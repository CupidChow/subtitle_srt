Xu Jingjing.

17
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,150
Where's your face?

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,471
What about yours?

19
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,391
Let me see your frontal face.

20
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:53,391
Am I stupid?

21
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,031
You'll take

22
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,191
my ugly photo.

23
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,831
That's nonsense.

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,751
Hurry up!

25
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,031
Let me verify your ID.

26
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,031
Quickly.

27
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,911
Okay?

28
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,391
Do the questions.

29
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,350
Stop searching.

30
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,550
I ripped off

31
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,751
the answer page.

32
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,630
What?

33
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:33,070
I don't understand.

34
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:34,911
Xu Jingjing,

35
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,431
do you want to improve your grades

36
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,871
to get near the scholar-lord?

37
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,350
Yes.

38
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,031
Is this how you improve?

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,151
Have you heard of

40
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,751
the reverse zoom?

41
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,790
If I can't

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,790
use my grades

43
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,830
to get near him,

44
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,471
I'll drag his grades down.

45
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,110
Xu Jingjing,

46
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,830
you are vicious!

47
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:00,790
Did you lose your humour cells first

48
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,151
when you try to slim down?

49
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,431
I was joking.

50
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,350
Just kidding!

51
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:05,350
Don't talk nonsense.

52
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,790
Do it quickly.

53
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,151
Emergency! Request reinforcement!

54
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:33,830
Hello, Xiaobai.

55
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,510
Aren't you in charge of

56
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:37,630
physics lab items?

57
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,070
Okay.

58
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:40,630
Okay. I'll find it.

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,391
Xu Jingjing.

60
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:25,511
Xu Jingjing!

61
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:27,870
Did you fall asleep?

62
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:28,911
Xu Jingjing!

63
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,110
Did you pass out?

64
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:31,750
Xu Jingjing!

65
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,511
Hello, 120!

66
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,391
Xu Jingjing died from overstudy.

67
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,670
Nice audio!

68
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,990
It's a new sound system!

69
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,711
The vibrations hurt my heart.

70
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:54,831
Open the door!

71
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:55,750
Stop singing!

72
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:56,591
Open the door!

73
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:57,350
What's going on?

74
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,151
Open the door!

75
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,471
Come on!

76
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,031
Open the door!

77
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:18,711
Xu Jingjing!

78
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:20,790
Yes.

79
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:23,071
Stand there!

80
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:26,350
Do you feel embarrassed?

81
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:28,190
Do you know how scary it was?

82
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:29,471
Are you a school kid

83
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:30,511
playing pranks?

84
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:32,350
Sorry.

85
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,230
I never used the doll

86
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:35,071
until yesterday.

87
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:35,711
I didn't know

88
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:37,151
that it would slump.

89
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,670
Am I talking about that?

90
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,631
I thought

91
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,831
you fainted.

92
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,670
Well,

93
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:42,391
Xu Jingjing,

94
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,430
tell me

95
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:44,190
honestly.

96
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,110
Tell me directly

97
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,151
if you want to quit.

98
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,750
I can

99
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:47,750
make use of my time.

100
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,790
I want to study.

101
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,190
I don't think so.

102
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,790
Your foundation and willpower are weak.

103
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,790
Forget it.

104
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,151
Give up if you can't do it.

105
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:55,310
I can!

106
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:57,190
You wear

107
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,230
the bracelet.

108
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,591
Do you have the will to do it?

109
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,350
About your notes.

110
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:03,790
What's wrong with them?

111
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,631
What are these formulas?

112
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,711
They're doodles.

113
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,990
These are empirical formulas.

114
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,670
Memorise them

115
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:10,670
to answer questions.

116
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,151
I won't give them to others.

117
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,711
They aren't in the book.

118
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,550
That doesn't mean

119
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:15,711
you can skip them.

120
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,430
Kang Jiawei,

121
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,071
I haven't learned what's in my book.

122
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,711
Don't force me to do that.

123
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:21,430
Didn't you

124
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,271
force me

125
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,670
to run 3,000 meters also?

126
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,031
Are you questioning

127
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,550
my well-tailored plan?

128
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,831
Is that a well-tailored plan?

129
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,550
Maybe it is

130
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:31,511
from the Internet.

131
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:33,911
Fine, Kang Jiawei.

132
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,110
Are you angry?

133
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,951
Yes.

134
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,151
I got it

135
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,310
online.

136
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,071
It fell

137
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:45,831
from the sky!

138
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,230
From now on,

139
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,831
we're strangers.

140
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,110
We don't talk to each other.

141
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,350
I was kidding.

142
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:51,391
Don't be serious.

143
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,471
How could you?

144
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,750
Do you know

145
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:55,591
that I researched

146
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,190
data throughout the night?

147
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,350
So did I.

148
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,831
I didn't fool you

149
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:01,271
with random math questions.

150
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,511
I carefully analysed

151
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:03,511
all the math papers

152
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,631
you did this semester

153
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:05,550
before I

154
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:06,990
formulated your lesson plan.

155
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:16,670
Kang Jiawei,

156
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:17,951
the problem

157
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,670
is

158
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:21,271
that we misunderstood each other.

159
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,031
You don't understand study slackers

160
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,031
and I don't understand

161
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,711
that you

162
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,110
would rather die than jog.

163
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,391
You don't understand

164
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,430
how painful it is

165
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,230
for a study slacker

166
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,631
to get back on her feet.

167
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,750
True.

168
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,350
Tell me about it.

169
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:39,750
Enlighten me.

170
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:45,151
In the first semester
of the tenth Grade,

171
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,550
(I wasn't)

172
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,911
(an out-and-out)

173
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,271
(study slacker.)

174
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:50,591
Hey,

175
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:51,670
Jingjing.

176
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,190
Help me pick up a pen.

177
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:56,790
Thank you.

178
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:58,110
(During the math class,)

(Let f(x) be...

(I bent down to pick up a pen.)

180
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,670
(After that, I was totally lost.)

181
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,471
(I became )

182
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:03,271
(a study slacker)

183
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:05,110
(in this subject.)

184
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:07,271
(A fresh fruit)

185
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,951

(if it is blemished.)

189
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,071
(is slightly impure,)

190

(you'll slacken all the way.)

191
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,631
(So,)

192
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,550
(I was inattentive in class)

193
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,990
(and copied homework.)

194
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,190
(It was a vicious cycle.)

195
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,911
(You can't become an expert)

196
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,750
(in a field)

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,831
(by working)

198
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,151
(doggedly for 10,000 hours.)

199
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,190
That was how,

200
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,631
as the hours

201
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:36,550
passed,

202
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:38,710
I became a professional study slacker.

203
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:46,590
Sorry.

204
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,710
I was too mean to you.

205
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,830
I'm sorry too.

206
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:54,231
I shouldn't force you

207
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,590
to jog without considering

208
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:56,871
your physical ability.

209
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,670
Later, I will prepare

210
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,351
a set of notes for you.

211
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:05,950
The formulas I prepared

212
00:09:05,991 --> 00:09:06,631
were beyond

213
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,991
the syllabus.

214
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,950
I thought it would help you

215
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,271
but now, I think

216
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,111
that they

217
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,310
overwhelmed you.

218
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,871
In future, I'll use
the simplest and easiest way

219
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:17,871
to help you

220
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:19,991
pick up knowledge points.

221
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,710
Are you doing this

222
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:22,790
out of pity?

223
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:25,511
I feel we're alike.

224
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,511
No one understands us

225
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,790
but that's fine now.

226
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,830
At least we understand each other.

227
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,430
Honestly, are you

228
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,231
giving me notes that I can understand?

229
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,710
Don't you like Pop Mart?

230
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:41,710
As of now,

231
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:42,991
for every math paper

232
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:43,871
you do correctly,

233
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,190
you'll get a Pop Mart toy.

234
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,751
Well?

235
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:46,830
Okay!

236
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:47,871
However,

237
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,190
if you make too many mistakes,

238
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:51,151
I will remove one

239
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,911
Pop Mart head.

240
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:52,631
Deal?

241
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,830
It's a challenge!

242
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:54,430
I'll

make a new plan.

If you finish your run in time,

245
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,631
I will also give you a Pop Mart toy.

246
00:09:58,871 --> 00:09:59,391

I want. I want.

351
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,751
I PM her.

352
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:08,871
Bombshell!

353
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:09,550
Peeping Tom!

354
00:16:09,631 --> 00:16:10,631
I want. I want.

355
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,470
I PM her.

356
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,151
You are all perverts!

357
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,271
Gao Zhan

358
00:16:16,511 --> 00:16:17,710
stood me up to defend her

359
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:18,830
against the perverts.

360
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:19,590
No.

361
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,670
I defended her.

362
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,511
Why should I care about her?

363
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,900
(Gotham Central)

364
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,190
What is it, Jingjing?

365
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,790
Jingjing,

366
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,351
is this you?

367
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,751
It must be that pervert.

368
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:49,031
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

369
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:49,950
It's okay.

370
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,470
Why don't we call the police first?

371
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:01,670
Rinse the vegetables in water

372
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:02,590
to remove the grease.

373
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,071
Have you gained weight recently?

374
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,831
You won't look good on stage.

375
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:10,391
For the time being,

376
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,230
let's eat simple.

377
00:17:13,591 --> 00:17:14,470
Is this

378
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,071
a bit too simple?

379
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,831
She is growing.

380
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:22,591
Next time add a meat dish.

381
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:23,911
A dancer

382
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,551
cannot gain weight

383
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:26,670
or

384
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,351
she won't look nice doing Arabesque.

385
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,190
This movement

386
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:30,470
is your weakness.

387
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:32,230
As you eat, revise

388
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,871
Lopatkina's movements.

389
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:43,670
Can we chat as a family

390
00:17:43,871 --> 00:17:44,791
during meals?

391
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,190
Should you

392
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:47,510
make a fuss?

393
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,631
Yes.

394
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:50,270
Why not?

395
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:52,831
Jingjing will be in her senior year.

396
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,071
Do you know

397
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,311
how tough her study is?

398
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,270
Every day, she has

399
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,631
to make time for ballet.

400
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,551
We have chosen this path,

401
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,990
she will be different

402
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,710
from other kids.

403
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,470
It's useless

404
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:06,391
for me to talk.

405
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:07,631
When you join the dance academy,

406
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:08,710
you will thank me.

407
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,071
By the way,

408
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:11,911
I cleaned

409
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:13,151
your room today

410
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,591
and saw a slim-fitting tank top

411
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,071
under your bed.

412
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,111
Where did it come from?

413
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,391
I...

414
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,230
I went

415
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:26,871
to the dance studio and took

416
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,551
Li Huiya's top by mistake.

417
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:29,911
Ya?

418
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,631
Does she usually wear this?

419
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,391
She...

420
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:37,391
I think she has been
practising hip-hop.

421
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:38,311
Hip-hop?

422
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:39,351
No! She has

423
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,911
a good ballet foundation.

424
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:44,831
It seems

425
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:46,950
that she loves hip-hop.

426
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:49,990
You must not

427
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,230
do hip hop.

428
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,551
What's wrong with it?

429
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,791
It isn't

430
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,111
something shady.

431
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:56,351
When I was young,

432
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,791
I did break dancing.

433
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,631
Yes.

434
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:00,030
Different dance forms

435
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,871
use different strength

436
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,750
and different breathing.

437
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,510
Have you seen ethnic song singers

438
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,710
singing rock-and-roll?

439
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:07,591
Listen, Jingjing.

440
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:08,871
Do not pick up

441
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,111
the bad habits of hip-hop.

442
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:12,111
It will affect your ballet.

443
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:13,551
Don't do hip-hop.

444
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,551
Don't even watch it.

445
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,510
Did you hear me?

446
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,111
Let's eat.

447
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,350
(Jingjing Milk Tea)

448
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:24,470
(Jingjing Milk Tea)
Why not call the police?

449
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,631
I don't want my mum to know.

450
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:28,591
This is a crime.

451
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:29,750
This is serious.

452
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,230
We can't let her know.

453
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:33,990
If we do that,

454
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,351
my mum would know

455
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,351
that I was photographed  doing hip-hop.

456
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,230
What will she say?

457
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,990
She'll say it's my fault.

458
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:45,551
Had I not done

459
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,710
such an absurd dance,

460
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:47,470
I won't be targeted

461
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:48,911
by shady characters.

462
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,631
No way.

463
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:51,911
What logic is this?

464
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:54,311
For Madam Liu,

465
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,791
this is her logic.

466
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,230
It's up to us.

467
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:02,591
What's the word?

468
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:05,750
Entrapment.

469
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,510
Entrap?

470
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,510
My dad does that.

471
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,230
How?

472
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,030
I'll ask him over.

473
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,190
Xu Jingjing is the fish.

474
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,230
Wooden fish.

475
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:13,071
I agree.

476
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,510
Do you think I'm a fish too?

477
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,230
No.

478
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,071
I'm not referring

479
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,551
to you but entrapment.

480
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,270
Ask the Nine-Dragon Master out.

481
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:22,710
Tell him we love his work,

482
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,470
and ask him out to take photos.

483
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,071
When we meet him,

484
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,591
we'll catch him red-handed.

485
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:29,430
Let's get a new account

486
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:30,391
for a female.

487
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:31,510
Xu Jingjing,

488
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:32,831
can we borrow

489
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:33,831
your Weibo account?

490
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:35,230
No way.

491
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:35,950
It's

492
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,470
not the account of a pretty woman.

493
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:38,791
Let's register

494
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,710
a new account.

495
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,230
Let's use the name

496
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:42,950
Cute Pretty Girl.

497
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,351
What's wrong?

498
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,391
Is it inappropriate?

499
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:53,510
How about we call it

500
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:56,071
Give Yourself Away?

501
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:59,871
How about Princess Momo?

502
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:01,230
That's a good name.

503
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,351
Next, we make it popular.

504
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,950
Post selfies and street shots

505
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:06,831
and seek photographers.

506
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:07,750
Nine-Dragon Master

507
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:08,470
will notice

508
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,270
Princess Momo.

509
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:09,791
Yes.

510
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,990
Whose photo do we use?

511
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:16,950
No way!

512
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,151
We'll make your legs

513
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,391
longer.

514
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,990
-Stretch a bit more.
-Yes.

515
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,750
A bit longer.

516
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,710
Shrink her butt.

517
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,831
More.

518
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,710
Make the skin

519
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:27,670
two shades whiter.

520
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,831
Make the waist smaller.

521
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:30,151
Darken the hair.

522
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:30,750
Yes.

523
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,351
Longer, straighter.

524
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:32,230
Enough.

525
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,631
You two should

526
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:34,631
just scold me.

527
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,151
You think my legs are short,

528
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,750
I'm not fair,

529
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:37,351
my waist is fat,

530
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,470
and my hair isn't black and straight.

531
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,631
Stop editing.

532
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,190
No.

533
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,151
We didn't mean that.

534
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:43,831
I spoke

535
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,551
from

536
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,871
the point of a pervert.

537
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,990
I see women from his point of view

538
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:49,631
and try to read a criminal mind.

539
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:50,551
Xu Jingjing.

540
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,871
According to our aesthetics standard,

541
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,831
your photo

542
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,071
doesn't need editing.

543
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:56,791
Editing is superfluous.

544
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,591
Am I right?

545
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,151
You look nice.

546
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,750
Why did you kick me?

547
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,190
Did Nine-Dragon Master PM you?

548
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,950
What did he say?

549
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,990
He asked me

550
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,311
for a date.

551
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,190
How did you respond?

552
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:21,750
I said

553
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,670
okay, Master,

554
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,151
look forward to it.

555
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:26,151
Oni-san.

556
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:28,710
Oni-san.

557
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,990
Oni-san.

558
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:31,430
You're okay, Gao Zhan.

559
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,351
I didn't see you

560
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:34,071
for a few days and you impressed me.

561
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,591
After we adopted the nickname,

562
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:37,591
I realised

563
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,750
my weakness as a straight man.

564
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,071
So, I did my research

565
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,710
on the way girls talk nowadays.

566
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,230
Anyway, we have a date

567
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:45,030
for a weekend photoshoot

568
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,230
but beware

569
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,750
that he can have an accomplice.

570
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,190
That's great.

571
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,071
We'll catch

572
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,351
all of them in one go.

573
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,470
Come.

574
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:56,470
I surveyed the terrain ahead of time

575
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:57,911
and drafted a simple

576
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:58,911
battle plan.

577
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,710
Xu Jingjing will wait

578
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:01,831
for them here.

579
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:02,871
The boys will lay

580
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,190
(The Nest. Cafe. Fast Food Restaurant)

581
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,551
(The Nest. Cafe. Fast Food Restaurant)
in ambush on the roadsides.

582
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,990
Let me tell you.

583
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:18,911
I came prepared today.

584
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:20,351
Came prepared?

585
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,591
Come.

586
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,551
Hit me.

587
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,631
Hit you?

588
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,950
Yes. Hit me hard.

589
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:27,111
Witness this.

590
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:27,791
He asked me.

591
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,710
You asked for it.

592
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,510
Hurry up, hurry up.

593
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,030
Master Kang,

594
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,190
why did you kick me there?

595
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:38,551
Where else?

596
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,391
I kicked here.

597
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,750
Are you blinding

598
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,831
my 24K Titanium Alloy Dog ​​Eyes?

599
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,111
Gao, I have a problem.

600
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,230
Will the pervert notice

601
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,670
Xu Jingjing looks different

602
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:14,831
from her photo and run?

603
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,351
Can you shut up?

604
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,831
I think she looks good.

605
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:21,911
Alright. Come.

606
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,311
Go through the tactics again.

607
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:24,670
Xu Jingjing alone

608
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:25,871
will wait in the square.

609
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:27,190
We spread out in pairs.

610
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,750
Do not attract attention.

611
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,071
While Xu Jingjing

612
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:31,351
talks to him,

613
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:32,510
listen to my orders.

614
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,670
We'll outflank him

615
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,510
and make a pincer attack.

616
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,311
I'm going too.

617
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,270
No.

618
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,351
If they see you,

619
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,510
they'll know.

620
00:24:40,631 --> 00:24:41,111
He's right.

621
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,911
You wait by the side.

622
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,750
In case anything happens to us,

623
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,351
call the police.

624
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:50,871
Stay safe.

625
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:52,111
Don't worry.

626
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:53,591
I will protect them.

627
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:54,591
Okay.

628
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,111
Let's synchronise our watches.

629
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:03,071
Forget it. Let's move.

630
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,950
Protect yourself.

631
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,791
Nine-Dragon Master?

632
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:40,990
Yes.

633
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,351
You are...

634
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,631
I am Princess Momo.

635
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,151
Your figure in the photo

636
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:52,430
is quite different.

637
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,591
Brother,

638
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,990
look at her face.

639
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,831
Her face is fine.

640
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,430
I've never had a photo session.

641
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,871
I'm a little nervous.

642
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:04,831
Nervous?

643
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:05,791
I like it.

644
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,111
Let's have fun first.

645
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,190
Relax, relax.

646
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:09,911
You get nice photos if you relax.

647
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,831
Yes.

648
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,030
Come. Let's sing.

649
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,510
No. No.

650
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,190
Let's go, girl.

651
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:17,990
Remove your fat leg! I...

652
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,230
Don't move.

653
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,151
Go.

654
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,391
Fatty,

655
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,750
what did you say?

656
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:24,510
Remove

657
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,351
your fat leg.

658
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,230
Shut up.

659
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,270
Hand over the photos

660
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,030
you took secretly.

661
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,551
There are so many of you.

662
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,710
Looks like you come prepared.

663
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,831
Brothers,

664
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:35,831
run!

665
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,631
-Don't run.
-Go after him!

666
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,311
Stay safe.

667
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,430
Split up!

668
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,391
Don't run!

669
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,911
Did I let you run?

670
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,710
Run?

671
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,510
Are you okay?

672
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:31,230
Stop chasing me. I'm not the mastermind.

673
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,750
He ran that way.

674
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,111
Taste my Praying Mantis Fist.

675
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,391
Dapeng spreads its wings.

676
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,111
Are you alright?

677
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,030
Thank you, math book,

678
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,351
Zhang Chang'an,

679
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,391
and Yuming Senior High School

680
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:04,750
for saving my life.

681
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,470
Are you all right?

682
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:11,351
Where are the two of them?

683
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:17,190
Kang Jiawei, are you okay?

684
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,230
Watch it!

685
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:31,510
Let's go. Quickly.

686
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,551
Jingjing.

687
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:33,510
Amazing.

688
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,670
Awesome!

689
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,791
Are you guys okay?

690
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:37,710
Yes.

691
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,030
Stay still. Don't move.

692
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:41,551
Stay still.

693
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,911
Take them away.

694
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,230
I called the police.

695
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:49,791
(Public Security Bureau)
This way.

696
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,510
(Public Security Bureau)

697
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,911
Although you guys were quick-witted

698
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,670
and brave

699
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:55,311
and got a happy ending,

700
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:56,111
I

701
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,230
must criticise you.

702
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:59,030
It's dangerous to act

703
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,990
on your own.

704
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,311
Yes. You are right.

705
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,391
We understand clearly.

706
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:04,311
Next time,

707
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:05,631
call the police.

708
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,030
Trust the adults

709
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,831
and trust the police.

710
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:08,670
Our job

711
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:09,791
is to protect you.

712
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:11,071
Sorry.

713
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:11,990
We understand.

714
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,990
Okay, let's go.

715
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,831
Gao Zhan.

716
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,990
Mr. Jin.

717
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:18,710
It's been a while.

718
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,831
You've grown taller.

719
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:22,871
How is your mother?

720
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,990
Fine.

721
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,190
Are you here

722
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,151
because of an offence?

723
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:27,871
No.

724
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,030
They fought for justice

725
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,391
and caught the bad guys.

726
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,551
Well done.

727
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,710
As expected of Gao Qiang's son.

728
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,151
Jingjing.

729
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,990
Try the dry ingredient.

730
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,990
Barbecue meat needs dry ingredients

731
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:47,351
and they're fun to eat.

732
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:49,950
Jingjing,

733
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:51,791
I'm sorry

734
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,551
about what happened.

735
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:56,111
I know you're still mad at me.

736
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,510
Forget it. Forget it.

737
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,391
I know

738
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,911
but I must tell you.

739
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:03,351
I know I was wrong.

740
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:05,230
I don't know how

741
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,510
to make you forgive me.

742
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,111
I have forgiven you.

743
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:11,151
You took

744
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,470
nice photos of me.

745
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,270
Moreover,

746
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:15,230
let bygones be bygones.

747
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:21,230
Actually, you look good

748
00:30:21,391 --> 00:30:22,750
in a sailor's suit.

749
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:25,551
Seriously?

750
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,831
I wanted

751
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,950
to buy one too

752
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:29,351
but was a little hesitant.

753
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:30,750
You can keep it.

754
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,391
No.

755
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:32,670
I know it's expensive.

756
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:33,430
It's okay.

757
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,510
my mum

758
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:35,791
will find it at home one day.

759
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:37,631
I'll get an earful again.

760
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,670
Please accept it.

761
00:30:40,551 --> 00:30:43,190
Alright. I will

762
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:45,270
I will. Really.

763
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,710
Thank you. Let's go back.

764
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:52,311
You don't know

765
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,551
how thrilling it was.

766
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,791
I vaguely saw the glint of a knife.

767
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,990
In a flash,

768
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,670
my stomach was stabbed.

769
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,190
I thought

770
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:02,791
I would die.

771
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:03,831
My life

772
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,670
was coming to an end

773
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,351
but I won't give up.

774
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,551
I haven't confessed to Jingjing yet.

775
00:31:11,591 --> 00:31:12,710
Don't talk rubbish.

776
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,551
Continue.

777
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:14,871
I noticed

778
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,230
that he looked puzzled.

779
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,111
Guess who

780
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,311
saved me?

781
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,190
Who?

782
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:21,151
Zhang Chang'an.

783
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:22,470
Was he there?

784
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,710
His math book saved me.

785
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:29,230
From then on, I thought

786
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,670
I must make up my mind

787
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,791
to study maths.

788
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,911
Do you believe this?

789
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:35,631
Yes.

790
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,551
Gao,

791
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:37,591
I heard that you

792
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:39,230
subdued that pervert alone.

793
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,230
Not bad.

794
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,470
Sorry. Because of me,

795
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:46,631
you hurt the only part

796
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:47,430
that matters.

797
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,391
Go away.

798
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,270
What

799
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,311
do you mean by that?

800
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,270
I want to say something.

801
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,190
The incident

802
00:31:59,391 --> 00:32:00,430
happened because of me.

803
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,311
Sorry.

804
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:04,551
I caused you trouble.

805
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,391
It's okay.

806
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,831
It's not your fault.

807
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:07,631
Yes.

808
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,270
Didn't you say no police?

809
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,190
I was selfish.

810
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:12,151
I only thought

811
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,430
about my mum

812
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,391
but I didn't

813
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,391
consider

814
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:16,990
how dangerous

815
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:18,190
it was for everyone.

816
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,710
Never mind. It's over.

817
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,710
I can brag about it forever.

818
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,151
Yes.

819
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,510
It's over. Forget it.

820
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,030
Cheers to our special operation

821
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,831
team!

822
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,591
Cheers!

823
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:27,430
Cheers!

824
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,071
Cheers!

825
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,551
Gao Zhan,

826
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,871
how did

827
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,111
you know the policeman?

828
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,631
He was my dad's colleague.

829
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:44,230
Is your dad a policeman?

830
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,151
When I was in junior high,

831
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:48,470
he died while on duty.

832
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,391
I never

833
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:55,791
heard you mention that.

834
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,710
What's there to say?

835
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,670
Why are you crying?

836
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,631
Brother.

837
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:10,470
Dapeng has a single parent.

838
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:11,470
His mum died

839
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:12,270
when he was small.

840
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,391
Brother, cheers!

841
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:25,670
Gao, are you interested in

842
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,391
crime investigation

843
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,911
because you want to be a policeman?

844
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,871
I'm not sure yet

845
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:32,670
but I prefer to read

846
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:33,911
my dad's books.

847
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,591
They're there anyway.

848
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,470
You two,

849
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,791
we'll get our results next week.

850
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,631
You'll score less than me.

851
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:55,950
You go girl.

852
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:56,710
Here she comes.

853
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:59,591
King Wastewood of Stormborn.

854
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:01,311
-So many people.
-Shut up.

855
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,030
The deities are busy.

856
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:11,990
Aren't you ashamed

857
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:12,871
to trouble them

858
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,070
over a 11th Grade final exam?

859
00:34:14,391 --> 00:34:15,030
No.

860
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:24,311
Careless.

861
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,510
How can I answer this question wrong?

862
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:28,950
Okay, Kang Jiawei.

863
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:30,351
You're a show-off.

864
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,150
How did I show off?

865
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:33,110
Well,

866
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,990
where do I put this paper?

867
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:35,630
On the floor?

868
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:36,470
Yes.

869
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,030
Let me look.

870
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,191
No.

871
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:53,030
Will there be 10 digits?

872
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,191
That requires some skills.

873
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,711
It's 90.

874
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,070
I got 90

875
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:01,831
for high school math for the first time.

876
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:06,110
Look at your English and Chinese.

877
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,950
Queen, Queen,

878
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:13,590
what is your total score?

879
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,671
Did you get 200?

880
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,751
I'll tell you first. I have.

881
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,550
Me too.

882
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:18,430
Really?

883
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:19,751
What is your total score?

884
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:20,831
Did you

885
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:22,430
get less than 200?

886
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,110
No.

887
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:23,871
Show me.

888
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:25,430
She doesn't have 200.

889
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:28,070
Here she comes.

890
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,191
Here she comes.

891
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:32,751
King Wastewood of Stormborn.

892
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:34,671
Eternally in the last place.

893
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,950
Khaleesi Doofus Xu Jingjing.

894
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:42,550
Where are you going?

895
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,110
I was just kidding.

896
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,831
Don't stoop down to their level.

897
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:58,711
They both failed math.

898
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:00,030
They scored 30 points less than you.

899
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,391
Although you passed,

900
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:06,311
I checked your paper

901
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:06,990
carefully

902
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,110
and found many

903
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,231
careless mistakes.

904
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,671
You can score higher.

905
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,550
Master Kang,

906
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,791
do you only teach math?

907
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:15,550
I know your scores weren't ideal

908
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,470
for the Chinese and English languages.

909
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:18,950
It's your fault.

910
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:20,671
You made me learn math every day.

911
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,030
It's just tenth Grade math.

912
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,231
My Chinese and English grades

913
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,271
dropped.

914
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,311
I know

915
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,030
but...

916
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:26,791
Your plan

917
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,630
must be flawed.

918
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,271
But you passed your math.

919
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,191
Your score went from 48

920
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:34,871
to 90

921
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,911
in a month.

922
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,311
It's a miracle.

923
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:38,430
What's the use

924
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:39,271
of passing math?

925
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,470
It's useless.

926
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:41,470
I was second last

927
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:42,630
in class.

928
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:43,990
Dude,

929
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,311
after you helped me,

930
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,911
I am last.

931
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,150
Thanks to you.

932
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:51,311
Xu Jingjing,

933
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,671
can we

934
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,590
go slowly, one subject at a time?

935
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,470
We've tackled the math.

936
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:57,191
Next,

937
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,630
we'll tackle English.

938
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:00,590
We'll improve one by one.

939
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:01,231
One day,

940
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,351
you will pass all subjects.

941
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,671
How long will that take?

942
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:05,430
By then,

943
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:06,470
I'll be in my senior year.

944
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,030
Gao Zhan has gone to another class.

945
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:11,470
Why do you have double standards?

946
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,711
I must lose weight

947
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,430
not quickly

948
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:14,351
but slowly.

949
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,430
Step by step.

950
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:15,990
When you study,

951
00:37:16,231 --> 00:37:17,311
you want results immediately.

952
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,070
That's different.

953
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:19,711
How so?

954
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,671
It's your fault.

955
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,470
Look at my plan for you.

956
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:25,791
It's balanced, nutritious,

957
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,070
and combines diet and exercise.

958
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:27,671
It is

959
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:28,950
comprehensive.

960
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:29,791
You brought this up.

961
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,831
I was embarrassed to say it.

962
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,470
Thanks to your lousy plan,

963
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,311
every day I eat

964
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,110
and sleep poorly.

965
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,391
I am tired every day.

966
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,070
As a result, I lost weight.

967
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,191
2.5 kilograms.

968
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,110
What about the 20 kilograms we agreed?

969
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,990
Did you snack

970
00:37:44,231 --> 00:37:44,950
secretly at home?

971
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:47,311
You didn't jog five km.

972
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,630
You are lazy and blame me.

973
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,630
Fine.

974
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,070
We don't trust each other.

975
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:52,711
Let's go our own way.

976
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,510
I slim down

977
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:54,391
and you study on your own.

978
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,311
We'll mind our own business.

979
00:37:57,831 --> 00:37:58,470
I'll learn.

980
00:37:58,911 --> 00:37:59,911
I'll go all out
during the winter holiday.

981
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,791
I'll be the class number...

982
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,590
Number what?

983
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,950
Third last.

984
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,671
I'll show you.

985
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,671
Excellent.

986
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:11,950
Want to bet?

987
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,110
Yes. What's the bet?

988
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,950
The monthly exam
after the holiday.

989
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,311
Forget it.

990
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:18,791
We'll bet on the homework.

991
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:19,990
Can you do it on your own?

992
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:21,711
Don't look down on me.

993
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:23,150
Fine.

994
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,430
I bet

995
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:25,791
you won't lose weight.

996
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,671
Fine.

997
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,671
If I find out

998
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:28,391
that you copy

999
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,590
your homework,

1000
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,231
next semester,

1001
00:38:33,191 --> 00:38:34,430
you will be my

1002
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,831
domesticated elf.

1003
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,191
You order me around?

1004
00:38:39,391 --> 00:38:39,871
Yes.

1005
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:40,911
If I lose,

1006
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,150
you order me around too.

1007
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:42,911
Fine.

1008
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:44,430
If you hadn't become a lightning bolt,

1009
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:45,351
you will kneel

1010
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,391
and call me master.

1011
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,831
Admit defeat for the bet.

1012
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:51,311
Loser!

1013
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,990
Jingjing.

1014
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:02,791
Jingjing.

1015
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,550
Here's your breakfast.

1016
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:07,110
What is this?

1017
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,911
Can't you read?

1018
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:13,590
Are you asking for a beating?

1019
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,910
(Winter Holiday Study Schedule)

1020
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:17,791
(Winter Holiday Study Schedule)
Winter Holiday Study Schedule.

1021
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:19,791
Wake up at seven.

1022
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,391
How embarrassing.

1023
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:22,430
Mum.

1024
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,391
Are you my mother?

1025
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,751
Why don't you believe me?

1026
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:26,871
I am no longer

1027
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,671
the former Xu Jingjing.

1028
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,911
Did you have a makeover?

1029
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,430
Half an hour for a meal.

1030
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,630
Learn Chinese from 7:30 to 10:00 a.m.

1031
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:41,550
Learn English from 10 to 12.

1032
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,351
Half an hour lunch break.

1033
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,590
Half an hour break.

1034
00:39:45,231 --> 00:39:47,470
Practice listening while watching
American dramas.

1035
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,231
From 1 to 5 p.m.,

1036
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,510
learn math.

1037
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,351
Xu, Xu!

1038
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,070
Something happened!

1039
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:55,831
What's wrong?

1040
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,791
Something happened.

1041
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,430
What's wrong?

1042
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:59,871
We'll have a top scorer
in the college entrance exam.

1043
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:00,831
Mum.

1044
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,510
If you look down on me,

1045
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,150
I will give dad my future income.

1046
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,311
Jingjing,

1047
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,430
my love has not been wasted.

1048
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:08,550
Look at her.

1049
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,630
Good.

1050
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,470
Xu,

1051
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,470
let's bet on how long she'll last.

1052
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,791
What is the bet?

1053
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,671

1057

Deal.

1058

Done.

1059

I will definitely support you.

1066

1072
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,950
My happiness

1073
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,070
is in your hands.

1074
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,231
You can do it!

1075
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,911
I still don't believe it.

1076

1077

1079
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:39,630
This is so boring.

1080
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,791
Boring.

1081
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,671
The more I have fun,

1082
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:47,470
the emptier I feel.

1083
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:48,231
It's because

1084
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,311
we have something on our minds.

1085
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:51,191
Do you mean homework?

1086
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,590
Have you done it?

1087
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,831
Don't touch

1088
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,950
a sensitive issue.

Jingjing.

1090
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,110
What about your bet

1091
00:41:59,271 --> 00:41:59,911
with Kang Jiawei?

1092
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,150
It's okay.

1093
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,150
Let me tell you.

1094
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,150
His sports bracelet

1095
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:04,751
is linked to my phone.

1096
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,470
The past two days,

1097
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,231
I watched his location.

1098
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:10,311
He was completely motionless at home.

1099
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:12,110
Maybe he wasn't wearing it.

1100
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,191
Given his character,

1101
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,831
he would wear it if he exercised.

1102
00:42:15,311 --> 00:42:15,831
Also,

1103
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,191
he would post in his friend group
to show off.

1104
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,150
He might have removed it

1105
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:19,990
to win the bet

1106
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:20,751
by

1107
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,150

1108
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,391
No way. That's mean.

1109
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,231
He isn't that smart.

1110
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,110
Other than the bracelet,

1111
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,751
do you have other news about him?

1112
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,351
Let me check.

1113
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:35,711
He didn't post in his friend group,

It's a disappearing act.

1118

He still can't control his mouth.

Look at what I'm talking about.

No.
