(You Look Cute When You Snore)

16
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:43,921
What's the matter?

17
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:51,921
They only sell coffee here.

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,760
(Classics Coffee Style Coffee)

19
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,002
Gao Zhan doesn't drink coffee.

20
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:58,761
Do you know that?

21
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,802
He only drinks milk tea and fruit tea.

22
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:05,561
But this coffee shop

23
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:06,401
only offers coffee.

24
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,281
I guess it wasn't a coincidence

25
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:22,802
that Gao Zhan was here

26
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:24,001
when we decided to meet up
that day, right?

27
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,082
He came here because you asked him to.

28
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:32,482
You knew about it.

29
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,202
Why did you want Gao Zhan

30
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:41,522
to meet me at this coffee shop?

31
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:42,561
I don't get it.

32
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,281
Sorry,

33
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:52,121
Kang Jiawei.

34
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,082
I asked you out

35
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,482
with a purpose.

36
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:07,281
How did it go?

37
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:08,161
You asked Gao Zhan

38
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,561
if he was going to apply
for the same university, right?

39
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:10,962
What did he say?

40
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:12,161
He said

41
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:14,922
that I have to apply
for the dance academy.

42
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:15,802
It's impossible for us

43
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:17,721
to attend the same college.

44
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:19,802
Is that what he said?

45
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:23,082
I'm used to it now.

46
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:24,561
He's Gao Zhan after all.

47
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,322
Are you going to just let it be?

48
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,042
What else could I have done?

49
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:32,482
How could Gao Zhan

50
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,322
be so dull?

51
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,281
What's the matter with you?

52
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,681
Why do you look more upset than me?

53
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:39,841
How can I not be upset?

54
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:41,242
You made it so obvious.

55
00:03:41,362 --> 00:03:42,681
Why couldn't he get it?

56
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,242
I think

57
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:48,841
he's probably not interested

58
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,001
in these.

59
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,281
Perhaps

60
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,762
he's just not interested in me.

61
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:56,202
That's not true.

62
00:03:57,962 --> 00:03:59,042
I think

63
00:03:59,082 --> 00:03:59,881
he just hasn't realized it yet.

64
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:01,762
He hasn't realized it yet?

65
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,601
In fact,

66
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,082
we can give him a push.

67
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:12,161
That was

68
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:14,762
what happened.

69
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,481
Never would I have thought

70
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:20,002
that you were Mayonnaise.

71
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,361
You asked me out

72
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,522
only because you wanted
to make Gao Zhan jealous?

73
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,281
Sorry.

74
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,041
I was too eager

75
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:33,642
to find out what he thought

76
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,002
about me.

77
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,082
That's why...

78
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,041
I became a pawn.

79
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,721
I had no idea it was you.

80
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,082
If I knew it earlier...

81
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:46,962
No.

82
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,002
Whoever it was,

83
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,522
I shouldn't have done that.

84
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:55,401
I made a mistake.

85
00:04:58,721 --> 00:04:59,601
Sorry.

It's fine.

00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:37,401

00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:55,841
You did quite well today.

111
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:56,921
You got all the answers correct.

119

and made some amendments.

120
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,041
Thank you so much.

121
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,041
I shouldn't have bothered you with it.

Are you listening to me?

143
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:05,721
Can I say it now?

144
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,881
Wait... Give me a minute.

145
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,922
Allow me some time to prepare myself.

146
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:14,322
Go ahead.

147
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:19,322
When we were
learning agricultural production,

148
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,282
your eggs were probably

149
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,162
eaten by the dog

150
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,601
that I'm in charge
of.

151
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,682
It was my mistake
that I failed to keep an eye on it.

152
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:32,601
It sneaked

153
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:34,162
into the chicken den.

154
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:36,001
When I was back,

155
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,042
I noticed some eggshells

156
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,282
on the floor.

157
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:39,721
In fact,

158
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,442
I should've told you about this earlier.

159
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:42,641
But

160
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:44,202
I was worried that
you wouldn't be able to accept it.

161
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:46,562
So...

162
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:47,721
Is that why

163
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:48,922
you visit me every day?

164
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:49,881
It was my fault

165
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:50,962
that you got infected with pneumonia.

166
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:55,922
Xu Jingjing, we need
to take your blood now.

167
00:09:58,922 --> 00:09:59,761
Be careful.

168
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:37,162

00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,001

170
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:39,962
(and sleep-talking.)

171
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:41,282

(I suddenly find)

174
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:48,042
(my female classmate really cute.)

175
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:48,881
(Is that normal?)

176
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,860
(The best answer.
It's a sign of love. Good luck!)

177
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,761
Perhaps that's a sign of you
being in love.

178
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:57,162
Love?

179
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:00,881
We're finally home.

180
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:01,841
Hammer.

181
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:02,922
Come here.

182
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:03,601
Put it down.

183
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,922
Xiaobai.

184
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:07,841
Do you and Jiayao

185
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:08,721
want to come over for dinner tonight?

186
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:10,402
Let's celebrate my discharge.

187
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,162
Don't worry. My mom isn't going to cook.

188
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:14,922
What's that supposed to mean?

189
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:16,322
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:17,682
She's calling you a bad cook.

191
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:18,521
What?

192
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:19,841
They weren't my words.

193
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:23,121
Sure. I'll see you later.

194
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,241
Surprise!

195
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,481
Do you like this?

196
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,001
I made this together with your dad.

197
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:48,641
What do you think?

198
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,802
I noticed that your wallpaper
has turned moldy.

199
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:51,802
So while you were staying
in the hospital,

200
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,241
we painted the wall Barbie pink.

201
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,282
Isn't it cute?

202
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,761
There was a hole in your curtain too.

203
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:58,202
So I got you a new one.

204
00:11:58,442 --> 00:11:59,682
What do they call this?

205
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:00,761
I've repeated this many times.

206
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,082
The Lolita fashion.

207
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:02,841
Yes. That's it.

208
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,001
I just couldn't remember the word.

209
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:04,881
It breaks my tongue.

210
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:05,761
Princess Lolita.

211
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,881
Do you like it?

212
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:09,562
I love it.

213
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,601
I told you

214
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,481
that our daughter would like it.

215
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:12,922
She's moved to tears.

216
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:13,481
Your mom worried

217
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:14,721
that you might not like it.

218
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,521
All thanks to my good fashion sense.

219
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:17,442
Yes. You have a great fashion sense.

220
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:18,521
That's why you picked me
as your husband.

221
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:19,802
I like how handsome you are.

222
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:20,682
Of course.

223
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:21,841
Dad. Mom.

224
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,001
I need some space.

225
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:26,562
Jingjing wants to be left alone,

226
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:27,721
so she can appreciate

227
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:28,922
our artwork in peace.

228
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,121
We'll prepare dinner.

229
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:32,202
We'll let you know
when the dinner is ready.

230
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:33,481
Princess Lolita.

231
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:34,601
Bye.

232
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:50,562
The curtain...

233
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,202
The curtain is amazing.

234
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,402
This one too.

235
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,121
The extremely pink wallpaper.

236
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,721
It's not easy

237
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,562
to find a wallpaper this pink, Jingjing.

238
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,162
Sitting in this room,

239
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:03,442
I finally realize

240
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,121
what anxiety feels like.

241
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,121
Apprehensiveness.

242
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,521
And worry.

243
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:14,922
When I get my pay
from the Pipi series again,

244
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:15,881
I must redecorate

245
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,641
this room.

246
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:18,641
Don't, Jingjing.

247
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:20,521
It's not as bad as you think.

248
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:22,841
Don't you feel

249
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,361
like a princess?

250
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:25,241
Do you?

251
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:26,001
I do.

252
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:26,721
Then, why don't you live here?

253
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:27,361
No way.

254
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:27,962
Look at you.

255
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:28,962
Both of you

256
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:30,641
have no sympathy at all.

257
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:31,881
We'll stop laughing.

258
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:32,841
We'll stop.

259
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:33,881
By the way,

260
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,042
don't you have something

261
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:36,322
to tell us?

262
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:38,282
Oh, yes.

263
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,442
It was Gao Zhan's dog

264
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,761
who ate my eggs.

265
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:52,481
That's the best joke

266
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,082
of the year.

267
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:54,761
I can keep laughing at this joke

268
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:55,881
for the rest of the year.

269
00:13:56,162 --> 00:13:57,241
It's a great joke.

270
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:58,322
You should participate in "Roast!".

271
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:00,402
It's true.

272
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,162
I'll be mad if you keep laughing.

273
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:04,601
Really?

274
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,481
Was it eaten

275
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:09,402
by the dog that looked like Dapeng?

276
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:12,481
That's why he offered

277
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,601
to help me with my revision.

278
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,241
I told you so.

279
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:16,202
I shouldn't have

280
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,521
expected anything from Gao Zhan.

281
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,322
Nonetheless,

282
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:20,562
your relationship with Gaozhan

283
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:21,601
has improved.

284
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:22,761
That's not true.

285
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:23,962
He's too blunt.

286
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:25,402
You're right.

287
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:26,922
If only Gao Zhan is half as smart

288
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:27,922
as Master Kang,

289
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,481
we won't end up like this.

290
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:31,082
Stop bringing up Kang Jiawei.

291
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,402
I'm annoyed at the thought of him.

292
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:33,601
I didn't get sick very often,

293
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:34,282
and when I was really sick,

294
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:35,282
he never paid me any visit.

295
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:36,082
Wasn't that too much?

296
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:37,121
It was too much.

297
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:38,721
How could he?

298
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:40,361
Even if

299
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,322
he was helping Xu Jingjing

300
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,802
with the preparation
of the Culture and Art Festival,

301
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:45,521
couldn't he just take

302
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:46,481
some time off?

303
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:48,562
How dare he put hoes before bros?

304
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,761
I'll give him a good scolding
when I go back to school.

305
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:55,601
What are you laughing at?

306
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,682
I've been reading a web novel recently.

307
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:58,521
There was a scene

308
00:14:58,682 --> 00:15:00,202
that felt exactly like
what you're going through right now.

309
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:01,841
The author

310
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,082
called this

311
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:04,442
jealousy.

312
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,962
What stupid novel is that?

313
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:06,962
That's ridiculous.

314
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:08,481
It's not stupid.

315
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:09,682
It's an amazing novel.

316
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,042
I'll share it with you later.

317
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:12,641
It's called "My Breakthrough Youth".

318
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:14,282
Does it have a high school theme?

319
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,322
It's as if the author was writing
about our classmates.

320
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:17,721
Sometimes, I think

321
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,042
it's more than just a coincidence.

322
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:20,361
Jingjing.

323
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:21,802
You should try reading the novel

324
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:22,802
I think the main characters

325
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,241
are just like you and Kang Jiawei.

326
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:25,721
No way I'm reading it.

327
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,620
(Yuming Senior High School)

328
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:36,121
You're back, Jingjing.

329
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:37,082
Morning.

330
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:38,202
What a bargain.

331
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,322
You managed

332
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,202
to escape from a math test.

333
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,042
Do I look like I'm scared of a test?

334
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,121
I can do it effortlessly.

335
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,682
Stop boasting.

336
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:46,402
Stop...

337
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:50,601
Morning.

338
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:52,121
Morning.

339
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:53,761
Jingjing.

340
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:55,402
Master Kang is here.

341
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:57,562
Kang Jia...

342
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,202
What's the matter?

343
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,121
Didn't you say that you wanted
to teach him a lesson?

344
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,521
Why did you chicken out?

345
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:10,962
I think I should leave them alone.

346
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:19,721
Are you... Are you looking for me?

347
00:16:21,121 --> 00:16:22,001
Are you

348
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:24,881
still mad at me?

349
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:28,562
I...

350
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:31,001
I was never upset.

351
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,601
I spent the entire weekend

352
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:36,841
trying to figure out
how to apologize to you.

353
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:38,562
What can I do to
ask for your forgiveness?

354
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:39,641
It's fine.

355
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:41,322
I...

356
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,562
I've forgotten about it
if you didn't bring it up.

357
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:44,322
Really?

358
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:46,881
I...

359
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:48,481
I don't hold grudges.

360
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:51,241
Are we still friends?

361
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:55,601
The lesson is going to start soon.

362
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:56,641
Let's get back now.

363
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:57,442
Sure.

364
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,442
Xu Jingjing.

365
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:07,962
It seems like you've gained some weight
from your recuperation.

366
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:09,561
Tell me how much weight you have gained.

367
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:10,842
Go away.

368
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:14,842
That...

369
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:15,602
Why were your Goddess

370
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,761
looking for you just now?

371
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:23,041
You're not going to tell me, huh?

372
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,081
Fine.

373
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:26,761
You're now sharing secrets

374
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:27,962
with Xu Jingjing.

375
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,202
In fact...

376
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:30,761
Fine. I don't want to listen to it too.

377
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:33,882
Fine.

378
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:34,962
Anyway,

379
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:35,842
you're more than friends now.

380
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,202
Congratulations.

381
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,162
By the way,

382
00:17:41,362 --> 00:17:42,442
I heard

383
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:43,521
that you're working with her

384
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,602
on their cheerleading choreography.

385
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:48,122
Gao Zhan and I are working

386
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:49,521
on the Taekwondo performance too.

387
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:57,081
Let's talk after the preliminary.

388
00:17:57,682 --> 00:17:58,321
What are you trying to say?

389
00:17:59,122 --> 00:17:59,842
Are you saying
that the Taekwondo performance

390
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:00,962
won't pass the preliminary?

391
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:02,122
That's not what I meant.

392
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:05,561
It was just a gentle reminder.

393
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:27,281
Can I ask you a question?

394
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:30,281
Are there any living people
in your family now?

395
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:31,041
There are.

396
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,162
What's that about?

397
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,202
Which family
doesn't have living members?

398
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:35,962
We're all alive.

399
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,521
That's such a pity.

400
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:39,321
Pity? What's that supposed to mean?

401
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,721
(Judge)
Fine. Let me ask you another question.

402
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:42,842
How many ropes of people
do you have at home?

403
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:43,162
Ropes?

404
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,442
Are we onions?

405
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:45,761
How many herds are there?

406
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,041
Are we buffalos?

407
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:48,481
How many cups...

408
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:49,721
How many pools...

409
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,281
Wait a minute.

410
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:52,721
It's getting more and more ridiculous.

411
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,642
They're really creative.

412
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,281
What do we do now?

413
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:06,281
I'm feeling a little nervous.

414
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,642
I'm not very familiar
with the moves yet.

415
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:09,001
Don't think.

416
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:10,202
Just do your best.

417
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:16,321
Is he really going to vomit here?

418
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:17,001
I've no idea.

419
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:18,442
Next up, Taekwondo Club

420
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:19,922
and Cheerleading Team.
Please get ready.

421
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:22,481
Break a leg.

422
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,362
Why are you looking like a pervert?

423
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,682
Keep it down.

424
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:43,682
I'm here

425
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:44,761
for the Taekwondo performance.

426
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:45,962
Since when did you start

427
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:47,442
to worry about Xu Jingjing?

428
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:48,162
Who?

429
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,761
I'm not worried about Xu Jingjing.

430
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,162
Yaoyao

431
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:51,521
is a member of the Taekwondo Club too.

432
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:52,882
Can you stop
calling Wang Jiayao by that name?

433
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:53,842
It's disgusting.

434
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:55,001
I do what I want.

435
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,321
Stop standing in my way.

436
00:19:58,602 --> 00:19:59,122
Attention!

437
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:00,801
Bow.

438
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:06,882
Xu Jingjing.

439
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:07,882
You did a great job.

440
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:09,202
Good luck to you too.

441
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:25,442
They are very much in sync.

442
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,321
What... What's going on?

443
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:35,521
Oh, no.

444
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:36,842
I forgot to charge it yesterday.

445
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:37,962
What's going on?

446
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:39,321
Sorry.

447
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:41,442
We forgot to charge our speakers.

448
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:44,922
Let's do it without the music.

449
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:48,922
One. Two. Three. Four.

450
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,801
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

451
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:52,402
One. Two. Three. Four.

452
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,561
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

453
00:20:57,602 --> 00:20:59,041
Excuse me.

454
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,960
(List of qualifiers)

455
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,362
We made it.

456
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:06,842
We made it!

457
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:08,041
We are eliminated?

458
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,561
But why?

459
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:10,281
There's something sketchy about this.

460
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:11,521
I'm sure there's something
sketchy about this.

461
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,682
The Cheerleading Team

462
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:13,801
paused their performance on stage.

463
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:14,402
How could they end up

464
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:15,362
with a score higher than ours?

465
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,761
We paused our performance
and still managed to surpass you.

466
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:20,281
It simply means
that your performance was terrible.

467
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:20,882
Wei Xue.

468
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:22,001
What did you say?

469
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,122
It's fine. Ignore her.

470
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:24,202
It's just the Culture and Art Festival.

471
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:26,842
You're just jealous.

472
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:27,962
I dare you to repeat it.

473
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:28,801
Should I repeat it then?

474
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:29,281
Come here.

475
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:29,801
Sure.

476
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:30,882
You...

477
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:31,761
Should I repeat it?

478
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:33,962
All the Taekwondo Club knows
is how to fight violently.

479
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:34,882
The Cheerleading Team...

480
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:36,122
Xu Jingjing.

481
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:37,882
I think the Taekwondo Club

482
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:38,922
did a very good job.

483
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:39,721
Really?

484
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:40,882
We didn't.

485
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:42,041
It probably happened

486
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,001
because we rushed through
our preparation.

487
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,281
I wasn't very familiar
with our moves yet.

488
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:44,962
No.

489
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:46,041
The cheerleading performance

490
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:47,041
was the real disaster.

491
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:47,842
Can you stop bringing it up

492
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:48,642
in front of me?

493
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,081
You're just like a student

494
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:50,761
who scored

495
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:51,721
99% in her test,

496
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:52,922
complaining to a student who failed

497
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:54,281
about the one point she lost.

498
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:55,481
That's not what I meant.

499
00:21:56,122 --> 00:21:57,241
Did you vote for the Cheerleading Team?

500
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:59,442
I feel so sorry for them
when their music wasn't playing.

501
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:00,642
I was worried that
they wouldn't get any vote.

502
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,162
That was what I thought too.

503
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:03,481
Did you vote for the Taekwondo Club?

504
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:04,202
I didn't.

505
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:05,882
I thought they would definitely make it.

506
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:07,081
It's such a shame.

507
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:10,642
Sorry.

508
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:12,241
I had no idea...

509
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,001
Xu Jingjing.

510
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:39,241
I should've applied

511
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:40,362
to join the student judges.

512
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:42,642
I think

513
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:43,842
there shouldn't be any judges
in the first place.

514
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:44,561
Every club should get a chance

515
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,642
to perform on stage.

516
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:48,561
Xu Jingjing.

517
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,081
Should we talk to the teacher

518
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:50,882
and ask for a second chance?

519
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,081
There might still be hope.

520
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,321
I heard that
the Cheerleading Team made it

521
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,241
despite the fact that
their music wasn't playing.

522
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,721
How did you fail the preliminary?

523
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:02,962
Let's figure something out.

524
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,642
We can figure it out together.

525
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:05,362
I don't want to be the only one...

526
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:06,362
Stay away from me.

527
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,721
My team has been eliminated.

528
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,122
The Cheerleading Team,
whom you've been helping, have made it.

529
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:11,281
Are you happy now?

530
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:12,642
I'm not. I...

531
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:13,442
You are happy.

532
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:15,202
You're here to mock us.

533
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:16,561
When I was in the hospital,

534
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:17,642
you never bothered to show any concern.

535
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,001
It's too late to say anything now.

536
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:25,602
Are you all right?

537
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:27,122
Does it hurt?

538
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,041
Do you want to go to the hospital?

539
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:33,721
Does it hurt? Are you all right?

540
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:40,362
Morning.

541
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:44,842
Xiaobai.

542
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:45,801
What did you tell me just now?

543
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:46,922
I told you

544
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:47,721
that I watched the variety show

545
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:48,682
featuring Qi yesterday.

546
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:50,041
It was hilarious.

547
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:51,162
Qi

548
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,801
and the two guests were counting ducks.

549
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:06,922
Take a break.

550
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:07,801
Let's take a break.

551
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:10,801
President Wang.

552
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:11,842
President Wang.

553
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,801
You sing really well.

554
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:14,801
Thank you.

555
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:15,561
Congratulations on making it
into the final round.

556
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:16,721
Your performance is what I look forward

557
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:18,081
to seeing the most during
the coming Culture and Art Festival.

558
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:19,122
Thank you.

559
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:19,922
By the way,

560
00:24:20,362 --> 00:24:21,081
how many songs are you going to perform?

561
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:22,842
We're doing a medley.

562
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,041
I like medleys.

563
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:25,162
How long is it going to take?

564
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:26,442
Five minutes. Why?

565
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:27,041
You can't do that.

566
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:28,602
Five minutes is too long.

567
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:29,721
The audience will feel tired.

568
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:30,521
Three minutes.

569
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,922
That is the best performance length.

570
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:33,001
No way.

571
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:34,642
We've prepared the songs.

572
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:35,842
Come here.

573
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,761
Let's get back to work.

574
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:40,362
What are you singing?

575
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:43,922
Lady,

576
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:46,602
by yonder blessed moon

577
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:47,801
I vow...

578
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:49,801
O,

579
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:50,801
swear not

580
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,481
by the moon,

581
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:54,561
the inconstant moon.

582
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,442
That monthly changes in her circle orb

583
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:01,962
I'm moved beyond tears.

584
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:03,561
It's true.

585
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,561
This is too touching.

586
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:06,801
The following will be even more moving.

587
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:08,162
Let us play it for you.

588
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:09,922
No. It's fine.

589
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:11,442
Actually,

590
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:12,962
I have something to discuss with you.

591
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:14,442
Say to me.

592
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:15,842
Can you shorten
the Drama Club's performance

593
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,041
by just a few minutes?

594
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,122
Why should I?

595
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:20,442
Can you shorten it just by two minutes?

596
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,962
So that the Taekwondo Club
can perform too.

597
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:23,442
No way.

598
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:25,682
We're running short of time too.

599
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:27,682
One minute? That will do too.

600
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:29,081
You just have to remove
a few meaningless lines,

601
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,241
and you'll have ample time.

602
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,281
You're calling Shakespeare's script

603
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:34,521
meaningless.

604
00:25:35,922 --> 00:25:36,561
I've got to go.

605
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:40,001
Can anyone demonstrate

606
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:41,842
the front kick we learned
during the previous lesson?

607
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:51,321
I know

608
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:52,721
you're still sad

609
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:54,402
because of what happened
at the Culture and Art Festival.

610
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,081
I think I am responsible

611
00:25:58,162 --> 00:25:59,602
for our failure at the preliminary.

612
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:01,882
Because

613
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,241
I didn't have much idea

614
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,561
about how to arrange the performance.

615
00:26:05,842 --> 00:26:06,602
Sorry.

616
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:09,962
I am to blame as well.

617
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:11,362
Many of the ideas

618
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,721
were suggested by me.

619
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:15,521
It's all right, Jingjing.

620
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:17,882
We won't blame you.

621
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:18,801
That's right.

622
00:26:22,202 --> 00:26:22,642
We can't change

623
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,162
the results anymore.

624
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:26,761
However, we still have to face it.

625
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:28,481
We don't get to perform.

626
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:29,682
That's not a big deal.

627
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:33,682
Our club

628
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:35,162
still has a few activities

629
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:36,122
pending, right?

630
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,761
Most importantly,

631
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,561
we can all appreciate the joy

632
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,081
brought to us by Taekwondo.

633
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,521
Let's enjoy
the remaining activities together.

634
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:45,561
For me,

635
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:46,402
the happiest part

636
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,481
is when I get to practice Taekwondo
with all of you.

637
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:51,761
We're very happy
to practice with you too.

638
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:52,442
Yes.

639
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:53,882
Don't get discouraged.

640
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:55,602
It's just the Culture and Art Festival.

641
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,041
We practise Taekwondo

642
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:57,761
not because we want to show off

643
00:26:57,922 --> 00:26:58,721
on stage.

644
00:26:59,202 --> 00:26:59,922
She's right.

645
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:01,241
We get

646
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:02,521
to gather here

647
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:03,321
because of our passion

648
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:04,442
for Taekwondo.

649
00:27:04,962 --> 00:27:06,362
Whether we're on

650
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,321
or off stage,

651
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:08,362
we will always be

652
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:09,442
as passionate as ever.

653
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:10,922
Let's do this!

654
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:13,442
Let's do this!

655
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:15,362
Let's do this!

656
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:27,041
(Are you there?)

657
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:36,642
(Let's meet at Douyou.)

658
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:47,801
In fact,

659
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,122
we can talk through WeChat.

660
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,362
I like talking to you here.

661
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:53,081
It feels like a secret hideout

662
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:54,281
only we know.

663
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:57,922
Why were you looking for me?

664
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:01,602
It's about Xu Jingjing.

665
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:02,761
Their Taekwondo Club

666
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:04,481
didn't get to perform

667
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,842
because of the difference
of a single vote, right?

668
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:08,041
I was thinking

669
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:09,001
if other clubs

670
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:10,481
can each give up some time,

671
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,321
so that they'll get to perform too.

672
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:15,442
Is this why

673
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,882
you were looking for me?

674
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:20,041
We all know

675
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:21,721
that Taekwondo Club has the capability.

676
00:28:22,922 --> 00:28:24,081
It was an accident

677
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,442
that they didn't pass the preliminary.

678
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:28,288
The Cheerleading Team

679
00:28:28,761 --> 00:28:29,842
is responsible for the accident.

680
00:28:30,362 --> 00:28:31,362
I know that the Cheerleading Team

681
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,481
only made it

682
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:33,362
by earning sympathy votes.

683
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:34,481
That's not what I meant.

684
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:35,281
I agree.

685
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:37,561
Let me go back
and discuss with my team members.

686
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:38,801
Let's see if we can share

687
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:39,922
half of the Cheerleading Team's
performance time

688
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,602
with Taekwondo Club.

689
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:44,081
Half?

690
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:45,281
Then, will you have enough time?

691
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:47,122
I've no idea yet.

692
00:28:47,402 --> 00:28:48,442
We need to choreograph it.

693
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:51,162
I have an idea.

694
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:02,281
Xu Jingjing.

695
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:07,962
Xu Jingjing.

696
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:12,682
I have good news.

697
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:13,481
I'm not listening.

698
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:17,842
The Taekwondo Club

699
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:19,041
will get to perform at the festival.

700
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:21,162
Really?

701
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:21,842
Yes.

702
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:23,682
So

703
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:24,962
how are you going to thank me?

704
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:27,041
Tell me what happened first.

705
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:29,041
The Cheerleading Team is willing

706
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,801
to collaborate with the Taekwondo Club.

707
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:33,001
You can perform a Taekwondo Dance.

708
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:37,001
A Taekwondo Dance?

709
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,481
I've watched the video.

710
00:29:38,721 --> 00:29:40,041
It looks amazing.

711
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:42,842
Will Xu Jingjing agree to it?

712
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:43,842
She said yes.

713
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:46,481
I've spoken to the teacher too.

714
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,402
She agreed as well.

715
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:52,481
Great.

716
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:53,682
I got it.

717
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:55,041
Wait.

718
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:57,202
Aren't you excited?

719
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:57,922
I am excited.

720
00:29:58,761 --> 00:29:59,362
Aren't you happy?

721
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:00,041
I'm happy.

722
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:01,721
Why haven't you thanked me?

723
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:03,801
Why should I thank you?

724
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:05,442
It was Xu Jingjing who helped me.

725
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:06,081
I should thank

726
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:07,561
Xu Jingjing instead.

727
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:09,842
Xu Jingjing did help you,

728
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,842
but it was my idea.

729
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:12,682
I contributed to it too.

730
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:14,761
No one asked you
to make such a contribution.

731
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:15,761
Xu Jingjing.

732
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:17,081
How could you say things like that?

733
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:18,241
Won't you feel guilty?

734
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:19,202
Do you know

735
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:20,001
how much time I've spent

736
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:21,481
begging those clubs?

737
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:22,001
I did that

738
00:30:22,162 --> 00:30:22,721
so that I could earn some time

739
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,122
for the Taekwondo Club.

740
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,721
I did all of that for you.

741
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:28,081
For me?

742
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:31,162
Why didn't you pay me a visit

743
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,721
when I was sick?

744
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,001
I had to clarify this.

745
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,561
I went to the hospital to visit you,

746
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:37,321
but you were there

747
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:37,962
with Gao Zhan.

748
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:39,521
Of course, I wouldn't want
to disturb you.

749
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:40,962
You can ask the nurses or the doctors

750
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:41,682
if you don't trust me.

751
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:43,321
They all saw me.

752
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:44,162
I won't ask them.

753
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:45,241
Why should I?

754
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:48,081
Don't worry.

755
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:49,882
Although Xu Jingjing and I
are online friends,

756
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,402
you're still my best friend

757
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,202
in real life.

758
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:01,842
Kang Jiawei.

759
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:04,602
Won't you cringe at your words?

760
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:06,402
I'm feeling embarrassed on your behalf.

761
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:07,281
Do you think I enjoyed saying that?

762
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,442
I want to puke too, okay?

763
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:11,922
Anyway, I'm not jealous.

764
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,642
If you insist.

765
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:15,882
I'm not.

766
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:21,162
Look who's talking.

767
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:22,842
You're just the same.

768
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:24,241
You do your revision with Gao Zhan
every day.

769
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:24,922
So what?

770
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:26,521
That's none of your business.

771
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,442
How are things going
between you and Xu Jingjing?

772
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:33,602
I don't know!

773
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,321
Kang Jiawei.

774
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,362
I hereby announce

775
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:37,402
that the Taekwondo Club

776
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:38,362
will join the Cheerleading Team

777
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,162
and perform

778
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:40,281
at the Culture
and Art Festival together.

779
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:41,362
Are you saying

780
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:42,481
that we'll get to perform?

781
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:47,122
Thank you so much.

782
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:48,321
Without you,

783
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:50,442
we won't be able to perform on stage.

784
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:51,801
Xu Jingjing.

785
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:52,761
Thank you.

786
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:54,081
We're classmates.

787
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:55,561
It's our pleasure.

788
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:56,882
Members of the Taekwondo Club

789
00:31:57,202 --> 00:31:58,362
are bad dancers.

790
00:31:58,761 --> 00:31:59,721
We need to learn

791
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:00,402
from the Cheerleading Team.

792
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:01,602
Then, we might need you

793
00:32:01,761 --> 00:32:03,402
to teach us some Taekwondo moves too.

794
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:05,281
Let's work hard together.

795
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:06,122
All the best!

796
00:32:06,362 --> 00:32:07,801
All the best!

797
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,922
The final flying kick

798
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:15,761
is very important.

799
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:16,682
If you jump earlier than planned,

800
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:17,721
you'll land off center.

801
00:32:17,922 --> 00:32:18,682
If you jump later than expected,

802
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,122
you'll bump into other students.

803
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,801
Before the performance,

804
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:23,321
I'll leave a mark

805
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:24,122
on the stage.

806
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,001
Look for the mark,

807
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:26,122
so that you won't make any mistakes.

808
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:31,521
Not bad.

809
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,321
You're indeed Gao Zhan.

810
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:34,561
So thoughtful.

811
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:40,281
About that...

812
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:41,842
Are you still mad at me

813
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,402
regarding the eggs?

814
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,481
It was the dog who ate it, not you.

815
00:32:48,162 --> 00:32:48,721
All right.

816
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:49,642
Let's practice

817
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:50,721
our moves.

818
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,202
What's with all the noise?

819
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:10,922
I'm going to perform at
the Culture and Art Festival tomorrow.

820
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:12,801
I'm practicing
the cheerleading choreography.

821
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:14,882
Stop wasting your time

822
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,202
practicing the choreography.

823
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:18,122
Finish your homework first.

824
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:19,241
Mom.

825
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,081
Will you...

826
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:22,801
Will you and dad be there

827
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:24,162
for my performance tomorrow?

828
00:33:24,642 --> 00:33:25,402
I can't join the Cheerleading Team

829
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:26,442
when I start Grade 12 later.

830
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:27,962
It'll be my final show

831
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,081
at school tomorrow.

832
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:32,442
Talk to your dad.

833
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:34,521
I have classes to attend
at the Palace of Culture tomorrow.

834
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:35,721
It's going to be my final show.

835
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:37,721
You weren't there the last time.

836
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,321
You haven't seen any performance

837
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:41,922
I did at school before.

838
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:42,882
That's not true.

839
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:44,281
I was always there

840
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,842
when you took part in ballet contests.

841
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:46,721
I know,

842
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:47,801
but for me,

843
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:50,721
this performance

844
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:52,481
is as important

845
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,721
as the ballet contest.

846
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:56,122
I really hope that you can be there.

847
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:01,321
Fine. I get it.

848
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:02,561
Hurry up and finish your homework.

849
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:03,642
Stop practicing.

850
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:14,722
Doesn't the crosstalk sound stupid?

851
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:15,201
Have you watched it before?

852
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:16,922
It's a large audience.

853
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:17,722
Such a huge audience.

854
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:18,802
Excuse me. Sorry.

855
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:20,041
My daughter is performing today.

856
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:20,802
Excuse me.

857
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:21,601
Excuse me.

858
00:34:21,802 --> 00:34:22,561
That's a nice stage.

859
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:23,681
Xu.

860
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,362
You're here too.

861
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,001
Your equipment is so professional.

862
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:27,802
Of course.

863
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:28,922
It's an important event.

864
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:30,081
Of course, we have to record it.

865
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:30,842
For memory's sake.

866
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:31,722
Can you record it for me

867
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:32,722
when Jingjing is performing too?

868
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:34,322
Sure. No worries.

869
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:36,121
Jingjing has performed on stage

870
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,362
too many times since she was little.

871
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:39,802
I'm very familiar

872
00:34:39,962 --> 00:34:40,962
with what she looks like on stage.

873
00:34:41,402 --> 00:34:41,962
Wait. Liu Wan.

874
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,402
What do you mean?

875
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:44,161
How can you...

876
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:44,882
What are you doing?

877
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:45,722
Stop.

878
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:46,641
That's why I look down on you.

879
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:48,161
The emcees are here. It's starting soon.

880
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:51,922
Leaders,

881
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:52,802
(Campus of Arts. Let Your Dreams Fly)
ladies and gentlemen.

882
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:54,081
(Campus of Arts. Let Your Dreams Fly)
Teachers

883
00:34:54,282 --> 00:34:55,641
(Campus of Arts. Let Your Dreams Fly)
and our beloved friends.

884
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:56,722
Welcome

885
00:34:56,882 --> 00:34:59,322
to the Culture and Art Festival
of Yuming Senior High School.

886
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:05,041
I'm Yang, your emcee for today.

887
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:06,922
I'm Zheng, your emcee for today.

888
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:08,282
It's too tight. I'm suffocating.

889
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,161
Okay.

890
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:10,282
All done.

891
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:11,242
What about yours?

892
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,001
Dad, have you found a seat?

893
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:14,962
All right.

894
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,161
I'll go and get ready.

895
00:35:16,362 --> 00:35:17,041
I'll see you later.

896
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:17,882
Jingjing.

897
00:35:18,722 --> 00:35:19,521
I owe you

898
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:20,442
big time.

899
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:21,641
Let me buy you a meal

900
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:22,442
after the festival.

901
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:23,362
Sure.

902
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:24,681
By the way,

903
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:26,722
I overheard you talking on the phone.

904
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:29,641
It sounds like your parents are here.

905
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:32,962
Are you not worried

906
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,081
that your mom will drag you
off the stage

907
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,641
when she sees you dancing?

908
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:38,041
I guess she won't.

909
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:39,521
But I really want

910
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:40,481
my mom to see

911
00:35:40,762 --> 00:35:41,322
how much

912
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:42,521
I love

913
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:43,882
dancing on stage.

914
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:45,322
Then,

915
00:35:45,722 --> 00:35:46,282
break a leg!

916
00:35:46,722 --> 00:35:47,802
All the best!

917
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:49,762
I'll go and get my makeup done.

918
00:35:51,402 --> 00:35:52,121
Xu Jingjing.

919
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,001
Remember to check the mark

920
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:55,201
before you do the final jump.

921
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:56,242
Make sure you don't make any mistakes.

922
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:57,722
Sure.

923
00:35:57,962 --> 00:35:58,521
Don't worry.

924
00:35:58,882 --> 00:35:59,722
I can find the spot

925
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:01,081
even with my eyes closed now.

926
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:03,201
Don't make any careless mistakes, okay?

927
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,161
A dead person?

928
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:08,601
The dead man has been buried.

929
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:09,322
Where is he buried?

930
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:10,322
What is that?

931
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:11,842
We call four bites.

932
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:13,402
Four bites?

933
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:14,242
Sister-in-law?

934
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:14,882
Dumplings?

935
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:15,681
Steamed buns!

936
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:16,601
What's the filling?

937
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,521
Leek and egg.

938
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:18,561
You can eat it with vinegar.

939
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,121
All you know is how to eat.

940
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:21,722
Not bad.

941
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:23,762
He's almost as eloquent as me.

942
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,242
As the saying goes,

943
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,641
"The sister-in-law is
as important as the mother.

944
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:27,681
The brother-in-law is as important
as the son."

945
00:36:27,882 --> 00:36:28,802
You have to show them some respect.

946
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:29,561
If that's the case,

947
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:31,041
you'll be your sister-in-law's son.

948
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:32,681
You're your brother-in-law's grandson.

949
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:37,041
Master Kang, look.

950
00:36:37,242 --> 00:36:38,041
It's very interesting.

951
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:39,001
I don't care.

952
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:40,121
I'll watch
the Taekwondo performance later.

953
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,362
None of the other performances matter.

954
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:43,121
You have a black face.

955
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:44,242
That's not what I meant.

956
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,802
Is your sister-in-law Bao Gong?

957
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:46,641
She's not Bao Gong.

958
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:47,442
Is her face black?

959
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:48,641
Yes, her face is black.

960
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:49,481
Then, your sister-in-law

961
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:50,322
is Bao Gong.

962
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:52,681
Cheerleading Team and Taekwondo Club.

963
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:53,481
Get ready to go on stage.

964
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:54,481
Okay.

965
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:57,001
All the best!

966
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:57,882
All the best!

967
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:58,922
All the best!

968
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:02,601
Stop fixing your hair.

969
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:04,561
It's pulling your eyes
into two thin lines.

970
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:07,001
Soaring youth

971
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,641
is always charming.

972
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:09,442
Students of Yuming

973
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:11,561
are full of vigor.

974
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:14,601
Let's look forward
to the joint performance

975
00:37:14,802 --> 00:37:15,641
by Taekwondo Club

976
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:17,362
and Cheerleading Team.

977
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:20,442
- The Invincible Youth!
- Let's welcome them.

978
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:21,282
Record it.

979
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:21,962
I'm recording.

980
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:24,722
Great.

981
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:31,362
Jingjing, you're the best.

982
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:32,681
Jingjing, you're amazing.

983
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:33,442
That's my daughter.

984
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:34,322
That's my daughter.

985
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:43,722
Well done!

986
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,242
They're so creative.

987
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:55,121
Xu,

988
00:37:57,561 --> 00:37:58,561
please take nice shots
of my daughter too.

989
00:37:58,882 --> 00:37:59,842
Can you see Jingjing?

990
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:00,802
It's out of battery. What do I do now?

991
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,362
There's nothing worth recording.

992
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:03,922
Yes. There's nothing worth recording.

993
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:04,722
Our Xu Jingjing

994
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,161
has all the limelight.

995
00:38:06,362 --> 00:38:06,962
Stop boasting.

996
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:15,722
That's great.

997
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:18,521
How did he do that?

998
00:38:33,442 --> 00:38:34,402
You...

999
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,081
Why did you do that?

1000
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,561
I didn't do that.

1001
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:39,242
I simply think

1002
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,641
there's a huge height difference

1003
00:38:40,641 --> 00:38:41,601
between Gao Zhan and Xu Jingjing.

1004
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:43,201
Yes.

1005
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:44,442
Gao is too tall.

1006
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:45,802
He should've taken the spot at the back.

1007
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:47,001
He's blocking Yaoyao.

1008
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:47,641
How could he?

1009
00:38:47,802 --> 00:38:48,641
He should have taken the last row.

1010
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,242
He's blocking everyone.

1011
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:49,681
Exactly.

1012
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:50,842
He should have taken the last row.

1013
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:51,402
Here.

1014
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,041
It's here.

1015
00:39:08,242 --> 00:39:09,282
Xu Jingjing is going
to show her signature move.

1016
00:39:09,362 --> 00:39:10,442
Good job!

1017
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:12,402
Well done!

1018
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:35,521
Jingjing!
