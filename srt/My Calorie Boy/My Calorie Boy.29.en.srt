00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,060
stay out of my business?

172
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:55,859
No.

173
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,420
You must bid farewell to Jingjing.

174
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,300
Otherwise, you can't leave.

175
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,060
Aunt.

176
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,420
After Wei has done
with the school termination procedures,

177
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:08,699
he's going to England with me.

178
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,060
We were preoccupied

179
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
with his father's funeral arrangements
last few days,

180
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:13,540
I haven't got the chance

181
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,780
to thank you.

182
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,420
I'll leave you here.

183
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,459
Be nice and don't lose your temper.

184
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:26,540
I'll wait for you at the gate.

185
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:35,219
Kang Jiawei.

186
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:37,300
Are you still

187
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,499
angry with me?

188
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,540
No, I don't.

189
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,499
Why don't you look at me?

190
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:49,260
Do you hate me?

191
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:54,979
No, I don't.

192
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,619
I know it's a stupid question.

193
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:03,699
But I want to know

194
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,900
when will you

195
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,300
stop being angry with me.

196
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:07,459
Give me

197
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:08,619
an approximate time.

198
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:10,060
One month,

199
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,499
two months

200
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,380
or one year.

201
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,619
I'm not angry with you.

202
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,459
Perhaps I'm angry with myself.

203
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:26,540
Whenever I see you,

204
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
it reminds me of my father.

205
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:31,020
And...

206
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:35,459
Kang Jiawei.

207
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,020
We miss you very much.

208
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:42,540
Please don't go, will you?

209
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,140
Say goodbye to them for me.

210
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
I said I miss you very much.

211
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,300
Did you hear me?

212
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:07,180
I've read your test paper.

213
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,219
There were

214
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,739
some tricky questions,

215
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,019
but you managed to resolve them.

216
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,620
Well done.

217
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,820
By the way,

218
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,019
when you sit for the exam,

219
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,820
read the paper through.

220
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,580
Go through all the questions.

221
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,219
Check your answers several times
after you're done.

222
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,019
Believe in yourself. You can do it.

223
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:42,059
I'm off.

224
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,299

Xu Jingjing.

258
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,779
The moment when you read this letter,

259
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,100
I guess I'll be on the flight

260
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:32,620
to England.

261
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,299
I left without informing you.

262
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:37,979
Hope you wouldn't mind it.

263
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,979
Previously, I threw tantrum at you

264
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:43,820
and said harsh words to you.

265
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,499
When I recall it now,

266
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,820
I find myself immature.

267
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,660
And I've tried

268
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:49,699
to stand in your shoes.

269
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
If I were you,

270
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,019
probably I would do the same as you.

271
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,459
Therefore, I'd like
to apologise to you.

272
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:58,380
Honestly, I have many things

273
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,059
to tell you.

274
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,459
But, I don't have the guts

275
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,539
to face you.

276
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,580
Or maybe

277
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:06,180
I have no courage to face

278
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:07,140
the current situation in my life.

279
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,499
By the way,

280
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,219
in the box,

281
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:11,140
there are notes and exercise books

282
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,739
I used for the past three years.

283
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,019
I wrote

284
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,620
the solutions

285
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,699
to those difficult questions.

286
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:18,820
Hopefully, they can be helpful to you.

287
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,620
Lastly, I wish you can make it
to Fuxing University.

Kafka once said,

295
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,900
"you can choose

296
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,940
the path that leads to
crossing the desert.

297
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,299
So, you're free.

298
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,620
but it's also unfree

299
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,979

I got three mistakes
in the English cloze section.

is the essay.

374

remind you of something.

During the exam,

387
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,580
ask your parents
to prepare something light.

388
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,340
Don't take raw or oily food.

389
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:03,739
Don't you regret it

390
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:05,299
because of your gluttony.

391
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:07,299
Remember to bring

392
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,299
your exam slip tomorrow.

393

There are always befuddled students

who forget to bring the exam slips

395

when they arrive at the gate
of the exam hall.

396
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,219
Go through all the questions
when you get the paper.

397
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,860
Don't miss out on questions
with higher weightage.

398
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,779
Some students rush through
unfinished questions

at the last minute.

400
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:23,860
Don't compare the answer with each other
after the exam.

401
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,059
Because the answer you compared

402
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:26,380
might not be correct,

403
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,059

this is my first time
being a class teacher.

433
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,900
Honestly, when I was initially
in charge of this class,

434
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,219
I had the same feeling

435

as when you first came to school.

436
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:08,900
I was a bundle of nerves.

437
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:10,499
I had qualms

438
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,259
and even fear.

439
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,660

Jingjing, you're here. Come on in.

510
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,579
Let's have dinner together.

511
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:18,340
You bought a dish here.

512
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:19,659
Uncle, aunt.

513
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,499
My mother

514
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,499
gives you this.

515
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,420
She said this big carp
brings a great blessing to Jingjing

516
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,099
as she can excel in the examination

517
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,979
like the carp leaps through
the dragon gate.

518
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:28,940
It's a good omen.

519
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:29,380
Great.

520
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:30,139
She's more superstitious than me.

521
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
Take this

522
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:32,780
to your mother.

523
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,179
Thank you.

524
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,459
What's this?

525
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:36,659
Fried egg with cucumber.

526
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,019
What's the meaning of it?

527
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:39,019
One cucumber

528
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:39,740
and two eggs.

529
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:41,979
Wish you get 100 marks in the exam.

530
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,579
100 marks?

531
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,179

532
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,300
The full score is 150 marks.

533
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:46,659
It's 150 marks.

00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,340
Hey, you.

535
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,940
I don't know about that.

536

537

Where are you going?

538
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,380
I'll add one more egg.

539
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,179
You should cook chicken feet instead.

540

Please bless Jingjing

541
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:04,860
to sail through her exams.

Everything must be smooth.

544
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,300
Dear deities, please bless her.

545
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:08,900
I'm off, mum.

Have you checked your exam slip?

548
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:13,579
Did you forget anything?

No.

I can't

560
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,059
recall that.

569

00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,659
you don't turn up

682
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:43,940
in the oasis?

683
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:54,979
I

684
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,019
I really

685
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:58,499
really

686
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:01,019
like you.

687
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,940
Hey.

688
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,659
Do you hear me?

689
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:36,860
(Happy Graduation)

690
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,139
Students.

691
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:11,860
Today

692
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:13,300
is your last day in school.

693
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,900
If you have anything
you want to say or do,

694
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,380
do it today

695
00:45:17,659 --> 00:45:18,940
without leaving any regrets.

696
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:19,940
Miss Chen.

697
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,979
If you become a famous writer

698
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:22,860
or a screenwriter,

699
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,459
don't forget about us.

700
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,340
Why did the three of you

701
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,179
come to our class?

702
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,380
It's the last day.

703
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:31,420
We want to pretend

704
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:32,539
to be good students.

705
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,220
Miss Chen.

706
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:34,139
Can you please sign

707
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,900
the group photo for me?

708
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,019
I want it too.

709
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:37,420
-Me too.
-Me too.

710
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,420
-I want it.
-Me either.

711
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:40,380
Alright.

712
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:41,260
I'll sign it

713
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:42,300
and leave a message for you.

714
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:42,820
Okay?

715
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:43,979
-Yes.
-Yes.

716
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:46,220
Kang Jiawei.

717
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,539
Kang Jiawei?

718
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,059
Didn't you go abroad?

719
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,459
Well,

720
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:00,940
the plan is changed.

721
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,459
You won't leave again, right?

722
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,979
Kang Jiawei, just stay here.

723
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:08,459
That's right. Mr. Kang, stay here.

724
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,820
We miss you so much.

725
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:10,459
Don't go.

726
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,619
Quiet.

727
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,700
Kang Jiawei.

728
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:15,740
