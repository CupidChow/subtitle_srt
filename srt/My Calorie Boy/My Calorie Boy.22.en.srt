I'm not afraid of a small start.

17
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:45,546
I'm not afraid of a small start.

18
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,705
I only wish for a strong ending.

19

Parents,

22
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:03,666
now you can hand the students

23
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,826
the letters and presents.

Why are you here?

26
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:23,826
Why are you here?

27
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:29,865
Xu Jingjing.

28
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,625
Kang Jiawei!

29
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:37,786
Screw you.

30
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:38,425
I...

31
00:03:56,585 --> 00:03:57,386
Xu Jingjing.

32
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,025
Your family is not here?

33
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:07,546
It's fine.

34
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:08,745
I don't mind.

35
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,386
It shouldn't be like this.

36
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:16,745
Here's a present for you.

37
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,026
What is this?

38
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,305
Is this a coming-of-age gift?

39
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,305
Don't get too touched.

40
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:28,786
It was nothing expensive.

41
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:32,586
What is it?

42
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:34,185
They told me

43
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:36,825
it's a special weapon

44
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,265
for art students.

45
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:40,706
Special weapon?

46
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,226
A pencil sharpener.

47
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,945
A pencil sharpener?

48
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:47,986
How much is it worth?

49
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:49,425
If you think it's cheap, then...

50
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:50,825
No. I've never said that.

51
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:51,706
Don't worry.

52
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:52,786
I like it a lot.

53
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,586
I'll use it every day.

54
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,505
Sharpen your pencils and draw more.

55
00:04:57,706 --> 00:04:58,265
Then, you'll forget

56
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,425
all your troubles.

57
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:03,786
Xu Jingjing.

58
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,265
I have a present for you too.

59
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:09,346
It's a novel written

60
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,065
by my favorite author, Lawrence Block.

61
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,346
I got you the whole set.

62
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:15,226
Happy coming-of-age day.

63
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,226
Thank you.

64
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:22,065
Read more.

65
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:23,185
It can help

66
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:24,106
with your creative thinking.

67
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:25,945
It's good for art students.

68
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:27,865
This one.

69
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:28,945
8 Million Ways to Die.

70
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,786
They will always leave behind some...

71
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,226
Sure. Thank you.

72
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:34,906
Let me bring them
to the classroom first.

73
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:35,786
Let me help you.

74
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:37,945
Let me do it.

75
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,106
I can do it. It's not that heavy.

76
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:40,986
You shouldn't visit
someone else's classroom.

77
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:41,945
It's fine. Give it to me.

78
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:42,786
Enough, the two of you!

79
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:44,745
I can do it myself.

80
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:46,026
Give it to me.

81
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:57,625
Stop right there.

82
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:01,625
Kang Jiawei, I have a question for you.

83
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:04,546
We made a promise.

84
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:05,706
You would be my teacher

85
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:06,666
and teach me

86
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:07,825
how to make friends with Xu Jingjing.

87
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:08,745
I trusted you.

88
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:09,986
Yes. I can't fake it anymore.

89
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,466
I don't want to be your teacher anymore.

90
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,106
Then, let's call it off.

91
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:18,146
Do you think

92
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,106
she prefers the pencil sharpener

93
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,666
or detective novels?

94
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:26,906
Yes.

95
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:28,945
The pencil sharpener
might be very useful

96
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:29,786
for her.

97
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:31,706
But if she reads

98
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:33,106
the novels I got for her,

99
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:34,786
it'll influence her positively.

100
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,226
Besides,

101
00:06:36,385 --> 00:06:37,385
it's wrong

102
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:38,226
to call it a detective novel.

103
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,865
Lawrence Block writes

104
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,026
crime fictions.

105
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,505
It was just a metaphor.

106
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,065
Do you know what's a metaphor?

107
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:51,185
The police academy you're applying to

108
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:52,065
is in Beijing, right?

109
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,305
Yes.

110
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:54,385
What about you?

111
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,625
I'm planning
to apply for Fuxing University.

112
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:57,226
I want to stay here.

113
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:00,385
As far as I know,

114
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:02,265
the best designing courses

115
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:04,346
and the best art courses

116
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:05,986
are in Beijing.

117
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:07,825
As far as I know,

118
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,026
the designing course
in Fuxing University

119
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,265
is the best in the country.

120
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,305
I think it's better in Beijing.

121
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,385
I think Wuxi is better.

122
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,706
You get roasted duck in Beijing.

123
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:17,945
You get
sweet and sour pork ribs in Wuxi.

124
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:18,986
That's Xu Jingjing's favorite.

125
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:20,226
The Great Wall is in Beijing.

126
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,106
Lake Tai is in Wuxi.

127
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:21,945
It's full of fish.

128
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:23,106
There'll never be a shortage of food.

129
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,865
There's still some time

130
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:32,945
before we start college.

131
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:34,586
Let's leave it

132
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,546
for Jingjing to decide.

133
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:37,346
I agree.

134
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:46,865
Jingjing.

135
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:47,945
Jingjing.

136
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:49,625
Sorry.

137
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:50,466
Can we still make it?

138
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:51,305
Hurry up.

139
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:51,906
It's over.

140
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:52,906
Why are you here?

141
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:53,706
It's over?

142
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:56,546
But... I...

143
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:00,625
Happy coming-of-age day.

144
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,385
The present... I...

145
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:08,625
If you don't want to come here,
you don't have to.

146
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:09,706
I don't mind.

147
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:10,346
No.

148
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:11,106
Jingjing.

149
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:12,586
Of course, I want to be here.

150
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:14,666
I got into a rear-end collision
just now.

151
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:15,906
The driver refused to let me go.

152
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:17,265
He insisted on waiting
for the police's arrival.

153
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:18,586
How did the collision happen?

154
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:19,425
Did you attend

155
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:20,425
another wedding?

156
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:21,305
Are the couple

157
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:22,505
more important than me?

158
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:23,945
All my friends' parents were there,

159
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:24,986
except for mine.

160
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:26,226
I come home dog-tired every day

161
00:08:26,385 --> 00:08:27,346
after work.

162
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:28,986
And you welcome me with a long face.

163
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:30,305
It's my fault, all right?

164
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:31,466
Jingjing, listen.

165
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,706
Of course, you're more important
than them.

166
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:33,466
No.

167
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:34,306
I don't need

168
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:35,625
your wishes.

169
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:37,665
Jingjing.

170
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:39,226
Jingjing.

171
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:56,545
Mr. Xu.

172
00:08:58,745 --> 00:08:59,265
Mr. Kang.

173
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:00,865
Why weren't you there just now?

174
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:02,466
Don't bring it up.

175
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:03,986
I was supposed

176
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:05,625
to host a wedding today.

177
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:06,865
I thought

178
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:07,665
I would have ample time to come here

179
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,385
after the event.

180
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:10,665
I didn't expect

181
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:11,785
to get caught up in the traffic.

182
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,385
I was nervous and tried to rush here,

183
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,625
so I ended up in a rear-end collision.

184
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:17,346
I had to wait

185
00:09:17,545 --> 00:09:18,265
for the police to settle the conflict

186
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:19,226
before I could come here.

187
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,066
And the Coming-of-age Ceremony was over.

188
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:22,306
Did Xu Jingjing know

189
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:24,106
about the paint you got for her?

190
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:26,226
How did you know about that?

191
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:28,145
I saw you

192
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:29,226
at the store yesterday.

193
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:32,106
It won't be helpful anyway.

194
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,466
For her,

195
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,186
everything I do and I say now

196
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:37,466
is wrong.

197
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:41,466
All right, Mr. Kang.

198
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:43,145
I won't disturb you further.

199
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,426
I'll get going.

200
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:01,545
Remember to get the basketball later,

201
00:10:01,745 --> 00:10:02,466
Dapeng.

202
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:04,306
I'll get going.

203
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:05,665
What's the matter, Jiayao?

204
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,186
This one is for you.

205
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:11,665
For me?

206
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:15,226
Happy coming-of-age day!

207
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:26,826
That's great!

208
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:28,346
I got a gift from Wang Jiayao!

209
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,625
Jingjing's mom looks so pretty.

210
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:31,385
You look

211
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,785
like Jingjing's sister.

212
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:33,625
I'm flattered.

213
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,466
No way I'm her sister.

214
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:37,986
When is Jingjing going

215
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:39,306
to take the entrance exam
for the dance academy?

216
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:40,745
Soon. She'll take it
during the winter break.

217
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,586
Jingjing can definitely do it.

218
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:44,785
Of course.

219
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:46,226
Jingjing

220
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:47,186
has been preparing for it

221
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:48,505
since the beginning
of the summer vacation.

222
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:49,545
That's so impressive.

223
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,106
You should learn from her.

224
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:53,306
Mom.

225
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:54,905
Can I speak to my classmate?

226
00:10:55,706 --> 00:10:56,346
Go ahead.

227
00:10:59,186 --> 00:10:59,865
Wei Xue.

228
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,226
Xu Jingjing.

229
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:14,905
Is this for me?

230
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:16,785
Happy Coming-to-age Day.

231
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:19,466
Jingjing.

232
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:24,186
It's a pair.

233
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:29,466
I've accepted your apology.

234
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,665
I need to apologize to you as well.

235
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:34,346
I wasn't

236
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,426
a good friend.

237
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:38,106
I never listened

238
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,186
to your thoughts.

239
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,706
Let what happened when we were 17th

240
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,625
stay in that year.

241
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:45,145
From now on,

242
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:48,306
let us start all over again, all right?

243
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:51,706
Will you still

244
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:53,025
be my friend?

245
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,586
We weren't honest with each other.

246
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:59,145
You were wary of me,

247
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:02,226
and I doubted you.

248
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:03,505
Friends

249
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,905
shouldn't be like that.

250
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:06,545
From now on,

251
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:07,665
we shall try

252
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:08,346
telling each other our minds.

253
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:09,745
What do you think?

254
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,226
Let's get to know each other
all over again.

255
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:15,665
My name is Wei Xue.

256
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,106
My name is Xu Jingjing.

257
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,106
(Strive hard, study hard.)
Thank you so much,

258
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:40,905
Gao Zhan.

259
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:41,946
Xu Jingjing.

260
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:44,826
You misunderstood your dad.

261
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,106
What are you talking about?

262
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,826
Mr. Xu didn't miss the ceremony
deliberately.

263
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:50,946
He was caught in a rear-end collision.

264
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,426
How did you know about that?

265
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:54,905
Do you believe everything he says?

266
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:56,986
I'm just not his priority.

267
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,505
He didn't mean for that to happen.

268
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,745
I didn't intend to tell you this

269
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,066
because I hate spoilers the most.

270
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:08,665
However,

271
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:09,625
you really misunderstood Mr. Xu
this time.

272
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:12,265
Tell her

273
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,265
you bought the paint for her.

274
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:14,625
She won't want it

275
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:15,505
if she knows it's from me.

276
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:18,346
Why don't we repaint the wall

277
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:20,586
if she doesn't want it?

278
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,186
It's not the right time

279
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:23,265
to joke.

280
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:28,625
I'm so useless.

281
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:31,665
You didn't do it on purpose.

282
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:32,745
It's fine.

283
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:33,826
I'll talk to her

284
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:34,745
when she comes home later.

285
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:36,665
Do you want to talk to me?

286
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:46,066
What is this?

287
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,986
Why does it look so familiar?

288
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:52,865
It's late.

289
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,665
I should start cooking now.

290
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:55,745
I need to cook.

291
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:56,346
Wait.

292
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:57,745
Aren't you going to talk to her?

293
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,505
Jiaren, wait...

294
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,505
Jingjing. Your mom... You...

295
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:04,346
Dad.

296
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:07,025
Sorry.

297
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:08,505
It was my fault.

298
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,265
I knew...

299
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,865
Am I hallucinating?

300
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,545
Shall we

301
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,346
grab something to drink?

302
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:25,946
Dad.

303
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:27,745
Do you still remember

304
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:28,905
what you told me when I was a kid?

305
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:29,745
You said
that you would teach me how to drink

306
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:31,066
when I come of age.

307
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:32,426
I remember that.

308
00:14:32,986 --> 00:14:34,625
Learn how to drink while you're with me.

309
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:36,145
Then, no one will be able
to take advantage of you

310
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:37,346
in the future.

311
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:39,986
From today on, I'll be an adult.

312
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:43,745
Miss Adult.

313
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,346
I'm drinking beer,

314
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,505
and you're drinking Wang Zai milk.

315
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:48,186
Isn't that a little too much?

316
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:52,106
I have homework to do later.

317
00:14:53,106 --> 00:14:54,145
Jingjing,

318
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,745
you've inherited all my strengths,

319
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,466
except

320
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:58,385
my humor.

321
00:14:58,586 --> 00:14:59,986
I was just kidding.

322
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:02,025
Cheers.

323
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:02,665
Cheers.

324
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,226
Jingjing.

325
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:14,625
Please don't stay mad at me.

326
00:15:16,586 --> 00:15:17,826
I know I'm not a good father

327
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:18,745
if you compare me

328
00:15:18,946 --> 00:15:20,346
to other fathers.

329
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:21,785
But I really want

330
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:22,665
to do my best to protect you.

331
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:23,665
I don't want to see you hurt,

332
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:24,865
even if it's just a little bit.

333
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:29,946
In fact, I always know that.

334
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,826
But there's just something
I still don't get.

335
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:34,346
Since I was a kid,

336
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:35,905
you've always believed in me

337
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:37,265
and been supportive of everything I do.

338
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:40,066
You believed that I would defeat

339
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:41,826
the boy who practiced Taekwondo with me.

340
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:43,346
You believed

341
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:44,625
that I would do better in the next exam.

342
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:46,426
You believed
that I wasn't a stupid student.

343
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:47,106
That's right.

344
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:47,826
You made me feel

345
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,025
as if I was invincible.

346
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:50,545
But somehow,

347
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,986
you think I won't be able
to do it this time.

348
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,106
Silly girl.

349
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,066
Why would I doubt your capability?

350
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:58,025
Why would I

351
00:15:58,066 --> 00:15:59,826
doubt my own daughter?

352
00:16:00,346 --> 00:16:00,905
Then, why did you not agree

353
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:02,106
to let me study arts?

354
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:06,066
Jingjing.

355
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,745
When I was your age,

356
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:10,466
I already won first place
in the Taekwondo competition

357
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:11,946
of the Intercity Games.

358
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:13,865
All I wanted to do

359
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,505
was to spend every minute training.

360
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:17,466
My dream was to join
the provincial team,

361
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,106
then take part in the National Games
and win the championship.

362
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:21,826
I even dreamed about
joining the national team

363
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,265
and taking part in Olympics.

364
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,426
Those were my dreams.

365
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:32,905
But before the tryouts

366
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:33,785
for the provincial team,

367
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:36,665
I injured myself

368
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:37,865
because I was working too hard

369
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:41,265
on my training.

370
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,186
You injured yourself?

371
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:47,346
Why haven't you spoken of this before?

372
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:52,826
After I recovered from the injury,

373
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,145
somehow,

374
00:16:54,426 --> 00:16:55,865
I became too scared
to join any competitions again.

375
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:58,346
I worried that I might get injured.

376
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,785
I worried that I might fail.

377
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:01,346
There were so many worries,

378
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:02,505
even the unnecessary ones.

379
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:05,386
I had no choice but to retire.

380
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,706
Then, I met your mom.

381
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:16,866
We fell in love and got married.

382
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,745
Soon after that,

383
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,386
we gave birth to your sister.

384
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:32,946
Dad.

385
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:41,825
This was what I learned later.

386
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,345
The more you care about it,

387
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,545
the worse

388
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:48,785
it will hurt you.

389
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:51,386
I never think

390
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,345
you're not capable enough.

391
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,666
I simply don't want you to get hurt,

392
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,666
and go through what I went through.

393
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,706
Get it?

394
00:17:58,186 --> 00:17:58,866
If...

395
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:01,666
If you intend

396
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:02,505
to turn your interests

397
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,025
into your career,

398
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:06,226
it'll be very risky.

399
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,305
There's a chance

400
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,825
that you'll gradually lose your passion

401
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:11,505
because of failures.

402
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:13,745
Eventually, your interest
will turn into an obsession.

403
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,906
And it'll change into something
you have never expected to see.

404
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,906
I don't want you to go through this,

405
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:20,505
because I went through it myself.

406
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,345
It felt terrible.

407
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,065
Dad.

408
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,825
In fact, you have no idea

409
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,505
how badly Snape

410
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:35,906
scolded me in class.

411
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:39,466
He said that I was a terrible artist.

412
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:41,745
He said that I wouldn't be able
to get into any university.

413
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:44,666
I cried because of that too.

414
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:46,105
I tried to run away as well.

415
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:47,745
I even thought about giving up.

416
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:49,505
But I also want

417
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,305
to prove to him

418
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:51,426
that I can do this.

419
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:53,186
Dad.

420
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:54,906
Don't worry.

421
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,745
Whether the outcome is good or bad,

422
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,466
I'm ready to accept them.

423
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:01,105
I got it now.

424
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:04,426
I know my mistake now.

425
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,305
My daughter is unlike me.

426
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,545
My daughter is way stronger

427
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:08,825
than me.

428
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,426
I know it now.

429
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:14,146
So...

430
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,946
Are you still going
to give me the paint?

431
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,105
You still remember the paint.

432
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:21,986
Your mom almost used it
to paint our walls.

433
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:23,305
That's only because

434
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:24,386
you overbought.

435
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:25,265
It's fine.

436
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:26,025
You can use it however much you want.

437
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:26,706
I'll buy you new ones

438
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:27,545
when you finish this.

439
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,226
Thanks, Dad.

440
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:31,386
You're welcome.

441
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:32,666
To adulthood.

442
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:39,666
Your mom caused trouble again.

443
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:41,505
Jiaren...

444
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:48,866
This way.

445
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,226
Carbonated drink?

446
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:02,065
No, thanks.

447
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:04,105
Not bad.

448
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:05,585
You're quite self-conscious.

449
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,345
It was just a test.

450
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:19,265
How did it go?

451
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:21,186
Did you talk to your dad?

452
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,146
We've reconciled.

453
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:27,345
You owe me big time,

454
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:28,186
but it's all right.

455
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:29,626
I won't make you buy me a meal.

456
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:30,825
I won't make you do that.

457
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:31,986
Forget it.

458
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,626
I was really impressed

459
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,386
by my dad yesterday.

460
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:35,706
He said many famous quotes.

461
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:37,666
One of them is this.

462
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:42,626
The more you care about it,

463
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,386
the worse it'll hurt you.

464
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:50,426
Mr. Xu worries

465
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:51,545
that you might get hurt?

466
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,186
I think what happened to my elder sister

467
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:56,866
left a great impact on him.

468
00:20:57,545 --> 00:20:58,866
Do you have an elder sister?

469
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,345
This is my first time

470
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:01,146
talking about it.

471
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,986
I had an elder sister.

472
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:05,626
You had?

473
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:10,146
I had an elder sister,
named Xu Liangliang.

474
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:11,785
According to my mom,

475
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,866
she looked just like her,

476
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,866
and was way prettier than I am.

477
00:21:16,265 --> 00:21:17,545
I won't deny that.

478
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,706
I saw her photos

479
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,105
and she was pretty cute.

480
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:23,626
She had a pair of big eyes.

481
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:25,065
She was two years old

482
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,585
when this happened.

483
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:27,866
One day, she was left playing alone

484
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:28,745
in the room.

485
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:31,146
While she was crawling around,

486
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:32,345
she hit the closet.

487
00:21:32,986 --> 00:21:34,105
The closet toppled over

488
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:36,866
and she was trapped underneath.

489
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:41,105
Since then,

490
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:43,386
my dad never trusted

491
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:44,585
furniture in the market.

492
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:46,265
He thinks

493
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:48,065
those are what killed her daughter.

494
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:50,785
After I was born,

495
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:53,146
my dad started learning
how to make furniture.

496
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,505
The furniture he made
was huge and heavy,

497
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,025
but very sturdy.

498
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,065
It was so sturdy

499
00:21:59,265 --> 00:21:59,986
that we could fix it on the wall.

500
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,426
He thought

501
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:04,745
that was the only way

502
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:06,265
to steer clear of danger.

503
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:09,626
I think one of the reasons

504
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:12,186
why our place looks so ugly

505
00:22:12,585 --> 00:22:13,505
is because of

506
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:15,466
how much my dad loves me.

507
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,745
I didn't know

508
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,226
your family went through this.

509
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:27,946
Our family

510
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,466
has secrets too.

511
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:32,146
But don't worry.

512
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:34,186
My parents survived that.

513
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,946
We're used to
carrying the story with us.

514
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,025
All in all,

515
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:43,626
your dad isn't only worried

516
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:44,626
about you getting hurt physically,

517
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:45,986
he doesn't want you

518
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:46,745
to be hurt mentally too.

519
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:48,585
That was why he was so firm

520
00:22:48,585 --> 00:22:49,785
about not letting you study arts.

521
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:54,946
You have amazing parents.

522
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:08,505
God,

523
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:10,946
I hope that I can get at least 100 points
for every subject.

524
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:12,626
Just 100 points will do.

525
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:25,226
I saw

526
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:26,466
you and Kang Jiawei playing this.

527
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:27,666
How does it work?

528
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,545
When you draw a Queen or a Seven,

529
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:33,305
it means

530
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:34,265
that you'll score well
in the coming exam.

531
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:37,386
Why the Queen and the Seven?

532
00:23:38,545 --> 00:23:39,345
7th of December

533
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,386
is my birthday.

534
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,146
It's my lucky number.

535
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,065
Oh, yes.

536
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:43,946
I remember that.

537
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:45,466
I know it's your birthday.

538
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,105
Let's shuffle.

539
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:06,065
Oh, no.

540
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:09,505
But this is an A.

541
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:11,986
It's the Ace.

542
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:18,545
Here.

543
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:20,386
Hand out the results
for the mock exam.

544
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,440
(Grade 12, English Test Paper)

545
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,867
(Grade 12, English Test Paper)

546
00:24:40,866 --> 00:24:41,785
I failed.

547
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,146
Why did I fail?

548
00:24:44,305 --> 00:24:44,825
Let me have a look.

549
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:45,666
No.

550
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:55,986
Stop hiding it.

551
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:58,866
It's just a mock exam.

552
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:00,345
It doesn't prove anything.

553
00:25:01,986 --> 00:25:02,706
Don't worry about it.

554
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:06,866
Guys.

555
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:08,345
Let's discuss the math answers.

556
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,206
(The Advantage of
the Usage of Liquid Oxygen)

557
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:19,505
(Methane Fuel in the Launching of Rockets.)

558
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:20,466
Kang Jiawei.

559
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:22,585
What did you submit?

560
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:25,626
The Advantage of
the Usage of Liquid Oxygen Methane Fuel

561
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:27,745
in the Launching of Rockets.

562
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:29,785
No.

563
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,426
We didn't talk about this
during the holiday.

564
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:33,305
I'm more interested in these topics.

565
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,146
It's not about

566
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:35,785
what you're interested in.

567
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:36,825
Didn't I

568
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:37,825
send you a list of topics

569
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:39,186
before the summer vacation ended?

570
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:40,666
You only had to pick one

571
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:41,265
from the list.

572
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:43,025
I went through the list,

573
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:44,105
but I had no idea

574
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:45,265
which one to pick.

575
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:46,065
Kang Jiawei.

576
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:47,345
You're taking it too seriously.

577
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:48,745
It's a good thing.

578
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:50,785
But if we want to win the contest,

579
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,305
other than taking it seriously,

580
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,505
we need to understand the rules

581
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:56,105
and know what the contest is about.

582
00:25:57,186 --> 00:25:58,105
Are you saying

583
00:25:58,305 --> 00:25:59,146
that I must pick one

584
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:00,186
from the list of topics?

585
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:01,305
Yes.

586
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:03,345
Those are the topics
that have higher chances of winning.

587
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,105
We need to first figure out

588
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:07,426
why are we taking part

589
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:08,585
in this Innovation Competition.

590
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:10,345
We're trying to win the contest,

591
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:12,226
so that we can have privileges

592
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:14,025
when we are taking
the self-enrolment tests

593
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:15,825
of prestigious universities.

594
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:17,626
We studied over and over again

595
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,545
and came up with this list of topics.

596
00:26:19,785 --> 00:26:21,505
These are the jury's favorite topics.

597
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,025
Do you still think

598
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,986
your interest

599
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:26,666
matters?

600
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,265
You're a very smart boy.

601
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:33,065
I'm sure you understand what I meant.

602
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:34,986
I don't need to explain further, right?

603
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:37,466
We're running out of time,

604
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:39,146
so hurry up and write a new thesis.

605
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:44,785
Jingjing.

606
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:46,545
Look at this.

607
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:47,745
The fifth multiple-choice question,

608
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:49,345
and the second and the third

609
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:50,386
major questions.

610
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:51,505
You calculated them wrongly.

611
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:52,785
If you've scored these three questions,

612
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:53,745
you would've passed.

613
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:55,906
Please stop talking.

614
00:26:58,706 --> 00:26:59,986
I'm just trying to comfort you.

615
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:01,706
You were just careless.

616
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:03,186
Strictly speaking,

617
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,025
you answered
these three questions correctly.

618
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:08,025
The more you say, the worse I feel.

619
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:20,025
Why not...

620
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:23,866
Why not do it again?

621
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:27,105
The tuition classes.

622
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:28,666
Let's meet at the milk tea shop

623
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,226
after school every day.

624
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,065
I'll help you with your revision.

625
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:34,666
Really?

626
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,466
Will I disturb

627
00:27:40,186 --> 00:27:41,305
your advanced learning?

628
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:44,585
Advanced learning?

629
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:46,226
I'm supposed

630
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:47,105
to do revision too anyway.

631
00:27:48,265 --> 00:27:48,866
Sure.

632
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,265
Let me thank you in advance.

633
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:51,105
What about this?

634
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:52,146
You'll get

635
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:54,946
a lifetime supply

636
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:56,186
of free Matcha Red Bean Milk Tea.

637
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:56,666
How does that sound?

638
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:57,265
Sure.

639
00:27:57,585 --> 00:27:58,505
Let's call it a deal.

640
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:00,706
By the way,

641
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:04,305
I can't take your books for free.

642
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:05,105
This

643
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:06,545
is the Tencent Video VIP Member Card.

644
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:07,946
Then, you'll get to

645
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,025
watch the FBI online.

646
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:10,745
It's of Blu-ray quality
and has no advertisement.

647
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:12,706
Thank you.

648
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:13,345
How do you know

649
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:14,265
that I like that show?

650
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:17,545
I was the writer

651
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:19,265
of the stalker notebook.

652
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:20,386
I know criminals' mind

653
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:21,505
the best.

654
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:25,626
You're so adorable.

655
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:33,745
I bought

656
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,785
a year's worth of membership for you.

657
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:36,666
It's about the same price

658
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:37,585
as the books you bought.

659
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,706
I didn't take advantage of you.

660
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:41,345
Don't worry.

661
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:42,946
I'm more than willing for you
to take advantage of me.

662
00:28:43,946 --> 00:28:44,706
I need to use the washroom.

663
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:45,785
I'm coming too.

664
00:28:45,946 --> 00:28:46,585
No.

665
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:48,906
You can hold it for a while.

666
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,538
(Technology Innovative Competition)

667
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,480
(Prevention and Control of Pollution
Caused by Rural Industry)

668
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:16,386
(Thank you so much)

669
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:17,626
(for your coming-of-age gift.)

670
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:18,706
A gift?

671
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:20,906
Why didn't I get a gift from her?

672
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:22,866
Xu Jingjing.

673
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,466
Why didn't you get me any gift?

674
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:26,186
I can't do that.

675
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:28,226
It's as if I'm asking for it.

676
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:29,706
It would be meaningless

677
00:29:30,265 --> 00:29:31,105
if I have to ask for it.

678
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:30,545
Wake up.

679
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:31,585
Get out your English paper.

680
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:34,386
Now?

681
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:36,585
I have something to do after school.

682
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:37,785
I can't go to the milk tea shop.

683
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:39,305
Let me check it for you now.

684
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:41,146
Where are you going?

685
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,146
I'm going to the hospital.

686
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,706
I need to do a preoperative checkup.

687
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,146
Are you having your eye surgery today?

688
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:48,946
No.

689
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:49,906
It's just a checkup.

690
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:51,226
The doctor will do

691
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:52,226
the surgical planning.

692
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,666
Are you going alone?

693
00:30:58,305 --> 00:30:58,986
Do you want me to come with you?

694
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:01,426
Will you?

695
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:02,585
Of course.

696
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:03,545
I'm free this evening.

697
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:05,906
Sure.

698
00:31:06,226 --> 00:31:07,226
Let's get started.

699
00:31:09,906 --> 00:31:10,585
This one...

700
00:31:54,986 --> 00:31:55,666
Xu Jingjing.

701
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,785
Kang Jiawei.

702
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:00,466
Long time no see.

703
00:32:00,745 --> 00:32:01,745
It's not that long.

704
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:02,986
It's only been a day.

705
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:03,986
It felt like

706
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:04,785
a long time to me.

707
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,025
Let's go home together.

708
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:07,466
I've something to tell you.

709
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:08,545
What is it about?

710
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:09,226
But today...

711
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:12,105
You're here.

712
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:16,186
Are you looking for Xu Jingjing?

713
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:16,825
No.

714
00:32:17,585 --> 00:32:19,025
Why would I be looking for her?

715
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:19,825
You can go ahead.

716
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:20,585
I'll get going.

717
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:25,146
Let's go.

Aren't you scared?

721
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,105
(Quiet)
A little.

722
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:49,505
But I have to do this

723
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:50,545
if I want to apply
for Public Security University.

724
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,146
Does your mom know

725
00:32:53,345 --> 00:32:54,146
about the surgery?

726
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:55,666
I haven't told her yet.

727
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:57,386
She'll find out that I'm applying

728
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:58,186
for Public Security University
if I tell her about this.

729
00:32:58,545 --> 00:32:59,505
She definitely won't agree to it.

730
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:00,986
If you think so,

731
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:02,585
why don't you let Dapeng's dad
talk to her?

732
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:04,105
She won't agree to it
no matter who talks to her.

733
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:05,986
I don't think so.

734
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:07,745
After what happened to my dad,

735
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:08,585
I realize

736
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,105
that our parents will eventually respect

737
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:10,825
our decisions.

738
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:11,825
Because

739
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:12,666
it's our lives.

740
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,585
We have the right
to decide for ourselves.

741
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:16,866
I hope so.

742
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:17,906
It's true.

743
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:19,666
Kang Jiawei told me this before.

744
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,146
When you wish

745
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:22,706
for something a lot,

746
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:23,825
the entire universe

747
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:24,906
will help you achieve it.

748
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:26,706
Nothing can stand in your way.

749
00:33:32,545 --> 00:33:33,345
Xu Jingjing.

750
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:35,706
What I want even more now

751
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:36,866
is your answer.

752
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:40,305
My answer?

753
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:42,906
The question I asked you
when we were on the rooftop.

754
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,146
Have you thought about it?

755
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:47,825
Will you apply
for the university in Beijing?

756
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:56,065
She's done. It must be your turn now.

757
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:57,105
Get in there now.

758
00:33:58,345 --> 00:33:59,265
You haven't answered my question.

759
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,866
Go and get your eyes checked first.

760
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,065
Go. Hurry up.

I saw your latest update.

767
00:34:56,426 --> 00:34:57,105
I'm so happy for you.

768
00:34:58,266 --> 00:34:59,386
Thanks to you and Xu Jingjing.

769
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:01,625
I'm ready to start over.

770
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:05,386
By the way, Ms. Tian wants to know

771
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:06,306
when are you

772
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:07,705
going to submit your new thesis.

773
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:11,466
Can I tell you the truth?

774
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:12,266
Of course.

775
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:13,585
We only say the truth here.

776
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:15,266
I've already submitted it
to the official website.

777
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:17,346
I submitted the one I did.

778
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:19,986
Does Ms. Tian know about this?

779
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:23,346
I'm planning to inform her tomorrow.

780
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,466
If she finds out

781
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,585
that you didn't pick one
from the list of topics she gave you...

782
00:35:27,906 --> 00:35:29,105
She'll definitely be mad at me.

783
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:31,306
It'll be awkward

784
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:32,986
when I see her in classes next time.

785
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,705
To be honest,

786
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:37,625
I'm still not very used to

787
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:38,986
Ms. Tian's teaching approach.

788
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:40,545
I think...

789
00:35:40,786 --> 00:35:42,225
I think you should join the art class.

790
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:44,025
You should go to
the advanced arts stream.

791
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:47,746
I don't think so...

792
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:48,466
Unless

793
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:49,466
there's a major you really want to do

794
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:50,466
which only takes science students.

795
00:35:50,906 --> 00:35:52,585
Otherwise, with your intelligence,

796
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:54,105
you'll do well everywhere you go.

797
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,185
I've considered that as well.

798
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:58,306
From what I observed,

799
00:35:58,786 --> 00:35:59,906
you're checking out the art class

800
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:01,306
at least 300 times a day.

801
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:02,866
You're exaggerating it.

802
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:04,145
I was just having a sore neck.

803
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:05,545
I wanted to stretch it.

804
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:07,386
You sound guilty.

805
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,426
You were obviously checking her out.

806
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:11,665
I didn't.

807
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:15,145
I've got to go.

808
00:36:16,346 --> 00:36:17,185
Kang Jiawei.

809
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:24,145
Do you know

810
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:25,746
why I haven't removed this account?

811
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:28,986
When we were having farming classes,

812
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:30,266
I found out

813
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:31,665
that you were Mayonnaise with Rice.

814
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,786
I was both happy and scared.

815
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:37,065
I worried

816
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,946
that no one would like the real me.

817
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,786
I worried that you wouldn't like me.

818
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:45,625
I...

819
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:46,306
You don't have to say anything.

820
00:36:46,986 --> 00:36:48,145
I've long found out

821
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:50,145
that the person you truly liked

822
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:52,705
was Give-up Virtuoso,

823
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:55,505
not me.

824
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:16,705
It's still not too late now,

825
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:18,625
so don't do anything
you'll regret later.

826
00:37:26,306 --> 00:37:26,906
By the way,

827
00:37:28,025 --> 00:37:28,705
let's

828
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:31,585
not talk here

829
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:32,786
again.

830
00:37:33,906 --> 00:37:34,746
Let this place

831
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:44,585
live in our memory.

832
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:53,585
Goodbye,

833
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,346
Mayonnaise with Rice.

834
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:24,025
It's normal

835
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:24,866
that your vision is blurry now.

836
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:26,705
That happens
when your pupils are dilated.

837
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:27,826
I got it.

838
00:38:28,346 --> 00:38:28,866
Thanks, doctor.

839
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:29,705
Thanks, doctor.

(Ophthalmology Clinic)
You can't see now, huh?

841
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:36,585
It's not that bad.

842
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:37,986
It's just a little blurry.

843
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:38,986
What did the doctor say?

844
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:39,946
Can they proceed with the surgery?

845
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:41,505
All is good.

846
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:42,746
Have you saved enough money?

847
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:44,906
I need to do the math when I get home.

848
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:45,826
Fortunately,

849
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:47,025
there's also a cheaper option.

850
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:48,065
A cheaper option?

851
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:49,665
Is it trustworthy?

852
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:51,065
What if you lose your sight?

853
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:52,505
I need you

854
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,746
to help me with my revision.

855
00:38:58,225 --> 00:38:59,266
If I really lose my sight,

856
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,705
you'll be my eyes.

all those

00:39:10,185 --> 00:39:11,185
cheesy lines?

861
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:15,065
I learned it from Dapeng.

862
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:17,426
I cringe at them too.

863
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:19,025
Why don't you learn
something more useful from him?

864
00:39:19,346 --> 00:39:20,145
Let's go.

865
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:22,866
Xu Jingjing.

866
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,705
Did you forget that I can't see?

867
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:31,705
Sorry, I forgot. Let's go.

868
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:36,906
Thank you.

869
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:37,826
You're welcome.

870
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,545
Gao, you're back.

871
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:57,466
You're back.

872
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:58,346
Dapeng.

873
00:39:58,665 --> 00:39:59,266
Give your dad a call

874
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:00,266
and ask him when will he be home.

875
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:01,145
It's almost dinner time.

876
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:02,025
It's fine.

877
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,065
We don't have to wait for him.

878
00:40:03,346 --> 00:40:03,946
We can eat on our own.

879
00:40:04,386 --> 00:40:04,866
Gao Zhan.

880
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:06,826
It seems like they've sent me a reply
from England.

881
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:07,665
Can you check it for me?

882
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:08,665
Sure, mom.

883
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:10,065
Get ready for dinner after that.

884
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:17,545
Gao.

885
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:19,105
How did

886
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:20,346
your eye checkup go?

887
00:40:20,746 --> 00:40:21,306
I told mom that you were home late

888
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:22,746
because you were helping our teacher

889
00:40:22,986 --> 00:40:23,786
with the test papers.

890
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:24,866
Can you help me

891
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:25,986
read this?

892
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:27,266
I can't see clearly.

893
00:40:27,585 --> 00:40:28,625
Me?

894
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:30,105
It's in English.

895
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:31,466
Just help me.

896
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:34,665
Hi.

897
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:36,306
Hi.

898
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:37,426
Enough of "hi".

899
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,545
Keep reading.

900
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:44,266
I'm so glad to accept your...

901
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:45,346
What accent is that?

902
00:40:45,386 --> 00:40:46,145
How should I read it then?

903
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:47,705
I...

904
00:40:48,386 --> 00:40:49,386
Whatever. Continue.

905
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,505
Accept your mail...

906
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:54,866
Can you check for me

907
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:56,705
if they mentioned the word "copyright"?

908
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,386
Right here.

909
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,426
Copyright is not yet...

910
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:01,346
Can you check for me

911
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:02,306
if they mentioned this?

912
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:04,826
Willing to provide a sample checklist.

913
00:41:05,145 --> 00:41:05,625
Yes.

914
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:06,545
Right here.

915
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:08,266
See if they mentioned

916
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:09,545
the word "contract".

917
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:11,466
Con... What is it?

918
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:13,906
The word "contract".

919
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:15,906
How do you spell it?

920
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:16,906
I...

921
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:18,906
C. O. N. T. R. A. C. T.

922
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:20,466
Yes. Right here.

923
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:21,665
Dapeng.

924
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:22,665
Gao Zhan.

925
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:23,786
Dinner is ready.

926
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:25,625
What did they say?

927
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,225
They say they haven't sold
the copyright yet.

928
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:29,826
However, they can send us
the sample first.

929
00:41:30,145 --> 00:41:30,665
If everything is all right,

930
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:31,986
we'll be able to finalize the contract.

931
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:33,625
Sure.

932
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:34,826
The dinner is ready.
Let's eat while it's hot.

933
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:35,585
Let's go.

934
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,585
Sure.

935
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:39,025
Wait, Gao.

936
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:40,665
You managed to grasp

937
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:41,386
the entire e-mail

938
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,665
by those few sentences.

939
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,145
I always read e-mails
from foreign publishers

940
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:45,585
on my mom's behalf.

941
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:47,065
There are the keywords.

942
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:47,986
Impressive.

943
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:49,266
I have nothing

944
00:41:49,545 --> 00:41:50,466
but respect for you.

945
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:51,105
Impressive.

946
00:41:51,346 --> 00:41:52,266
Enough.

947
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:53,625
Stop flattering me.

948
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:55,065
But

949
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:57,266
your eyes...

950
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:58,705
When is it going to get better?

951
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,065
The doctor said
it'd recover in a few hours.

952
00:42:01,545 --> 00:42:02,386
Let's go and have dinner.

953
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:20,346
Wake up, Xu Jing jing.

954
00:42:21,386 --> 00:42:22,585
Just one minute more.

955
00:42:23,306 --> 00:42:23,866
No.

956
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,625
30 seconds.

957
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:30,746
It's almost noon.

958
00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:38,065
Did you stay up all night again
yesterday?

959
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:42,746
Wait. Kang Jiawei.

960
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:44,585
Why are you here?

961
00:42:46,386 --> 00:42:47,585
I have good news for you.

962
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:49,145
Hey.

963
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:51,266
Excuse me,

964
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:52,346
but this is my seat.

965
00:43:14,786 --> 00:43:15,505
Kang Jiawei?

966
00:43:15,906 --> 00:43:16,545
Are you blind?

967
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:18,786
Why are you here
at advanced arts stream?

968
00:43:21,906 --> 00:43:22,866
Are you looking for Xu Jingjing?

969
00:43:23,665 --> 00:43:25,585
Do I need a reason to be here?

970
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,065
Let's talk outside, then.

971
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:27,866
It's fine.

972
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:29,386
You're all here.

973
00:43:30,386 --> 00:43:30,946
Guys.

974
00:43:31,346 --> 00:43:32,185
I have an announcement.

975
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:33,306
Starting today,

976
00:43:33,665 --> 00:43:34,705
Kang Jiawei

977
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,065
will be joining
the advanced arts stream.

978
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:36,986
Let's welcome him.
