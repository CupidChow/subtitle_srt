What... What did you say?

18
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,126
I can't hear you.

19
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:53,326
Shut up!

20
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:55,445
Shut up! I can't hear him.

21
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,126
I can't hear you.

22
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:09,965
I can't hear you.

(Madam Wang Jiaren)

00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:35,486
Hey. Mom.

26
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:36,926
Are you still sleeping?

27
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:39,965
No. I'm making breakfast now.

28
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:40,926
Liar.

29
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:42,685
I could tell that you just woke up
by listening to your voice.

30
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:43,405
Exactly.

31
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,206
Anything else?

32
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:46,206
Of course.

33
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:47,525
I'm here to wake you up.

34
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:48,805
If it wasn't for me,
would you even wake up by now?

35
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:50,645
I told you the alarm clock
would wake me up.

36
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,125
I didn't need you to wake me up.

37
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,565
You have to
take your breakfast, all right?

38
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,166
You can't go to work
with an empty stomach.

39
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:55,965
That's right.

40
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,046
Fine. I got it.

41
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:58,766
Wait a minute.

42
00:02:58,766 --> 00:02:59,446
Your dad wants to talk to you.

43
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:00,326
Mom.

44

I'm running late.

45
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:04,166
Fine. I've got to go.

46
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:06,006
Don't wake me up tomorrow!

47
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:07,645
Hey?

48
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:38,805
Where's my computer?

49
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:46,685
Hey.

50
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:47,565
I would like to make a police report.

51
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:53,886
Don't be scared.

52
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:55,006
Take your time
and tell us what happened.

53
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:57,446
I'm not scared.

54
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:58,726
I'm just angry.

55
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:00,286
I spent half a month working on this,

56
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,125
and now all my effort is gone.

00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:08,046
Are you Xu Jingjing?

59
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:10,365
Are you Xu Jingjing too?

60
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:11,805
I'm not.

61
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,845
Do you work at a design studio?

62
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:17,685
Are you a designer?

63
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:19,205
I'm not.

64
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:20,565
I'm just an assistant designer.

65
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,646
Did you rent this place?

66
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:26,805
I live quite far from the office,

67
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,086
so I rented a unit

68
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,486
near my workplace.

69
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,205
Can you tell me

70
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:32,685
what did you lose?

71
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:33,646
Of course.

72
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:36,205
My tablet

73
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:37,606
and my computer.

74
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:38,606
I won't be able to work

75
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:39,565
without these two items.

76
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:40,606
Also...

77
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,166
My bag too.

78
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:44,046
It's a designer bag.

79
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:45,805
It's very precious

80
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:46,805
for me.

81
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:51,966
Okay. I got it.

82
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:53,286
We'll inform you right away

83
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,526
if we find anything.

84
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:55,846
Thank you so much.

85
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:57,046
Don't worry.

86
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:24,966
Can I have a pancake?

87
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:26,445
Extra crispy, with sausage and egg.

88
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:27,406
Sure.

89
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:29,885
Madam, you haven't changed a bit.

90
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,125
You still look as young as before.

91
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:33,846
And you are...

92
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,245
I was a student of Yuming.

93
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,685
Yuming's student? Have a seat.

94
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,005
Let me give you an extra egg.

95
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,125
Thanks, Madam.

96
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,125
Can I copy your answers, please?

97
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:47,606
You have nothing to lose.

98
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:48,606
I just don't get it.

99
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:49,445
Why can't you

100
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:50,365
do your own homework?

101
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:52,646
I wouldn't need to copy yours
if I know how to do it.

102
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:53,646
I can teach you.

103
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:54,726
I just don't understand any of them.

104
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,646
If so, why do you even
bother coming to school?

105
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:58,286
Kang Jiawei!

106
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,320
(Mom)

107
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:36,245
Hey. Mom.

108
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,005
I arrived early. I'm eating now.

109
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:41,606
I'll meet up

110
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:42,565
with the designer later.

111
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:44,245
We'll talk about
the makeover of the house.

112
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:50,445
Good morning.

113
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:51,445
Good morning.

114
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:55,885
Sorry, Mr. Wei.

115
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:57,005
I'm here.

116
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:57,966
Jingjing, have a seat.

117
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:00,205
How's it going?

118
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:01,365
It's fine.

119
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:02,565
I'm just really mad.

120
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:03,765
If I ever

121
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:04,486
run into the thief,

122
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:05,486
I'll definitely make him pay for it.

123
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:06,646
Stop talking big.

124
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:07,526
You're a young lady,

125
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:08,926
so stop acting tough.

126
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:10,445
Most importantly,

127
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,125
I lost

128
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:13,846
my tablet and computer.

129
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:16,966
You can borrow mine.

130
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,406
Buy a new one later in the afternoon,

131
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:20,526
and submit the claim to me later.

132
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,726
You're being too nice.

133
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:24,646
All right. Don't get too touched.

134
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:25,646
Get ready in the meeting room now.

135
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:26,486
Our client will arrive soon.

136
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:27,166
Sure.

137
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:32,606
Jingjing.

138
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:34,926
It's been a while
since you started working with me.

139
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:35,885
I want to let you try

140
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,046
handling this project on your own.

141
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,685
Really, Mr. Wei?

142
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:41,685
Am I going to be
a full-fledged designer soon?

143
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:42,445
You should understand

144
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:43,565
the project first.

145
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,046
The previous owner of this place

146
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:46,526
was a designer too.

147
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:47,726
He left us with some suggestions.

148
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,005
Our client hopes

149
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:50,365
that we can do our best

150
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:51,445
to reserve these ideas.

151
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:53,646
It won't be fun if I don't get
to use my original design.

152
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,046
Mr. Kang, you're here.

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,480
(Meeting Room)

154
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,205
Hello.

155
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:07,445
Hi.

156
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:08,205
You're Mr. Wei, right?

157
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:08,805
Yes.

158
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:09,846
We spoke on the phone before.

159
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:17,526
Jingjing.

160
00:08:17,885 --> 00:08:18,486
Jingjing.

161
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,365
Come here.

162
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:23,166
I spoke to you

163
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:24,125
about her before.

164
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:24,765
The youngest designer

165
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:25,486
in our office.

166
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:26,245
Xu Jingjing.

167
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:27,286
She's very talented.

168
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:30,166
Hello.

169
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:31,765
I've heard a lot about you.

170
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:40,485
Excuse me.

171
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:45,845
Sorry about that.

172
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,205
Wake up, Xu Jingjing.

173
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:53,286
Wake up!

174
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:55,565
Why are you still dreaming?

175
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:00,965
It's not a dream.

176
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:08,965
Xu Jingjing.

177
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:11,805
Look at you.

178
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,366
What are you wearing?

179
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,085
Why do you look like
an elementary school student?

180
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,445
Also,

181
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,046
why didn't you wash your hair?

182
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,166
Wait a minute.

183
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,766
Why do you care

184
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:34,926
how you appear to him?

185
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:35,965
What's so special about him?

186
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:36,926
He's just another client, right?

187
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:38,646
Just like any other client.

188
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:44,965
Amy.

189
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:47,085
Do you have eyebrow pencils, mascara,

190
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,886
lipstick, and foundation

191
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,246
in your bag?

192
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,286
I do. What's wrong?

193
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:53,366
That's great.

194
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:01,805
Mr. Kang.

195
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:02,766
Sorry.

196
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:04,886
Xu was facing some issues at home today.

197
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:06,805
I guess she has gone home
to settle the issue.

198
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,166
Did something happen?

199
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:09,766
What happened? Is it bad?

200
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:10,605
It's quite bad.

201
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:12,286
Her place was broken into.

202
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:13,246
Sorry.

203
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:14,046
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

204
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,006
Let's proceed.

205
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,406
We were waiting for you.

206
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:19,926
Mr. Kang.

207
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:21,685
I have gone through

208
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:22,526
all the basic information
regarding your project.

209
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:23,965
I heard

210
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:24,646
that you had some special requests too.

211
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:25,565
Your house was broken into?

212
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:27,246
Is it bad?

213
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:28,805
Why are you living alone now?

214
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:29,565
Where do you live?

215
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:30,685
Why is the security so bad?

216
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:31,845
These are my personal matters.

217
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:32,886
We're now talking about

218
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:33,725
the renovation of your place.

219
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:34,926
Answer me now.

220
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,006
I refuse to.

221
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:37,805
Jingjing.

222
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:39,366
Watch your words.

223
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:40,445
Mr. Kang is our client.

224
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:41,406
Xu Jingjing.

225
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:43,445
I'm just concerned.

226
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:44,406
I worry about you. Get it?

227
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:45,126
I don't need you to worry about me.

228
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:45,766
I didn't need it,

229
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:46,766
and I won't need it now too.

230
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:54,286
Excuse me.

231
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:55,605
Are you friends?

232
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:56,725
- Yes.
- No.

233
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:00,565
Sorry, Mr. Wei.

234
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:02,805
It seems like

235
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:04,166
Mr. Kang is not here for business.

236
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:05,286
Perhaps you can
continue with the discussion.

237
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:06,805
I'll get back to work.

238
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,820
(Gao Zhan)

239
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:23,205
What's happening?

240
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:25,725
Hi. Gao Zhan.

241
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:28,366
Dad.

242
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:32,965
I'm home.

243
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:39,965
Don't worry.

244
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:40,805
I'm not running away from my mom.

245
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:45,766
We've been quite amicable
with each other

246
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,526
over the past few years.

247
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,845
I've been able to maintain my weight.

248
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:58,965
I'm not too chubby or too thin.

249
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:01,886
I'm also 0.5cm taller than before.

250
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:06,766
Career-wise...

251
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:09,725
I'm planning to start a business
back in our home country.

252
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,205
I'm going to venture
into the education industry.

253
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:14,965
I guess that's what I'm good at.

254
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,046
As for the rest...

255
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:30,406
As for the rest,

256
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:34,126
things aren't going too well.

257
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,845
Qi is so good-looking.

258
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:54,006
That was hilarious.

259
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:54,845
Let's rewind

260
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,366
and play it again.

261
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:02,646
It's been so many years

262
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,166
and we still laugh at stupid things.

263
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:05,845
It's been so many years,

264
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:07,246
and

265
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:08,886
I still only have eyes for Qi.

266
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,166
You're a director now.

267
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:11,286
Back then, you were a fan.

268
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:12,445
Now, you're the person
who makes them the stars.

269
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,085
You held an art exhibition too.

270
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,565
And it's soon going to be

271
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:17,926
you and Dapeng's fourth anniversary.

272
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:19,725
I'll ditch him sooner or later.

273
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,565
He plays game day and night.

274
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:23,246
Let's play it again.

275
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:25,805
I met Kang Jiawei.

276
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:32,646
I said...

277
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,445
Kang Jiawei is back.

278
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,006
He visited my office today

279
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,641
and intended to hire me as his designer.

280
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,840
He wants me to
do a makeover for his room.

281
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,041
Is he handsome now?

282
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,521
He looks decent.

283
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,600
Did his weight rebound?

284
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:43,440
No.

285
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,401
Does he have a girlfriend now?

286
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,200
That's none of my business.

287
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,641
Xu Jingjing.

288
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Tell you what.

289
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:50,440
I'm sure, this time,

290
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,361
he came back for you.

291
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:54,560
Are you really not going

292
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,001
to give him another chance?

293
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,800
He blocked me.

294
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,161
How am I supposed
to give him another chance?

295
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Perhaps

296
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,041
he accidentally pressed the button.

297
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:03,361
Yes.

298
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,600
He probably had low blood sugar

299
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
and his fingers were shivering.

300
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,960
It's been four years.

301
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:08,800
Can you come up

302
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,161
with a better excuse?

303
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,161
It has been four years.

304
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,401
We've been staying by your side
for the past four years

305
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:14,720
as you repeatedly complained about him.

306
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:15,921
If you think

307
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:16,840
you're still angry at him,

308
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:18,200
why don't you take the project

309
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,080
as a chance to torture him?

310
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:21,401
Make him suffer.

311
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,881
If I agree to work on this project,

312
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,320
he'll be my client.

313
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,121
If I am to torture him,

314
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:26,960
I guess

315
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,440
I'll be the one suffering eventually.

316
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,600
Jingjing.

317
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,800
Do you remember the novel
Miss Chen wrote

318
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,041
two years ago?

319
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,001
I do.

320
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,241
My Breakthrough Youth.

321
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,001
Many people commented,

322
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,001
saying that it had a terrible ending.

323
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,921
It was because Miss Chen

324
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
never bothered explaining in the novel,

325
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,881
whether Lin Youmei and Chen Donglin

326
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:46,080
ended up together.

327
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,080
What does the terrible ending
have anything to do with me?

328
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,080
Miss Chen mentioned this

329
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,680
during the previous gathering.

330
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,080
You are Lin Youmei,

331
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,761
and Kang Jiawei is Chen Donglin.

332
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm done.

333
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:57,761
I'm going to bed.

334
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,560
I have to work tomorrow.

335
00:15:58,761 --> 00:15:59,521
You should go to bed earlier too.

336
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,680
Keep it down.

337
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,440
Stop running away

338
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,401
from it.

339
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,281
I'm not running away from it.

340
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
I simply can't take him

341
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,161
as a regular client.

342
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,161
I can't pretend

343
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,881
that nothing happened

344
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:11,521
between us,

345
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,960
and interact with him professionally.

346
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,200
I'm asked

347
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,960
to renovate his dad's place.

348
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,921
Do you think I can take this?

349
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:31,320
Mr. Kang.

350
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,641
This is

351
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
our current proposal

352
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,001
for the makeover of your place.

353
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,600
Amy.

354
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,440
Mr. Kang, here's my proposal.

355
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,600
Sorry. I have a question.

356
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,361
Where is Xu Jingjing?

357
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,440
She's no longer in charge

358
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:43,200
of this project.

359
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,401
Amy is

360
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:45,800
a very young and promising designer too.

361
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:48,041
Can I liaise with Xu Jingjing

362
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,041
directly?

363
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,560
I'm afraid that
she's at the police station now.

364
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,440
It's about

365
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,401
the break-in at her place.

366
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:57,361
Excuse me, Mr. Wei.

367
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:58,641
Sorry, Miss Amy.

368
00:16:59,241 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm not trying

369
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,680
to make things difficult for you.

370
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:02,001
However,

371
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,921
if Xu Jingjing is not handling

372
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:03,761
this project,

373
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:05,680
I think we shall end it here.

374
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:18,680
Xu Jingjing!

375
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,680
Why did you turn down

376
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:23,361
the project?

377
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,361
Don't worry, sir.

378
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:25,601
Amy is a very smart

379
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:26,921
and professional designer too.

380
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,960
Sir?

381
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,440
Did you just refer to me as "sir"?

382
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,200
You're our client, sir.

383
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:31,401
It's just an honorific.

384
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,520
I thought you decided
not to work on the project anymore.

385
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:33,801
Then, I'm no longer your client.

386
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,121
What do you want?

387
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,081
Were you at the police station?

388
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,121
Did they catch the thief?

389
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:40,081
It's none of your business.

390
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,200
Xu Jingjing.

391
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,081
Can you stop

392
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,841
treating me like this?

393
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,760
I have to get to work.

394
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,881
Then, I'll see you
after you get off work.

395
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,720
I don't have anything to say to you.

396
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:47,561
But I do.

397
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:48,881
I have a lot to tell you.

398
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,401
One of those things is the fact
that I owe you an apology.

399
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:53,841
Sorry.

400
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:55,561
I shouldn't have

401
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,321
blocked you.

402
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:57,361
Great.

403
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,680
Are you finished?

404
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:02,200
I know it's hard for you to forgive me.

405
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:02,841
You're wrong.

406
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:04,161
You're forgiven.

407
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,081
In fact, I forgave you a long time ago.

408
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:07,921
I understand.

409
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,321
Because that was
when Mr. Kang just passed away,

410
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:10,801
so you needed a place
to vent your feelings.

411
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:11,680
I understand.

412
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,440
I really do.

413
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:16,601
Xu Jingjing.

414
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:17,361
Mr. Kang.

415
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,321
It has been four years.

416
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,401
I have to carry on with my own life.

417
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:21,881
Goodbye.

418
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:47,000
Almond. Peanuts.

419
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:48,520
Together with hazelnuts.

420
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,361
Toast it together with the oatmeal.

421
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,121
It's good for your brain
and fills your stomach.

422
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,841
It's the best food for exam candidates.

423
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,440
Try it.

424
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:00,720
What do you think?

425
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:07,921
Dad.

426
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,361
What should I do now?

427
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,121
What should I tell Xu Jingjing

428
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,361
to make her forgive me?

429
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,240
Hey.

430
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,081
Welcome.

431
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,921
You really turned out to be a detective.

432
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:49,801
You look even more handsome now.

433
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:53,161
Does being a detective

434
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,280
make me handsome?

435
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,801
You haven't changed a bit.

436
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:58,561
By the way,

437
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,401
why did you ask me out?

438
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,601
Have you met Xu Jingjing yet?

439
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:04,361
I met her just now.

440
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,040
Really?

441
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,601
It seems like

442
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:10,480
you're pretty close.

443
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:11,680
Yes, we are.

444
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:17,881
How close are you?

445
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,200
My girlfriend...

446
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:23,161
She's a policewoman.

447
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:28,000
My girlfriend is a policewoman.

448
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:30,841
Gao.

449
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,641
From where did you pick this trick?

450
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,040
Why did you break your sentences?

451
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,520
Have you heard about
the break-in at her place?

452
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,280
She didn't tell me the details.

453
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:49,760
She lost her computer,

454
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,801
a tablet,

455
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:52,121
and a handbag.

456
00:20:53,361 --> 00:20:53,881
She told me

457
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,280
the bag was really important to her.

458
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,280
She asked me to do my best
to retrieve it.

459
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,401
We informed her

460
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
to collect her belongings today.

461
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,321
We retrieved everything she lost,

462
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:02,841
including the bag,

463
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,520
but she didn't look too pleased either.

464
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,200
Why?

465
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,401
Something on the bag

466
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,601
was missing.

467
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,361
A tablet, a computer, and a bag.

468
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:17,200
They're all here, right?

469
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,881
Where's the dog?

470
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:21,321
Dog?

471
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,401
Which dog?

472
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:24,040
There was a small white dog

473
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:25,361
hanging here.

474
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,881
We didn't see

475
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,720
any dog.

476
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,720
Did it cost you a lot?

477
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:34,760
It's not that valuable,

478
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,081
but can you please

479
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,081
help me find it?

480
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:42,520
The criminal was planning

481
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,680
to sell these items
on an online marketplace.

482
00:21:45,361 --> 00:21:46,641
I suppose he threw away

483
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:48,440
the superfluous accessory.

484
00:21:48,601 --> 00:21:49,960
It's not a superfluous accessory.

485
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,881
You gave her the dog, right?

486
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:55,841
Here.

487
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:57,520
Pick one, and I'll get it for you.

488
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,121
That one.

489
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:01,641
Which one?

490
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:02,921
The dog.

491
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,720
Doggie!

492
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:11,240
I recalled what happened right away

493
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,601
when she mentioned the dog.

494
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,760
Wait.

495
00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:18,960
I don't get it.

496
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,401
If she really cares about me,

497
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,921
why does she keep running away

498
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:25,240
from me?

499
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
Are you really asking me

500
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,841
for relationship advice?

501
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:35,200
The biggest issue

502
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,361
is with you now.

503
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:54,561
Xiaobai.

504
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:56,881
Do you know where Xu Jingjing is
right now?

505
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,480
Jingjing.

506
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,520
You are quite drunk.

507
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm fine.

508
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:08,161
I can keep drinking.

509
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,401
Four years.

510
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,801
It has been four long years.

511
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,480
There are 365 days in a year.

512
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:24,480
Multiply it by four.

513
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:25,841
How many days are there?

514
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:29,720
1600?

515
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:34,200
1460 days.

516
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:36,040
During

517
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,881
these 1460 days,

518
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,760
he could've contacted me

519
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,440
on any of these days.

520
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,321
But he didn't.

521
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,121
Not even once.

522
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,000
How could he do that?

523
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,361
How could he?

524
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:44,641
He's too shameless.

525
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:46,361
He didn't get in touch with you,

526
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:48,121
but neither did you take the initiative.

527
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:49,841
Forget it.

528
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,440
It's making me angry.

529
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:53,361
He was the one who blocked me.

530
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,161
What could I have done?

531
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,401
It'll make me look unashamed

532
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,601
if I beg him to unblock me.

533
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,280
Why would I do that?

534
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,361
Yes. Why would she do that?

535
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,121
It was Kang Jiawei's fault.

536
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,240
I know it was his fault.

537
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:03,401
However,

538
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,801
if none of you is willing

539
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:06,081
to take the first step,

540
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,401
you will be stuck here

541
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,641
forever.

542
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,081
Do you want to be stuck here forever?

543
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,081
Do you still have feelings
for Kang Jiawei?

544
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,801
I...

545
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,240
I want to drink.

I'll get you more beer.

We haven't finished it yet.

549
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:34,240
It won't be enough for you.

550
00:24:34,561 --> 00:24:35,200
I'll use the washroom.

551

Let's keep drinking

555
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,680
until we're all drunk.

556
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,161
Pour me more beer.

557
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,361
Hurry up.

So you still care about me.

When you were collecting
your items at the police station,

565
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,440
you didn't care about the bag.

566
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:13,520
You only cared about the dog.

567
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,480
The dog I gave you.

Gao Zhan...

569
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:23,480
It's okay to lose the dog.

570
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,040

Can you please

574
00:26:58,601 --> 00:26:59,440
give me another chance?

575
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:01,960
Can we start over again?

576
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,480
No.

Kang Jiawei.

578
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,680
Don't you think you have gone too far?

579
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,440
You blocked me four years ago.

00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,200
it's an extremely thoughtful plan.

689
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,921
If you don't have

690
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:36,960
any more questions,

691
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,000
my office will get in touch with you

692
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,121
and sign a renovation agreement
with you.

693
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,520
I have one final question.

694
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:41,680
What is it?

695
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
Can I ask you out for dinner tonight?

696
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm occupied.

697
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,321
Don't you want to know my answer?

698
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:49,401
Don't you want to know

699
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:50,440
why didn't I get in touch with you
over the past four years?

700
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,361
I didn't ask you the question.

701
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:51,921
You did.

702
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,801
When you were drunk a few days ago.

703
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,440
You asked me this.

704
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:54,801
You fell asleep when I was about
to answer your question.

705
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:57,921
I...

706
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,361
I was drunk.

707
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,240
That didn't count.

708
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:01,161
But I want to tell you the answer.

709
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,401
I don't want to hear it.

710
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,921
Ma Xiaodong.

711
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:08,881
Institute of Information,
Science and Technology.

712
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,160
Class 4 from Batch 2012.

713
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,281
You were a freshman
when he was a junior.

714
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
During the orientation night,

715
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,361
with a shabby guitar,

716
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:16,281
he played and sang

717
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:16,881
"Hotel California".

718
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,361
By the way,

719
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,600
he had terrible taste in music.

720
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:20,721
You took a photo with him

721
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,241
and they posted it
on the student portal.

722
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,960
Ma and I?

723
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:24,921
Yes.

724
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:26,080
Tell you what.

725
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,201
He definitely had an agenda.

726
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:28,160
He always targeted

727
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:28,960
newcomers

728
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,401
like you.

729
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:31,600
He only had to be a little friendlier,

730
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,281
and you would fall into his trap.

731
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,040
Do you know that?

732
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,401
He's the president
of the Taekwondo Club.

733
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,881
Other than

734
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:36,640
the club activities,

735
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:37,761
we had never met in private.

736
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,801
Was that why

737
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,881
you cut off our contact?

738
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,480
No, I...

739
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,201
I thought you were seeing another guy

740
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:52,560
when you were in college.

741
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,040
I was scared

742
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:57,120
to approach you.

743
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:00,721
I assumed

744
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:03,681
that you had forgotten about
everything happened in high school.

745
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,681
I wanted to get over them too.

746
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,841
But

747
00:35:06,841 --> 00:35:07,881
it wasn't up to me.

748
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:21,640
Sorry, Xu Jingjing.

749
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,321
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

750
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,520
I went overseas

751
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,841
but never managed to get over us.

752
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,160
Then, I had to take
the college entrance exam.

753
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:36,721
On top of that,
I learned about you and Ma.

754
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:39,520
That was why
I didn't get in touch with you.

755
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:47,960
I know

756
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,480
it sounds

757
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,160
like I made up these excuses.

758
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:52,040
However,

759
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:53,600
I did make terrible decisions
in the past four years.

760
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,000
I can't change the past.

761
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:00,321
What matters now is the presence.

762
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,801
What should I do now?

763
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:07,600
What should we do now?

764
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,480
I need to get back to the office.

765
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,040
I'll see you again.

766
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:50,881
My dear friends.

767
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,520
Are you available this weekend?

768
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,160
Do you want to come to Yuming
for classes?

769
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:49,160
Xu Jingjing.

770
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,640
You're late again.

771
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:56,560
Not bad.

772
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,681
Should I address you

773
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:58,480
as Mr. Xiong now?

774
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,321
Are you Mr. Zhao's successor?

775
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:01,640
Yes.

776
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:03,040
I heard my name.

777
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:05,201
Mr. Zhao!

778
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,201
Jingjing.

779
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:07,480
Mr. Zhang.

780
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:10,120
He's now Principal Zhang.

781
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:11,600
Don't bring it up.

782
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:14,241
Jingjing, what have you been up to?

783
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:15,881
I'm an interior designer now.

784
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,640
That's good.

785
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,881
Mr. Xiong.

786
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,040
Ni Dapeng.

787
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:24,960
That's a very ostentatious outfit.

788
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:27,480
I couldn't stop him.

789
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,401
I need to be ready for the camera.

790
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:30,281
I have to leave a good impression

791
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,160
on the director.

792
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,640
What if one day

793
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:33,960
I gain my popularity overnight?

794
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,640
You

795
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,000
are just a D-list actor.

796
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,040
Let's talk business.

797
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,921
Being the former best point guard
of Yuming,

798
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,921
shouldn't you help the school

799
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,921
with the varsity production?

800
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,681
Of course.

801
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,520
I'll give you a 50% discount.

802
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm very generous, right?

803
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:47,480
He's too stingy.

804
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,321
We'll do it for free.

805
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,401
Yaoyao is the best.

806
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,241
Sure. We'll listen to the boss.

807
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:52,440
Behave. We're at school.

808
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:53,640
Gao Zhan!

809
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:56,281
It's been a while.

810
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,160
You are more handsome than before.

811
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,681
When are you going to make your debut
as a celebrity?

812
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:01,401
Stop mocking me.

813
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,401
I heard that you are now a teacher.

814
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,080
Teach the kids
the right thing, all right?

815
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
I was picked

816
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:08,921
as the best teacher
in Yuming Senior High School

817
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,921
last year.

818
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,160
That's impressive.

819
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:12,761
Xiaobai.

820
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:14,440
You look prettier now.

821
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,520
Xiong Shuai, tell us the truth.

822
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:18,440
Did you have a crush

823
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,960
on Xiaobai when we were in high school?

824
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,761
How did you know that?

825
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:26,321
I'm single now.

826
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:28,841
What a coincidence. Me too.

827
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,401
Let me buy you a meal this weekend.

828
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:31,960
I'll think about it.

829
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,721
- Guys.
- Miss Chen.

830
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:34,361
Miss Chen.

831
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,440
Miss Chen.

832
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,281
I've missed you a lot.

833
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:38,440
Miss Chen.

834
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:39,321
Not bad.

835
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:40,881
It seems like
you're all doing quite well.

836
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,801
You haven't changed a bit.

837
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:43,600
Miss Chen.

838
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,721
You've gotten prettier over the years.

839
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,960
Thanks for coming over

840
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:49,921
and play cameos
in the final scene

841
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,361
for the movie version
of My Breakthrough Youth.

842
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:53,600
I'm moved beyond words.

843
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:55,120
This is

844
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,881
a very important matter

845
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:57,120
to me.

846
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:58,480
The director will brief you

847
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,281
on the rundown

848
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:00,401
after you get in there.

849
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,160
Is that all right?

850
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:02,241
Sure.

851
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,881
Where is the female lead?

852
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,480
We want to meet the female lead.

853
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:06,681
Let me bring you there.

854
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,841
Let's go.

855
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,480
Let's go.

856
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,040
Let's go.

857
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,000
Lin Youmei.

858
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,560
You...

859
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:26,321
Why are you here?

860
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,640
Long time no see.

861
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
My goodness. You're all here.

862
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm going to embarrass myself
in front of the crowd.

863
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:33,801
That's not true.

864
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:35,040
Miss Celebrity.

865
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,080
Please free up your schedule for me

866
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,281
after you're done filming this movie.

867
00:40:37,681 --> 00:40:38,321
I have a few variety shows

868
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:39,480
waiting for you.

869
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,761
Of course. How can I

870
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:41,640
turn down your invitation?

871
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,560
Jingjing.

872
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:45,921
How's your acting skill?

873
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
Is it difficult to play me?

874
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:51,000
Jingjing is an amazing actress.

875
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:51,960
I watched her previous movie

876
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,681
repeatedly.

877
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:53,520
I was moved to tears.

878
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:54,440
But it was a comedy, right?

879
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:55,560
What's the name of the show?

880
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:56,761
My Breakthrough Youth.

881
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,640
Right?

882
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,361
That's right.

883
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,801
Xu Jingjing.

884
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I finally get to

885
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:03,721
imitate you openly.

886
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,281
Chen Donglin.

887
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,761
Do you hate me?

888
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,321
Are you still mad at me?

889
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:15,640
I'm not.

890
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:18,361
If you don't hate me,

891
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,000
why won't you look at me?

892
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,681
Cut!

893
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:28,480
Jingjing.

894
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,600
You looked

895
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,361
too upset just now.

896
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,160
You should let the rage

897
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,201
flow through you

898
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:36,560
because Chen Donglin
just won't understand you.

899
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,721
Later,

900
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,080
try to

901
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:39,801
amplify your anger.

902
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,640
Yes, Director. I got it.

903
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,480
Let me try it again.

904
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,040
All right. Let's do it again.

905
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,040
Scene 97. Roll three. Take four.

906
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,721
Three. Two. One. Start.

907
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:50,801
Chen Donglin!

908
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,440
Do you hate me?

909
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:55,761
Do you not like me anymore?

910
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,841
Sorry. I said the wrong line.

911
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,040
Let us take a break.

912
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,520
Take a break here.

913
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:04,600
Don't go too far.

914
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:05,440
Props team.

915
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:06,440
Remember the box.

916
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:08,241
Jingjing.

917
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,640
Try to evoke the emotion

918
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,681
and process it.

919
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,520
Sure.

920
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:13,080
It's fine.

921
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:14,120
Sorry, Director.

922
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:14,681
All the best.

923
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:20,960
Jingjing.

924
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:22,841
I'm sorry

925
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,160
for wasting your time.

926
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:26,401
Don't worry. We understand.

927
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:27,600
That's just how filming is.

928
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:31,281
I find it very difficult
to act out this scene.

929
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,281
Then...

930
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:34,520
Let me tell you

931
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:36,321
what was on my mind

932
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,480
at that time.

933
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,480
Do you think it can be of help?

934
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,960
Of course.

00:43:05,681 --> 00:43:06,560
I know

939
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,921
that I could never make up

940
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:10,480
for the mistake I did.

941
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,480

Yes.

947
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:45,681
Other than feeling sad,

948
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,040
it's the fear that haunts me.

949
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,120
I'm afraid

950
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,401
that you won't talk to me ever again.

951
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,361
I know I have to carry on with my life.

952
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:57,520
I have other friends too.

953
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,560
I need to focus on my studies too.

00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,480
I want you to listen to it too.

958
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,440
When I see a terrible show,

959
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,960
I want to mock it with you.

960
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,401
When I stumble upon a funny video,

961
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,440
I want to share it with you.

962
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:21,960
Never would I have expected

963
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,881
that after all these years,

964
00:44:26,401 --> 00:44:27,761
you're still the most interesting person

965
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,440
among all my friends.

966
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:32,520
Never would I have expected

967
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:36,361
that even after meeting
so many new friends,

968
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,401
every conversation I have with them

969
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,721
and every meal I eat with them

970
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,640
will still remind me

971
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,281
of you.

972
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,480
Sorry, Xu Jingjing.

973
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:06,600
Sorry.

974
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,480
Do you know

975
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,921
that I never stopped waiting

976
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,361
for your text?

977
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:19,520
But the waiting

978
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:20,881
was so painful.

979
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,201
I didn't know how long more

980
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:26,241
you were going to keep hating me.

981
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:29,080
I never hate you.

982
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,241
I only worried that you wouldn't
be bothered to talk to me.

983
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,120
Are you stupid, Kang Jiawei?

984
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:35,040
Why would I ever ignore you?

985
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:37,160
Why would I ever ignore you?

986
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,281
How is that possible?

987
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,160
Sorry, Xu Jingjing.

988
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:58,881
I won't run away
from my problem anymore.

989
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:01,681
I should have

990
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:02,921
been frank with you.

991
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,520
I should have stood before you

992
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,761
and looked right into your eyes.

993
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:12,560
Even if we were to fight,

994
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:13,520
I should've told you everything

995
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,401
that was on my mind.

996
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,921
Xu Jingjing, I like you.

997
00:46:24,881 --> 00:46:26,281

1000
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:35,560
I never met anyone like you,

1001
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:38,160
and will never find
another person like you in the future.

1002
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,801

Date him.

1008

Date him.

00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:00,881

1016
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:15,080
I think there's something missing

1017
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:16,120
in this scene.

1018
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,080
What's missing?

1019
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:32,040
If your dad wasn't around,

1020
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,801
would you have kissed me?

1021
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,560
Dream on.

1022
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,321
That's my first kiss.

1023
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:37,321
I won't let you have it.

00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,761
That's what I think too.
