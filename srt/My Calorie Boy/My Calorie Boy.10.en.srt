16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,150
Xu Jingjing!

17
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,150
Your mom...

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,200
What about her?

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,840
Um, Xu Jingjing, your mom is here too...

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,630
She comes again?

21
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,510
They're here.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,230
Mr. Zhang,

23
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,960
I admit that my daughter

24
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,320
was not studious,

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,600
and she didn't have

26
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,320
the best grades.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
But I know my child.

28
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,630
At least she is honest.

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,120
If I may put it bluntly...

30
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,160
She has always

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,880
handed those failed test papers to me

32
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,390
to be signed

33
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,510
before this.

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:13,950
Yes.

35
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,760
That's why I said

36
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,320
that she might have

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,630
made some wrong choices

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,160
for Miss Chen...

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,880
Why can't it be
that she worked hard and studied hard

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,280
for Miss Chen?

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,630
We're not ruling out that possibility.

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,950
You don't know

43
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,790
how much effort these kids put in

44
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,230
for this exam.

45
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,350
They proactively set up
tutoring sessions and did revisions.

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,320
I saw them with my very own eyes.

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:35,760
Yes.

48
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,920
I don't deny that.

49
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,320
You can't erase all of their hard work

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,950
because of one video!

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,320
Mrs. Xu,

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,320
we're still investigating this matter.

53
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,350
Please don't get too agitated.

54
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,950
You're slandering my daughter!

55
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,070
How could I remain calm?

56
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,200
Mom!

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,350
You guys have no business here.

58
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,040
Return to your classroom!

59
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,790
Sir,

60
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,510
is there anything

61
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,760
that can't be said in front of them?

62
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,830
We are discussing them right now.

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,760
Why can't they stay and listen?

64
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:04,950
Mom,

65
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,320
go back.

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,350
Don't get involved.

67
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,070
Also,

68
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,200
Liu Wan,

69
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
I've been meaning

70
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,480
to have a word with you.

71
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,040
The kids should know

72
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,920
Miss Chen better

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,670
than we do.

74
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Why are you always

75
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,160
targeting her?

76
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,600
That's unfair.

77
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,070
What do you mean by target?

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
I'm not the one who suggested

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
using the class's average score

80
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,550
to decide if Miss Chen gets to stay.

81
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,510
Principal Shen was the one
who suggested that.

82
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,790
If you had any opinions or thoughts,

83
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,880
why didn't you bring them up
in the parent group?

84
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Isn't it a bit too late

85
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,000
for you to bring this up now?

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,720
Does my opinion matter?

87
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,110
After all,

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,440
you're the boss
of the group, aren't you?

89
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,320
What does

90
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,350
that mean?

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,160
What do you mean, "I'm the boss"?

92
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,550
It's

93
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,110
a majority rule.

94
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,110
With how aggressive you are,

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
who would dare speak up?

96
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,160
Who are you calling aggressive?

97
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,550
You!

98
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,510
In any case, I support Miss Chen.

99
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,440
Wang Jiaren!

100
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,670
You're just here
to pick a fight with me, aren't you?

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,440
I can't be bothered.

102
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm here
to seek justice for my daughter.

103
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,670
I won't stand by

104
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,790
and allow her to be falsely accused!

105
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,280
I did no such thing!

106
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,160
I'll stress this again.

107
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,480
This is reasonable doubt.

108
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,870
There's nothing reasonable about it!

109
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,790
You're obviously

110
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,350
biased against my daughter!

111
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,600
I am not!

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,990
Yes, you are!

113
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,230
I said I was not!

114
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,040
I want to retake the test!

115
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,040
Mr. Zhang,

116
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,430
if you doubt me,

117
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,160
I can take the exam again.

118
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,040
Xu Jingjing,

119
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,080
you don't have to do that.

120
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,280
It's fine, Miss Chen.

121
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,160
I want to do this.

122
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,840
Jingjing...

123
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,040
Mr. Zhang,

124
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,720
you can call me useless,

125
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,550
dumb,

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,670
and slow.

127
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,480
But you can't accuse me of cheating.

128
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,990
You have a valid reason to doubt me.

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,160
I did come to your desk.

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,400
I admit that.

131
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,960
Then you'll invigilate this time.

132
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,190
You'll set the questions
and grade the paper.

133
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,110
I'll use my results

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,110
to prove my innocence.

135
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,920
You said it.

136
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,040
But I have a condition.

137
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,190
Name it.

138
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,040
If my grades went up

139
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,790
and our class
made it into the top three of our year,

140
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,110
Miss Chen gets to stay.

141
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,920
You tell them, Xu!

142
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,750
That's the spirit, Xu!

143
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,160
We support you.

144
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,280
We believe in you.

145
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,350
Is that all right, Mr. Zhang?

146
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,480
I have no problem with that.

147
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,480
Does anyone have anything
to say about that?

148
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,990
Sure.

149
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,520
What about you, Mrs. Xu?

150
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,960
I respect my daughter's decision.

151
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,110
All right.

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,190
Then retake the test tomorrow

153
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,110
after school.

154
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,670
Our class's total score

155
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,960
is 15,088 points.

156
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,640
Our average score

157
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,990
is 419.1.

158
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,720
Class 2's average

159
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,870
is 419.2.

160
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,520
If we want

161
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,430
to surpass their score,

162
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,750
that means

163
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,230
you'll need to score
another seven points,

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,640
either two sub-questions

165
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,750
or one question.

166
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,430
Focus on the question.

167
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,750
That's the important part.

168
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,960
The sub-questions are key.

169
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,840
Especially multiple choice questions.

170
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,840
You can't get any of them wrong.

171
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,080
If you have time left
after you've finished,

172
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,080
check your work again.

173
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,080
You're the hope

174
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,190
of the class.

175
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,430
I'll pray for you.

176
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,040
Jingjing,

177
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,790
you have to do your best.

178
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,040
Miss Chen's fate

179
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,280
is in your hands.

180
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
Stop pressuring her.

181
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,750
Jingjing,

182
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,670
Miss Chen won't blame you

183
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,600
even if you didn't do well.

184
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,720
But Zhang Chang'an

185
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,960
is the one setting the questions.

186
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Who knows if he'll slip in things

187
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,160
that are outside of the syllabus?

188
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,750
Enough.

189
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,080
Xu Jingjing,

190
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,310
don't think about anything tomorrow.

191
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,080
All that stuff about cheating,

192
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,190
Miss Chen, Mr. Zhang,

193
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,040
the class's honour,

194
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,990
none of those is your concern.

195
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,110
You are doing it for yourself.

196
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,790
Just like athletes

197
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
trying to break their own records.

198
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,960
Got it?

199
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,140

Xu Jingjing!

203
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,520
You can do it!

204
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,870
All the best!

205
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,310
Xu,

206
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:48,790
all the best.

207
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
It's up to you.

208
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,310
Jingjing.

209
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,160
You got this.

210
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,190
All of us believe in you.

211
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,080
We'll have a party for you
to celebrate afterwards.

212
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,790
Do your best.

213
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
You can do it!

214
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,190
(Success in exams)
This is for you.

215
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,230
Do your best.

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

217
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,110
You have this in the bag.

218
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,840
All the best.

220
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,160
Xu Jingjing!

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,920
Why are you here?

222
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,280
I'm nervous enough as it is.

223
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
I went to get you a deck of cards.

224
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,920
You can't take the exam
without the ritual.

225
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,920
Come on. Try your luck.

226
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,550
I... I'll pass.

227
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,590
I don't want it to affect my mood.

228
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,550
Come on, give it a shot.

229
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,190
Trust yourself.

230
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:39,920
Hurry.

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,400
This.

232
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,590
Look.

233
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,950
If it isn't Q

234
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,830
or seven,

235
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,790
don't tell me.

236
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,310
It is Q!

237
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,790
What luck!

238
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,360
You're right!

239
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,760
You definitely have it in the bag now.

240
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:02,790
All right.

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,920
Mr. Zhang will be here soon.

242
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,470
Hurry and go inside.

243
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,920
Okay. I'll head inside now.

244
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,550

You guys...

263
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,040
Xu Jingjing,

264
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,360
thank you.

265
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,430
I know you did this

266
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,310
for me.

267
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,710
I wasn't able to protect you.

268
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,120
I let you suffer.

269
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,550
Don't say that.

270
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,590

271
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,790
We can't do without any of us.

272
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,760
Oh, no.

273
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,070
I think I'm going to cry.

274
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,160
Xu Jingjing,

275
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,160
good work.

276
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,640
Jingjing,

277
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,000
you're the best!

278
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,640
But

279
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,160
shouldn't you guys be more worried

280
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,550
about my results?

281
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,240
Don't worry about that.

282
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,830
The fact that you have the courage

283
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
to resit the exam
is already an admirable feat.

284

Xu Jingjing!

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,760
You got 102 points!

293
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,190
102!

294
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,880
A full eight points

295
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,920
higher than your midterm!

296
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,160
Eight marks!

297
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,190
Is this for real?

298
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes!

299
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,920
I heard it from the teachers themselves.

300
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,920
Xu Jingjing!

301
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,920
- Yes! Great!
- This is amazing!

302
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,430
Did no one hear the bell?

303
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,670
What's with all the ruckus?

304
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,790
You did improve.

305
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,760
But with this difficulty,

306
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,310
you should've scored 120.

307
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,310
Everyone, take out your papers.

308
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,590
We'll go through them.

309
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,160
Mr. Zhang,

310
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,590
don't you think

311
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,920
you owe Xu Jingjing an apology?

312
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,550
"I'm sorry.

313
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,430
I was wrong.

314
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,920
I was biased against you

315
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,920
and falsely accused you of cheating."

316
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,160
Shouldn't you say these words

317
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,240
to Xu Jingjing?

318
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,070
Kang Jiawei,

319
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,710
don't think you can talk to me like that

320
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,400
just because your grades are good.

321
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,240
Mr. Zhang,

322
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,710
I'm not saying that

323
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,880
because I have good grades.

324
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,240
I said it

325
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,400
because I think
that your actions were wrong.

326
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,470
Did none of you hear me?

327
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,430
Take out your papers.

328
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,070
We're going through them.

329
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,310
I didn't bring mine.

330
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,240
You didn't?

331
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,830
And you still have the audacity
to speak to me like that?

332
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,470
Go and stand outside!

333
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,280
I didn't bring mine too.

334
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,360
Gao Zhan, you...

335
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,950
Me too.

336
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,000
Me too.

337
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,280
Me too.

338
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:24,790
Me too.

339
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,790
- Me too.
- Me neither.

340
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,790
Me too.

341
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,670
Fine.

342
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,760
Fine!

343
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,880
Disciplinary action will be taken
against all of you!

344
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,830
Principal!

345
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,520
Principal!

346
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,880
Those students in Class 3 are rebelling!

347
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,950
I can't teach them anymore!

348
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,710
Go and have a look yourself!

349
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,400
I...

350
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,400
Mr. Zhang...

351
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,120
Now, now, don't be hasty.

352
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,470
No...

353
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,280
You have to see them!

354
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,670
You didn't see how they were behaving!

355
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,160
Principal...

356
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,240
Let's sit down first.

357
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,160
Have a seat first.

358
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,880
Mr. Zhang,

359
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,880
have some water.

360
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,760
I'm not thirsty.

361
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,550
Principal,

362
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,830
those students from Class 3

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,040
were so...

364
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,640
Mr. Zhang,

365
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,830
would you mind
if I say a few words first?

366
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,670
Go... Go ahead, sir.

367
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,670
Mr. Zhang,

368
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,710
I know

369
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,590
about

370
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,550
Xu Jingjing's results.

371
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,000
It was a lapse in judgement
on my part this time,

372
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,880
but her usual grades are nowhere...

373
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,710
Mr. Zhang,

374
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,360
you've been working
in this school for many years.

375
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,000
You are well-known

376
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,190
for being strict with students.

377
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,160
I don't think
there's anything wrong with that.

378
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,120
But don't you think

379
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,950
that it's not good for you

380
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,640
or the students

381
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,280
if you clamp down too hard?

382
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,120
Principal,

383
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,670
I am doing this for their good!

384
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,310
No one is questioning that.

385
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,000
But we should find

386
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,880
the right way
to do things, shouldn't we?

387
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,400
I received complaints

388
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,640
from a lot of teachers.

389
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,470
You installed surveillance cameras

390
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,590
in the office,

391
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,190
and they think

392
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,790
that made the workplace unfriendly.

393
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,120
Everything they do is being monitored.

394
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,710
They feel stressed.

395
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,280
I installed those cameras for...

396
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,240
Anyway, it's not for them.

397
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,400
But

398
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,520
they are bound

399
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,040
to be caught on camera in that office.

400
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,920
Mr. Zhang,

401
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,000
you've worked
in this school for many years.

402
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,790
But you've never taken

403
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,950
any leave or days off, have you?

404
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,120
Why don't you take this chance

405
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,190
to give yourself some time off

406
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
and take a break?

407
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,710
What do you mean, sir?

408
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,400
Are you firing me?

409
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, I couldn't possibly bear

410
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,760
to let someone of your talent go.

411
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,240
I just think

412
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,670
that you should give yourself a break

413
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,320
to readjust yourself.

414
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,230
Don't fret about the average score

415
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,560
and enrollment rates.

416
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,230
There is a lot more to life

417
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,080
than those matters,

418
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,800
isn't there?

419
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:14,560
Go home

420
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,800
and spend time with your children.

421
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,360
I sincerely hope

422
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,670
that you'll learn

423
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,430
how to get along with kids after this.

424
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,670
All right.

425
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,230
I understand.

426
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,920
Sit down, sit down.

427
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,190
Miss Chen,

428
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
thank you for staying.

429
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:44,990
Miss Chen,

430
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,190
don't think about getting rid of us!

431
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,320
At this very moment,

432
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,670
I would like to recite a poem.

433
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,670
Poem?

434
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,230
Knowing you, it's doggerel at most.

435
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,880
Here I go.

436
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,230
Um...

437
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,120
Miss Chen, Miss Chen,

438
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,880
you'll teach us this year...

439
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
Stay...

440
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,430
Stay...

441
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,160
We won't let you go even in death!

442
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,030
Can't you say something less morbid?

443
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,400
Did your PE teacher

444
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,400
teach you Chinese?

445
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,030
Right!

446
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,560
Miss Chen. Mr. Zhao.

447
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,950
They're a family anyway.

448
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,950
Don't blabber nonsense.

449
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,560
All right.

450
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,320
Back to the lesson.

451
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,840
Turn to page 29.

452
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm no longer the dean.

453
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,510
Mr. Zhang, what is this...

454
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,670
How ironic.

455
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,030
To think I would be the one
that leaves in the end.

456
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,560
I don't understand.

457
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,600
Drop the act.

458
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,710
With me gone,

459
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,190
you must be relieved.

460
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,430
No one will oppose you anymore.

461
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:20,990
Mr. Zhang,

462
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,670
I never thought

463
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,880
that you were opposing me on purpose.

464
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,400
We just happen to have
different approaches to teaching.

465
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:34,880
Sir,

466
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,640
have you ever thought
about drinking with your students?

467
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,470
What?

468
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,880
Do you know

469
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,800
what my greatest dream

470
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,510
of becoming a teacher was?

471
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,750
Of course,

472
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,510
I've dreamed

473
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,270
of becoming an outstanding teacher

474
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,030
and getting commended on stage.

475
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,160
But the dream I yearn to see

476
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,950
the most

477
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,640
is that

478
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,920
maybe 10 or 20 years later,

479
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,990
when my students are all grown up,

480
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,470
they would invite me

481
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,320
to their class reunions,

482
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,510
and I can drink

483
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,430
with them,

484
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,320
and we can talk about life together.

485
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,360
I don't get what you're trying to say.

486
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,030
You're right.

487
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,800
I am young.

488
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,840
Inexperienced.

489
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,920
Sometimes,

490
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,840
I can be idealistic.

491
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,990
But I'm fortunate.

492
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,560
Because I seem to have met

493
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,710
a group of students

494
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,840
who are also as idealistic as I am.

495
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,920
They know right from wrong.

496
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,670
They're dauntless.

497
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,510
They have the courage

498
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,990
that I lost a long time ago.

499
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,510
To me,

500
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,990
that is the most amazing thing
about them.

501
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,470
Testing.

502
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I would like to say a few things.

503
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,080
Oh, all right.

504
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,470
Tell us what you want for your reward.

505
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,270
How about

506
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,880
a new Taekwondo uniform?

507
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,600
Approved!

508
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,430
That's not what I meant.

509
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,640
I

510
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,080
wanted to thank you both

511
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,920
for

512
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,320
never giving up on me.

513
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,840
Oh, you...

514
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,840
You make it sound like

515
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,880
we were going to throw you away.

516
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,920
The thought crossed our minds,

517
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,030
but that's illegal.

518
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,320
Be... Be serious!

519
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,160
Okay.

520
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,510
Carry on.

521
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,600
Mom,

522
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,950
even though

523
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,800
sometimes

524
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
your cooking isn't the best,

525
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:03,950
and Dad,

526
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,230
your jokes

527
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,990
can be a bit dry too.

528
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,640
And the decor in our house

529
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,030
leaves much to be desired...

530
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,080
Pause right there.

531
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,800
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

532
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,880
My jokes are bad?

533
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,880
But your mom

534
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,950
always laughs at them.

535
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,600
That's right.

536
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,840
Is my cooking that bad?

537
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,990
Even so, I've fed you
until you've grown this big.

538
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,640
Right.

539
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,750
Okay, okay.

540
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,510
That's not the point.

541
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,670
The point is

542
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
I want to thank you guys

543
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,080
for always believing in me,

544
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,950
supporting me,

545
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,880
and always having my back.

546
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,750
So

547
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,080
I am very lucky and blessed

548
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,230
to be your daughter!

549
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,270
Now that's a thank you speech.

550
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,950
My daughter is all grown up.

551
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,560
Come here!

552
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,320
Come over here!

553
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,080
Jingjing,

554
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,920
your father and I

555
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,510
are very fortunate to have you

556
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,470
as our daughter too.

557
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,750
Isn't that right, Xu?

558
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,470
Of course.

559
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,510
Let me tell you something, Jingjing.

560
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,600
I have two things

561
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,710
I am proud of in my life.

562
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,600
One, marrying your mother,

563
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,510
and two, having you.

564
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,230
Well-said.

565
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,990
Of course.

566
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,190
I might not

567
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,510
have let you guys feel like

568
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,510
you had a daughter you could boast

569
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,270
and brag about like other kids,

570
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,190
but

571
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,080
I promise

572
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,990
that from now on,

573
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,880
these surprises will continue to come.

574
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,030
Of course.

575
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,160
Jingjing,

576
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,560
if you keep up

577
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,270
the good work,

578
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,030
you'll have no problem
getting into a Tier 2 university.

579
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
You can try aiming for Tier 1.

580
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,160
Yes.

581
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,360
Oh, right.

582
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,360
When I have time,

583
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,750
I should think

584
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,510
about the universities
you might apply to.

585
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,230
You don't need to fuss about that.

586
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,600
Oh, I'm not like Jingjing's mother.

587
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm just going
to help you do the research

588
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,190
and let you use that information

589
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
as a reference.

590
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,270
That's more like it.

591
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,990
Yes.

592
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,400
Um...

593
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,120
What's the name of the boy

594
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,990
who tutored you?

595
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,400
You mean Master Kang?

596
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,750
Yes. Him.

597
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,510
Ask him

598
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,400
when he's free.

599
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,080
Your father and I
will treat him to a meal.

600
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes, of course. We ought to.

601
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,470
Yes. We have to thank him.

602
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,710
Okay.

603
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,750
Say,

604
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,560
why do you think

605
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
we have a new maths teacher?

606
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,120
We didn't chase him off,

607
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,750
did we?

608
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,080
Can't be.

609
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,190
I heard

610
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,160
the school gave Mr. Zhang

611
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,990
a long vacation.

612
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,470
A long vacation?

613
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,840
How long?

614
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,750
Can he take a break

615
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,360
until we graduate?

616
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,360
Dream on.

617
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,430
What's up?

618
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,470
I was just smelling it.

619
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,710
Don't give me that.

620
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,120
Put it down.

621
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,080
Fine.

622
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,800
You look so pitiful.

623
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,430
You can have some.

624
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,560
I'm happy enough

625
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,640
that you're eating properly.

626
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,400
It's fine

627
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,670
to have some high-calorie food

628
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,190
every now and then.

629
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,560
Really?

630
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,160
Don't eat too much.

631
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,750
Is... Is something the matter?

632
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,160
Um...

633
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,230
So my grades went up,

634
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
and my parents are really happy,

635
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,430
so they want to thank you.

636
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,190
They want you to come over

637
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,560
for dinner tonight.

638
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,270
But if that's not all right with you,

639
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,270
I'll let them know...

640
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,750
Why wouldn't it be?

641
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,600
Why wouldn't that be necessary?

642
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,190
Do you know how tired I've been
this past month?

643
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,710
I've got back pains and cramps,
and I'm sore all over.

644
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,990
I fried so many of my brain cells.

645
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,270
What are you doing?

646
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,640
I'm not finishing this.

647
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,950
I'll save my appetite for dinner.

648
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,920
Does this mean

649
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,160
I've made it into your family's lair?

650
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,670
First things first.

651
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Our house is ugly.

652
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,430
But we're very aware of that.

653
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,470
You better not say anything mean
about that.

654
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,360
Have you ever heard of that topic?

655
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,400
"Parents' questionable taste
in home decor?"

656
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,470
Our house is practically

657
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,670
an exhibit of that.

658
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,600
How ugly can it be?

659
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,800
My dad

660
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,510
made all our furniture himself.

661
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,080
But

662
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:55,950
he has never learned

663
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,920
how to make furniture.

664
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,270
And my mom

665
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,840
grows

666
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,950
all sorts of strange vegetables
in her garden.

667
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,270
I can't even name them.

668
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,640
Oh, right. What's even worse

669
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,840
is our wallpaper.

670
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,320
It's one of those European-style
wallpapers with filigree.

671
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,560
My bed sheets and covers

672
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,600
are covered in red peonies.

673
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,030
That sounds nice.

674
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,320
It's good to preserve tradition.

675
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,230
I'm not finished yet.

676
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,920
Our dining table

677
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,670
is covered

678
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,560
in old doily and lace.

679
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,230
On top of the lace

680
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,430
is a sheet of soft glass.

681
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,920
What's soft glass?

682
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,510
You'll know when you see it.

683
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,560
Oh, right.

684
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,270
My parents are loud,
and they talk a lot.

685
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,560
They'll bombard you with questions.

686
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,600
My mom's cooking sucks,

687
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,470
and she'll pile your plate

688
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,640
and watch you eat her food.

689
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,360
Xu Jingjing,

690
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,920
are you trying to lower the bar

691
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,400
and set my expectations low

692
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,600
to give me a surprise?

693
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,920
No.

694
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,190
Our house is really lame.

695
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,510
You'll find out when you get there.

696
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Mom! Dad!

697
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,320
We're home.

698
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,360
Mom?

699
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,800
Hammer!

700
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,190
You're back.

701
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,120
Hurry.

702
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,360
Dear,

703
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,230
this is Mr. Kang,

704
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,400
the boy who tutored our daughter.

705
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,430
Mr. Kang.

706
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,710
Oh, sorry.

707
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,840
My hands are greasy.

708
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,360
It's fine...

709
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:04,670
Here.

710
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,670
Mr. Kang.

711
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
You're a strapping young lad.

712
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,560
Good-looking.

713
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,510
Yes. Very handsome.

714
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,120
Jingjing,

715
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,030
take care of our guest.

716
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,990
Dinner will be ready soon.

717
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,400
Yes.

718
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,360
I've prepared a feast

719
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,320
for you.

720
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,190
Have a seat.

721
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,360
Help yourself around.

722
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,270
Make yourself at home.

723
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,430
Take a seat.

724
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,320
Come inside.

725
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,880
They're very friendly and welcoming.

726
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,800
I couldn't even get a "thank you" in.

727
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,190
Is this

728
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,160
a closed-down studio?

729
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,750
Don't look at it, then.

730
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:42,710
Fine.

731
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,270
Why are you looking at it again?

732
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,600
You're looking at it again!

733
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,430
Hammer, bite him!

734
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,640
Get him, Hammer.

735
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,600
On this festive day

736
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,990
of celebration,

737
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,710
we welcome...

738
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,750
Sorry, work habit.

739
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,320
We are gathered here tonight

740
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,190
to share a meal

741
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,880
to thank Mr. Kang

742
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,470
for tutoring Jingjing

743
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,400
and giving her

744
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,230
another chance to get into university.

745
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,710
What do you mean by "another"?

746
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,230
I can get into university
just fine without this.

747
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,470
Right.

748
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,800
Another chance
to get into a Tier 2 university.

749
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,800
Yes.

750
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,230
Mr. and Mrs. Xu,
there's no need to thank me.

751
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,990
Xu Jingjing is a hardworking student.

752
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,270
Yes, she is hardworking and clever.

753
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,430
Mr. Kang need only

754
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,430
enlighten her,
and she'll pick things up right away.

755
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,400
All thanks to me, of course.

756
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,120
What does that have anything
to do with you?

757
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:28,920
Well, she inherited

758
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,430
my intelligence!

759
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,320
My dear mother

760
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,430
and father,

761
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,710
my hand is getting tired.

762
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,510
Here, here.

763
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

764
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,750
Thank you, Mr. Kang!

765
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,510
Drink more.

766
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,470
Come, eat.

767
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,030
- Let's eat.
- Dig in.

768
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,920
Why did you drink that?

769
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,750
Mr. Kang,

770
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,600
don't listen to her.

771
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,080
Let's eat.

772
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,120
Don't hold back now.

773
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,510
Okay.

774
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,880
Here, let me give you a piece.

775
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,230
Try this.

776
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,030
Try it.

777
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,670
I wonder if it's to your taste.

778
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,560
Try it.

779
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,400
Of course, it would be.

780
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,750
Because my dad made this.

781
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,750
Xu Jingjing.

782
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,230
Let me tell you

783
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,560
the dishes that are safe to eat.

784
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,160
The Sichuan Boiled Beef,

785
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,990
Fish-flavoured Shredded Pork,

786
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,840
Steamed Fish,

787
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,750
and the soup

788
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,800
are safe to eat

789
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,430
because my dad made them.

790
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,360
But

791
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,120
stay away

792
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,080
from

793
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,400
the potatoes,

794
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
this braised pork belly,

795
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,800
and the Dry Fried French Beans.

796
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
My mom cooked these. They're hazardous.

797
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:17,800
Xu Jingjing,

798
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
you're asking for a beating.

799
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,190
What?

800
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,950
You want to fight?

801
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,750
You think I don't dare?

802
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,560
Darn brat!

803
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,270
How dare you bully my woman?

804
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,270
You have a death wish.

805
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,400
Nicely done.

806
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,400
You...

807
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:31,950
What?

808
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,840
What about us?

809
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,600
Think carefully before you speak.

810
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,920
Choose your words wisely.

811
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,600
You're such loving parents.

812
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,320
Wise.

813
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,640
Smart.

814
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,120
Let's eat.

815
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:45,950
That was just a little episode.

816
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,990
Just some playful banter, Mr. Kang.

817
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,470
Don't laugh.

818
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,560
You're still laughing.

819
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,600
I just think your family
is so cheerful and fun.

820
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,080
Mr. Kang,

821
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,400
this is how our family always is.

822
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,430
If you enjoy being here,

823
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,080
come over often.

824
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,510
You're always welcome here.

825
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,160
Oh, right.

826
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,080
How is your singing?

827
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,430
I think that was a solid

828
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,510
"mm".

829
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,270
Isn't that right, dear?

830
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,600
You have a good voice!

831
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:05,950
Yes, you'll definitely sing well
with that voice!

832
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,750
Mr. Kang,

833
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,120
it would be a waste for you

834
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,160
not to sing.

835
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,710
No better time than now!

836
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,360
Why are we having dinner?

837
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,430
Let's sing!

838
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,600
Sure!

839
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,470
I'll turn on the audio equipment.

840
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,190
All right. You do that.

841
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,080
There's no time to waste on dinner!

842
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,990
Forget about dinner!

843
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,430
Forget about it!

844
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,080
Clear the table, Jingjing!

845
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,710
Switch on the lights!

846
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,640
The one that rotates!

847
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,120
Put the bowl down.

848
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,880
Stop eating.

849
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,670
I haven't eaten anything since lunch.

850
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,670
Let me have another bite.

851
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,160
Come on.

852
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,600
Let's go.

853
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,230
You're not allowed to laugh.

854
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,430
So these are

855
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,230
the legendary peonies?

856
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,990
I told you they were ugly.

857
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,750
It's not that bad.

858
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,640
Good job on the expectations management.

859
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,750
It's better than I expected.

860
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,800
My house is a bit wild.

861
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,750
We didn't scare you, did we?

862
00:30:59,470 --> 00:30:59,800
Honestly,

863
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,160
I'm kind of envious.

864
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,990
Only a family that's truly close

865
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,670
acts like this.

866
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,080
Really?

867
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,230
Some parents and children

868
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:09,950
have a half-baked relationship

869
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,230
all their lives.

870
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,710
Like my mom and me.

871
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,510
Ever since she and my dad got divorced,

872
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,950
we haven't spoken much.

873
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,880
Trend Homes.

874
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,950
I didn't expect you to have this.

875
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,190
Of course.

876
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,400
I buy every issue.

877
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,400
I love this.

878
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,620
(Kang Minzhi)

879
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,080
My dad.

880
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,920
My dad.

881
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,640
So your dad's a designer?

882
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,230
Your dad's a major designer?

883
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,640
There's no need
to have such a big reaction.

884
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,470
Quick! Close your eyes! Cover them!

885
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
Why?

886
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,160
You're not allowed to tell your dad

887
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,840
that this is what my house looks like!

888
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,270
You cannot!

889
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,990
I think your house

890
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,950
is cosy. You...

891
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,670
Look out the window.

892
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,080
You...

893
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,840
I...

894
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,640
I just remembered
I have something to do.

895
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,920
I need to go back now.

896
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,400
Yes. I need to study...

897
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:15,920
No...

898
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,270
Um... Focus on your studies!

899
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,950
Study hard!

900
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,030
Wake up!

901
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,160
Get it together, Xu Jingjing!

902
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,600
Gao Zhan is the most handsome.

903
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,030
You're home.

904
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,430
Why did you come back so late?

905
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,950
Our English teacher made us stay behind.

906
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,320
He wanted to help us

907
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,880
improve our writing.

908
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,190
I'll have

909
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,560
two more classes every day

910
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,160
from now on.

911
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,750
Is that so?

912
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,710
Why did Xu Jingjing get home

913
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,800
so early, then?

914
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,990
She wasn't feeling well.

915
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,840
You scared me.

916
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:51,920
Um...

917
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,080
Can I ask you for a favour?

918
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,360
Go ahead.

919
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,600
Can you try to be as quiet as possible

920
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,400
when you go home

921
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,190
and don't let my mom notice
for the time being?

922
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,190
Why?

923
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,160
Can you promise me first?

924
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,550
Are you dancing again?

925
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,760
I want to participate

926
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,880
in a street dance cover competition.

927
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,070
So I've been staying back after school

928
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,880
to practise street dancing.

929
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,320
But

930
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,430
I told my mom

931
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,150
that we were staying behind
for extra lessons.

932
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,510
So if she sees you

933
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,320
go home,

934
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,510
she'll know what's going on.

935
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,590
So

936
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,200
this is your new spot?

937
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,630
I have bad memories

938
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,680
of the garage.

939
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,990
I'm worried

940
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,110
about getting stalked
by creepy people again.

941
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,590
But are you sure

942
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,150
you don't want to talk
to your parents about this?

943
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,760
You know my mom.

944
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,360
Her attitude is clear.

945
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,240
If I go to her,

946
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,070
I'll just be digging a hole for myself.

947
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,110
This place doesn't have

948
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,760
the best conditions,

949
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,990
but all I need is a place

950
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,990
to dance.

951
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,150
Besides,

952
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,680
this place actually gives off

953
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,590
an industrial aesthetic.

954
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,720
I'll show you

955
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,030
the video I took last time.

956
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,880
Not bad.

957
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,400
This place looks cool
in videos and photos.

958
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:18,950
But

959
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,110
why wear a mask?

960
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,920
Well,

961
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,590
if I uploaded the video

962
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,470
and it went viral,

963
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,240
it would be bad if my mom saw it,

964
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,150
so I figured I would wear a mask

965
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:31,950
to cover my face.

966
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,760
So, please.

967
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,280
Xu Jingjing,

968
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,400
just for the time being,

969
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,400
be extra careful

970
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,550
when you go home

971
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
and don't let my mom see you.

972
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,630
Okay.

973
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,470
Jingjing!

974
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
This is for you.

975
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,110
Did you make this for me?

976
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,760
No, I picked it up somewhere.

977
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,360
Make do with it.

978
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,760
It looks great.

979
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,950
But why a whale?

980
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,920
Have you heard of Alice, the whale?

981
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,550
There's a whale

982
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,510
named Alice.

983
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,240
Ever since it was young,

984
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,840
the sounds and frequency it emits

985
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,840
are different from others.

986
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,470
And that's why

987
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
it never receives an answer.

988
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:48,950
But

989
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,240
it continued

990
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
to sing and travel the sea.

991
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,240
It sounds lonely.

992
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,030
No.

993
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,470
I think it's a one-of-a-kind whale

994
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,630
in the world like no other.

995
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,110
It's lonely,

996
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
but it's brave.

997
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,680
Even if no one else

998
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,470
could hear it,

999
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,470
it never stopped

1000
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,470
singing or wandering.

1001
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,360
I think it's just like you.

1002
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,920
Thank you, Jingjing.

1003
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,760
Oh, don't get emotional.

1004
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,280
This is just thanks

1005
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,720
for the amulet you gave me.

1006
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,940
(Success in exams)

1007
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,630
Come on, then.

1008
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,400
Let's head to school.

1009
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,030
Okay.

1010
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,920
Is that Xu Jingjing's mom?

1011
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,470
Oh, no!

1012
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,420
(Recyclables, Other Waste)

1013
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,630
Did Xu Jingjing

1014
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,630
get the message?

1015
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,320
She didn't reply.

1016
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,510
She probably didn't see it.

1017
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,070
I know a shortcut.

1018
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:07,990
Where are we going?

1019
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,200
You'll know in a bit.

1020
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,360
That was one heck of a shortcut.

1021
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,110
Give me a moment.

1022
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,030
Here she comes.

1023
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,510
Why... Why are you late?

1024
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,550
We've been waiting for you all day.

1025
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,280
That's right.

1026
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,840
The English teacher is going

1027
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,590
to check on our skit tomorrow.

1028
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,990
No... No one gets to go home

1029
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,630
until we have it down today.

1030
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,470
Let's hurry up and get started.

1031
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,510
Jingjing,

1032
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,550
you're being followed.

1033
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,990
Are you sure?

1034
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,950
Don't look around!

1035
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,030
Are they the same people as last time?

1036
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,590
No.

1037
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,550
It's your family.

1038
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,590
Sorry.

1039
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,430
These kids...

1040
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,800
Why did they have

1041
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,360
to come all the way here
to practise English?

1042
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,200
I can't thank you guys enough
for earlier.

1043
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,150
If not,

1044
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,880
my mom would've found out.

1045
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,680
Well, it's not the first time

1046
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,470
you've had to fight with your mom.

1047
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,840
I can't believe it.

1048
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,800
I just found a new location,

1049
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,880
and I can't use it anymore.

1050
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,470
Don't be too upset.

1051
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,280
We'll think of something else.

1052
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,880
Gao Zhan.

1053
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,400
Gao Zhan!

1054
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,760
Dinner.

1055
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:31,840
Okay.

1056
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,840
You have dinner first. I need
to make a trip to the supermarket.

1057
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,470
Mom?

1058
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,470
What are you getting?

1059
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,800
We're out of laundry detergent.

1060
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,920
I'm going to get more.

1061
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,680
Remember to wash the dishes

1062
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,800
after you finish.

1063
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,720
Okay.

1064
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,150
It's a bed sheet.

1065
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,550
They only set it up
to make it look like a design.

1066
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,400
A bed sheet?

1067
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,720
It's a promotion thing.

1068
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,760
Silly boy.

1069
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,400
Dapeng.

1070
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:09,990
Madam Shi.

1071
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,430
Hui, you're here.

1072
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,720
Where's Gao Zhan?

1073
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,400
He is studying at home.

1074
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,510
Hear that?
Learn a thing or two from him.

1075
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,800
Hello.

1076
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,470
May I help you?

1077
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,200
Um,

1078
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:21,990
I heard you have

1079
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,920
something called a glue pillow?

1080
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,760
Could you tell me more about it?

1081
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:26,920
What? Glue?

1082
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,430
He meant latex pillow.

1083
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,280
Yes.

1084
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,110
Latex. Latex pillow.

1085
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,070
We have two examinees.

1086
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,320
I heard latex pillows

1087
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,920
can help you sleep better?

1088
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,800
Latex pillows

1089
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,840
are not only good for sleep,

1090
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,110
but they're good for our necks too.

1091
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,630
You can take a look at this one.

1092
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,680
A lot of parents

1093
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,920
choose this for their children.

1094
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,680
This?

1095
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,510
No need for the fuss.

1096
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,590
Just give us two
of your most expensive ones.

1097
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,150
Most expensive?

1098
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,720
The most expensive
isn't always the best.

1099
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,320
Right.

1100
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,470
You're always right.

1101
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,990
I'll try it.

1102
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,280
Dad,

1103
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,400
this feels nice.

1104
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,200
Give it a try.

1105
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,470
Okay.

1106
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,400
It does feel nice.

1107
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,320
This pillow

1108
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:06,800
does

1109
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,030
feel a bit different.

1110
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,550
It's a little strange.

1111
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,070
It feels better than the ones at home.

1112
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,950
Get up.

1113
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,430
Son,

1114
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,240
get up.

1115
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,320
Hui,

1116
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,400
come and try it.

1117
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,720
Oh, I'm fine.

1118
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,070
You're shopping
for something, aren't you?

1119
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,590
How can you buy something
without trying it first?

1120
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,510
She can try it, right?

1121
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,630
Yes, of course.

1122
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
See? She gave the okay.

1123
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,630
Come on. Hurry up.

1124
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,760
All right. I'll try it.

1125
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,720
What do you think?

1126
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
It is comfortable.

1127
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,470
Listen,

1128
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,280
high-tech stuff

1129
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,990
is just different.

1130
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:44,840
I'm even feeling

1131
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,400
a little sleepy.

1132
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,070
Sir, would you like
to come inside and take a look?

1133
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,760
Gao Zhan.

1134
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,630
