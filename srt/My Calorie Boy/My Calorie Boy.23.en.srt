Starting today,

18
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,319
Kang Jiawei will be

19
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,799
in our arts class.

20
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,480
Let's welcome him.

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
The top and second top

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,879
are both in our class.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,000
If you have questions,

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,399
feel free to ask Kang Jiawei

25
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,519
and Gao Zhan.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,239
Don't be shy to ask,

27
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:58,920
okay?

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,319
Take a seat there.

29
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:03,760
Sure.

"The ambassador is traveling
on official affairs."

32
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:25,200
It means the person
is going to many places.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,440
Finish the practice after page 38

34
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,799
as your homework.

Class dismissed.

36
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:50,999
It's hot!

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
Don't scare me.

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,760
By the way,

39
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,999
why did you come to our class?

40
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:04,719
I wanted to

41
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,519
tell you last night.

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,679
But someone

43
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,399
had a date with someone else.

44
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,399
You came for this?

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,679
Why didn't you say it sooner?

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
Don't make excuses.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
Where did you go after school?

48
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,399
Gao Zhan was having

49
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:19,519
astigmatism surgery.

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,839
It was sad for him to go alone.

51
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,640
So, I went with him.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,679
Is it Xu Jingjing?

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Why did you come out?

54
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,040
Could you copy

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,999
the language

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,440
lesson note for me?

57
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,880
Sure.

58
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:38,679
Are you feeling better now?

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,080
Things are still a bit blurry.

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,640
The doctor says I'll be fine.

61
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,119
That's normal for mydriasis.

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,519
Mydriasis heals

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,719
in a few hours.

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,360
I have astigmatism.

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,040
It takes a few days to heal

66
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,160
from slow mydriasis.

67
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,880
It's alright.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,799
I'll copy it for you.

69
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,440
I can use some revision.

70
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,239
Thanks.

71
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:04,679
You're welcome.

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
If I have to go out

73
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,839
in the next few days,

74
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,959
I'll need your help.

75
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:10,640
Sorry.

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,839
It's alright.

77
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,880
Don't trouble

78
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,519
Xu Jingjing with your trivial matters.

79
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:17,519
You should give her

80
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
the time to do

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,800
more revision.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,320
Right?

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,560
From now on,

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,039
I'm your service dog.

85
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,359
Let's go to the toilet.

86
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,279
Never mind.

87
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,039
I'm not in a hurry.

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,800
It's alright, come on.

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000
I really don't feel like it.

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,680
Come on.

91
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,080
Help!

92
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,860
(Overcome the challenges,
fight for the entrance exam!)

93
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:39,919
Thanks.

94
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm back.

95
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,599
Thanks.

96
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,959
Eat up.

97
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,000
I checked your

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,719
simulation test.

99
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,120
All things aside,

100
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,599
you lost too many marks

101
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
on too many mistakes.

102
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,120
For example, the ancient text rewriting.

103
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,039
If you got them correct,

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,120
you'd get more marks.

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,279
Gao Zhan's said that before.

106
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,919
What was his solution?

107
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:34,519
Memorize the whole thing.

108
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,440
No, no, no.

109
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,839
For subjects such as English

110
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,320
and history,

111
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,560
you need a lot of memory

112
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,839
to remember.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,959
It's not possible to remember all.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,760
I have a better way.

115
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,560
Do you know the memory palace?

116
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,320
Is it a movie?

117
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,320
Memory palace

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,760
is a memory enhancement method

119
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,279
that dates back to ancient Greece.

120
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,159
It uses

121
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,279
dull and boring parts of

122
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,000
knowledge

123
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,080
to form familiar images

124
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,839
that are kept

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,359
in a space you're familiar with.

126
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,399
What is this nonsense?

127
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,320
I don't get it at all.

128
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,640
I'll give you an example.

129
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,320
For the Melody of Water,

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,479
you need a palace

131
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,479
before you start

132
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,440
memorizing it.

133
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,880
We'll use the road you pass

134
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,599
on the way to school.

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,560
You will first

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
pass a breakfast joint.

137
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,300
(Chang Men Yao Soymilk)

138
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,159
(Famous Tobacco and Wine)
Then, a tobacco and wine shop.

139
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,000
Then, the central park's

140
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:27,599
tree.

141
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,800
Then you reach the school.

142
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:29,800
(Study hard, read more)
There are notice boards.

143
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,080
These places

144
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,839
are the keys to your memory.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are they connected to

146
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,800
the Melody of Water?

147
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,640
That's it.

148
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,599
When you memorize,

149
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,080
you must first imagine

150
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,399
your own palace's

151
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,359
keys to memory.

152
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,560
First off,

153
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,719
the lady boss at

154
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,760
the breakfast joint

155
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,800
(pancakes)
makes pancakes.

156
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,800
(pancakes)
The pancakes

157
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,120
(pancakes)
are big and round like the moon.

158
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,560
You can connect the image

159
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,440
with the line that mentions the moon.

160
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,800
(How rare the moon,so round and clear!)
Does that work?

161
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:00,640
(How rare the moon,so round and clear!)
Of course.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,839
(Famous Tobacco and Wine)
And then, the tobacco and wine shop.

163
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:02,839
(Famous Tobacco and Wine)
The shop entrance

164
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,000
(Famous Tobacco and Wine)
has bottles of wine.

165
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:05,640
(Famous Tobacco and Wine)
Connect the wine

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,320
with the line that says,
"With cup in hand,

167
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,240
I ask of the blue sky."

168
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,360
(With cup in hand,
I ask of the blue sky.)

169
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Try the next line.

170
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,839
Then, the tree at the park.

171
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,800
There are some sparrows.

172
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,200
The palace tower

173
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
is as tall and big as the tree.

174
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,039
So the tree will mean

175
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,479
"I do not know in the celestial sphere."

176
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,120
Not bad.

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,159
You learn fast.

178
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,880
What about
"What name this festive night goes by?"

179
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,440
There are the notice boards.

180
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
Under the notice boards

181
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,639
are the dates.

182
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,959
So the notice boards mean

183
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,119
"What name this festive night goes by?"

184
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,800
Perfect.

185
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,839
If you ever

186
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:38,599
run into texts

187
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,759
you can't remember,

188
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:40,999
don't memorize it.

189
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,999
Try to recall the images

190
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,119
you remember.

191
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,479
That will remind you of

192
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,239
the key information.

193
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,839
Can I turn

194
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,359
every place I remember

195
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,759
into part of my memory palace?

196
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,080
I can put geography in the cafeteria

197
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,639
and history at the convenience store.

198
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,080
You learn well.

199
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,359
Your method works.

200
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:04,080
I memorized

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,599
three poems in just one afternoon!

202
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,119
By the way,

203
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,200
have you decided on which school

204
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,119
you'll go to

205
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,879
for a design major?

206
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,680
No.

207
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,479
What about you?

208
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
I plan to go to Fuxing University.

209
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,680
But Wuxi is fine too.

210
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,560
I can be with my family there.

211
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,999
If it's Wuxi,

212
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
I think the design major of

213
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,920
Nanshan University is a safer choice.

214
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
But Fuxing University

215
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:29,759
has the best design major.

216
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
I'd like to give it a try.

217
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:31,599
Really...

218
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,839
But the bar for art students

219
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,639
to get into Fuxing

220
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,999
is pretty high.

221
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:39,320
What?

222
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,479
You think I won't make it?

223
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:41,879
No.

224
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm here for you.

225
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:44,599
You'll probably make it.

226
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,119
Kang Jiawei,

227
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,400
do you ever stop

228
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,479
showing off?

229
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,959
By the way,

230
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:53,999
you gave Gao Zhan

231
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,999
the coming-of-age gift.

232
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,839
Where's mine?

233
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,959
Xiaobai?

234
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:01,959
What's up?

235
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,599
-What is it?
-Where's mine?

236
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,160
Yes, speak.

237
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,759
Miss Tian, you asked for me.

238
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,119
Kang Jiawei,

239
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:15,560
congratulations.

240
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,599
Your thesis about rocket science

241
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,359
won an award.

242
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,320
Well?

243
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,639
The special training program

244
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,839
proved to be meaningful.

245
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,639
I think I deserve

246
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:25,479
some credits.

247
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah.

248
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,040
Of course.

249
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,639
Well...

250
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,040
I thank you for the help

251
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,719
and guidance.

252
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,759
I do feel pity that you eventually

253
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,320
chose the arts class.

254
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:37,999
Right.

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,520
Fill up the form this weekend.

256
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,080
Hand it to Miss Chen next Monday.

(Fuxing University Application Form)

258
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,119
Yes, sir.

259
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,160
I can take it down myself.

260
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,160
Stop kidding around.

261
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,080
Is something wrong?

262
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,520
Just say it.

263
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,959
I don't mind losing face.

264
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,040
Do you have a face to lose?

265
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,959
I didn't know that.

266
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,719
The color gradation is not bad.

267
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,239
It has a richness to it.

268
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,879
Really?

269
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,999
You deserve a lecture.

270
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,520
Only then will you improve.

271
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,680
Mr. Qin,

272
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,160
with my level, do I have a chance

273
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,520
to make it to Fuxing University?

274
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,920
You want to study there?

275
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,800
I get it. I'm not worthy.

276
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,959
It's my wishful thinking.

277
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,520
Sir, wake me up from this daydream.

278
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,639
Actually,

279
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,400
it's not entirely impossible.

280
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,839
Judging by your progress,

281
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:03,800
you'll catch up

282
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,639
to your friend soon.

283
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,680
Starting tomorrow,

284
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,920
take the advanced class.

285
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,400
The advanced class!

286
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,479
Stay humble.

Right?

297
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,680
He knows very well

298
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:18,800
why he chose this.

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,999
sending me
to Public Security University?

why I'm against it.

If you want to get the surgery,

306
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
you can have it after

You know

I've always wanted

live in fear forever?

keep the people safe?

Why not?

Why did you get so mad at him?

334
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,280

335
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,479
I feel nothing.

336
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,359
Well,

337
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,959
what about the surgery?

338
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,200
I'm going to get it.

339
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,759
I'll get into that university.

340

for the surgery?

345
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,839
Are you helping?

346

Come on.

347
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,440
I'm your brother.

348
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,920

Is that the application form?

351
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,800
Leave it on the desk.

352
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm not going to Fuxing University.

353
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,119
What's your plan?

354
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,800
Nanshan.

355
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:02,599
Nanshan?

356
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,920
Are you sure?

357
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,160
I know Fuxing University is better,

358
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,239
but I am choosing Nanshan.

359
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,479
May I know why?

360
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,920
No reason in particular.

361
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,400
I just want to go to Nanshan.

362
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,900
(Nanshan University Application Form)

363
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,860
(Ms. Chen)

364
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,080
Miss Chen, hello.

365
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,639
How may I help you?

366
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,680
Jiawei's father,

367
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:52,959
I'd like

368
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,639
discuss something with you.

369
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,359
Just now,

370
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Jiawei came to me

371
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,639
and said he wouldn't

372
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,040
be going to Fuxing University.

373
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,879
He is choosing
Nanshan University instead.

374
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,240
Are you alright?

375
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,320
Sorry. Yeah, I'm listening.

376
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:06,879
Speak away.

377
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,480
It's about his decision.

378
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:09,159
I want to know

379
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,359
if you're aware that he's going to

380
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,159
Nanshan University.

381
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,159
I'm aware.

382
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:15,399
He told me

383
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,720
he was interested in a few majors

384
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:17,720
they offer.

385
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,639
I think choosing the right major

386
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,439
is more important
than choosing the school.

387
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,960
I'd like to let him follow his passion.

388
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:24,720
What do you think?

389
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:26,960
Okay, understood.

390
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Thanks, Miss Chen.

391
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:29,760
Goodbye.

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,399
Well?

393
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,760
His father knows.

394
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,720
He respects Jiawei's decision.

395
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:52,879
Passion comes first.

396
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,280
Well, he's right.

397
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:56,919
It's such a shame

398
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,119
to miss this opportunity.

399
00:17:59,399 --> 00:17:59,960
Forget it, Dean.

400
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,359
We can't force them
into making decisions.

401
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,439
Besides, 985 or 211 isn't

402
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,720
our KPI.

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,720
We should respect

404
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,760
the children's decisions.

405
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,599
Yes.

406
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,839
Parents' mindsets are different

407
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,080
nowadays.

408
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,199
As the older generation,

409
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,960
I must learn to get used to it.

410
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,839
Please, you're not old.

411
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,280
Carry on.

413
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:25,119
Hello.

414
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:27,199
(This is Purchasing Manager Wang Yue)

415
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,399
(from Heniao TV.)

416
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:29,639
(We are interested)

417
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,080
(in your serialized novel)

418
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,320
(My Breakthrough Youth.)

419
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,359
(May I know if you
still have the copyright)

420
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,480
(to this series?)

421
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,919
(If it's possible,)

422
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,359
(could we meet in person?)

423
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:39,919
(We look forward
to working with you.)

424
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,560
You're going to Nanshan University?

425
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:44,639
Yeah.

426
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,159
Master Kang!

427
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,679
What got into you?

428
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,320
You promised to

429
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,159
go to Fuxing with me.

430
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,679
Fuxing has the best design major.

431
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,720
I know.

432
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,639
But...

433
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:54,760
I...

434
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:57,679
I get it now.

435
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:58,960
You're worried you might not

436
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,240
pass the early enrollment.

437
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,720
Right?

438
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Master Kang, listen.

439
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,720
With your...

440
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,439
I'm doing this for you!

441
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,280
What?

442
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,159
I chose Nanshan University
because of you.

443
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,280
So we wouldn't study together?

444
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:15,280
I chose it

445
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
so we could go there together!

446
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,760
You should've chosen Fuxing.

447
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,800
I checked.

448
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,520
The bar there for art students

449
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,839
is simply too high.

450
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,919
Do you think

451
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,599
I won't make it?

452
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,320
It's not what I mean.

453
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,679
I'm worried...

454
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,040
That I wouldn't make it?

455
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,320
You said

456
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,520
Fuxing's bar for arts students

457
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:49,720
was very high.

458
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,399
I thought you were kidding.

459
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,439
I didn't think

460
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,639
you'd think so little of me.

461
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,919
You don't think I'm worthy.

462
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,439
Xu Jingjing, listen to me.

463
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Nanshan's design major

464
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:05,639
is very reputable as well.

465
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,720
You don't have to

466
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,760
go to Fuxing's design major.

467
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,199
Just say I won't make it,

468
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,919
that I am simply

469
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,720
not good enough!

470
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:12,359
I get it now.

471
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,159
Xu Jingjing!

472
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,399
Brother.

473
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,359
Brother!

474
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,599
What is it?

475
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,800
Good news!

476
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,280
Good news.

477
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:30,800
Catch a breath before you talk.

478
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,879
I was there, buying a drink.

479
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:33,720
Kang Jiawei

480
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,760
was following Xu Jingjing.

481
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:35,839
Xu Jingjing told him,

482
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,119
"Stop following me!"

483
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,000
"I won't

484
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,960
talk to you again!"

485
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,439
Maybe they are just joking.

486
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,080
No, it's not that.

487
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:43,720
It's not the...

488
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:45,040
"Get lost,

489
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm not talking

490
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:46,760
to you again."

491
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:47,320
It's more like,

492
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,599
"I'm never talking

493
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:49,280
to you again!"

494
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:49,960
Like that.

495
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:54,879
What are you waiting for?

496
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,960
This is your chance.

497
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,040
Ever since Kang Jiawei

498
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,080
went to the arts class,

499
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,919
you've been at

500
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,839
a disadvantage

501
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,639
at approaching her.

502
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,639
What should I do?

503
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:05,839
I think

504
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,080
You should ask

505
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,199
Xu Jingjing

506
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,240
if she will

507
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:10,359
study in Beijing with you.

508
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,439
This time,

509
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,800
make sure she gives you

510
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,560
a clear answer.

511
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,679
But...

512
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,000
No more "but!"

513
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,040
You've read

514
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:18,080
Gaogao Observation Note.

515
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,960
You know

516
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,040
what she is thinking.

517
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:22,119
You both know the tips to

518
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,879
higher education.

519
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:23,960
You worked together

520
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,480
during the summer break.

521
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,919
You got everything ready

522
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,439
for you.

523
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:27,919
You...

524
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:29,879
It's time

525
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,760
to take on the boss fight.

526
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,679
Is Jiayao skipping lunch again?

527
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:37,639
She went drawing.

528
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,839
What got into her lately?

529
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,599
She is giving up

530
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,639
her life for drawing.

531
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,119
What?

532
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,320
I...

533
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:57,879
Here.

534
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,320
Sponge gourd soup with egg.

535
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:01,240
For the heatiness.

536
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:08,919
Xu Jingjing.

537
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,119
I apologized.

538
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,320
Please, talk to me.

539
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,000
No.

540
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:16,119
I'm not worthy

541
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,839
of talking to the prodigy.

542
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,839
I can't even make it

543
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,480
to Fuxing University.

544
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,760
It was only a suggestion.

545
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,359
I never said you wouldn't make it.

546
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm full.

547
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,800
See you.

548
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,520
What?

549
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,000
Help me out.

550
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:35,760
Don't sigh.

551
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,240
And they think Gao Zhan

552
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,000
is too dense.

553
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,599
You're even worse.

554
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,439
You two

555
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,199
should team up

556
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,919
and call yourselves
the Dense Duo.

557
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm better than him.

558
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,720
Better?

559
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:46,960
In what way?

560
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,679
At least Gao Zhan asked

561
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,080
if Jingjing would
go to Beijing with him.

562
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:51,000
And you?

563
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,919
Who made you the boss?

564
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,960
You just think

565
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,320
Jingjing can only make it Nanshan.

566
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,000
I know it was my mistake

567
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,439
for not telling her beforehand.

568
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,760
I should have...

569
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,000
What's with the look?

570
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,439
You are hopeless.

571
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:07,960
You're on your own.

572
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,679
Xiaobai,

573
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:10,439
hear me out.

574
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,480
If I want to go to

575
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:12,480
the same university as her,

576
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,839
Nanshan is the most probable

577
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,080
and practical option.

578
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,800
When you were losing weight,

579
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,720
Xu Jingjing

580
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:18,839
believed in you wholeheartedly.

581
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,639
She supported you.

582
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,040
She didn't say

583
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:21,800
it was a miracle

584
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,320
for you to lose any weight.

585
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:24,240
When she

586
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,199
is trying,

587
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,399
you don't even have any faith in her.

588
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:28,000
It's not that.

589
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,080
I am being practical.

590
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,639
Fine.

591
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,919
Even if you both got into Nanshan,

592
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,119
do you think she wouldn't

593
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,720
feel bad because
you gave up Fuxing for her?

594
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Use your brain and think.

595
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
What should I say?

596
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,919
I told you everything.

597
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,839
Do you not remember?

598
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,480
Just say what I say.

599
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,480
Xu Jingjing.

600
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:55,199
So,

601
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,119
Gao Zhan wants to talk to you.

602
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,240
What is it?

603
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,480
It's not anything

604
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:04,800
too important.

605
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,520
Hold on.

606
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
My brother wants to know

607
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:08,879
if he could

608
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,919
walk you home today.

609
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,040
Your eyes are fine now.

610
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

611
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,639
I want to talk to you.

612
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,720
Say it.

613
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,040
It's driving me crazy.

614
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:27,960
What he wants to say

615
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,439
can't be said in school.

616
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,800
Why aren't you eating?

617
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,839
I'm not hungry.

618
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
What is it?

619
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,480
So...

620
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:50,280
There's nothing

621
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,040
in particular.

622
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,119
I want to know

623
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,199
your decision about

624
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,280
what I asked on the rooftop.

625
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:10,040
Miss Chen.

626
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,320
Do I look

627
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,919
like a manager?

628
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,280
You look like a PE teacher.

629
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,159
Is this too casual?

630
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:22,960
I can wear a suit instead.

631
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,320
Cut it out, please.

632
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,679
I'm nervous.

633
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:27,720
It's alright.

634
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,000
Do you think

635
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,280
it's a prank?

636
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,000
We'll know

637
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,040
soon enough.

638
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,439
When are you meeting?

639
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:37,320
It's 7 pm.

640
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:40,439
It's almost time.

641
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:41,800
By the way,

642
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,080
don't tell anyone about this.

643
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,800
I haven't told anyone.

644
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,159
I'm the first to know?

645
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,399
It's such an honor.

646
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,639
You must be Miss Chen.

647
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,919
I am Wang Yue from Heniao TV.

648
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:01,480
Hello.

649
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,599
Hello.

650
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,399
Hello, Madam Wang.

651
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:03,960
Hello.

652
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:04,879
This is my boyfriend,

653
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,800
Zhao Donglin.

654
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,080
I'm her manager.

655
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,560
Just call me Zhao.

656
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:10,000
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

657
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,720
That has a nice ring to it.

658
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,439
As I mentioned,

659
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,720
we do sincerely hope

660
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,399
to purchase

661
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,040
the copyright to this series.

662
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,359
Madam Wang.

663
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,119
From what I know,

664
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,960
many novels

665
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,720
are adapted with many
changes to the plot and details.

666
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,280
May I know

667
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,040
what is your take

668
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,080
on the adaptation?

669
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,280
I was just about

670
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,159
to discuss it.

671
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Our production team

672
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,080
has had several meetings

673
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,399
regarding this matter.

674
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:44,359
The most ideal way

675
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,879
is for you to be

676
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,960
our screenwriter.

677
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:49,639
Me?

678
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:51,159
Great.

679
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,800
You majored in

680
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,000
acting or something like it.

681
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,359
It's literature of theater and film.

682
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,760
That's even better.

683
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,960
That fits our requirements.

684
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,520
We think

685
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,879
your novel gives out

686
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,879
a special vibe of youth.

687
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,480
Only you can write it.

688
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,320
It won't be the same

689
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,199
with other screenwriters.

690
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,080
Not to mention

691
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,320
you wouldn't want

692
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,320
the adaptation of your novel

693
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:11,599
to be twisted or changed.

694
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:17,280
But...

695
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:19,839
Look,

696
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,080
take a few days to consider.

697
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,040
Contact me when you've
made up your mind.

698
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:26,639
I think

699
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,159
this is the chance of a lifetime.

700
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,359
What are you waiting for?

701
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,639
Do you want me to leave?

702
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,720
Given our relationship,

703
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,560
no matter where I am,

704
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,599
I am only

705
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,439
one call...

706
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,080
Does it mean you'll have to leave

707
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,119
this city for the job?

708
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,000
Now you get it.

709
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,439
I am actually interested.

710
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,960
It's my dream to become

711
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,919
a screenwriter.

712
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,399
But you heard

713
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,320
the producer.

714
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,000
She wants me to take over now.

715
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,359
The kids are

716
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,359
in their senior year.

717
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,399
I can't just leave now.

718
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,280
Are you going to
let go of this opportunity?

719
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,560
There will be other opportunities.

720
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,639
Now is not the right time.

721
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:23,399
Hello?

722
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:25,359
Kang Jiawei, what's wrong with you?

723
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,159
Why do you

724
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:27,119
have to call so many times?

725
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,159
My mum thought I was in love.

726
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,639
I called Jiayao as well.

727
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,679
She wouldn't pick up.

728
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:32,399
By the way,

729
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,040
did Xu Jingjing call you?

730
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,119
What did Gao Zhan tell her?

731
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,560
How should I know?

732
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,720
She didn't tell me.

733
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,359
You love gossip.

734
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,240
Just ask her.

735
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:40,679
Quick,

736
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:41,439
do it now.

737
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:42,159
Ask her.

738
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,240
Kang Jiawei.

739
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,560
What am I to you?

740
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,439
Your sidekick?

741
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
Why should I order

742
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:47,720
from you?

743
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,839
I have my own life.

744
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,560
Okay?

745
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,639
Madam Lu,

746
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:51,960
my apologies.

747
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:53,679
I'm worried

748
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:54,760
Gao Zhan might

749
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,119
get too aggressive.

750
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,520
Now you're worried.

751
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,599
Where have you been?

752
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,439
Xiaobai,

753
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,480
you must help me out.

754
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,879
There is nothing much
to worry about.

755
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,919
This isn't the first time

756
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:07,720
Gao Zhan has asked her out.

757
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,080
You don't get it.

758
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,320
This is not the same!

759
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,439
Someone is really anxious.

760
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:16,560
I'm not.

761
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:17,800
I...

762
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,359
I'm worried about Xu Jingjing's study.

763
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,119
Fine.

764
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,760
Seeing we are classmates,

765
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,639
I'll scout it out for you tomorrow.

766
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,000
But don't

767
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,199
call me again tonight!

768
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:31,199
Yes.

769
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,119
Thank you.

770
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,480
Okay.

771
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:33,320
I'm hanging up.

772
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,359
How was your summer training

773
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,359
with Mr. Zhao?

774
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,879
Any major improvement?

775
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,320
You can focus

776
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,359
more on your dancing lately.

777
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,679
You're already doing great
with your study.

778
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:53,599
We're not going

779
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,599
to some famous universities.

780
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:55,879
Don't push yourself too hard.

781
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,280
Here, have some fish.

782
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,560
It won't make you fat.

783
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:07,720
Your daughter

784
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,879
is a remarkable dancer.

785
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Of course.

786
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,000
Someone complimented you.

787
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,720
For what?

788
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:18,240
For your dancing skills.

789
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,399
I'm full.

790
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,800
Sit down.

791
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:45,919
What is this?

792
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,280
You saw everything.

793
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,760
How many times have I told you?

794
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,960
No street dances.

795
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:03,919
The muscles you use

796
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,879
are different.

797
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,199
You will bring

798
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:06,960
these bad habits

799
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,320
to your ballet performances.

800
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:09,720
See this?

801
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,280
Look at these people.

802
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:12,800
What are they wearing?

803
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,520
They dyed their hair!

804
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,119
How unbecoming.

805
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:18,760
That's not what I think.

806
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,119
I think the dance was great.

807
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,320
What are you talking about?

808
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,119
Are you trying to upset me?

809
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,280
I want you to promise me

810
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,760
never to join this kind of...

811
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,520
These outrageous people!

812
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,879
Did you hear me?

813
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:37,520
Mum,

814
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:38,960
I'm done keeping it a secret.

815
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,399
I never went to the ballet training

816
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,080
you signed up for me

817
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:42,240
during the summer break.

818
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:43,480
I spent the money

819
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,240
on street dance!

820
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,359
I like street dancing!

821
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,839
I will send in my resume

822
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,879
and be a trainee.

823
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,679
I want you to stay out of it.

824
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,280
Jingjing.

825
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,399
Did you befriend

826
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:07,919
some hooligans?

827
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,800
What are you talking about?

828
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,399
Did someone brainwash you

829
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:12,919
into having your own opinion?

830
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:14,919
Did your homeroom teacher

831
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,599
say something?

832
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,639
Why do you always think

833
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,760
everyone is a bad influence?

834
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,320
Can't I

835
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,040
have my own opinion?

836
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:20,800
Fine.

837
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,520
You're out of your mind.

838
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,119
You have lost your mind!

839
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,760
Jingjing.

840
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,720
You've learned ballet as a kid.

841
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,520
You didn't even make it to

842
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,399
the dance academy's affiliate school.

843
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:34,439
You've only started

844
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,879
learning street dance.

845
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,399
What makes you think
you can find success with it?

846
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:39,080
Why can't you

847
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,919
support me for once?

848
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,119
I'll do street dances

849
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,240
no matter what you say!

850
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,439
I want to prove to you

851
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:45,359
I can do it!

852
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,040
You...

853
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:48,919
Yes.

854
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,560
You can prove it to me.

855
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:54,599
Xu Jingjing!

856
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,159
Mum!

857
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,560
I'll show you what I can do!

858
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,839
Mum, I'm sorry!

859
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:01,679
I won't do it again.

860
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,480
Mum.

861
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,199
Please, that's enough!

862
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,520
I won't do it again!

863
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:06,679
Mum!

864
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,679
That's enough.

865
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:10,919
I won't do street dancing again.

866
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,599
Mum.

867
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,839
I'm sorry.

868
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,599
I won't do it again.

869
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,080
I'm sorry.

870
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,760
I'm sorry.

871
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,399
I'm sorry, Mum.

872
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,879
I won't do it again.

873
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,280
Please, that's enough.

874
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,520
Jingjing.

875
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,279
I bought this...

876
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,279
I had breakfast at home.

877
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,520
I reflected on my mistake.

878
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,159
I was wrong.

879
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,319
I was wrong to say it.

880
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,960
We can try applying

881
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,639
for Fuxing together.

882
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:47,000
But the requirement

883
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,840
is very high.

884
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:48,799
You don't

885
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,199
have to stress that every time.

886
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,480
I know I won't make it there.

887
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,440
No, it's not what I mean.

888
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,239
You can make it.

889
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,080
You can certainly make it.

890
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,199
Just study as hard

891
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:55,679
as you can.

892
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
You can do it.

893
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:57,759
But the thing is...

894
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:58,440
The thing is...

895
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,239
Don't fall in love just yet.

896
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,440
What are you talking about, Kang Jiawei?

897
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,000
Think about it.

898
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,199
If you fall in love,

899
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:07,719
half your mind

900
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:08,840
is filled with love.

901
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,480
It'll affect your study.

902
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm not in love.

903
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,360
Who says I'm in love?

904
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:15,920
I...

905
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Did I say that?

906
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:19,480
I didn't say you were in love.

907
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:20,599
I didn't...

908
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,400
I mean,

909
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,560
if you work hard

910
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:24,520
and practice,

911
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:25,639
stay focused,

912
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,560
you will make it.

913
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:27,319
You can do it.

914
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,159
Stop talking to me

915
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:28,840
or following me!

916
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,880
Why are you here again?

917
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,440
Great Master Wang, rest your pencil.

918
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:53,920
Here.

919
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Take a break.

920
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,840
I can't stop practicing.

921
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,400
I think I'm getting worse.

922
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,799
Jingjing is an amateur

923
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,159
and she's not working as hard.

924
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,520
That's because

925
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:04,639
she is more gifted.

926
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,199
Fine.

927
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,799
It'll only take one minute.

928
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,239
Do you think Gao Zhan looks happy

929
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,639
or sad?

930
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:19,880
What's wrong with him?

931
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,719
I have good reasons to suspect

932
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,799
he talked it out with Jingjing

933
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,360
yesterday after school.

934
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,480
For real?

935
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,719
Jingjing didn't call me afterward.

936
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,960
Do you think he made it?

937
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,840
If he was rejected,

938
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,599
he wouldn't be in the mood for reading.

939
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,679
I wouldn't be so sure.

940
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,279
I think Gao Zhan

941
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,239
was born to be

942
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,480
a reader.

943
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,520
Enough speculations.

944
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,119
We should just

945
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:49,679
ask Jingjing.

946
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:50,880
And your practice?

947
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:51,759
Forget about it.

948
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,560
Now is the time for some gossip.

949
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:53,960
Let's go.

950
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,319
What is it?

951
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,920
You know what this is about.

952
00:36:58,279 --> 00:36:58,639
Spill it.

953
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,400
Where were you and Gao Zhan yesterday?

954
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,279
Be honest,

955
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,440
or be punished.

956
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,199
So that's what this is about?

957
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,119
How did it go?

958
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,400
What did

959
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,480
Gao Zhan tell you yesterday?

960
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,840
If you want gossip,

961
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,679
go check on

962
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:12,480
the celebrities.

963
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:13,840
Cut it out.

964
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,159
Spill it.

965
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,199
Well...

966
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,679
I...

967
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,279
Gao Zhan.

968
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,119
I'm happy that

969
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,319
we became friends.

970
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,520
In the past, you were

971
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,639
a dream

972
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,840
beyond my reach.

973
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:46,520
A dream?

974
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,840
The dream was beautiful.

975
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,159
It makes me yearn for it

976
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,920
but it makes me anxious.

977
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,360
I spent every day

978
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,080
thinking about getting to

979
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:01,719
that dream.

980
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,239
However,

981
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:08,639
dreams sometimes

982
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,319
remain a dream.

983
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,440
It's the dreamer that has changed.

984
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:38,719
Actually,

985
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:41,159
I was prepared for this.

986
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,520
I've read the note many times.

987
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,840
But one day,

988
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,880
you stopped writing

989
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,920
about me.

990
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,759
I think it was the second
semester of the 11th Grade.

991
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,400
You seemed to have

992
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,799
wanted to forget this notebook.

993
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,599
That must be because

994
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,279
Kang Jiawei kept pestering me.

995
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I was too busy fighting him.

996
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,960
You never fought me.

997
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,759
Of course.

998
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,719
I beat you

999
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,880
at the Taekwondo match.

1000
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,159
You know what I mean.

1001
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,880
It's alright.

1002
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm giving it back to you.

1003
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,460
(Gaogao Observation Note)

1004
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,480
Take this

1005
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,279
as a gift.

1006
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,679
It's a little embarrassing

1007
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,159
and silly,

1008
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,279
but it was

1009
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,279
my most wonderful memory.

1010
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,119
I don't regret writing about you.

1011
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,880
I don't regret

1012
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,000
writing that version of you.

1013
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,520
Cool, Jingjing.

1014
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,080
You are awesome!

1015
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,360
A moment of silence for Gaogao.

1016
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,520
You rejected him,

1017
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,080
but you made it sound so poetic.

1018
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,199
Dreams?

1019
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,279
Memories?

1020
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,520
Not bad, Xu Jingjing!

1021
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,159
I didn't tell you

1022
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,759
so you could

1023
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,759
make fun of me!

1024
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,239
We're not making fun of you.

1025
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:50,400
This is our salutation.

1026
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:53,599
Actually,

1027
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,360
I thought about what Kang Jiawei

1028
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,799
told me yesterday.

1029
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,480
He said my feeling for Gao Zhan

1030
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,719
was like yours for the idols.

1031
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,199
Look.

1032
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,480
You give it your best

1033
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:11,639
to study in Beijing

1034
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,040
because of your idol.

1035
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,920
It's the same

1036
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,239
as my feeling for Gao Zhan.

1037
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:19,920
(I paid attention to his interests)

1038
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:20,960
(just like)

1039
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,199
(how you bought merchandise.)

1040
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,639
(I wanted to sit closer to him)

1041
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,840
(just like you wanted
the front-row seat)

1042
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,440
(of the concert.)

1043
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,440
(We work hard)

1044
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:34,679
(for the first time
because of someone.)

1045
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,000
(It's a form of yearning
and adoration.)

1046
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:39,960
Did you forget your homework?

1047
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:42,840
They make us

1048
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,759
become better.

1049
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,440
Let's go.

1050
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,880
The class is starting.

1051
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,560
Is she

1052
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,799
the same person we know?

1053
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,400
It's time to grow up,

1054
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,480
Miss Lu Xiaobai.

1055
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:02,199
It had nothing to do with me.

1056
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:03,639
Hold on!

1057
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,239
What's the drumstick for?

1058
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:25,759
I saw you

1059
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,960
taking my drumstick.

1060
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
I know you like it.

1061
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,360
You can see?

1062
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,719
Were you pretending all this time?

1063
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,520
Hear me out.

1064
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,599
I thought the drumstick

1065
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,239
was too greasy,

1066
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,119
it'd be bad for recovery.

1067
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:40,520
It's...

1068
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,199
I know. You don't need to explain.

1069
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,719
We did it all

1070
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,159
for Xu Jingjing.
