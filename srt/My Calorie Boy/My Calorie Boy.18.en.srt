You've bought so many things.

You can't carry them all.

you liked my canine.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,679
You want to preserve

67

the evidence

68
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,200
and have me locked up.

70
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,640
Have mercy on me.

71
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,640
Look.

72
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:44,959
I'll finish the noodles

88
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,519
I shouldn't have

89
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,680
taken your notebook.

90
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,200

91
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,080
the better of me.

92

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
the red beans of the drink.

I loved matcha.

I prefer historical thrillers.

We'll be there for you.
Don't cry.

179
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,639
We can still meet.

180
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,959
Yeah, that's right.

181
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,759
- Don't cry.
- Hush.

182
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,719
Don't cry.

183
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,320
Little crybaby.

184
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,160
Come in.

185
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,800
Principal.

186
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,839
You asked for me.

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,999
Mr. Zhao.

188
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,599
Sit down.

189
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,400
Sure.

190
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,040
You submitted

191
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,040
the proposal for

192
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,999
the TV program.

193
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,359
We've gone through it.

194
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:12,999
The final exam

195
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,959
is already over.

196
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,080
I think

197
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,560
it's time for everyone to relax.

198
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,560
That's great.

199
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,520
Thanks, Principal Shen.

200
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,759
I'll contact them at once.

201
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,440
Mr. Zhao, hold on.

202
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,400
I need to ask.

203
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,200
What is it?

204
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,080
Can I participate as well?

205
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
I'd love to join too.

206
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,400
Sure thing, Principal.

207
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
I'll give him a call.

208
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,400
- Sure.
- Thanks, Principal.

209
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,200
Thank you.

210
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,599
Seriously?

211
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,639
Breaking news right
before the summer break.

212
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,400
Our school agreed

213
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,599
to this TV program?

214
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,400
This is your chance

215
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,479
to talk to Gao Zhan.

216
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,239
Read the letter you wrote.

217
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,080
How touching.

218
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,440
Look.

219
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:51,800
He can't reject you

220
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,839
in front of the crowd.

221
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,599
I've been embarrassed enough.

222
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,080
This is a TV program.

223
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,520
The whole country will watch it.

224
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,359
I'm not doing it.

225
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,599
I'm pretty curious about it.

226
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,719
Who would participate?

227
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Certainly not me.

228
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,520
None of you are going?

229
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,839
I'm not going either, then.

230
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm joining.

231
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
Yaoyao, the rooftop is where...

232
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,680
Ni Dapeng.

233
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,119
I'm warning you.

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,879
If you utter my name

235
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,999
on the rooftop,

236
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:17,400
I'll make your life a living hell,

237
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,320
got it?

238
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,119
Sure.

239
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,800
You have my words.

240
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,980
(I Want to Tell You Out Loud)

241
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,119
Chen Bei!

242
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,719
(I Want to Tell You Out Loud)
Am I speaking loud enough?

243
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,639
Grade 11 Class 3!

244
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,759
Ms. Chen Bei!

245
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:57,999
Hey there!

246
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,560
I am Zhao Donglin, the PE teacher!

247
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,639
I should drop the job title.

248
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,560
I'll just be Zhao Donglin.

249
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,440
Grade 11 Class 3, Ms. Chen Bei!

250
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,839
I am Zhao Donglin!

251
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,920
I have something to tell you.

252
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,839
(I Want to Tell You Out Loud)
I really like you!

253
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,119
Zhao Donglin!

254
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,639
Are you out of your mind?

255
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,959
Watch your step.

256
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,999
You could fall.

257
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,920
What brings you here?

258
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,239
Are you really

259
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,359
going to say that tomorrow?

260
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,160
Yeah.

261
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,320
What's wrong?

262
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,879
No, you can't do it.

263
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:39,800
Why not?

264
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,959
The production team says I can say it

265
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,080
if I mean it.

266
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,260
(Ms. Chen Bei of Grade 11 Class 3)

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,599
Are you serious?

268
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah.

269
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,479
I made up my mind

270
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,400
when they came to me.

271
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,080
That's not what I mean.

272
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,400
What do you mean, then?

273
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,280
Do you mean it

274
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,280
when you say you like me?

275
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,520
Ms. Chen.

276
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,879
I really like you.

277
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:16,959
I like how you are kind

278
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,479
and honest.

279
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,280
I like your smile.

280
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:22,999
I'd explode

281
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,239
if you didn't let me say it.

282
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,239
So be it.

283
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,879
Do not say it.

284
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,440
If that's what you want,

285
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:33,879
there is another way.

286
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,759
What is it?

287
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,280
Say yes now.

288
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,879
To what?

289
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
To be my girlfriend.

290
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,340
♪When my boldness turns to hesitation
because of you♪

291
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,660
♪I can't let you go so I toss and turn♪

292
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,759
So, we can only be colleagues?

293
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm counting on you.

294
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:08,560
Is that a yes?

295
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,200
That's a yes!

296
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,599
The scholarly type
is always so reserved.

297
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:19,879
You're back.

298
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,680
See?

299
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,239
What is the point
of installing it so high up?

300
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,759
This is exhausting.

301
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,520
Gao Zhan, welcome home.

302
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,999
Where is Mum?

303
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,119
She went to the supermarket.

304
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,280
Didn't she tell you

305
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,759
we're having dinner together?

306
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,160
I forgot.

307
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,920
Sure, that's normal.

308
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
That's totally normal.

309
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,239
Well...

310
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
See? It's working.

311
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,440
I...

312
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,639
I should get going.

313
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,239
What about dinner?

314
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:55,080
Sure.

315
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,479
Is that a yes?

316
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,759
Great.

317
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,479
That's great.

318
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:03,879
We'll have it together.

319
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,879
Come, have a seat.

320
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,759
Take a break.
You must be tired.

321
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,639
This is a great tea.

322
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:31,479
Thanks.

323
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,040
Thanks.

324
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,040
Great tea.

325
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:41,520
Uncle Ni.

326
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,680
Can I ask you something?

327
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,160
Ask away.

328
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:46,719
When did you

329
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,080
fall in love with my mother?

330
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,719
Sorry.

331
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,119
Sorry about that.

332
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,479
Don't be nervous.

333
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,239
I'm alright.

334
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm doing some research.

335
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,879
I want to know

336
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,400
when do people

337
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,119
realize they are in love with someone.

338
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Research?

339
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,080
That's what you're studying?

340
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,359
You asked the right person.

341
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,040
So...

342
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,920
Is this because

343
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,440
a girl

344
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,040
caught your attention?

345
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,599
It's alright. You can tell me.

346
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:31,639
Spill it.

347
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,040
Well...

348
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:41,320
It's just that...

349
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,920
I found out a girl

350
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,359
was very interested in me.

351
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,400
I find her

352
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,959
quite cute.

353
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,680
But I'm not sure

354
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,879
if I find her cute

355
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,639
because she's

356
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,839
interested in me

357
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,239
or that she's always been cute.

358
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,359
I didn't...

359
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:56,959
Stop.

360
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,440
Hang on.

361
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,160
You got me all confused.

362
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:01,920
Sorry, Uncle Ni.

363
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,520
It's alright.

364
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,239
I'll take it slow.

365
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:03,719
Let me repeat.

366
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,240
Never mind.

367
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,199
It's fine.

368
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,720
I got a general picture of it.

369
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,439
Tell me.

370
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:09,760
So,

371
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:11,399
Dapeng told me

372
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,839
you are popular at school.

373
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,800
Correct?

374
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not sure either.

375
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,000
But...

376
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,240
I'm doing better than Dapeng.

377
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,439
See?

378
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,000
That brat always brags about

379
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,119
how he's more popular.

380
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,399
But that's not important.

381
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,480
Tell me something.

382
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,399
When the other classmates

383
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,080
had a crush on you,

384
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,520
did you find them cute?

385
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,080
No.

386
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
There's the answer.

387
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,399
Why don't you get it?

388
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,480
Silly kid.

389
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,040
Welcome back.

390
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,000
You two got along.

391
00:17:58,919 --> 00:17:59,520
What did you talk about?

392
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,000
- Food.
- Basketball.

393
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,639
- Food.
- Basketball.

394
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:07,359
You...

395
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,320
What is it, exactly?

396
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,800
You two carry on.

397
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,000
Call me when dinner's ready.

398
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,919
Yes.

399
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,679
Such a nice kid.

400
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,480
What did you talk about?

401
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,839
That's not important.

402
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,800
I settled it.

403
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:22,560
Really?

404
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,359
Yes.

405
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,480
Now, let's get dinner ready.

406
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:25,839
Let's go.

407
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,240
Go.

408
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,260
(Yuming Senior High School)

409
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,320
No.

410
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,000
We should hide.

411
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:34,839
Listen.

412
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:35,919
Kang Jiawei

413
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:36,720
is going to the rooftop.

414
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,199
How do you know?

415
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,320
Maybe he's ready to...

416
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Forget about it.

417
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,599
That's not happening.

418
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,639
Just watch.

419
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:45,760
There he is!

420
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,340
(I Want to Tell You Out Loud)

421
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,080
Principal Shen?

422
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,879
Yeah!

423
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,159
Students!

424
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,639
Hello!

425
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,359
Hello, Principal.

426
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,359
I'm here

427
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,560
to demonstrate.

428
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,000
When you speak,

429
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,839
do not feel nervous.

430
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,599
Do not feel embarrassed.

431
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,919
Do not keep anything to yourself.

432
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,000
Just say what you want

433
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,919
out loud.

434
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,560
Yes!

435
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,839
I'll tell you what I want to say.

436
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,599
Mr. Zheng from the cafeteria,

437
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:26,080
our meat buns

438
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,839
need more meat in them!

439
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,000
Put more meat in it!

440
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,599
Yeah!

441
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:37,960
I am here

442
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,919
to help our homeroom teacher Mr. Lei

443
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,040
a wife!

444
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,879
Mr. Lei

445
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:42,720
is handsome

446
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:43,599
and kind.

447
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,879
He even knows quantum physics!

448
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,720
Yeah!

449
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,399
I want to tell my good friend

450
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,800
Liu Ying

451
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,159
to stop saying

452
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,240
she didn't study!

453
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,399
She always gets good grades anyway!

454
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,960
Be honest!

455
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,040
Okay?

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,080
We should all be honest.

457
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Hello, everyone!

458
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I am Ni Dapeng from Grade 11 Class 3.

459
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,159
My goodness, this is too high up.

460
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,639
I want to tell...

461
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,800
Don't say my name!

462
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,000
Jiayao!

463
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:30,960
I know. Don't worry.

464
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,720
I won't say your name!

465
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,760
I want to tell

466
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,199
someone from our class...

467
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:41,960
Ni Dapeng.

468
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:43,560
How dense can you be?

469
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:44,679
I...

470
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,439
Are you saying it

471
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,159
or not?

472
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,359
Would you let me say it or not?

473
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,560
Just be quick with it.

474
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:58,359
Because I didn't work hard enough,

475
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,960
I can't be in your class

476
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,320
starting next semester.

477
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,320
However,

478
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,720
that doesn't matter!

479
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,320
I hope that

480
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
when we

481
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:13,520
do meet in school,

482
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,359
you can smile at me.

483
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,720
That's all I ask.

484
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
Thank you, Wang Jiayao!

485
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,679
Oh no,

486
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,879
I said your name out loud, Jiayao.

487
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:30,480
Yeah!

488
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,560
Yeah!

489
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Dapeng surprised me

490
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:39,879
with

491
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,520
his gentle side.

492
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,879
He was right.

493
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
What's wrong with you now?

494
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,720
Starting next semester,

495
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,560
we'll be separated.

496
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,720
Are you going

497
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,199
to replace me with someone else?

498
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,639
No way. That won't happen.

499
00:21:58,639 --> 00:21:59,760
We'll visit you at your class

500
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,720
and mess with you.

501
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:03,919
Lu Xiaobai!

502
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,879
Ms. Chen?

503
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,720
It's alright if you didn't

504
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,599
make it to the advanced class.

505
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,439
Don't be upset.

506
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,439
Why do you get special treatment?

507
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,359
Someone is getting jealous.

508
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,720
If you don't stop crying,

509
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,080
your favorite writer

510
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,879
will be disappointed.

511
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,280
One more thing.

512
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,839
I have a secret for you.

513
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,879
My Breakthrough Youth

514
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,119
was written by me!

515
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,320
I knew it!

516
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,119
I knew it was

517
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,480
our class!

518
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,439
One exam doesn't define you.

519
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,080
Even in the normal class,

520
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,520
you must still work hard

521
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,839
and give it your best.

522
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
I promise you

523
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:57,879
as long as you study hard

524
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,439
and never give up,

525
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,280
I'll write your story in my novel.

526
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,879
Thank you, Ms. Chen!

527
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,399
Well?

528
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,040
Did that motivate you?

529
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,320
Yeah!

530
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,399
Yeah!

531
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:21,879
Come on.

532
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,919
Ms. Chen is too kind.

533
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,359
How nice of her.

534
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,240
Certainly.

535
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,439
Next student, come forth.

536
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,000
It's Gao Zhan!

537
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,000
Gao Zhan?

538
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,399
What will he say?

539
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,280
I am Gao Zhan from Grade 11 Class 3.

540
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,439
Whom is he saying it to?

541
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,679
I have something

542
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,359
to tell

543
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,080
Xu Jingjing from my class!

544
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,960
Xu Jingjing,

545
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,520
I'd like to ask

546
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,240
if you're willing

547
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,720
study in Beijing with me!

548
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
I think you're special.

549
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,080
Well...

550
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:36,839
Well...

551
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
You are one of a kind!

552
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
Xu Jingjing, you're a fast runner.

553
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
You are strong.

554
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,639
You can finish eight buns

555
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
in one go!

556
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,119
You are serious when you argue with me.

557
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:53,800
You are very good

558
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,439
at broadcasting.

559
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,639
You are good at drawing.

560
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,679
You are funny.

561
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,199
And you are great in so many ways!

562
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:11,140
♪The evening breeze sweeps past
as the youth declares his pride♪

563
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,800
In the past, my life

564
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,000
was just black and white.

565
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,439
I knew nothing

566
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,199
except studying and sports.

567
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,199
I wasn't interested in anything.

568
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,520
Jiayao said I was

569
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,520
the chat ender.

570
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,839
Xiaobai said I was too dull.

571
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:33,520
I think they are right.

572
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,439
But after we became friends,

573
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:39,159
I think my life has started

574
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,480
to become colorful.

575
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:46,639
If you are willing,

576
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,679
let's study in universities

577
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,000
in the same city.

578
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,040
Yeah!

579
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,000
(I am Gao Jiawei from Grade 11 Class 3.)

580
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:39,919
(I have something)

581
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,119
(to tell Xu Jingjing.)

582
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,879
(I want to say)

583
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:46,839
(I am sorry.)

584
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,679
(I've been reflecting on myself.)

585
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,560
(What right do I have)

586
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,399
(to judge the decision you make?)

587
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,760
(Ever since we met,)

588
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,320
(you've never)

589
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,919
(stopped striving for your goal.)

590
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,439
(You may not know)

591
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,639
(where your destination is)

592
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:03,520
(just yet,)

593
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,439
(but I believe)

594
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,679
(you will find it one day.)

595
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
(I want to tell you)

596
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:12,679
(I'm the one)

597
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,399
(without a dream.)

598
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:15,839
(I don't know)

599
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,720
(what I'm interested in)

600
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:18,639
(or my ambition is.)

601
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,760
(I don't have any passion.)

602
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,599
(I don't have a clear goal.)

603
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:25,839
(I can't even decide)

604
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,000
(which stream I should take.)

605
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,839
(But that is fine by me.)

606
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,679
(It's alright not to have a dream.)

607
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,800
(No one says)

608
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,919
(we must have a goal when we are 18.)

609
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,599
(We are young.)

610
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,159
(There is still time for us)

611
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,040
(to find our dreams.)

612
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:42,560
(What's easily found)

613
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:43,800
(is interest and hobby.)

614
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:46,280
(What takes effort to find)

615
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,040
(is the dream.)

616
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,040
(That's what is precious.)

617
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Fool.

618
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,480
I don't want to

619
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,119
scare you.

620
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,000
I won't motivate you

621
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:18,760
aimlessly.

622
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,399
The summer break this year

623
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,000
should be taken seriously.

624
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:23,839
I believe you are

625
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,839
all aware of that.

626
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:26,919
In the filming yesterday,

627
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,119
I saw someone from our class

628
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,199
confess their love

629
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,599
for the ones they like.

630
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,599
I find that nice.

631
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,480
I mean it.

632
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,560
At least that shows courage.

633
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,320
But my point is,

634
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,760
you can enjoy

635
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,639
your love life in university.

636
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,639
You can do as you want.

637
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,040
But for now,

638
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:53,960
you have one goal.

639
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,960
How do you get into the university

640
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,399
where you can enjoy love

641
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,480
to the fullest.

642
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,159
Ms. Chen, don't worry.

643
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,119
I don't

644
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,000
fall in love easily.

645
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,399
Alright, back to business.

646
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,159
This summer break is the beginning

647
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,760
of your senior year.

648
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,480
I hope all of you

649
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:13,639
can think about

650
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,080
how they will face their senior year.

651
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:16,800
What is your weakness?

652
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,480
How do you make up for it

653
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:20,359
during the summer break?

654
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,800
I hope that

655
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,439
all of you

656
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,520
can have

657
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:27,040
and fulfilling and
precious summer break.

658
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,960
When the next semester begins,

659
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,639
you'll realize how utilizing

660
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,199
this summer break

661
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,080
will benefit your study next year.

662
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,359
Alright, that's all from me.

663
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:37,800
Give it your best.

664
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,280
All the best.

665
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,560
Ms. Tian.

666
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,720
You asked for me?

667
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,000
I've wanted to

668
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:54,720
talk to you.

669
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,679
Starting next semester,

670
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,919
the best and third best
students of the year

671
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,080
will be in my class,

672
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,240
I'm simply

673
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,320
overjoyed.

674
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:03,240
Thank you.

675
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,240
So,

676
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:05,599
you'll be in the senior year soon.

677
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Why is the school

678
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,359
filming a TV show?

679
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,720
You two weren't

680
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,159
interested in participating.

681
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,960
That's good.

682
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,679
Back to the topic.

683
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,560
So about your university choices,

684
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,199
have you decided?

685
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,839
I...

686
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,960
I haven't decided yet.

687
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,839
Neither have I.

688
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,280
You should start thinking about it now.

689
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,599
You have good grades.

690
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,919
Famous universities

691
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,639
will almost certainly accept you.

692
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,839
I want to talk to you

693
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,800
because I want

694
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,800
to give you a boost

695
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,119
and improve your chances

696
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,399
even greater.

697
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,960
During the summer break of Grade 11,

698
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,159
we'll recommend a few top students

699
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,359
to participate in the National

700
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,599
Technology Thesis Contest.

701
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,639
The Fuxing University

702
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,839
and Nanshan University

703
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,399
prioritize students'

704
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,000
performances in this contest.

705
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,520
Is this mandatory?

706
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,159
I read your files.

707
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,119
Kang Jiawei, you once won

708
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,879
the Chinese Chemistry Olympiad.

709
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:01,119
Xu Jingjing won the Physical Contest's

710
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,000
first prize.

711
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,240
If you win in this

712
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,800
technology thesis contest,

713
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,480
it will be a great bonus

714
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:07,520
on your resume

715
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,560
for applications.

716
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,960
So for this summer break,

717
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,199
I recommend

718
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,080
that you participate

719
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,480
in the training for this contest.

720
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,480
Thank you, Ms. Tian.

721
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,560
We will cherish this opportunity.

722
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:22,960
Thank you, Ms. Tian.

723
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,919
Xu Jingjing.

724
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
Let me walk you home.

725
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,879
Never mind.

726
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,080
I'm busy.

727
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,119
Okay.

728
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,760
Bye.

729
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,560
Bye.

730
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:53,599
You don't

731
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,800
have to answer me right away.

732
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:57,599
Tell me when you

733
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:58,439
make up your mind.

734
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:09,760
Kang Jiawei.

735
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:13,960
It seems we'll be spending

736
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,439
the summer break together.

737
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:16,760
Yeah.

738
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,520
What's wrong?

739
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,480
Don't you want to study with me?

740
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,599
It's not that.

741
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:24,919
You...

742
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,359
You seem a little upset.

743
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,260
(Notification)

744
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:35,919
Something came up.

745
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,280
I must get going.

746
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,919
Any plans for summer break?

747
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,199
I think

748
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,399
I'll go out.

749
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,000
Let's go to Disneyland.

750
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:51,159
Why won't you draw with me?

751
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,720
I'm not good at drawing.

752
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,159
I can teach you.

753
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,119
Where is Xu Jingjing?

754
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:57,960
She left after school.

755
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,199
What's the matter?

756
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,159
It's nothing.

757
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,080
See you.

758
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,399
-See you next semester.
-Bye.

759
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,599
See you next semester.

760
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,320
Xu Jingjing.

761
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,359
Are you hungry?

762
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,800
Actually...

763
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,639
Don't say it just yet.

764
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,280
Let me do the talking.

765
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,639
The meal

766
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,560
is on me.

767
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,839
Why?

768
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,879
The apology seems fine.

769
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:52,480
I'll give you

770
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:53,760
60 out of 100.

771
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,199
How did you...

772
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,080
I picked it up.

773
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,800
It's a shame to leave it there.

774
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,960
Do you forgive me?

775
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,280
I think so.

776
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,440
By the way,

777
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,119
I should congratulate you.

778
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:13,719
Cheers.

779
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,880
I made it to the advanced class.

780
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Congratulations.

781
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,520
Gao Zhan asked you

782
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,759
to go to Beijing with him.

783
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,799
I didn't say yes

784
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,840
to his offer.

785
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:27,960
Do you feel happy

786
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,880
when Gao Zhan said it?

787
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,480
I'm supposed to feel happy.

788
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,520
But something feels off.

789
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:40,480
I'm confused.

790
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:42,239
Is there

791
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,440
something wrong with me?

792
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Did I

793
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,119
study too hard and damage my brain?

794
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:49,960
Forget it.

795
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,440
Any plans for the summer break?

796
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,159
Ms. Tian asked Xu Jingjing and me

797
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,759
to participate in a technology thesis

798
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,599
training class.

799
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:07,360
Not bad.

800
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,400
You'll be with the goddess.

801
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:14,360
By the way,

802
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,000
you should see this.

803
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,360
I set up a page for you

804
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,440
on Cozy Home.

805
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,239
I posted all the photos you took

806
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,880
with the modifications you made

807
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,920
with your room.

808
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,000
You have

809
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,000
(Budget Room Overhaul For Students)
over 5,000 fans.

810
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:28,440
Check out the likes

811
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,199
and comments.

812
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:30,960
The system sent me a message.

813
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,360
Your work is now

814
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,639
in the top ten.

815
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,480
Xu Jingjing.

816
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,159
Everything thinks

817
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,920
your modifications are successful.

818
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,040
Did you put a filter on this?

819
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,040
Is this even still my room?

820
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:44,920
Xu Jingjing.

821
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Are you going to

822
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:47,920
venture into interior design?

823
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:50,400
I...

824
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,400
Probably not.

825
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,960
Why not?

826
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,040
If you yearn

827
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:55,920
for something,

828
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:56,679
the universe

829
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,719
will give you the push.

830
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,279
Nothing will stand in your way.

831
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,239
But I know nothing.

832
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,040
My father

833
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,279
may be a great designer now,

834
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,679
but he knew nothing at your age.

835
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:06,719
If you knew,

836
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,360
the university courses

837
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,319
would be obsolete.

838
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:12,040
Design courses?

839
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,199
Believe in yourself.

840
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,119
You are one step

841
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,639
ahead in practical experience.

842
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,080
(I like this style.)

843
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,199
(Beautiful, great work.)

844
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
(I want to overhaul my room.)

845
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,360
(Some people don't
appreciate aesthetics.)

846
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,960
(She is a student?)

847
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:37,920
(Salute!)

848
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:39,520
(I love this style.)

849
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,319
(It looks cozy.)

850
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,520
(My father)

851
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,319
(may be a great designer now,)

852
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,920
(but he knew nothing at your age.)

853
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:48,679
If you knew,

854
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,279
the university courses

855
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,440
would be obsolete.

856
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,120
(Interior Design Major)

857
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,060
(4th National Design Major Assessment)

858
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,719
Don't worry.

859
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,199
I need to pass the unified examination

860
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,319
for art students,

861
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,440
but I don't know

862
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,279
how to draw.

863
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,560
Calm down.

864
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:16,960
You still have time.

865
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,799
But I only have six months left.

866
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,920
Can I make it?

867
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,679
By the way,

868
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,159
you should ask Wang Jiayao

869
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:23,840
about the exam.

870
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:25,520
Ask her to find you a studio.

871
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
This is the legendary hall

872
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,480
of artwork.

873
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,199
Interesting, right?

874
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,119
Interesting.

875
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
So,

876
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:49,880
how many pictures

877
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,440
do you draw in a year?

878
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,080
It's probably

879
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:55,000
over 1,000 pictures.

880
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
That's a lot.

881
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,520
This looks

882
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,279
like my grandpa.

883
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,080
This is Voltaire.

884
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,960
Volty.

885
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,159
Sorry.

886
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,080
Wang Jiayao,

887
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,440
how much will it take to catch up

888
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,560
to your level?

889
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:17,719
It's a bit difficult

890
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,759
to reach my level,

891
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:19,799
but you know

892
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,639
the basics.

893
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
You'll learn fast.

894
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,360
Then again,

895
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,639
the exam is not about

896
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:25,319
drawing emojis.

897
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,679
Start with sketches.

898
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,119
Then, croquis drawing and coloring.

899
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,119
That's a lot.

900
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,360
Are you sure

901
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,080
you want to study interior design?

902
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:36,560
But I checked.

903
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,920
I must pass the unified exam

904
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,679
for art students first.

905
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,799
That is only six months away.

906
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,279
I might not make it.

907
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,199
You're already here.

908
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,080
Meet the teacher.

909
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,400
Come on.

910
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,679
Ms. Zhang.

911
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,400
Come in.

912
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,080
She's my classmate.

913
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:55,599
We talked about her.

914
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,599
Wang Jiayao told me

915
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,679
about your situation.

916
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,239
If you're interested,

917
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,400
read this.

918
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,199
We have a special class

919
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,960
that teaches

920
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,560
the basics to students like you.

921
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:07,480
We start from scratch.

922
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:08,560
Many students got into

923
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,480
the universities they wanted.

924
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,300
(Summer Art Training Registration Form)

925
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,119
Students must pay the fee
in one payment.

926
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,199
It costs 10,000 yuan?

927
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,360
You should discuss it with your family.

928
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,360
Sure.

929
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,360
Ten thousand yuan?

930
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,360
Even you think it's out of reach.

931
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,279
I'm done for.

932
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:30,920
It's over.

933
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,960
Talk to your parents about this.

934
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,560
This is an investment for your future.

935
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,199
When you become a successful designer,

936
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,960
you can pay them back tenfold.

937
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,279
They love you a lot.

938
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,599
They will say yes.

939
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,159
But the thing is,

940
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,799
I brought up my interest

941
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,799
out of nowhere.

942
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,679
They will think I've lost my mind.

943
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,119
If you say it

944
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,480
like you don't mean it,

945
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:52,480
of course they will think

946
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,119
you're being rash.

947
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:55,759
However,

948
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:57,880
if you present them

949
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,560
with a proper proposal,

950
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:00,799
they will know

951
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,679
you are serious about it.

952
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,080
A proposal?

953
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,719
No way.

954
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,840
What's with them?

955
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:09,719
Jingjing.

956
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,119
We are watching TV.

957
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:12,440
What now?

958
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,679
What is it?

959
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,719
I need ten minutes.

960
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,740
(What University Should I Go To?)

961
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,360
Mum and Dad,

962
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,360
I will tell you about my ambition

963
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,639
via the topic

964
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:25,400
we're discussing today.

965
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:26,840
Honey.

966
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,679
She finally has an ambition.

967
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,799
Sit tight.

968
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,799
Interior Design?

969
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,480
Why interior design?

970
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,239
I want to be an interior designer.

971
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,000
I want to make homes cozy

972
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,000
and beautiful.

973
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,279
Jingjing.

974
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,639
Putting up wallpapers

975
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,520
and light strips

976
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,840
isn't interior design.

977
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,159
It's just for fun.

978
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:48,880
Indeed.

979
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,000
That wasn't interior design.

980
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,639
From now on, I am learning

981
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,080
from scratch.

982
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:54,599
So,

983
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,679
how long can you last

984
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
this time around?

985
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,639
I'm not doing this on a whim.

986
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,319
The signs show that

987
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,199
the ambition has germinated

988
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,239
inside of me.

989
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,679
It dates back to middle school.

990
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:08,319
I once wrote an essay

991
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,759
back in middle school.

992
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:12,719
Outrageous!

993
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,480
The house looks ghastly.

994
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,480
I was away for my training.

995
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:17,639
Madam Wang Jiaren

996
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,480
put up European design wallpapers

997
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,960
on our walls

998
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:21,719
and my dad

999
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,279
installed a chandelier.

1000
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:25,639
My home looks like SPA now.

1001
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,520
SPA?

1002
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,119
They don't have
our expensive lighting there.

1003
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,599
Did you diss on me in your diary?

1004
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,440
Unbelievable.

1005
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,840
These are not the points.

1006
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,159
I've been ordering

1007
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,960
interior design
magazines for inspiration.

1008
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,840
It's been four years since then.

1009
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Four years?

1010
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,319
That's where she spends

1011
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,319
her allowance on.

1012
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,719
I didn't read them to kill time.

1013
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,679
I wrote notes.

1014
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,319
I even posted pictures of

1015
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,319
my bedroom overhaul

1016
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,279
(Congratulations for Ms. Xu.)
online.

1017
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,520
I've received thousands of likes.

1018
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,639
People are saying

1019
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,759
I set up a good example.

1020
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Not bad.

1021
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,759
Interesting.

1022
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:54,599
Now, back to the topic

1023
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,119
of interior design.

1024
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,279
This major

1025
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,920
is about

1026
00:41:58,279 --> 00:41:59,360
techniques and art.

1027
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,520
It's about applications.

1028
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,639
Read the next page.

1029
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,599
(Employment Rate Comparison Between
Interior Design and other Majors)

1030
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,400
The stats show

1031
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,040
the employment rate
of interior designers

1032
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:05,799
and their salary.

1033
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,719
This profession

1034
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,360
has a much higher employment rate.

1035
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,239
Not bad.

1036
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,679
The salary for fresh graduates

1037
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,599
after a year

1038
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:13,599
is already around 8,000 yuan.

1039
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:14,960
Not bad.

1040
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:15,960
For this profession,

1041
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,639
age comes with many perks.

1042
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,679
You need not worry

1043
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,759
that I'll starve.

1044
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,400
Not bad.

1045
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,400
Dad.

1046
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,920
Don't you want to start

1047
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:23,799
and wedding company?

1048
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,719
Yeah.

1049
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,239
If you host the wedding,

1050
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,719
I'll design the decorations.

1051
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,440
But...

1052
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,000
Madam Wang Jiaren.

1053
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,360
Don't you want to upgrade

1054
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,239
your shop?

1055
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,040
With this major,

1056
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,239
your dreams

1057
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,840
will come true.

1058
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:40,199
That sounds interesting.

1059
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,000
However...

1060
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,239
How do you know

1061
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,799
there's more to it?

1062
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:48,319
Spill it.

1063
00:42:48,759 --> 00:42:49,719
How much do you need?

1064
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,920
To take this major, I need to pass

1065
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,199
the unified exam for art students.

1066
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:55,759
So, I need to join

1067
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,360
a special training

1068
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,960
during the summer break.

1069
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,719
But...

1070
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,719
The exam is only six months away.

1071
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,880
What if you fail?

1072
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,119
The time you spend studying
language and culture

1073
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,440
will be for nothing.

1074
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,319
(Study Schedule)
Starting today,

1075
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,639
I'll follow this study schedule

1076
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,480
for the next six months.

1077
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,639
I study arts at day,

1078
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
I study language at night.

1079
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,159
Starting next semester,

1080
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,239
I study language at day,

1081
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,199
I study arts for

1082
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,000
two hours

1083
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:23,960
at noon and night.

1084
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,440
Jingjing,

1085
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:27,480
I don't mean to spoil it for you,

1086
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,279
but your plan is

1087
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,480
not practical.

1088
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,040
How so?

1089
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:33,520
We had a deal.

1090
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:34,319
You practiced

1091
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,440
Taekwondo for years

1092
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:36,719
and won provincial competitions.

1093
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,520
You could just

1094
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:38,639
apply to a sports school.

1095
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,480
Most importantly,
they don't require you to

1096
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,560
do great in language.

1097
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,119
Just take the steady path.

1098
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,239
Okay?

1099
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,440
But I want to learn interior design!

1100
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:47,960
You are rash.

1101
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:48,799
Look.

1102
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,520
If you still

1103
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:50,599
want to learn after a month,

1104
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:51,440
I'll give you the nod.

1105
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:54,560
I can't wait that long!

1106
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:55,759
It will already be too late!

1107
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,560
You just don't

1108
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,560
want to pay the fee.

1109
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,719
How could you say that?

1110
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,360
I only want what's best for you.

1111
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:01,440
You don't want to pay.

1112
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,159
You wouldn't even

1113
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,679
invest 10,000 yuan in me.

1114
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,159
10,000 yuan?

1115
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,960
Jingjing.

1116
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:09,880
First off,

1117
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,400
we don't mind spending the money.

1118
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:12,560
But think about it.

1119
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,759
You've learned Taekwondo

1120
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,759
for years.

1121
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,040
You can get into a sports school.

1122
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,440
Why must you choose art?

1123
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,319
After you graduate, I'll fund you

1124
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,159
and let you open

1125
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,440
a dojo of your own.

1126
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:22,599
If it's too hard,

1127
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,520
we can run

1128
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:24,159
a wedding company.

1129
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,840
We can be partners.

1130
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,759
That's nice.

1131
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,920
I don't want to run a wedding company!

1132
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,679
I want to learn interior design!
