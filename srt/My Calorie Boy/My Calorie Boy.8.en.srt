16

Gao Zhan.

17
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:51,970
Where's your cousin?

18
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:52,929
I...

19
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,450
My apologies, Gao Zhan.

20
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:55,489
My cousin

21
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,769
had a last minute.

22
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:57,730
So he couldn't come.

23
00:01:59,329 --> 00:01:59,689
Then...

24
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,409
It's okay though.

25
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:02,250
I can ask the questions for him.

26
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,289
I recorded

27
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,929
his questions on my phone.

28
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,769
Take a look.

29
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,289
Does your cousin practice Judo?

30
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,810
These are questions about Judo.

31
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:17,970
That's about Judo?

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,370
Do you know Judo then?

33
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,090
A little bit.

34
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,930
Then please teach me.

35
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:27,009
Maybe next time.

36
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,289
This isn't some Math question.

37
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:29,210
It gets physical.

38
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,009
But we're already here.

39
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:31,889
Plus, I already made

40
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,050
a reservation for lunch.

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,849
We can go

42
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,009
after we finish.

43
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,490
Okay, put your bag down.

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,770
Kang Jiawei!

45
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,729
You scared me to death!

46
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,609
Why are you here?

47
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,250
Same as you, here to make trouble.

48
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:03,810
Weren't you the one

49
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,609
who told me yesterday?

50
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:06,729
That you should keep

51
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,569
your crush to yourself.

52
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,889
I... I regret I said it, alright?

53
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,650
Do you have a plan then?

54
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:16,330
We might as well

55
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,210
have a double date. How about that?

56
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:18,250
No way.

57
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,810
That'd become a can of worms.

58
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:23,770
They're about to confess their feelings.

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,810
Move out!

60
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:27,650
To counter the opponent,

61
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,289
you'll need to free yourself
from the waist lock.

62
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,970
Then do a hip throw.

63
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,370
Gao Zhan! Xu Jingjing!

64
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:34,609
What...

65
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,169
Gao Zhan, Xu Jingjing.

66
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:39,650
Why are you two here?

67
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,569
I...

68
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,050
Xu Jingjing is supervising my workout.

69
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,449
Yes.

70
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:48,569
We just ran here.

71
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,770
Good that Xu Jingjing is here.

72
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:52,889
Xu Jingjing's cousin

73
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:53,650
asked me what to do

74
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,650
during a waist lock.

75
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,849
Different schools

76
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,169
handle it differently.

77
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,129
I thought about that too.

78
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,849
Although the schools are different,

79
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:04,930
but they all include

80
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,530
establishing, getting into position
and executing.

81
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:07,729
Come, let's demonstrate it.

82
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,210
Well...

83
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,409
I think you should teach my cousin
face-to-face

84
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,849
when he comes.

85
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,609
Okay.

86
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,729
Let's wrap it up then.

87
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,570
No, no.

88
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,650
We're already here.

89
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,369
Why don't we

90
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,289
go to Tom's World?

91
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:27,729
I have coupons.

92
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,450
Don't you want to play?

93
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:31,729
Yes, I do.

94
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,729
Gao Zhan.

95
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:44,450
You're amazing.

96
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,690
Can you teach me?

97
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,609
Okay.

98
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,169
One more time.

99
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,090
Gao Zhan!

100
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,330
I'm a bit thirsty.

101
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:05,010
Could you open the bottle for me?

102
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:30,010
Xu Jingjing.

103
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,330
Xu Jingjing.

104
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:33,849
I think the bottle is faulty.

105
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,570
Everyone must be thirsty.

106
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,970
I'll go and get drinks.

107
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,260
(Tom's World)

108
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,890
So...

109
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,809
I guess we can go...

110
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,650
After all that fun,

111
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:05,289
everyone must be tired.

112
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,130
Why don't we

113
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:07,450
go have dinner somewhere?

114
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:10,609
Actually, I...

115
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,409
I... already booked a place.

116
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,890
But it's only for two persons.

117
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,010
It's okay.
There are plenty of restaurants.

118
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,289
We can go somewhere else.

119
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,130
I know a really nice

120
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:19,970
hotpot place.

121
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,890
I've tried it. It's really good.

122
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,249
Let's go then.

123
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,770
So far,

124
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,210
we've not let them

125
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,049
be alone together.

126
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,770
Let's keep it up during dinner.

127
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:47,809
Don't let your guard down.

128
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,849
Do you think the loin

129
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,530
is better

130
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,809
or the chuck?

131
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,929
I'll help get the condiments.

132
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,369
What kind of condiments
do you guys want?

133
00:06:58,809 --> 00:06:59,530
Sesame sauce and sugar.

134
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:00,690
I want mixed oil and mixed flakes.

135
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:01,929
Gao Zhan.

136
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,450
Would you go with me?

137
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:04,369
I might not be able to take all of them.

138
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,450
I... Allow me to help.

139
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:08,770
I'll go. You guys order.

140
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:10,970
Okay.

141
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,970
You know this place better.

142
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,130
You go ahead and order.

143
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,650
I'll go and get drinks.

144
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:26,249
(Yellow Plate 10 yuan, Blue Plate 12 Yuan)
You know what?

145
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:27,450
(Green Plate 16 yuan, Orange Plate 24 yuan)
Different meats here

146
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:28,970
can be paired with different condiments.

147
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,049
For instance, mutton.

148
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:31,489
The best match

149
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,330
is sesame sauce.

150
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,369
Beef's soulmate

151
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,369
is shacha sauce.

152
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,729
Then, for duck blood,

153
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,049
duck offal...

154
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,169
Those pair well with mixed oils.

155
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,130
That's the best.

156
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:42,609
Amazing.

157
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,690
You know all the details.

158
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:45,970
All picked up from real experience.

159
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,609
Would you like to try

160
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,929
my own special blend?

161
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:52,970
Okay, sure.

162
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:54,409
I'll leave the condiments to you then.

163
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:54,729
Okay.

164
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,770
I'll help Gao Zhan with the drinks.

165
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,289
Okay.

166
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:57,450
Thanks.

167
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,130
I'm here to take the drinks.

168
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,409
Hey.

169
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:06,970
Hey!

170
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:15,729
Thanks.

171
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,330
Thanks.

172
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,210
Please enjoy.

173
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:19,570
Thanks.

174
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:21,690
Kang Jiawei.

175
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:22,809
What should I dip

176
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:23,770
the shrimp paste in?

177
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,409
That depends on your preference.

178
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,289
You could choose

179
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,169
refreshing or rich tastes.

180
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:28,929
Normally, it's seafood dips.

181
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,289
If you like

182
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,010
something spicier,

183
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,009
you can mix soy sauce

184
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,649
with wasabi.

185
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,249
It's more stimulating.

186
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:33,810
And...

187
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,970
Why don't you mix it for us?

188
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:37,970
You go prepare the condiments

189
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,649
and we'll cook.

190
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:39,930
When you return, the food will be ready.

191
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,609
Xu... Xu Jingjing.

192
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,450
Could you go with me?

193
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:47,970
I'm afraid

194
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,330
I can't carry so many alone.

195
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:50,570
Didn't you

196
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:51,970
bring these back by yourself

197
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,889
just now?

198
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:54,690
There are trays.

199
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,769
You could put the condiment bowls on it.

200
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,129
Are you two having neck pain?

201
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:08,529
No...

202
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:10,729
I'll get it.

203
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:12,889
Let us start eating.

204
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:15,609
I'll squeeze the shrimp paste
into balls.

205
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,170
I'll do it.

206
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:22,129
No, no. I can do it.

207
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,930
I think it needs to be cut first.

208
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,129
What's going on?

209
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,609
What the heck is this?

210
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,330
Gross.

211
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,690
Throw it away!

212
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:07,970
Hey.

213
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,330
How did this

214
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:10,489
end up as another public embarrassment?

215
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:11,170
What now?

216
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,729
It's all Lu Xiaobai's fault.

217
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:15,050
She forced me to wear the wig.

218
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,570
Do you have another?

219
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,609
Why did Xu Jingjing's hair

220
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,930
fall off just now?

221
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:27,690
Gao Zhan.

222
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,889
I have something to ask you.

223
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,450
What is it?

224
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,090
How is it?

225
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:40,810
Is it okay?

226
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:42,889
No!

227
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,729
What?

228
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,050
Did you forget

229
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,170
our mission today?

230
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,129
It's over.

231
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:50,090
Xu Jingjing must have said

232
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,249
everything from A to Z.

233
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,009
Come on.

234
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,290
Why did Jingjing pick the shrimp paste

235
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,210
of all days?

236
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:54,889
Gosh, it's on you!

237
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,529
Why did you go mix condiments?

238
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:57,529
Stop whining.

239
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:58,489
We need to get back.

240
00:10:58,609 --> 00:10:59,090
Otherwise,

241
00:10:59,210 --> 00:10:59,769
it'll be too late!

242
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,330
Go on.

243
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,050
You go first.

244
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,249
I'll be right there.

245
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,009
You go first.

246
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:09,810
I need to use the toilet.

247
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,410
You go ahead.

248
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,649
Don't you think

249
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:18,889
the double date today

250
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,729
was a total failure?

251
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,129
We're just in denial.

252
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,249
Don't you think

253
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,849
what we did today was inappropriate?

254
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,529
It was a little despicable.

255
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,410
And a little pitiful.

256
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:36,769
And a little comical.

257
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:54,290
Are you planning to take

258
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,410
science or literature for Year 3?

259
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,210
I'm not sure yet.

260
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,129
Why?

261
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,290
Nothing.

262
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,889
I was just curious.

263
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,609
Then are you planning to go elsewhere?

264
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,570
Most probably.

265
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,849
But I haven't decided.

266
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:16,330
Actually...

267
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,249
I'd love to go

268
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,290
to the same university as you.

269
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:20,529
How come?

270
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,570
Shouldn't you go
to a dance academy?

271
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:24,849
You and I

272
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:25,849
can't possibly go
to the same university.

273
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,529
It's not that.

274
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,889
What I mean is,

275
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,570
compared to other people,

276
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,690
I'd really prefer

277
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,170
to go to the same university as you.

278
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,009
But I don't know dance.

279
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:47,769
Say,

280
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,970
do you think Gao Zhan said yes?

281
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:50,849
To me,

282
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,170
Xu Jingjing's expressions was off

283
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,649
when we paid and left.

284
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:57,290
You're right.

285
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,009
After leaving the shop,

286
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,889
Xu Jingjing

287
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:02,690
didn't say a word

288
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,330
to Gao Zhan.

289
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:07,570
Do you think Gao...

290
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,609
It's Xu Jingjing.

291
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:13,009
She sent me

292
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:13,849
a message on Douban.

293
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,009
What did she say?

294
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,570
Mayonnaise.

295
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:17,649
- Can we meet tomorrow?
- She asked

296
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,009
(Can we meet tomorrow?)
if we could meet.

297
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,609
How did this happen?

298
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,330
Why are you two

299
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:28,529
suddenly going to meet?

300
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,290
What about me?

301
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,810
I must be the unluckiest person
on earth.

302
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,050
There's no progress at all.

303
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,649
You should be happy.

304
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,290
There's no reason to be happy.

305
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,810
Think about it.

306
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,570
Why do you think she messaged me

307
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,810
at this moment,

308
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,810
asking to meet?

309
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,810
Do you mean, Gao Zhan rejected her?

310
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,529
Xu Jingjing.

311
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,249
We finally did it!

312
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,330
Come on!

313
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:00,769
Come on!

314
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:03,290
Come on!

315
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,849
Come on!

316
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,290
Come on!

317
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:29,529
I'm seated at

318
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:30,810
the second table
on the left of the entrance.

319
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,649
Don't you have any sympathy?

320
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,849
Just let me laugh.

321
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,849
Hey!

322
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:26,729
How could you

323
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:27,609
laugh at other people's misery?

324
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:28,970
You have no heart.

325
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,129
If you were me,

326
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:32,769
you'd surely laugh too.

327
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:34,930
No, how could it be?

328
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,570
How did I get it so wrong?

329
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,090
Right.

330
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,009
She has the bracelet
from Stranger Things.

331
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,050
I have it too.

332
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:42,769
But Gao Zhan doesn't.

333
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,970
How do you know he doesn't?

334
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:45,489
What if he kept it at home?

335
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,170
Does Gao Zhan like Stranger Things too?

336
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,690
From my many years of observation

337
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,609
he loves watching American shows.

338
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:53,330
In his top three

339
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:54,090
are Stranger Things,

340
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,810
Person of Interest and 24 Hours.

341
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,970
His favorite comedy

342
00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:57,930
is Friends.

343
00:15:58,849 --> 00:15:59,450
Just like Chandler

344
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,609
when he's watching football,

345
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:01,769
screaming his head off,

346
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,129
pretending to be excited, right?

347
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,609
What is Chandler?

348
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,170
I see.

349
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,489
I wondered why Xu Jingjing

350
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:10,369
didn't get what I said

351
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,369
about Chandler screaming
while watching football.

352
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,290
You mean when
he avoided doing house chores?

353
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,930
Even you know it.

354
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,729
What do you mean even I know?

355
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:17,849
I'm a long-time fan of Friends.

356
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,570
Okay?

357
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,649
Don't underestimate me.

358
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:25,889
I can't stay and chat.

359
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,090
I need to go train.

360
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:29,009
Train?

361
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:30,649
Our school

362
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,090
has a basketball tournament
every semester.

363
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,410
Qualifications are starting soon.

364
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:35,649
You really like

365
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,649
guys who play basketball.

366
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,050
You've never met me.

367
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:39,889
How do you know I'm a girl?

368
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:44,249
Scram!

369
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:46,729
No...

370
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,570
No, it's all over.

371
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,889
It's over.

372
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,450
Young man.

373
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,290
You two are online best friends.

374
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,410
You shouldn't care

375
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,329
if they're a guy or girl, right?

376
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,809
Stop it!

377
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,370
Get into your own teams.

378
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,410
Then start doing sit-ups.

379
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,569
Start!

380
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,569
Get moving.

381
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:51,089
Let's do it together.

382
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:54,690
Why...

383
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,569
Why?

384
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,009
What do you mean why?

385
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,249
Right.

386
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,650
I... I'm teaming up with Xu Jingjing.

387
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,650
No way.

388
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,130
A guy and girl

389
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,289
can't do it together.

390
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:10,890
Come on.

391
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:11,930
No...

392
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,370
What are you doing? Come on.

393
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,049
Why didn't you ask
to team with Gao Zhan?

394
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:56,890
I think I might be overthinking it.

395
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,089
Gao Zhan

396
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,610
probably just thinks of me

397
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:00,569
as a friend.

398
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:02,089
Gao Zhan

399
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,850
is a straight-laced kind of guy.

400
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,529
You were too vague

401
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,329
the last time.

402
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,569
I bet he didn't get it.

403
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,970
Then what should I do?

404
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,970
You could try something else.

405
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:38,850
Jingjing.

406
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,130
What are you up to?

407
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,650
What do you mean?

408
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,890
I'm doing homework.

409
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:52,769
Mom.

410
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:53,850
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

411
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,210
I wanted to ask
what you want for dinner.

412
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:00,930
I want fried chicken, coke and burger.

413
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:01,850
Can I?

414
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,890
Sure.

415
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,850
The day you stop ballet,

416
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:05,769
you can.

417
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,210
The trash can is full.

418
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,170
I'll empty it.

419
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:13,930
I'll do it myself.

420
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:14,450
It's okay.

421
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,170
I'll empty is with the kitchen's.

422
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,130
I'll do it along with the kitchen's.

423
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,130
A crush at 17 years old

424
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,170
is very precious.

425
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:39,890
It could be the first time

426
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,170
you care about someone

427
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,610
more than your friend,

428
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,170
your family,

429
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:45,729
or even yourself.

430
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:46,930
So you should cherish

431
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,130
this feeling of adoration.

432
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,729
This is what Class 3's homeroom teacher,

433
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,410
Miss Chen, said.

434
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:54,370
There are others.

435
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:56,450
I've shared it in the group.

436
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,009
So I won't play it again here.

437
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,809
My apologies, everyone.

438
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,130
This is indeed

439
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:05,329
a dereliction of duty by the school.

440
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,089
From what I know,

441
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:08,249
Miss Chen

442
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:09,850
only has three years
of experience teaching.

443
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,089
This is her first time being
a homeroom teacher.

444
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,210
She's still too young.

445
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:15,850
She shouldn't have said those things.

446
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:16,410
That's right.

447
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:17,729
Where's her common sense?

448
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,569
Telling the child
not to obey the parents?

449
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,450
Will she be responsible

450
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,370
for my son's future?

451
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,009
Yeah.

452
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,329
I'd like to ask Yuming

453
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:24,329
why they couldn't find

454
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:25,529
a more experienced teacher

455
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:26,610
to lead the class.

456
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,049
Please calm down, madams.

457
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,970
The school

458
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,130
will take this matter seriously.

459
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:33,249
Sure you will.

460
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,089
May I speak?

461
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,690
You are...?

462
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,210
I'm Gao Zhan's mother.

463
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:41,650
Gao Zhan's mother.

464
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,569
What do you wish to say?

465
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:45,850
I wonder if the parents

466
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,890
have seen the complete video.

467
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,930
Gao Zhan showed me the clip

468
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:50,890
when he got home.

469
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,329
If I remember correctly,

470
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:55,569
Miss Chen said this at the end.

471
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,329
"The road ahead is long."

472
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,489
"We should keep
the feeling of adoration"

473
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,890
"in our heart."

474
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:04,529
"Until we become a better version
of ourselves."

475
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:06,970
We've been through

476
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,009
the high school years.

477
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,370
I'm sure

478
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:10,049
we all have

479
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:11,569
our own beautiful memories.

480
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,170
So I'm quite pleased

481
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,249
that my child

482
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:17,009
has such a homeroom teacher.

483
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:18,170
I'm sure.

484
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:19,809
Gao Zhan is top of the class every year.

485
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:21,529
It doesn't matter what the teacher says.

486
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,210
Telling the child
not to listen to the parents.

487
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,450
She said that though, didn't she?

488
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,289
Is that what
a homeroom teacher should say?

489
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,249
That's right.

490
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:27,850
Mr. Zhang.

491
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:28,650
Get Miss Chen to come

492
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:29,489
and let's settle this.

493
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:30,890
Okay.

494
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,450
Then you guys go ahead.

495
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:34,970
I've stated my stance.

496
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,249
I have another meeting.

497
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:37,690
Please excuse me, Mr. Zhang.

498
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,130
Since everyone said so,

499
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,089
get Miss Chen to come here.

500
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:44,809
That's right.

501
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,729
Summon Miss Chen right now.

502
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,690
Okay.

503
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,210
Bad news!

504
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,289
Bad news.

505
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:50,329
What's wrong?

506
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,450
Miss Chen is called out by the parents.

507
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,809
Whose parents?

508
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,450
I think Xu Jingjing's mother

509
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,130
brought the video recorded

510
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:58,809
at the hotpot restaurant.

511
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:01,089
Xu Jingjing!

512
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,890
The rest of you continue your revision.

513
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,170
Miss Chen.

514
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,529
I know you're still young.

515
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,249
You probably still harbor

516
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,210
unrealistic ideals

517
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,089
regarding the profession of a teacher.

518
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:13,170
Madam.

519
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:14,329
I think

520
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:15,850
this must be a misunderstanding.

521
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:17,089
I didn't teach the kids to...

522
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:18,009
Mom!

523
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:19,210
Miss Chen.

524
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,690
Where did you get the video?

525
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:22,450
Did you go through my phone?

526
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:24,249
You peeked at my phone again!

527
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,569
Why are you all here?

528
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:27,210
This is none of your business.

529
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,289
Go back to the classroom.

530
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,329
Hold on.

531
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,410
Principal.

532
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,769
Principal.

533
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,890
Sir.

534
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,690
Since we're discussing student affairs,

535
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:45,170
it's good to hear

536
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:46,249
their opinions.

537
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:48,170
Parents, please sit.

538
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:50,370
Principal Shen.

539
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,049
You came right on time.

540
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:53,289
Let's continue.

541
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,130
Go on.

542
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,569
Miss Chen.

543
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,809
Do you admit some things

544
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,049
you said were inappropriate?

545
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,489
I'm not sure what you mean.

546
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,809
But if's it about my opinion

547
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,930
that getting into university

548
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,930
isn't the sole reason for studying,

549
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,249
that's because I want the kids

550
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,130
to have genuine interest in studying.

551
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,410
To fall in love with learning,
to always remain curious.

552
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:23,850
But the way you said it

553
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,210
will mislead the kids.

554
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,370
We didn't misunderstand.

555
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:27,529
We know

556
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,489
where Miss Chen is coming from.

557
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,890
Miss Chen just wants us

558
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:30,809
to remain curious.

559
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:32,329
To never stop learning,
isn't that right?

560
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,370
You said,

561
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:34,729
let the kids tell their parents

562
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,650
they don't like

563
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,729
the subjects we chose for them.

564
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,890
What did you mean by that?

565
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:38,809
Why can't the kids

566
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,410
choose

567
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,009
their own preferred majors?

568
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,329
Don't they have the right

569
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,049
to choose their own future?

570
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,289
My son doesn't know

571
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:47,170
what it is they want.

572
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,489
He's only 17.

573
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:49,569
Being 17 doesn't mean

574
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:50,489
we don't know anything.

575
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:52,370
I know exactly what I want to do

576
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:53,769
later in university.

577
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:56,410
The kids have dreams

578
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,489
but dare not voice out.

579
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,249
That's because some parents

580
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,450
are too overbearing.

581
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:01,970
They've even planned out

582
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,329
everything for the children.

583
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:04,890
I really hope

584
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,130
the parents could sit down

585
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:07,729
and have a good talk with the kids.

586
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,610
Listen to what they truly wish to say.

587
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,970
What do you mean?

588
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:11,769
Are you saying

589
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,729
we're pushy?

590
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:14,650
I don't mean that.

591
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,610
Chen Bei!

592
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,890
Stop talking back.

593
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:21,410
Sorry about that.

594
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,610
Miss Chen is indeed too young.

595
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,769
She lacks experience.

596
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:26,249
On behalf of Miss Chen,

597
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,009
please accept my apology.

598
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:28,970
Sir.

599
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,249
Why should I apologize when
I did nothing wrong?

600
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,529
Didn't you encourage them to date young?

601
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,130
Miss Chen never encouraged us

602
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,890
to date young.

603
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,769
Then what was,

604
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,450
"a crush at 17 years old is precious"?

605
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,650
You said that.

606
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:40,769
Is that what

607
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,890
a teacher should say?

608
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:43,130
Shouldn't it be cherished?

609
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:43,729
How exactly

610
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,410
do you suggest to cherish it?

611
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,930
Isn't that precisely

612
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,009
encouraging early dating?

613
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:49,089
Mom!

614
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:50,690
I'll go home with you

615
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,009
and you can punish me how you want.

616
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:53,890
Just stop blaming Miss Chen.

617
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,089
Principal Shen.

618
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,049
Mr. Zhang.

619
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,850
I'm not here to wrangle.

620
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:00,130
My belief is that Miss Chen

621
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:01,769
is unsuited to be the homeroom teacher.

622
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:04,450
Throughout her time
as Class 3's homeroom teacher,

623
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,529
Class 3 has always

624
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,729
been at the bottom in every exam.

625
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,769
That was before.

626
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,089
The class

627
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:10,289
is already getting better.

628
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,249
Let me say a few words.

629
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,970
Just as you all said,

630
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,249
Miss Chen is indeed young.

631
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,610
In terms of experience,

632
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:25,489
she might be lacking
when compared to other teachers.

633
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,210
But that doesn't mean

634
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:29,890
she's unqualified.

635
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:32,049
How about this?

636
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:34,170
Let Miss Chen

637
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,329
prove herself with the results

638
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,569
for the midterm exam.

639
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,170
Do you guys agree?

640
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,329
So what position

641
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,289
do you think Class 3 should get?

642
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:47,690
Miss Chen?

643
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:54,610
How about top 3?

644
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:57,529
Sure.

645
00:26:58,569 --> 00:26:59,569
Let's see if Miss Chen

646
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:00,890
agrees to it.

647
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:18,569
I agree.

648
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:21,529
I have confidence in the kids.

649
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:23,210
Alright.

650
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,690
That's a deal then.

651
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,930
If Class 3's results

652
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,249
at the midterm exam

653
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,370
is top 3 of the grade,

654
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,170
then Miss Chen

655
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:33,009
will continue leading the class.

656
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,130
If not,

657
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:36,569
the school will immediately change

658
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:38,850
Class 3's homeroom teacher.

659
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,289
Is that okay

660
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,329
with everyone?

661
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,769
Fine.

662
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,890
Top 3 of the grade?

663
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,529
You must be kidding me.

664
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,769
We're done for.

665
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,560
(Freedom and Fairness, Intelligent and Innovative)

666
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:00,089
(Freedom and Fairness, Intelligent and Innovative)
What should we do, Xiaobai?

667
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,130
(Humble and Adaptive, Virtues and Duty)
What is it?

668
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,130
(Humble and Adaptive,
Virtues and Duty)

669
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,410
What's with the long face?

670
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:14,890
It's fine.

671
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,289
Relax.

672
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,249
Miss Chen.

673
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,249
I'm sorry.

674
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,890
It's my fault for what happened today.

675
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:24,970
My mom was...

676
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,089
It's not your fault.

677
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,329
No need to apologize.

678
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,410
Miss Chen.

679
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,130
We beat Class 6 during the sports day.

680
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,410
We can do the same in the midterm.

681
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,370
That's right.

682
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:36,890
We'll take 2 out of the top 3 spots.

683
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:37,970
We don't know for sure

684
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,410
that we'd lose the bet.

685
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,210
Our average score is one of the lowest.

686
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:43,130
It just means

687
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,729
the others are weighing us down.

688
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,130
I think we should give it a try.

689
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:51,370
There's still some time

690
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,249
before midterm.

691
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,729
Let's give it our best shot.

692
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:55,329
We can't let Miss Chen

693
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:55,930
leave us

694
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,249
like this, right?

695
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,049
No way...

696
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,210
Looks like it's time

697
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,569
to test out our brains on court.

698
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,489
That's right.

699
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,329
In the past, I didn't study.

700
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:05,970
Now, I'm going to start.

701
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,289
I'll master it in a jiffy.

702
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:08,410
You think we're playing a game?

703
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,489
Master it in a jiffy?

704
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,690
Miss Chen.

705
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:12,809
You see how determined we are.

706
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,690
We won't let you go that easily.

707
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:15,890
Right.

708
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:16,650
Miss Chen.

709
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,930
You mustn't give up on us

710
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,529
so easily either.

711
00:29:18,729 --> 00:29:19,289
Yes.

712
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:20,529
Yes, Miss Chen.

713
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,249
Do not give up.

714
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,130
I definitely won't give up on you.

715
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:27,489
Let us do our best then.

716
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,410
Let's do it!

717
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,249
Let's do it!

718
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,890
Say...

719
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:41,650
Is this step

720
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,410
too big of a risk?

721
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:47,610
That's not for sure.

722
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:49,289
You won't know

723
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,450
exactly what

724
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,410
the kids are capable of

725
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,289
if you don't give them a push.

726
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,450
But maybe

727
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,970
the parents are right.

728
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:03,329
I do lack experience.

729
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:04,489
I shouldn't have said those things...

730
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:05,489
Miss Chen.

731
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,610
I was there.

732
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:08,650
I think you didn't say

733
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,729
anything wrong.

734
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,650
Honestly,

735
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,009
I too, was touched by your words.

736
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,009
At the time, I thought,

737
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,009
how come I didn't meet

738
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:19,809
a teacher like you

739
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,410
when I was in high school?

740
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,729
But I've met you now.

741
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:26,529
It's even better.

742
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:32,769
What you need to do now

743
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:34,930
is to use your own way

744
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:36,809
to lead your class.

745
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:37,809
As long as

746
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,009
everyone is working hard
towards the same goal,

747
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:40,329
you will surely reap the reward.

748
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:41,930
Trust me.

749
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,610
Got it.

750
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,370
To get a good average score,

751
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:49,890
by right,

752
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:52,809
the score distribution
should be diamond shaped.

753
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,769
High scorers and low scorers

754
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:57,690
are the fewest.

755
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,489
The more above average scorers we have,

756
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,289
the higher our average

757
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:01,009
will be.

758
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:01,970
But for our class,

759
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,370
the distribution is triangle shaped.

760
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:04,890
Only me,

761
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,769
Kang Jiawei,

762
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:06,610
and Xu Jingjing,

763
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:07,809
are in the top 10 of the grade.

764
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:09,850
There are many more low

765
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:11,289
and super low scorers
compared to other classes.

766
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,850
We could all take a sick leave

767
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,210
on the day of the exam.

768
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,049
Are you dumb?

769
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,130
Missing the test?

770
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,569
Mr. Zhang would just give us a zero.

771
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,569
I think

772
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:22,130
the only way now...

773
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:25,009
Is to find a way to steal
the exam papers.

774
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,850
Before the day...

775
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,970
Have you guys seen

776
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:27,930
the Bad Genius?

777
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,049
Stop your nonsense, Ni Dapeng.

778
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,170
I worry we don't have what it takes.

779
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,489
And we'll just
make things worse for Miss Chen.

780
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:39,289
Top 3 of the grade.

781
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:41,650
It does sound intimidating.

782
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,569
But I believe

783
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,729
that if we all come together as one,

784
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,610
there's nothing Class 3

785
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,370
can't accomplish.

786
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:47,890
Gao Zhan is right.

787
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,329
If anyone

788
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:50,249
has any questions,

789
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:51,890
you can come to me or Gao Zhan.

790
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,450
This is what I suggest.

791
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,569
Every Tuesdays and Thursdays,

792
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:57,729
Miss Chen will give

793
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,089
English tuition after school.

794
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:00,249
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,

795
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:01,249
we will organize

796
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:02,690
our own after school revision.

797
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:03,769
Kang Jiawei and I

798
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,130
will take turns as tutors.

799
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:06,450
I have an idea.

800
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:07,850
I'll take care of the venue.

801
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:08,930
After school,

802
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,650
everyone can go
to Jingjing Milk Tea Shop to study.

803
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:11,930
Drinks are free.

804
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:13,930
I can help

805
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:14,930
coach too.

806
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:16,210
If...

807
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:18,009
you guys need any help.

808
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:19,690
No thanks.

809
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:21,170
If not for your mom,

810
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,890
we wouldn't be in this predicament.

811
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:29,289
I'm sorry.

812
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:33,890
You're back, Jingjing.

813
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:37,809
What's the matter?

814
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,170
You want to peek at my phone, right?

815
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:40,489
Go ahead and look.

816
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,249
Sit down and eat.

817
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:47,329
After you finish,

818
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:48,489
I will help you

819
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,170
with some of the unfamiliar moves.

820
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,410
From now on,

821
00:32:51,729 --> 00:32:52,529
I won't talk to you

822
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:53,650
nor eat the food you make.

823
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,410
Unless you promise
not to get rid of Miss Chen.

824
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,170
She can stay.

825
00:32:58,809 --> 00:32:59,450
But we made a deal.

826
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,769
As long as your class

827
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,970
is one of the grade's top 3.

828
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,170
Why are you being so hard

829
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,170
on Miss Chen?

830
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:04,890
She didn't do

831
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:05,970
anything wrong!

832
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,210
Jingjing, don't be angry.

833
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,930
I have to say.

834
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:11,049
Why must you cause a scene?

835
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:12,049
Right?

836
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:12,850
Now what?

837
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:14,690
You've become the parent representative.

838
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:16,410
How do you expect Jingjing

839
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,890
to face her classmates now?

840
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,489
What will the teachers think of her?

841
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,289
Right?

842
00:33:21,329 --> 00:33:22,210
Do you know that Miss Chen

843
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,529
encouraged dating young?

844
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,450
Not to that extent.

845
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,410
No?

846
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,289
It'd be too late when
your daughter starts dating for real.

847
00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:30,930
Xu Jingjing.

848
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:31,970
I've watched you

849
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,890
for a while now.

850
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:34,489
You've been hiding in your room,

851
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,370
being all sneaky.

852
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,809
No more closing your door.

853
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:38,690
Am I a pet dog or cat to you?

854
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,610
You might as well

855
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,729
install a camera in my room.

856
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:41,809
Jingjing is discerning.

857
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:42,850
She won't do anything wrong.

858
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:44,729
Alright, let's give it a rest.

859
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:45,809
Eat first.

860
00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:47,729
Come.

861
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,690
Everyone can say they're discerning.

862
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,690
But in the end,

863
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,850
you start dating young and days past.

864
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:56,729
At last, you neither have this

865
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,569
nor that.

866
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,289
And you realize a big chunk
of your life is gone.

867
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:00,009
That's enough.

868
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:00,769
She...

869
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,130
In the art exam back then,

870
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,890
I came in first in the whole province.

871
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:06,329
If I hadn't been injured,

872
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,089
I would've gotten into a dance academy.

873
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,169
Then I wouldn't have

874
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,250
to contend with teaching amateurs

875
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,250
at the Children's Palace.

876
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,330
Why are you bringing that up again?

877
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,009
I was a victim of cruel fate.

878
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:16,529
But you're destroying your own future.

879
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:18,370
If I were you,

880
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:19,890
after failing to get
into a dance academy

881
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,810
affiliated middle school,

882
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,209
I would be more strict with myself.

883
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:24,250
Don't you know how hard

884
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,330
it is to get into a dance academy?

885
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:27,770
It's like a thousand troops
trying to cross a single plank bridge.

886
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:28,810
We're at

887
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,009
the last hurdle.

888
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,569
There's no time for nonsense.

889
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,770
You just want me

890
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,049
to finish what you couldn't.

891
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:35,569
This isn't the life I want!

892
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:37,330
You!

893
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:38,209
Jingjing.

894
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,129
Sit down.

895
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,370
Fine.

896
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,009
Are you happy now?

897
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,049
As if I'm happy.

898
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,250
Eat your food.

899
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,410
Half of...

900
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:55,649
- Minus 2.
- Kids.

901
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:56,689
Take a break.

902
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,810
Have some fruits.

903
00:34:58,089 --> 00:34:59,209
And milk tea.

904
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,410
Here.

905
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,089
By the way,

906
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:03,689
all the milk tea today

907
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,730
is free.

908
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:05,689
But,

909
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,810
whether or not Madam Wang's drinks

910
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:07,489
are any good,

911
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,450
there's no guarantee.

912
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,649
What are you saying?

913
00:35:11,129 --> 00:35:12,209
Listen up.

914
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,810
This is the first time

915
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:14,930
Miss Xu Jingjing

916
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:16,209
is taking the initiative to study.

917
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:18,250
So as long as she's learning,

918
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:19,330
rest assured.

919
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:20,330
Our business hour

920
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:21,730
is until 3pm.

921
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,649
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Thank you.

922
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,370
Alright.

923
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,290
I won't disturb you guys studying.

924
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:24,970
Call me if anything.

925
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:25,730
Okay.

926
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,290
Let's go over the question.

927
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:29,569
This is a bonus question.

928
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,730
We already know...

929
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:31,569
Stop it.

930
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:32,730
Bonus this, bonus that.

931
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,169
It's not actually a bonus.

932
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,649
From today onward,

933
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,930
this question will be a bonus.

934
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,169
Before we attempt answering,

935
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,009
we need to know

936
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,089
about trigonometric functions.

937
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:44,009
Once you know,

938
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,450
AB is a hyperbola.

939
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:49,089
The left and right vertices of E...

940
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,440
(Jingjing Milk Tea)

941
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:57,250
Are you guys done with

942
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,290
the trigonometric equations?

943
00:35:58,569 --> 00:35:59,169
Done.

944
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,529
Let's check the answers.

945
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,009
BCCA.

946
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,450
DACB.

947
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,089
I only got two wrong.

948
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:13,529
I got everything correct!

949
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,609
Master Kang.

950
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,529
You explained

951
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,810
the main points super well.

952
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:17,930
Trigonometric equations?

953
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:18,890
Not a problem at all!

954
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:20,049
Thanks, Master Kang.

955
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,129
Thank you, Master Kang.

956
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:21,810
Okay.

957
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:22,770
We'll end the session today.

958
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:23,450
Let's continue tomorrow.

959
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,049
Okay.

960
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:24,529
Okay.

961
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:25,250
Let's go.

962
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:30,009
Bye-bye.

963
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,209
Bye, Master Kang.

964
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:32,209
Bye-bye.

965
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,250
How is it?

966
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:36,890
I...

967
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:38,810
It's okay.

968
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:39,770
I'll go back

969
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:41,370
and figure it out myself.

970
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,129
Am I really that stupid?

971
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,330
Even Dapeng only got two wrong.

972
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:56,250
Me?

973
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,609
I only got two right.

974
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,529
You're not stupid.

975
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:02,770
You've improved

976
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:04,049
a lot in just half a semester.

977
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,930
It's because you don't have
the proper basics.

978
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:07,689
Then...

979
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,049
I'll go home

980
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,169
and figure it out on my own.

981
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:12,569
What can you figure out

982
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,609
on your own?

983
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:15,569
Let me remind you.

984
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,250
There's not many days left

985
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:18,209
before the midterm.

986
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,330
You must not

987
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:20,850
pretend to know when you don't.

988
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,689
It's fine to get it wrong now.

989
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:24,569
I just have to help you understand.

990
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,529
But...

991
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,569
I really don't get it.

992
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,169
You can't get it the first time?
Try a second time.

993
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,209
Can't get it the second time?
Do it a third time.

994
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,129
Until you get it.

995
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,370
Okay?

996
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,129
Thanks, Master Kang.

997
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,640
(sin3x and cos3x formulas)

998
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:43,089
These are the derivation process

999
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:44,089
of the sine cosine formulas.

1000
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:45,850
Understand?

1001
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:51,129
Not at all.

1002
00:37:54,169 --> 00:37:55,169
Don't panic.

1003
00:37:56,489 --> 00:37:57,730
Let me think of a way.

1004
00:37:58,649 --> 00:38:00,169
3 sin x...

1005
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,450
Four...

1006
00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:03,450
Minus is has.

1007
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:04,529
This...

1008
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:08,049
Xu Jingjing.

1009
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,049
You can remember it like this.

1010
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,290
3 sin x is a hill.

1011
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,129
Minus is "has".

1012
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,930
Four is "for".

1013
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:18,890
Square is "squat".

1014
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,810
Why is square squat?

1015
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,850
Square.

1016
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:22,609
Squat.

1017
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,930
They sound similar, right?

1018
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:24,970
Putting them together,

1019
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:27,649
The sine formula reads
"Hill has no squat".

1020
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,890
The cosine formula is
"Squat has no hill".

1021
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,609
Hill has no squat.

1022
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,049
Squat has no hill.

1023
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,009
I think I get it.

1024
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:37,529
You're an idiot
if you still can't get it.

1025
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,290
Kang Jiawei.

1026
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,410
You're a genius!

1027
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:40,450
Even I think

1028
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,129
I might be a genius.

1029
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:41,609
Listen.

1030
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:42,290
I should tell

1031
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,930
those syllabus makers

1032
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,930
about my amazing discovery.

1033
00:38:44,169 --> 00:38:45,529
I should get some credit too.

1034
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:46,970
What did you do?

1035
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,410
I brought out your potential.

1036
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,970
Quick, tell me more

1037
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:50,689
of your tips.

1038
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:51,489
Let me memorize them.

1039
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:52,930
Okay. Let's take a look

1040
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,089
at the tangent and cotangent.

1041
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:55,730
The tangent

1042
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:57,689
is the straight line that just touches

1043
00:38:57,689 --> 00:38:59,209
the curve at that point.

1044
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:00,009
Yes.

1045
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,169
How is Miss Chen?

1046
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,689
She's fine for now.

1047
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:06,770
Whether or not she gets to stay

1048
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:08,129
will depend on

1049
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:09,129
our class' average score in the midterm.

1050
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:12,129
Some parents nowadays

1051
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:12,930
have nothing better to do.

1052
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,169
I pity

1053
00:39:14,169 --> 00:39:14,930
your homeroom teacher.

1054
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,290
Mom.

1055
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,810
Did you put on perfume?

1056
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,009
Can't I?

1057
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,450
You don't usually use perfume.

1058
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:30,970
So?

1059
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:32,850
I read in a book

1060
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:33,770
that once a person

1061
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:35,290
deviates from their daily structure,

1062
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:36,009
their behavior...

1063
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,009
Pause.

1064
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,649
Why are you talking

1065
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,450
as if I'm some criminal suspect?

1066
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,209
Besides,

1067
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:42,649
humans change.

1068
00:39:43,169 --> 00:39:44,689
Just like how you liked football

1069
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,730
in middle school.

1070
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,450
But in high school,

1071
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,009
you prefer basketball.

1072
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:52,290
So will your feelings for Dad

1073
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:53,129
change too?

1074
00:39:58,209 --> 00:39:58,930
No, it won't.

1075
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:02,169
Eat more thigh meat.

1076
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:14,209
I...

1077
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,290
(Give-up Virtuoso)

1078
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,089
