(Dobby is a free elf)

16
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:45,849
If you could have

17
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,730
a real duel with him,

18
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:49,209
you're not Tsukushi anymore.

19
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:50,409
Instead, you're Bruce Lee,

20
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:51,250
Wong Fei-hung,

21
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:52,330
and The Rock Johnson.

22
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,050
Bravo.

23
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,089
I think Gao Zhan

24
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:09,089
takes things seriously.

25
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,290
To him,

26
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:11,649
competition is a serious thing.

27
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:12,969
If you have

28
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,929
nonsense thoughts in your mind,

29
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:15,769
you have no respect for him.

30
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:17,689
Because you don't own a place

31
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,529
in his heart.

32
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,769
All he cares about
is merely the competition.

33
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,050
As long as you stay focused

34
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,209
in something you're good at,

35
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,610
you become strong

36
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,649
and have confidence.

37
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:26,850
You'll shine brightly

38
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:28,929
and draw all the attention to you.

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,689
Only if you don't strain yourself

40
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,410
and devote yourself

41
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,529
to Taekwondo,

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,850
the people

43
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,769
and Gao Zhan will be impressed by you.

44
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,209
Calling it a quit?

45
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:46,969
Sure.

46
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,570
I'm doing it seriously this time.

47
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,010
Xu Jingjing.

48
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,689
You slayed it, Xu Jingjing. Awesome.

49
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:43,890
Good.

50
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:46,089
Bravo!

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,209
Good.

52
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:54,850
Xu Jingjing, you won.

53
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,290
Jingjing, you're amazing.

54
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,730
Was I as strong as The Rock Johnson
just now?

55
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:11,809
You're surely Tsukushi.

56
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:13,410
After Tsukushi beat

57
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,290
Domyoji,

58
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,769
Domyoji fell for her.

59
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,650
Thank you.

60
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:32,410
Thank you.

61
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:34,369
Don't bounce your leg so hard.

62
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,090
Do you think

63
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,329
we can finish them all?

64
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,410
We have time to finish them.

65
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,369
I can bounce my leg myself. Like this.

66
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,610
Boss Xu. Heroine Xu.

67
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,410
Hopefully,

68
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,770
you'll look out for me later.

69
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:58,850
Do you admit you're wrong?

70
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,889
Yes, I do.

71
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,369
Please spare me

72
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,610
if I'd offended you before,

73
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,929
Heroine Xu.

74
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,569
What a bumper harvest.

75
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,689
Awesome.

76
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,850
Not only Class 3
have got the champion,

77
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,689
you also have Queen Kong.

78
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:14,410
No.

79
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,770
I shouldn't call you Queen Kong,

80
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,369
but the Hulk.

81
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:20,650
Hey, you!

82
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,449
You have limited creativity though.

83
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:23,809
The nickname you could think of

84
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,050
is just the elementary.

85
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,489
Gao.

86
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:28,210
What about you?

87
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,610
You always play on the basketball team.

88
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:30,809
I thought you were great.

89
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,129
Yet,

90
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,050
you couldn't even defeat a girl.

91
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,449
True. I couldn't defeat Xu Jingjing.

92
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,610
But, it's much easier
to bring you down.

93
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,290
Hmph.

94
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,129
Trashes like to team up.

95
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,770
Say that again.

96
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:45,889
Well.

97
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,770
Everyone thinks so of you.

98
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,210
You're the good-for-nothing class
who's at the bottom of the rank.

99
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,050
A worthless class.

100
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:51,970
Dapeng.

101
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,050
Trash? Bottom?

102
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,730
How dare you?

103
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:00,210
Well.

104
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,129
Everyone agreed with this.

105
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,050
You rank last

106
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,730
in the sports competitions and exams.

107
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:05,929
Aren't these the glorious achievements

108
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,050
of your class?

109
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,129
Don't you rake up the past scores.

110
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:11,170
If you want to compete,

111
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,249
let's fight on the sports day this time.

112
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:14,170
Sure. Remember what you've said.

113
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:15,410
Do you know

114
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:16,809
the sports day is held next week?

115
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:17,610
Yes.

116
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:19,689
Besides, I also know

117
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:20,809
that our class is going to win

118
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,170
more gold medals than your class.

119
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:22,970
That's right.

120
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,730
If we win,

121
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,009
you have to crawl

122
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,770
around the stadium twice

123
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,290
shouting, "Class 3 is the best".
Do you have the guts?

124
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:31,210
Yes, we do.

125
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,050
If we win,

126
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,970
whenever you

127
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,129
appear before us,

128
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,329
you have to call us "Daddy".

129
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,410
Fine. Don't take advantage of me.

130
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,090
Are you up to the challenge?

131
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,009
Yes.

132
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,369
Wait.

133
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,009
You're a bit rashly.

134
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,889
No, he's not.

135
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,489
Good. We'll see.

136
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:54,610
Let's go.

137
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:07,050
Since we've taken on

138
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,410
the challenge by Class 6,

139
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,290
we must strive with all our might

140
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:11,889
in the coming sports day.

141
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,610
(Humble and Adaptive,
Virtues and Duty)

142
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,970
Sports like men's 100-metre dash,

143
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,449
(Class 3 Men's 800-metre. Medley relay, Men's long jump)
men's shot put, and women's long jump,

144
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,329
(Class 3 Men's 800-metre. Medley relay, Men's long jump)
Class 6 prevails over us

145
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,489
(Class 3 Men's 800-metre. Medley relay, Men's long jump)
in these sports.

146
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,449
While men's 800-metre,

147
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,410
medley relay and men's long jump

148
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,329
are the sports

149
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:24,530
we might compete with them.

150
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,090
Sadly, if even a miracle happens

151
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:27,809
and we win in these sports,

152
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:28,929
our competition will end in a standoff

153
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,970
by three to three.

154
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:31,809
Do you mean we can only even the score

155
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,369
even if a miracle happens?

156
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:34,929
What I'm trying to say

157
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,050
is to discover our forte
in certain sports

158
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,569
that we have the upper hand over them.

159
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,329
Forte?

160
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,410
I'm natural at eating instant noodles.

161
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,369
I can compete in binging bubble tea too.

162
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,050
Stop playing a fool.

163
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,410
Hurdle.

164
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,530
Don't you miss out on Xiong.

165
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,009
He's a professional athlete in hurdling.

166
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,689
No, I can't. I'm a professional athlete.

167
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,569
If I join the competition,

168
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,249
they will accuse me

169
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,369
that it's unfair.

170
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,970
Men's relay.

171
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,009
I think we can do well

172
00:07:59,170 --> 00:07:59,809
in men's relay.

173
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,009
You take the first baton,

174
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,730
Xiong is the anchor.

175
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,530
Kang and I will be the middle sprinters.

176
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,530
Did you forget

177
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:08,850
how Class 6 surpassed us last time?

178
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,730
I can join

179
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,889
the women's 800-metre.

180
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:13,569
Me too.

181
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,809
Are you kidding me?

182
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,889
Jingjing is the best runner
in 800-metre

183
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,210
in our class.

184
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,970
Jingjing, you go.

185
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,410
I can register for

186
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,489
women's relay.

187
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,410
I wasn't in the competition last year,

188
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,850
perhaps I can win this time.

189
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:29,970
I want to participate in the relay

190
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,850
and shot put too.

191
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,650
As well as the 100-metre dash
and long jump.

192
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,410
Hey, girl.

193
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:33,729
We're not in a competition

194
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:34,849
to see who participates in more sports.

195
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,449
Jingjing, don't overexert yourself.

196
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:39,849
Aren't you

197
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,890
the emcee this year?

198
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,209
I'm not sure
if I'll be drafted this year.

199
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,609
Who else can do better except for you?

200
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,089
What's she talking about?

201
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:48,370
I think you'll be selected for sure.

202
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,050
This is it?

203
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:57,809
They even give them

204
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,650
a couple name, Jingzhan.

205
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:00,650
Jingzhan?

206
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,650
Doesn't this name sound awkward?

207
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,650
Jingzhan couple?

208
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,050
The prince and princess of dreams
descend,

209
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,250
Jingzhan is the honour of Yuming Senior High School.

210
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,770
Not even fish and chips are
a better match,

211
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,250
the curve wrecker and the head turner
are the best.

212
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,809
What a lame doggerel.

213
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,050
How do I sign up to be an emcee?

214
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:25,609
Everyone can sign up for that.

215
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,890
And the students will vote.

216
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,050
All students can sign up to be an emcee

217
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,569
and vote for the emcee?

218
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,689
Every candidate

219
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,209
has a homepage

220
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,010
for their

221
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,809
self-introduction,

222
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:35,650
photo,

223
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,929
and electoral pledge.

224
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,290
Does Gao Zhan

225
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:45,929
register for that this year?

226
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,329
Actually, he didn't register
last year.

227
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,890
Someone secretly registered for him.

228
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,370
But, Gao Zhan has told everyone

229
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:51,729
that he didn't want to be the emcee.

230
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:52,729
What about Xu Jingjing?

231
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:53,890
Did she sign up?

232
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,410
Of course.

233
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,770
Xu Jingjing.

234
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,370
I want to sign up for that.

235
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,130
Wish you good luck.

236
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,609
I give you my drumsticks
in exchange for your help.

237
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:07,490
I'm full.

238
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,490
Did you forget about
the holiday homework?

239
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:13,530
Dobby Xu.

240
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,650
You!

241
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,250
Alright. Fine.

242
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:38,530
Kang Jiawei.

243
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,180
(A History of Western Philosophy)

244
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,209
What are you doing?

245
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,689
Hey.

246
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,010
Stop right there.

247
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:30,650
Am I so gorgeous, right?

248
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:32,969
By the way,

249
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,050
remove the blemishes.

250
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:35,050
Also,

251
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,890
refine the chin.

252
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,609
And lengthen my legs.

253
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,170
Don't you distort the floor.

254
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,849
Enough. Kang Jiawei.

255
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,250
My goodness.

256
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,530
It seems like

257
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,290
he has become

258
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,250
more handsome.

259
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,410
Did he go for plastic surgery?

260
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,530
How come he changed so much
by just losing weight?

261
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,569
What are you doing, Xu Jingjing?

262
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,050
Even if he's slim now,

263
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,569
he's still a fat soul deep inside.

264
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,209
Take your hand back.

265
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,050
This is your original look.

266
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,689
Thank you for using your sleeping time

267
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:46,849
for the training this early morning.

268
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,370
For the sake of Class 3,

269
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:49,370
it's a small matter.

270
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,130
We girls will do our best

271
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,329
in the relay race.

272
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,650
Captain Gao, don't worry.

273
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:54,410
We won't lose it

274
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,010
in the men's relay. Right?

275
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:58,849
Come on.

276
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,569
We can do it.

277
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:09,969
Go, go, go!

278
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,050
Take a photo.

279
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,370
Take a picture of me running handsomely.

280
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,250
Hey, we're running now.

281
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:34,010
Just one, please. Hurry up.

282
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,650
Hey, what are you up to?

283
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,609
Don't be lovey-dovey
early in the morning.

284
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:40,370
Scram.

285
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,290
Don't fabricate rumours.

286
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,290
I was tortured last semester

287
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,170
because of you.

288
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,689
Why did she take your photo?

289
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,569
It's the photoshoot for my election.

290
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,650
I enrol for the emcee.

291
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,849
Hang on.

292
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,609
Are you competing for the emcee too?

293
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:57,609
You too?

294
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,290
I thought I'm going to win this year

295
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:01,370
as Gao Zhan didn't join,

296
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,370
yet you come.

297
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,370
Well.

298
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,729
You're my opponent this year.

299
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,530
I don't care

300
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,050
who's competing
for the candidacy with me.

301
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,530
Anyway, the victory is in the bag.

302
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,569
The shoo-in has gone.

303
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,209
Do you think I'm scared of you,
small fry?

304
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,650
Who are you referring to?

305
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,849
Dapeng.

306
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,170
I feel so sorry for you.

307
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,410
You've worked so much,

308
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:57,770
but your effort is going
to turn in vain.

309
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,449
Kang Jiawei.

310
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,689
Don't cry if you lose.

311
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,809
We're still friends.

312
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:06,929
The selection result is out.

313
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:13,250
First of all,
I'll announce the female emcee.

314
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,089
There's no doubt.

315
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,490
It must be Jingjing.

316
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,130
Am I right?

317
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,689
Congratulations to Xu Jingjing.

318
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:19,770
You won 852 votes.

319
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,809
Bravo!

320
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,449
Okay, stop.

321
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,449
Coming next

322
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,250
is the long-awaited male emcee result.

323
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,290
Congratulations to Kang Jiawei.

324
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,849
You won 1145 votes.

325
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:39,449
You won.

326
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:40,969
I knew it. You slayed it.

327
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:43,609
Well done, Master Kang.

328
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,809
Bai.

329
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,650
Didn't you read the lower part?

330
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:48,170
How many votes did I get?

331
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,010
Ni Dapeng.

332
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:53,890
Ni Dapeng.

333
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,449
14000 votes.

334
00:15:57,969 --> 00:15:58,530
I won.

335
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:01,050
I won.

336
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,650
Xiong.

337
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,089
Look, he slayed it.

338
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,010
I can't believe

339
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,130
he defeated the school hunk.

340
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,250
Stay lowkey.

341
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,170
Actually, every candidate is good.

342
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,050
Ni Dapeng.

343
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:13,929
When I checked the polls
yesterday night,

344
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,609
you only got over 200 votes.

345
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,849
Besides, there's only

346
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,969
1500 students in our school.

347
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,290
What's wrong with
the extra ten thousand votes?

348
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,329
Xu Jingjing.

349
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:21,689
I'm well known

350
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:23,010
not even in this school.

351
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,569
That's right. We have lots

352
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,410
of buddies and friends.

353
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,410
Dapeng, I voted for you.

354
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,729
I know. I have many relatives too.

355
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:28,650
Tush, tush.

356
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:30,329
Do you have ten thousand people
in your family?

357
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:32,170
I do. Yesterday night,

358
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,770
my 86 uncles

359
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:33,770
voted for me.

360
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:34,689
You better own up.

361
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:35,170
What are you doing?

362
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:36,010
Did I offend you?

363
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,010
Hey.

364
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,170
What do you want from me?

365
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,530
You've wronged me. Headlock?

366
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:41,050
Xiong Shuai. Stab her
with Six Meridians Divine Sword.

367
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,290
- Stab her.
- Stop fooling around.

368
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,689
Dapeng, even if you refuse to confess,

369
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,729
the backend of the school website

370
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:49,530
will detect the data anomaly anyway.

371
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,969
And everyone will know about it later.

372
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,650
I cheated by duplicating the votes.

373
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,130
Xu Jingjing, wait for me.

374
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,410
I'll enrol for it

375
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,250
next year.

376
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,690
Then, the male emcee

377
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,369
of the coming sports day goes to

378
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,970
Kang Jiawei.

379
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,609
I knew Dapeng wouldn't win.

380
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,530
Yesterday night,

381
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:33,730
your votes were far ahead of him.

382
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,770
But, you should thank Gao Zhan.

383
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,490
If it wasn't for him,

384
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:38,730
Dapeng wouldn't have owned up.

385
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:42,450
Thank you.

386
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,250
What's wrong with you?

387
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:46,569
Why did you say this suddenly?

388
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,889
I'm not used to it.

389
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:48,809
Didn't you say

390
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:49,849
that I'm your domesticated elf?

391
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:03,970
What's wrong with you?

392
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,290
I hereby announce

393
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:09,970
the bet terminates.

394
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,409
You're free now, Dobby Xu.

395
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,409
Seriously?

396
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,250
I'm on cloud nine now.

397
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,169
Thank you.

398
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,089
Thank you.

399
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,569
Thank you so much.

400
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,970
Thank you.

401
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,169
What's wrong with you?

402
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,649
I'm quite touched

403
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,210
when you argued with Dapeng.

404
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:37,730
Why would I not argue with him?

405
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,530
I have put in so much effort

406
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,609
to support you

407
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,129
for the emcee election.

408
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:41,849
I'd say

409
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,129
it's our honour.

410
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,490
You must take this opportunity

411
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,930
to improve your relationship

412
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,050
with Gao Zhan

413
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,210
in the sports day.

414
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:50,889
You too.

415
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,490
You must grab this chance

416
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,930
to improve your relationship

417
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,290
with Xu Jingjing.

418
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:58,250
Yes!

419
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,300
(Grade 11 Class 4)

420
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,620
(Humble and Adaptive,
Virtues and Duty)

421
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:06,889
What time did you go to bed yesterday?

422
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:07,889
Nine.

423
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:08,730
Are you going to challenge 800-metre?

424
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,450
800-metre.

425
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,569
You got up early, trash.

426
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,250
How should I describe this?

427
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,450
Clumsy birds have to start flying early?

428
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,889
Like this.

429
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:21,770
Right.

430
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,690
Yeah.

431
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,649
Why is a dog barking
in this early morning?

432
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:25,730
Did you hear the bark?

433
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,129
Yes. It sounds like a real dog barking.

434
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,250
Sounds like?

435
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,329
It's actually a dog barking.

436
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,210
Xiong Shuai. Are you taking part

437
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:35,250
in the hurdle?

438
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,290
If you do,

439
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,409
you can't lose.

440
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:39,329
No.

441
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,569
You even failed to be selected
for the provincial team.

442
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,089
Are you going to sell vegetables

443
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,609
with your parents?

444
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:45,690
Don't you go too far.

445
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,050
How much are the potatoes per jin?

446
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:47,730
Give me two jin.

447
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,530
How dare you?

448
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,290
Do you want to pick a fight?

449
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,169
Come on.

450
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,569
Come and beat me.

451
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,770
Let's compete in the competition.

452
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,010
Sure, I'll see you at the competition.

453
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,649
Do you mean the wet market

454
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:03,409
or the wholesale market?

455
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,609
I can't stand it anymore.

456
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:05,369
Beat him.

457
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,290
Very well done.

458
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,290
You excel in nothing

459
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:46,369
except picking a fight.

460
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,129
Miss Chen.

461
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:50,849
This isn't the first time

462
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,809
Class 6 provoked us.

463
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:53,889
They always

464
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:54,809
infuriated us first.

465
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:55,930
That's right.

466
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,450
We can't stand it anymore.

467
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,369
Silent.

468
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:04,409
I think you should stick to

469
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:05,569
your own proposition and thoughts.

470
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:08,089
Don't let others affect you.

471
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:13,930
I don't want to reprimand

472
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:16,889
anyone of you

473
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,970
on this matter.

474
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,450
She wouldn't reprimand us?

475
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,250
If I were a high schooler

476
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,450
and be in

477
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:26,690
Xiong Shuai's shoes,

478
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,050
probably I wouldn't have

479
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,569
kept me in check
when I encountered this.

480
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:32,329
However,

481
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:35,210
is fighting the only way

482
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,050
to deal with this?

483
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:38,250
Miss Chen.

484
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:39,609
I'm at fault.

485
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:40,730
I won't do this again.

486
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,690
Did you win the fight?

487
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:44,730
We won.

488
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,329
Of course, we won.

489
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,490
Certainly.

490
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,649
How do you feel about it?

491
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,649
Great.

492
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,450
I feel so great.

493
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,290
Then, use that passion

494
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,970
during the sports day.

495
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,649
Let's defeat them again

496
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,770
proudly.

497
00:21:59,169 --> 00:21:59,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

498
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:01,730
Miss Chen, don't worry.

499
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:03,329
We'll definitely defeat Class 6

500
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:04,569
and prove them wrong.

501
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,849
That's right.

502
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:07,649
We'll bring them down with
the performance on the sports day

503
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:09,210
and the examination.

504
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,050
I'll fully support you.

505
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,889
Thank you, Miss Chen.

506
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,250
- Thank you, Miss Chen.
- Thank you, Miss Chen.

507
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,089
Gao Zhan.

508
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,129
Do you have anything to say?

509
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,970
To be honest,

510
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,770
we don't stand a chance to win.

511
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:33,250
Miss Chen.

512
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,889
What about I join the marathon?

513
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,930
Marathon? What's that?

514
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:37,849
The grand finale of the sports day,

515
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,609
the mini-marathon.

516
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,250
The distance is five km.

517
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,369
Can you manage this?

518
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,889
Isn't that female students
aren't allowed

519
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,050
to participate in the mini marathon?

520
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,450
Don't you know about that?

521
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:49,970
That's not true.

522
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,730
Actually,

523
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:52,690
this sport was cancelled

524
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:53,849
because only
a few female students joined.

525
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:55,809
But, I don't think
it should work this way.

526
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:56,970
Even if there are not many participants,

527
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,250
the female group
shouldn't be called off.

528
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,450
At least there are
still participants joining.

529
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:01,530
I agree with Jingjing.

530
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:03,290
Girls shouldn't be deprived
of their right

531
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,369
to participate in the competition

532
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:05,770
because of the small number
of applicants.

533
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,649
I will register for this.

534
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:07,490
Me too.

535
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,930
- Me either.
- I want to join.

536
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,010
- I want to take part in that.
- Me too.

537
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,210
Marathon is unlike the relay race.

538
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:12,490
The participants need perseverance.

539
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,609
If you can't even

540
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,849
win the 800-metre with good ranking,

541
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:16,530
I don't recommend you
to take part in the marathon.

542
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,649
Well.

543
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,849
I think my record in 800-metre

544
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,649
is good.

545
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:20,849
Also,

546
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,970
I practice Taekwondo

547
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,050
and I believe my physique

548
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,369
is stronger than the girls.

549
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,450
Besides,

550
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:26,730
it's the first marathon we have,

551
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,369
probably many students

552
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:29,770
wouldn't dare to register for it.

553
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,690
Therefore,

554
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,369
our class stands a chance to win.

555
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,409
Don't you forget Li Huiya from Class 6

556
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,770
is a student-athlete too.

557
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:41,530
Let me ask you this, Gao Zhan.

558
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,210
Are you afraid of Niu Junfeng?

559
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,290
Why would I?

560
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:48,369
If you aren't afraid of him,

561
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:49,730
so am I.

562
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,490
But, you participate in both relay race

563
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,649
and marathon.

564
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,970
Don't you get tired?

565
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,169
No.

566
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,770
If you are worn out,

567
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,690
you'll fail

568
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:05,930
in the two competitions.

569
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:07,250
I advise you

570
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,649
to give up on 800-metre

571
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,770
and just focus on the marathon.

572
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,730
Xu Jingjing, I'll support you.

573
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,169
If you win the competitions,

574
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,809
I'll buy Häagen-Dazs for Class 3.

575
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,169
I'll buy drinks for all 11th graders,

576
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,050
except for Class 6.

577
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,290
Thank you, everyone. I'll do my best.

578
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:26,129
Come on.

579
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,290
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

580
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,849
- Come on.
- Go, Xu Jingjing.

581
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,649
You can do it.

582
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,730
This is ridiculous.

583
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,169
Why not?

584
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,369
This sport has always been

585
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:49,730
for the male students.

586
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,450
But, I came to register for it now.

587
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,730
There's a female student now.

588
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:54,490
Xu Jingjing.

589
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,089
Do you think

590
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,290
you can get your own way

591
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,129
as your maths result

592
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,649
has slightly improved?

593
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,250
I'd like to remind you

594
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,050
that you're still at the bottom
of the ranking.

595
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:05,970
Mr. Zhang.

596
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,409
That's two different things.

597
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,569
Besides,

598
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:09,889
isn't it that students are encouraged

599
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,530
to develop into all-rounders?

600
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:13,250
Am I wrong to take part in running?

601
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:14,010
You can run.

602
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,329
100-metre, 400-metre,

603
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,569
or 800-metre, choose it.

604
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,089
I want to join the mini-marathon.

605
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:20,169
Mr. Zhang.

606
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,050
Please let me join it.

607
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,409
We're not discussing this anymore.

608
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,490
I'm busy now.

609
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,649
You may leave now.

610
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,970
I beg of you.

611
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:27,849
Stop

612
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,849
kicking up a fuss before me, okay?

613
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,129
Go now.

614
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:35,970
Now.

615
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,169
Does Mr. Zhang

616
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,369
disapprove of our class?

617
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:44,849
I think he only disapproves of me.

618
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:50,849
Why not just go for 800-metre?

619
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:51,889
It's easier for you.

620
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,169
Why would I?

621
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,169
I must join

622
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:55,609
the marathon.

623
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,129
I'll support you

624
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:00,930
no matter what you do.

625
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:06,730
Why are you staring at me?

626
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,490
Kang Jiawei, you've changed.

627
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,369
You used to have a sharp tongue.

628
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,050
Because I think

629
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,609
your persistence on this

630
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,169
is meaningful.

631
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:24,530
Plus,

632
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,690
the rule is unreasonable.

633
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,089
Why are girls banned
from running a marathon?

634
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,970
Our priority now

635
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:29,970
is that we must come out

636
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:30,649
with a plan.

637
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:31,849
What's it?

638
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,369
What about we make a petition?

639
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,730
Good idea.

640
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,609
What about this?

641
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,290
I'll collect the signature
from all female students

642
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,089
to let Zhang Chang'an know

643
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,450
that girls have the right
to run the marathon.

644
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,129
I'll collect it from the boys.

645
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,129
Good.

646
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:46,809
Let's go.

647
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:58,889
It's too difficult for me.

648
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,089
Writing a petition

649
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,849
is so much more difficult than
solving maths problems though.

650
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,849
Have you gone to bed?

651
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,210
Not yet. What's up?

652
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:15,690
The petition.

653
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,329
Well-written.

654
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,770
I wrote this petition.

655
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,210
You can take it as your reference.

656
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,849
Not bad.

657
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,089
I'll consider

658
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:42,490
about it.

659
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,010
Thank you.

660
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,649
(Distinguished teachers,)

661
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:53,129
(good days.)

662
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,329
(I'm Xu Jingjing from
11th Grade Class 3.)

663
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,050
(On behalf of all students)

664
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,690
(who want to participate
in the mini marathon,)

665
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,169
(I petition the school to allow
our participation in the competition.)

666
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:02,010
(I reckon the school authority)

667
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,250
(should not deprive of the right
of female students)

668
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:04,609
(in participating in any sports.)

669
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,129
(Our society is making headway)

670
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:07,730
(and women have an equal status)

671
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,770
(as the men.)

672
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,849
(If the school)

673
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,089
(allow such an unfair treatment
to existing,)

674
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,450
(this is an inappropriate act.)

675
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,050
(I remember the first day
I entered this school,)

676
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,569
(teachers told us)

677
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,809
(the motto of Yuming Senior High School)

678
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,450
(that's freedom, equality,
wisdom, and creativity.)

679
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:21,210
(However, if female students)

680
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,409
(are forbidden to participate
in the marathon,)

681
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,490
(equality doesn't exist as it should.)

682
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:25,089
(We hope teachers)

683
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,210
(could give us a fair answer.)

684
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,250
Girls can participate

685
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:28,690
in the marathon, for sure.

686
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,129
Why can't it be

687
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:32,290
Xu Jingjing?

688
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,089
She can.

689
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,690
But not in the marathon

690
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:36,609
held by the school.

691
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,169
There're many marathon events

692
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:39,250
outside.

693
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,450
She can sign up for that

694
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:41,490
as she wants.

695
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,730
No one will hinder her.

696
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,329
Mr. Zhang.

697
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:44,129
Chen.

698
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,369
I understand you as a new teacher

699
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,409
have your own thoughts.

700
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:49,930
It's great to have passion.

701
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,770
However, you appear to be not clear

702
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:53,889
about the school

703
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:55,690
has its own tradition

704
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,450
which the tradition

705
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,329
can't simply be overturned.

706
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,450
Banning female students
from marathon event

707
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,369
is our tradition?

708
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,290
There have been no girls

709
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,409
enrolled for this event before.

710
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:08,450
But now

711
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:09,690
there is.

712
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:10,409
We have no reason

713
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:11,649
to hinder them though.

714
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:12,770
Miss Chen.

715
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,530
I think you're aware

716
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,569
of the bet

717
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:17,569
between your class and Class 6, right?

718
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:19,889
Yes.

719
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:22,169
Does it matter

720
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,609
with the bet

721
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:25,250
between the two classes?

722
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:27,930
Are you expecting

723
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:28,889
the school authority to make changes

724
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:29,770
just because

725
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,690
of the childish bet?

726
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,050
I'm not talking about the bet,

727
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,609
but the marathon itself.

728
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:35,329
A marathon held by the school

729
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,369
only allows male students to join

730
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,690
instead of the female students.

731
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,010
Don't you think it's weird?

732
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:39,770
Is it?

733
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,730
Certainly.

734
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,129
Do you expect the school authority

735
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:43,970
to cater to students'

736
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,010
requests whatsoever

737
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,210
and being led

738
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,010
by the nose?

739
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:49,770
Students will cross the line.

740
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,730
For now, Xu Jingjing

741
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,970
requested participation
in the marathon event.

742
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,409
Later, Ni Dapeng will request

743
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:54,490
to play with a handphone during class.

744
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,569
Miss Chen, will you concur with that?

745
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,089
You're too young and naive.

746
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:00,809
Don't put words in my mouth.

747
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:01,930
I'm talking about

748
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,169
something reasonable.

749
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:04,369
Yet, you seem to be deliberately
missing the point.

750
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,530
What did you say?

751
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:08,250
I'm deliberately missing the point?

752
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,690
It's understandable for students
to be impulsive,

753
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,250
but not the teachers.

754
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:12,930
Instead of using your time

755
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:13,930
on all this nonsense,

756
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,369
you better rack your brain

757
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:16,970
to improve the average mark
of your class.

758
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,770
The enrollment rate for the higher education
of Yuming Senior High School

759
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,649
will be ruined

760
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:20,730
by Class 3.

761
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,450
Why do you always

762
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:22,530
divert the topic

763
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,290
when I have different opinions from you?

764
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:24,889
Why don't you admit

765
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,129
that you're inflexible

766
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:27,609
and your thoughts are outdated?

767
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:28,609
Miss Chen.

768
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:29,409
It's fine.

769
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:30,889
You claimed that I'm inflexible
and outdated,

770
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,129
I won't mind it.

771
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,690
Over the years,

772
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:35,930
I've dealt with lots of students

773
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,730
and my experience tells me

774
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,530
that my judgement is never wrong.

775
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,809
True, I agree

776
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,050
that you're experienced.

777
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,089
However, the big difference

778
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:43,770
between you and me

779
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,050
is that I don't want to hold
the students accountable

780
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,609
but to get along well with them.

781
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,210
Miss Chen.

782
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,169
I don't want to hold the students
accountable,

783
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,730
but you instead.

784
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,210
Mr. Zhang, have a seat.

785
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:04,730
You're young, naive,

786
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,169
and impulsive instead.

787
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,490
No, you're not young anymore.

788
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,609
You're just lazy

789
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,369
and take traditions as your excuse.

790
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,609
You never stand in the shoe

791
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,329
of the students.

792
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,490
You even said your judgement

793
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,050
is never wrong.

794
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:18,849
How confident of you.

795
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,530
Because no one dares

796
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,050
to raise an objection against you.

797
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,690
But, I have the guts to do so.

798
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:29,129
Miss Chen.

799
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,169
Continue, Miss Chen.

800
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,369
I've done.

801
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,210
All of us have heard about

802
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:38,210
the fight.

803
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,329
Can you not be sarcastic?

804
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,010
No, I'm not.

805
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,530
The teachers in the group chat
are all freaked out.

806
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:46,889
Did they say that I'm insane,

807
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,490
naive, young, and childish?

808
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,569
They did

809
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:53,730
in the group chat with Mr. Zhang.

810
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:57,490
But in the group without him,
the teachers are complimenting you.

811
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,290
They praise you for being brave
and daring to speak the truth.

812
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:02,010
A group chat without him?

813
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,409
Can you add me to it?

814
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,250
Is this your contact?

815
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,169
You were lying.

816
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,290
The group doesn't exist.

817
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,609
Now, it does. Just the two of us.

818
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:25,530
Do you think

819
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,730
I made it worse this time?

820
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,609
After all, he's the dean

821
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:31,970
and he's experienced.

822
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:33,490
However, concerning this matter,

823
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,730
I'm on your side.

824
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:42,849
Previously, you asked me

825
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,730
what I think of teaching students.

826
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,369
I pondered it for a long time

827
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,169
and kept fixating on it.

828
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:50,730
Sometimes,

829
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:53,409
I think my thoughts

830
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,889
aren't important at all.

831
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,409
I have no idea if my thoughts

832
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,169
would be helpful

833
00:32:58,369 --> 00:32:59,409
for the students or not.

834
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:01,649
Now, I have come around to this.

835
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:04,889
I must convince myself

836
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,050
before I convince my students.

837
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,129
Because there are thoughts

838
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,889
from Mr. Zhang

839
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,690
I could believe in it sometimes.

840
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:13,010
How could I

841
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,649
relay this message to my students?

842
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,409
Nothing is wrong with this,

843
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:17,250
Miss Chen.

844
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:18,290
I support you

845
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,450
to do things in your own way.

846
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:20,730
I mean it.

847
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,970
The entire group supports you either.

848
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,250
The second type

849
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:32,010
is the direction of the current
in the generators.

850
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,849
Alright, let's call it a day.

851
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:38,010
Dismiss.

852
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:38,970
Okay.

853
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,609
- Come on.
- To where?

854
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:41,409
The washroom.

855
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,129
Xu Jingjing.

856
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:45,530
Are you free after school?

857
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,329
What's the matter?

858
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,930
Xu Jingjing

859
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,089
called me to practice

860
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,290
for the script of the sports day.

861
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,369
I'm quite shy.

862
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,809
You go with me.

863
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,970
What's wrong with you?

864
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,530
Don't back down.

865
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,450
Just go.

866
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,450
Besides,

867
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,490
I'm going to send the petition

868
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:08,169
to Mr. Zhang

869
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:09,169
after school.

870
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,569
Are you sure to go alone?

871
00:34:12,209 --> 00:34:12,850
I...

872
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,970
Of course.

873
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:17,370
Worst case scenario would only be

874
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:18,609
that he refuses my request.

875
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,010
Good luck to you.

876
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,490
You too.

877
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:28,289
Kang Jiawei.

878
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,209
What did you say?

879
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:33,649
I was saying

880
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,490
that aside from preparing the script,

881
00:34:34,729 --> 00:34:36,330
we can prepare
for the commentary of the game.

882
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:37,810
We don't have to

883
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:38,970
be as professional as
the sports channel does.

884
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,249
But, we should get ready for it.

885
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,330
There are the jargon terms

886
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:44,810
I prepared last year.

887
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,810
If possible,

888
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,729
you can memorise them.

889
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,689
You're indeed saving me.

890
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:52,649
I know nothing

891
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,530
except for basketball.

892
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:55,490
It's alright. You're smart.

893
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:56,729
You'll get the hang of it very soon.

894
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:58,970
Or I can take charge of the commentary

895
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,530
and you give some response.

896
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,450
I know it. It's like Chandler

897
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:04,810
when he watched the rugby game

898
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:05,890
and screamed

899
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:07,089
pretending he's into the game, right?

900
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,609
Chandler?

901
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:10,850
It's the drama, Friends.

902
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,410
To skip from doing house chores,

903
00:35:12,689 --> 00:35:14,089
Chandler lied to Monica
that he's a big fan of rugby.

904
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:17,490
Is it?

905
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,330
I don't quite remember that.

906
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:20,850
By the way,

907
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:22,689
the emcee has the privilege

908
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:23,890
to be the disc jockey.

909
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:24,530
We can

910
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:25,530
decide on the music

911
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:26,609
during the sports event.

912
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:28,970
That's great.

913
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,050
I can finally

914
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:30,890
play my favourite song list.

915
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:33,169
Let's make it

916
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:34,810
a rock concert, okay?

917
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:36,089
We can play Linkin Park
in the beginning,

918
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,609
then T. Rex.

919
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:38,729
Lastly, we can play Queen

920
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,050
during the award ceremony.

921
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,089
I don't think this will work out.

922
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,810
Many teachers will be there.

923
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:48,450
It's fine.

924
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,169
You decide on the music.

925
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,689
Good. Let's practice the script first.

926
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,209
Okay.

927
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:14,209
Come in.

928
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:17,649
Mr. Zhang.

929
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:23,890
This is the joint letter
from all female students

930
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:25,569
who want to join the marathon.

931
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,010
Their signatures are at the back.

932
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
(I'm a girl and I want to run.)

933
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,129
I got it.

934
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,169
It's my problem.

935
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,689
Mr. Zhang.

936
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:48,850
I should give you more homework.

937
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:52,209
You all have too much free time.

938
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,209
Wait...

939
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,530
We understand

940
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,609
we have put pressure on the school

941
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,729
with the sudden request
for adding the girls' participation.

942
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:00,410
However,

943
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:01,689
we came out with a resolution.

944
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,330
Please hear me out.

945
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,010
Xu Jingjing.

946
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:03,850
The midterm examination

947
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,289
is right after the sports day,

948
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:07,850
yet you're still messing around
with this nonsense.

949
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:08,810
Do you think

950
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,890
you can pass the exam this time?

951
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:10,930
I think you'll break the record

952
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:12,450
for the lowest marks
in the three subjects again.

953
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:14,370
Mr. Zhang.

954
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,129
That's a different matter.

955
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,249
Can't a student with poor grades
in general courses

956
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,609
participate in the sports day

957
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,689
and running event?

958
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,609
I wonder who educate

959
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,810
Class 3.

960
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:24,490
You have no manners.

961
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,729
You should knock on the door
before coming in.

962
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:28,609
Mr. Zhang, did you forget

963
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,890
that it's you who educate us?

964
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,490
Kang Jiawei.

965
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:35,890
Instead of

966
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:36,810
importuning me here,

967
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:37,729
you should

968
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,209
prepare for the emcee script.

969
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:41,890
Do you want to quit the emcee?

970
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,370
No.

971
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:45,930
Kang Jiawei.

972
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:46,729
You better go back

973
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,769
and do your preparation.

974
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,609
It's not related to you. Leave now.

975
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:49,289
Mr. Zhang.

976
00:37:51,129 --> 00:37:52,209
If the female students
are being treated unfairly

977
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:53,089
on the sports day,

978
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:55,330
I'd rather quit the emcee.

979
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,530
Kang Jiawei.

980
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:58,209
Are you deeming the school event

981
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:58,930
a child's play

982
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:00,530
that you can act on your accord?

983
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,129
No.

984
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:01,410
He...

985
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,490
He didn't mean that.

986
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:03,729
That's what I meant.

987
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,370
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhang.

988
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,569
I quit.

989
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,129
Don't be angry, Mr. Zhang.

990
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,930
He's joking.

991
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:15,890
Kang Jiawei.

992
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:20,970
I'm screwed.

993
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,569
What the heck was I doing?

994
00:38:24,129 --> 00:38:25,010
Did I have to do that

995
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,729
for Xu Jingjing?

996
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:27,410
Certainly. Why not?

997
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,649
I must help her. I'm her friend.

998
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:31,569
Kang Jiawei.

999
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,050
You were talking nonsense just now.

1000
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:33,970
Do you know

1001
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,729
you finally got the chance

1002
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,530
to be the emcee with Xu Jingjing?

1003
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:36,810
Why did you give it up?

1004
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,850
Did you hear

1005
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:38,850
that Mr. Zhang was threatening me

1006
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,689
with the emcee role?

1007
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,930
He was saying

1008
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:41,970
that if I insisted to speak up for you

1009
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:42,729
on the marathon event,

1010
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,370
he'll replace me

1011
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,089
with someone else.

1012
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,569
You shouldn't have helped me then.

1013
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,209
I can settle this

1014
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,010
by myself.

1015
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:47,850
Quit saying that.

1016
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:49,370
Don't worry.

1017
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,649
You'll definitely make it
for the marathon.

1018
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,689
I'm sorry, Xu Jingjing.

1019
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,169
I can't

1020
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,209
host the sports event with you.

1021
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,169
Will she feel awkward

1022
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:18,609
if I tell her this face-to-face?

1023
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,160
(Washed-up Artiste: Are you there?)

1024
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:30,970
(Washed-up Artiste: Are you there?)
Are you there?

1025
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,689
No way.

1026
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,689
I can't expose myself for now.

1027
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,169
I think you're right.

1028
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:49,289
Aren't you mad at me?

1029
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:51,450
Why would I?

1030
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,649
We're the emcees for the event.

1031
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,169
Yet, I quit

1032
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,129
and leave halfway.

1033
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,890
I suppose Dapeng

1034
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:58,689
will be your new partner.

1035
00:39:59,129 --> 00:39:59,609
It's fine.

1036
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,609
To be honest, I'm very moved.

1037
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,289
Moved?

1038
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,129
You have a strong bond with Xu Jingjing

1039
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,209
and you're willing to give up the post

1040
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,289
for her.

1041
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:09,729
I'm impressed by that.

1042
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,129
What?

1043
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,370
What would I do that for her?

1044
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:14,729
You've taken me wrong.

1045
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:18,850
I'm doing this for the right

1046
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,649
of all girls in Yuming Senior High School.

1047
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,209
Well, as you wish.

1048
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:25,169
No, I mean it.

1049
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:26,450
Xu Jingjing and I

1050
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:27,649
are just

1051
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,609
pure friends.

1052
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,010
Alright, I know.

1053
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,769
By the way, if you figure out

1054
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:32,930
any plan

1055
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:33,689
to help the girls

1056
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,769
for joining the marathon,

1057
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,689
please tell me.

1058
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,890
I want to help everyone as well.

1059
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,249
I'm off then.

1060
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,530
I'm going to try on the skirt
for the cheerleading squad.

1061
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,490
See you.

1062
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:44,890
See you.

1063
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,890
