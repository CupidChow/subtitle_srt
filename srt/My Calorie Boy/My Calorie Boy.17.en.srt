18
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,370
mimic her Weibo posts?

I don't get what you mean.

Xu Jingjing.

21
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,049
You can tell me

anything.

25

I said I don't want to talk about this.

26
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,970
But don't you think

27
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,209
this is unfair to Xu Jingjing?

28
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:06,129

30

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,370
I really don't want to talk about this.

It's nothing.

35
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,650
Initially, I wanted

36
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,569
to ask

37
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,090
for your recommendation

38

A friend of mine

78
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,970
asked me something recently.

79
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:19,409
But I'm not familiar with it.

80
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,489
Give me some advice.

81
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:23,609
Just tell me what it is.

82
00:04:24,249 --> 00:04:25,330
Well...

83
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,570
It's...

84
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,609
What is it?

85
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,849
Well...

86
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,409
This friend of mine

87
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,530
feels

88
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,409
something unusual is happening.

89
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,010
How so?

90
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,489
My friend keeps

91
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,970
thinking about a girl.

92
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,130
And it happens often.

93
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,770
What does this mean?

94
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,970
I know.

95
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,609
Did the girl owe your friend some money?

96
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,010
Or is the girl

97
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:01,690
looks so beautiful

98
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,130
that your friend envies her?

99
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,090
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

100
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:06,690
Never mind.

101
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,609

103
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:11,770
I didn't ask

104
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,570
if your friend

105
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,369
is a boy or a girl.

106
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,289
A boy.

107
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,770
A boy? Why didn't you
say it earlier, Gao?

108
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,970
You're so smart.

109
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,409
You asked the right person.

110
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:21,729
Let me tell you.

111
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,130
Your friend is most probably

112
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:25,849
into her.

113
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,010
Into her?

114
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:29,809
What do you mean?

115
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,409
Which aspect are you referring to?

116
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,890
Please make it clearer.

117
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,090
It's hard to say.

118
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,210
But at the very least,

119
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,369
he likes the girl.

120
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:42,169
Likes her?

121
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,970
But I'd already known her for some time.

122
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:46,890
You?

123
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,609
No.

124
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,090
I...

125
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,049
I'm referring to my friend.

126
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,650
He'd already known
the girl for some time.

127
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:58,890
I see.

128
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,289
But

129
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,970
why didn't he fall for her before this?

130
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,609
Why does it happen only now?

131
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:07,530
I don't like

132
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,809
Yaoyao before this too.

133
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,210
Let's put it this way.

134
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,489
It's like there's a switch

135
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,489
in his body.

136
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,489
It was turned off previously

137
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,570
but has suddenly turned on now.

138
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:16,849
That simple.

139
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,249
A switch?

140
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,770
It means he's getting wise now.

141
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,010
What does the switch mean?

142
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,489
Why does it suddenly turn on now?

143
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,010
Which mechanism is involved?

144
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,330
Please make it clearer.

145
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:34,330
What are you talking about?

146
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,690
You're getting philosophical here.

147
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,330
I don't have an answer for you.

148
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,530
But I can tell you...

149
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,450
Tell your friend a way.

150
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:44,650
Go on.

151
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:45,570
Well,

152
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,409
if you...

153
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,690
If your friend

154
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,010
wants to tighten the bond

155
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:50,690
with the girl,

156
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:51,970
he needs to keep making his presence

157
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,010
known to the girl.

158
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,690
Just like Yaoyao.

159
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,010
She said she dislikes

160
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:57,690
Chinese pancakes.

161
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:58,970
So I made her French pancakes.

162
00:06:59,169 --> 00:06:59,650
She forbade me

163
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:00,450
to deliver it to the school.

164
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,010
So I delivered it to her home.

165
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,369
What happened next?

166
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:07,609
I was lectured

167
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:08,770
by her parents.

168
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,090
But it doesn't matter.

169
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,249
What matters is this.

170
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:12,049
Didn't you notice

171
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,450
the subtle changes

172
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,890
in my relationship

173
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,929
with her?

174
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,489
No.

175
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,890
Anyway, remember

176
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,169
to relay what I just said

177
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,210
to your friend.

178
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,010
I'll take the field now.

179
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:35,890
A switch?

180
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:51,090
I heard that you and Xu Jingjing

181
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:52,330
had chosen the advanced science stream.

182
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,249
You're so well-informed.

183
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:01,130
It's great

184
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,049
to be in the same class as her.

185
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,289
Actually, Give-up Virtuoso is...

186
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,609
Are you free after school?

187
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,450
Let's do our homework together.

188
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,210
I heard

189
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:12,330
you've chosen
the advanced arts stream too.

190
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:13,210
We can

191
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,409
guide each other in our studies.

192
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:15,609
It's fine.

193
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,489
Just leave it to me,

194
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,690
her master.

195
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,890
Carry on with your business, Gao.

196
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:21,890
I'm not busy.

197
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,570
We chose the Arts.

198
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,289
We have the same goal.

199
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,450
Leave it to me this time.

200
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,650
I'll wait for you

201
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,409
at the school entrance after school.

202
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,290
Gao Zhan wants to help you
with your homework?

203
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,410
Why aren't you excited at all?

204
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:46,970
Why should I?

205
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,210
He must have done

206
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,489
something wrong again.

207
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:50,970
I'll interrogate him later.

208
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:52,849
Think on the upside.

209
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,009
With him, a scholar-lord,

210
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:55,129
giving you free tutoring,

211
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,410
you have higher chances of getting

212
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:57,410
into the advanced stream.

213
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:58,930
I have Master Kang.

214
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,210
That's not right.

215
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:03,769
He's no longer my master.

216
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:05,129
What's the matter?

217
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,529
Since Master Kang
has chosen the science stream,

218
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,769
someone can't bear to part with him.

219
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:11,889
What are you talking about?

220
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,170
It's just

221
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,529
that I've been
his deskmate for a long time.

222
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,050
I won't get used
to having a new deskmate.

223
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,889
I wonder who he'll be harming

224
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,210
in the science stream later.

225
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,050
The latest chapter

226
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:26,369
of My Breakthrough Youth

227
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,649
also talks about class placement.

228
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,810
Because he wasn't placed
in the same class

229
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,090
as the female protagonist,

230
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,649
the male protagonist
secretly cried at home.

231
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,690
I've read it too.

232
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,170
It's pretty interesting.

233
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,009
But

234
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,050
she wasn't aware that she likes

235
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,129
the boy too.

236
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,930
I felt so anxious for her.

237
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:41,810
Jingjing,

238
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:43,090
I recommend that you read it too.

239
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:43,889
I won't.

240
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:44,649
I don't have the time.

241
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,170
I'd rather get some sleep.

242
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,930
By the way,

243
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,090
my dear sisters,

244
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,849
I need a favor from you two.

245
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,570
I bet it's nothing good.

246
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,489
Did you hear anyone talking here?

247
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,170
I indeed have something urgent.

248
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:00,570
What is it?

249
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:03,889
Can you two lend me some money?

250
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,450
Lend me 200 yuan each.

251
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:08,050
200 yuan?

252
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,529
Why do you need so much money for?

253
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,090
I want to buy some workbooks

254
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,810
and top up the online course.

255
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,009
Both of you

256
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,330
are so hardworking every day.

257
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,009
I won't be able to catch up
if I don't work harder.

258
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,249
You've finally come to your senses.

259
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:21,090
Hold on.

260
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,609
What about your pocket money?

261
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,690
I used this month's pocket money

262
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,210
to buy Qi's merch.

263
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,050
Next month...

264
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,009
I promise to pay you back next month.

265
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:31,970
I swear.

266
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:32,769
I'll prepare an IOU.

267
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,410
I have no money.

268
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,529
I have no money.

269
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:36,609
Please.

270
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,249
I really have no money.

271
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,129
Wang Jiayao, do you have any?

272
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,570
No.

273
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:41,450
Please.

274
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:42,970
I beg you two.

275
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,009
I'll cry if you don't lend it to me.

276
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,050
All right. Don't cry.

277
00:10:48,729 --> 00:10:49,930
You really want to learn?

278
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,210
Okay then.

279
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:52,009
Since

280
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,930
you're so eager to learn,

281
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,249
I'll definitely contribute

282
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,129
to your learning.

283
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:56,570
Don't let me down later.

284
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,129
I'll remit it to you later.

285
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:00,009
Which workbooks are you getting?

286
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,489
Do you need my recommendation?

287
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:02,729
Yes.

288
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,609
Come in.

289
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:06,369
Principal Shen.

290
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:08,450
Mr. Zhao,

291
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:09,729
what's the matter?

292
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,090
I'd like to discuss something with you.

293
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:13,609
Take a seat.

294
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:14,769
Okay.

295
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,450
What is it about?

296
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,090
It's not a big deal.

297
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,810
A university friend of mine

298
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,489
is working as a director
at a TV station.

299
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:22,529
He asked

300
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,529
whether our school is interested

301
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,729
in collaborating on a TV show or not.

302
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,249
That's great.

303
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,450
Tell me more.

304
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:28,889
The TV show is called

305
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,129
I Want to Tell You Out Loud.

306
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,609
The teachers and students

307
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,529
will shout out their thoughts

308
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:34,769
from the rooftop

309
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,369
to the teachers and students

310
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,369
standing below.

311
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,410
It sounds great.

312
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,649
But will the filming

313
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,810
take up too much of the students' time?

314
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:46,009
What about this?

315
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,050
Request for a detailed filming plan

316
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,410
from the TV station.

317
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,290
We will

318
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:52,290
discuss it in the meeting.

319
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:53,210
All right.

320
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,050
Are there any questions

321
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,690
you're unsure of?

322
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,369
Gao Zhan,

323
00:11:59,210 --> 00:11:59,810
I've already forgiven you

324
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,529
on the chick matter.

325
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:03,729
I know.

326
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,210
Then, have you done something wrong

327
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:07,249
again

328
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,970
and wanted to atone for it with this?

329
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:10,210
No.

330
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,889
I indeed did not do anything wrong

331
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,729
this time.

332
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,729
So, you're sincere

333
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,129
in helping me with my homework?

334
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:18,690
I want you to take
the advanced arts stream

335
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:19,609
with me.

336
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,369
Speaking of which,

337
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:26,129
I'm not confident in it.

338
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,330
To get the placement,

339
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:29,609
I need to get into
the top 40 in our grade.

340
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,249
In the last midterm exam,

341
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:32,330
I studied so hard

342
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,369
but only managed to rank around 140th.

343
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:35,369
That's wrong.

344
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,690
Your calculation is wrong.

345
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,609
Through Miss Chen,

346
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,249
I saw the name list of our grade.

347
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,369
Amongst the top 140 students,

348
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:45,930
only 65 students

349
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,090
have chosen the arts stream.

350
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,810
You don't need

351
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,290
to improve your ranking

352
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:51,489
from 140th to 40th

353
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,529
but from 65th

354
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:55,410
to the top 40.

355
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:58,330
You're right.

356
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:01,249
It's not from 140th to 40th

357
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,889
but 65th to 40th.

358
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:05,690
Do you feel

359
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:06,849
more relaxed thinking this way now?

360
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,889
And the arts stream students

361
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,330
need to be good at maths.

362
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:12,410
As long as

363
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:13,769
you have a higher maths score,

364
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,090
you'll have a higher chance of getting

365
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,129
into the advanced arts stream.

366
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:17,410
Then, I'll focus

367
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:18,330
on maths.

368
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,889
Kang Jiawei?

369
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,849
How come you're here?

370
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:26,009
Why can't I be here?

371
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:27,649
You don't own this milk tea shop.

372
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:32,570
I came here for revision.

373
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:33,649
I'm not welcome here?

374
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:35,050
Come over then.

375
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,009
Let's study together.

376
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,050
No need.

377
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,090
Sit down.

378
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,810
I want to be alone.

379
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,810
Whatever.

380
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:46,889
Let's carry on.

381
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:52,090
Get this question now?

382
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,330
This question

383
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:54,210
is about functions.

384
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,090
If you come across

385
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:55,930
similar questions again,

386
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,210
be sure to study them carefully.

387
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:57,970
Okay.

388
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,260
(Intensive Mathematics Drills
for High School)

389
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,769
Xu Jingjing,

390
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,050
have you decided on the university

391
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,970
you want to get into?

392
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,410
University?

393
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,009
I haven't thought about it.

394
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:20,050
But my dad

395
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,290
must have already decided it for me.

396
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,609
Don't you have any major
you're interested in?

397
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:32,889
Actually, I

398
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,529
don't have any dreams.

399
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,090
If I could major in sleeping,

400
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,489
I'd definitely apply to that university.

401
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:39,930
By the way, when you were sleeping

402
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:40,769
in the hospital previously,

403
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:41,649
I recorded you.

404
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,249
Let me find it for you.

405
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:47,249
You even snored.

406
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:48,090
I...

407
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,210
You recorded a video of me?

408
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:51,090
Yes.

409
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,090
But I suggest

410
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:53,170
that you get a medical checkup.

411
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:54,249
Snoring is likely

412
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,210
caused by rhinitis.

413
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,050
In serious cases,

414
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:57,570
it may cause respiratory failure.

415
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:58,290
All right. I'll get a checkup.

416
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,170
Delete the video, and I'll go.

417
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,129
You...

418
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:01,849
Xu Jingjing!

419
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,290
What is it?

420
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,050
I can't keep it from you anymore.

421
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,050
I want to tell you the truth.

422
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:15,729
You're my

423
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,050
Give-up Virtuoso!

424
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,810
I found Xu Jingjing has been mimicking

425
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,170
your Weibo posts.

426
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,050
She keeps imitating you.

427
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:32,970
And I'm the one

428
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:33,970
who truly understands you

429
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,729
and your bad taste.

430
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,529
We are

431
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,369
real

432
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,050
online bosom friends.

433
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,690
So, it turns out that I'm

434
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,769
the Goddess you have been
keeping in touch with.

435
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,930
I'm sorry, Kang Jiawei.

436
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,330
Actually, in my heart,

437
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:07,410
you've always been

438
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,930
the adorable, chubby boy.

439
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,810
My Prince Charming has always been

440
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,290
Gao Zhan.

441
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,009
What's wrong with you?

442
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,690
Just spit it out.

443
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:32,769
Are you going to tell me?

444
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,729
Why are you clenching your fists?

445
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,210
I don't have anything to say.

446
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,290
I've done my homework.

447
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:47,050
I'm leaving now.

448
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,729
Bye.

449
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,410
Is there

450
00:16:59,009 --> 00:16:59,649
something wrong

451
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,970
with him here?

452
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:01,889
Who knows

453
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,129
what he's up to today.

454
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,529
I feel so miserable!

455
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,650
The earlier I face it,
the earlier it will be over.

456
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,410
I just need to tell them both.

457
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:30,210
No way.

458
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,089
If I tell them,

459
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:33,729
Xu Jingjing will surely

460
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,729
feel embarrassed.

461
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:35,650
Xu Jingjing

462
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:36,930
will laugh at me for life.

463
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,249
Use the distance formula.

464
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:44,890
Even if you get the final answer wrong,

465
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:46,769
you'll still get marks

466
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,690
for the steps.

467
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:49,850
So, the distance formula

468
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,170
is the most practical and safest formula

469
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,249
for you.

470
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,410
Okay. Let me try it.

471
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,729
Good morning.

472
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,450
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

473
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:57,850
Study it on your own then.

474
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,370
What was wrong with you yesterday?
Are you okay?

475
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:15,769
Why are you using this method

476
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,650
to solve the value of K?

477
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:19,210
What's the matter?

478
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:20,569
Shouldn't I use

479
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:21,930
the distance formula for this question?

480
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,529
There are

481
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,650
three methods to solve this question.

482
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:25,809
The first is

483
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:27,410
the distance formula.

484
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,890
The second is the collinear vectors.

485
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:30,089
The third is the slope ratio method.

486
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,850
But Gao Zhan said the distance formula

487
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,009
is the simplest.

488
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,249
It's also the dumbest.

489
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,170
Come on.

490
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,569
I'll teach you the slope ratio method.

491
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:40,729
No need.

492
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,130
Gao Zhan said...

493
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,009
He said

494
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,769
although more steps
are involved for this method,

495
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,210
I can score some marks on the steps.

496
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:47,289
If there are lesser steps,

497
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:48,529
one wrong step will lead to a zero mark.

498
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,089
Why didn't he say that lesser steps

499
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,009
will save you more time

500
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,049
during the exam?

501
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:52,809
You can

502
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,130
double-check your answers.

503
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:55,370
But what Gao Zhan meant is...

504
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:56,009
He wants...

505
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,410
Why do you keep mentioning him?

506
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,489
I just don't get

507
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,450
why you insist on using

508
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,210
such a dumb method.

509
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,650
Just because Gao Zhan taught you so?

510
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:05,809
Kang Jiawei, what's wrong with you?

511
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,049
Why are you taking it out on me?

512
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,489
Ridiculous.

513
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,410
What was wrong

514
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,049
with Master Kang this morning?

515
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:32,450
Just let it go.

516
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,089
Calm down.

517
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,970
It was only a question.

518
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,970
What for?

519
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,450
I feel

520
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,049
Gao Zhan has his own solution.

521
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,850
Don't you know

522
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:43,249
that the scholar-lords

523
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,769
are competing for their own pride?

524
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,329
I feel Master Kang has been

525
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:48,569
out of his mind recently.

526
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,769
One moment, he brings me some food.

527
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,930
Another moment, he scolds me.

528
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,329
He's totally out of his mind.

529
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,009
Why are you laughing?

530
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:00,489
The online teacher

531
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,769
has given a question on functions.

532
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:03,850
I finally understood it
after watching it five times.

533
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,809
Looks like the 400 yuan

534
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:07,809
did not go to waste.

535
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,289
Let's hope so.

536
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:10,970
Keep going!

537
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:11,930
Keep going!

538
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:23,009
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

539
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,970
Tell me. What have you done wrong?

540
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,210
I shouldn't be impulsive.

541
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,170
I shouldn't talk to you like that.

542
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:29,970
I shouldn't get angry.

543
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:30,850
You're wrong.

544
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,089
You shouldn't say

545
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:33,329
that Gao Zhan's method is dumb.

546
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,329
But...

547
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,769
I shouldn't say
that Gao Zhan's method is dumb.

548
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,610
You're not mad at me now?

549
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,970
Well...

550
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,170
I guess so.

551
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:54,089
What date is it now?
Why do you still make so much noise?

552
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,130
You're fully prepared
for the placement exam?

553
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,329
Miss Chen,

554
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,529
don't scare us.

555
00:20:58,769 --> 00:20:59,450
The placement exam

556
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,809
has nothing to do with us.

557
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,809
That's right.

558
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:02,529
Only around 100 students

559
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:03,809
will be selected
for the advanced stream.

560
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,210
We don't stand a chance at all.

561
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:06,130
Yaoyao,

562
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:07,410
please don't get
into the advanced stream.

563
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,850
Touch wood.

564
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:09,809
Don't you need

565
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,289
to study hard for the final exam?

566
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:16,690
Is this how

567
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,410
you welcome Grade 12?

568
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,289
Exams are never

569
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,210
about someone else

570
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:25,890
and rankings.

571
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,729
Regardless of your results

572
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,410
in the upcoming placement exam,

573
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,289
it's a testament

574
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:34,769
that you've studied hard for it.

575
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:36,329
Get it?

576
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,450
Yes!

577
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,940
(Lu Xiaobai)

578
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,130
Hello, Xiaobai.

579
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,130
Hello, Jingjing.

580
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,729
The most beautiful

581
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,049
and adorable Jingjing.

582
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:01,529
I need a favor from you.

583
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:02,809
What is it?

584
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:03,970
Want to borrow money again?

585
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,410
No.

586
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,009
If...

587
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,569
I mean if

588
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,769
my parents call you

589
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,970
and ask about me,

590
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,089
can you tell them
that I'm living in your house

591
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,249
to study together on the weekend?

592
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,289
Tell them that you're
at my house this weekend?

593
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,249
Why?

594
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,450
To cover it up for me.

595
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,890
Where are you going?

596
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:23,370
I...

597
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,170
Don't ask, Jingjing.

598
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,729
I need to leave for some matters.

599
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,529
Please.

600
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,009
I'll hang up now.

601
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,130
Love you. Bye.

602
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,210
Hey!

603
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,650
Is Lu Xiaobai out of her mind?

604
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,249
The placement exam
will take place next week.

605
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,249
The number you dialed is switched off.

606
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,089
Only you can help me now.

607
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,089
Hurry up and find a solution.

608
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:54,729
Xiaobai has gone missing.

609
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,809
She has turned her phone off.

610
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:56,970
Calm down first.

611
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:57,970
Try to recall.

612
00:22:58,249 --> 00:22:59,089
Anything amiss with her

613
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:00,009
in the past two days?

614
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,249
Yes.

615
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,809
She said she wanted to study hard.

616
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,009
And she borrowed 200 yuan

617
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:04,809
from Wang Jiayao and me each

618
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,170
to buy some learning materials.

619
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,809
200 yuan each?

620
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,009
She must have already left Wuxi.

621
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:13,970
Otherwise, no matter how busy she is,

622
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,410
she will have time to go home.

623
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:17,249
Where did she go then?

624
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,329
Is her favorite celebrity

625
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:19,529
holding any event recently?

626
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:21,249
Let me check.

627
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:24,049
(Qi's Fans Meeting)
Yes, indeed.

628
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,690
Qi will be holding
a meet-and-greet event

629
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,850
in Beijing tomorrow.

630
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,170
She must be going there then.

631
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:31,769
What should we do now?

632
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,729
Let's get to the train station now

633
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,489
and look for her.

634
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,130
Wait a moment.

635
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:34,729
When did she

636
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,610
call you?

637
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:38,610
Half an hour ago.

638
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,850
Was it noisy over there?

639
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:41,249
No.

640
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,289
I remember it was rather quiet.

641
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:42,970
Then, she must be

642
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,210
in a cab.

643
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,489
I've checked it.

644
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:48,049
There is no train

645
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,249
or high-speed train to Beijing now.

646
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:50,289
But there is

647
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,529
a flight at 10.50 pm.

648
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:52,329
She must be planning

649
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:53,569
to fly to Beijing.

650
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,529
But is the small sum

651
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,850
enough for the flight tickets?

652
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:58,410
Often, night flights

653
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,289
are sold at special fares.

654
00:23:59,529 --> 00:23:59,970
If we hurry over now,

655
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:00,890
we can get there in time.

656
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:01,410
Let's go.

657
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:01,970
Okay.

658
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:02,970
Inform Miss Chen too.

659
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:08,370
Miss Chen.

660
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,729
Any news?

661
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:11,049
Her phone is still turned off.

662
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,809
Let's search inside.

663
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:13,610
Come on.

664
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:19,930
Let's split up and find her.

665
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:20,729
Go over there.

666
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,210
Okay.

667
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:21,930
Okay.

668
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:47,569
How is it? Did you find her?

669
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,650
What if

670
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:50,249
she has boarded the plane?

671
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:52,410
Don't worry.

672
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:54,089
Even if she has boarded the plane,

673
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:54,729
as a grown-up,

674
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,009
she won't lose her way.

675
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,769
I'm such a fool.

676
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,130
Why didn't I keep an eye out

677
00:24:59,289 --> 00:24:59,690
for her

678
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,089
when she borrowed money from me?

679
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:04,970
It's not your fault.

680
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:06,809
What if she gets into a suspicious cab

681
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,049
when she arrives,

682
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,370
is sent to a suspicious hotel,

683
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:10,210
and comes across bad guys?

684
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,610
Will the money I lent her

685
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,049
enough for her to last a weekend?

686
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:17,970
Let's continue the search.

687
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,289
Then, what do you like?

688
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,569
I like Qi.

689
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:32,329
I like his songs,

690
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,450
variety shows,

691
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,769
and everything.

692
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:39,489
Qi!

693
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,210
Qi!

694
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:42,210
Qi!

695
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:43,610
Where's Qi?

696
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:44,289
May I know

697
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,690
where Qi is?

698
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:48,249
Stop there!

699
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:53,650
Forget about running away.

700
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:02,489
I'll tell you a secret.

701
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,249
Actually, I like Qi too.

702
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,289
Bring me along

703
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,009
to his meet-and-greet event.

704
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:11,130
Miss Chen,

705
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,289
you must be kidding me.

706
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:15,729
You do know

707
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,210
that I'm kidding you.

708
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,890
What date is it now?

709
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,729
The placement exam
will take place next week.

710
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,970
Don't tell me you're clueless.

711
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,529
For me, it's a final exam.

712
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:30,370
Are you saying
the final exam isn't as important?

713
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,210
Don't you want to get into Grade 12

714
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,329
and graduate?

715
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,170
Miss Chen,

716
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,690
I can take the replacement exam.

717
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,210
You've got nerve.

718
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,370
I promise

719
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,410
I'll go with you next time.

720
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,130
I'll pay for the tickets,

721
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:46,850
okay?

722
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,729
But what if...

723
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,370
What if there is no next time?

724
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:50,089
What if

725
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:51,329
I have something on next time?

726
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,210
Or I like someone else already?

727
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:55,650
There is a shelf life
to being rebellious.

728
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:58,450
Before I turn into an adult,

729
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,450
I want to be rebellious more.

730
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,729
Nothing is more exciting

731
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,289
than stolen freedom.

732
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:09,489
Where did you hear this from?

733
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,890
From my recent

734
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:12,249
most favorite novel.

735
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,049
My Breakthrough Youth?

736
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,130
Miss Chen,

737
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,729
you're so knowledgeable.

738
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:23,610
You really like it?

739
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,009
I think he understands us very well.

740
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,529
He has many golden words

741
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:29,690
and is humorous.

742
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,130
To be honest,

743
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:36,089
the author

744
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,650
is my university classmate.

745
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:39,210
Really?

746
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,450
I'm a stan.

747
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:43,529
I think he's quite right.

748
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:44,890
If I don't

749
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,009
do it now,

750
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:48,049
I'll surely regret it one day.

751
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:51,489
Then, do you know

752
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,370
how You Mei, the person who said so,

753
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,249
has ended up?

754
00:27:58,489 --> 00:27:59,130
She regretted

755
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,450
her impulsive

756
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:01,690
decision.

757
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,650
Miss Chen,

758
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:06,769
I'm not a kid anymore.

759
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,569
Don't make up such a story

760
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,970
to coax me to go home.

761
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,009
Who's treating you as a kid here?

762
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,329
If you don't believe me,

763
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:14,970
I can give you the author's contact.

764
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,690
Ask him yourself.

765
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,690
Really?

766
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:17,970
I want it.

767
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,650
You want it?

768
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,450
No problem.

769
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:26,130
Then, follow me back and take your exam.

770
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:29,489
Xiaobai.

771
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,089
Jingjing.

772
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,970
You shouldn't do this.

773
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,009
You scared us out of our wits.

774
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,450
Xiaobai, let's go home with us.

775
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:39,930
Let's go.

776
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:45,890
Let's go.

777
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,329
Don't be mad at me, Jingjing.

778
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:48,170
How dare you smile?

779
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:53,569
Detective Gao,

780
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,249
thank you so much for today.

781
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:56,329
Without you,

782
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,729
Xiaobai would have already

783
00:28:57,729 --> 00:28:58,410
landed in Beijing.

784
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,450
That's nothing.

785
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,450
We're classmates.

786
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,690
You were so worried
that you almost cried just now.

787
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:08,329
Don't talk about it.

788
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,650
I feel embarrassed.

789
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,370
By the way,

790
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:15,489
when I was rebellious that time,

791
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:16,930
did you look for me

792
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:17,809
the same way too?

793
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,850
I was worried.

794
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,130
I was afraid something
had happened to you.

795
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:22,450
What will you do

796
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,410
if something really happens to me?

797
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,850
I'll go all out to find you.

798
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:31,370
Well, I've reached home.

799
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,489
I'll get inside now.

800
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,809
Go on.

801
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:34,930
See you on Monday.

802
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:35,809
See you on Monday.

803
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:47,370
Kang Jiawei!

804
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,249
Kang Jiawei,

805
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,089
I've been calling you.

806
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:51,850
Why didn't you respond?

807
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:52,850
I'm listening to songs.

808
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:55,089
Please turn down the volume.

809
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:56,809
Loud noise isn't good for the ears.

810
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:57,850
I like it so.

811
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:00,809
Have you just taken the gunpowder?

812
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,049
I'm concerned about you.

813
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,450
By the way,

814
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:05,690
have you heard of our hunt

815
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:07,329
at the airport?

816
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,410
A hunt?

817
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:10,650
You were only looking for a person.

818
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,890
It was really a hunt.

819
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,089
Why don't you try it yourself?

820
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,210
It's downright looking
for a needle in a haystack.

821
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,850
But to be honest,

822
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,450
Xiaobai was so good at acting.

823
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,170
She had fooled Wang Jiayou

824
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:22,170
and me inexplicably.

825
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:22,769
That's because

826
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,650
it's so easy to fool you.

827
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:24,529
If it were me,

828
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,610
I'd have seen through her immediately.

829
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,970
Keep boasting yourself.

830
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:28,329
But it was thanks

831
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:29,410
to Gao Zhan

832
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,210
for deducing

833
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,130
that Xiaobai was at the airport.

834
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,450
If we were a moment late,

835
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,809
she could have boarded the plane.

836
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:34,970
What's so hard about deduction?

837
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:36,610
I can do it too.

838
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,009
Why didn't you find me last Friday?

839
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,650
What's the matter? Jealous?

840
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:44,769
Why should I?

841
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:45,690
You envy Gao Zhan.

842
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,329
Why should I?

843
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:48,890
Still denying it?

844
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,569
You're the one who admires him so much.

845
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:52,489
After all,

846
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,850
you're the same as Lu Xiaobai.

847
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,690
What do you mean?

848
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,450
What do I mean?

849
00:30:58,009 --> 00:30:58,809
Isn't it for pursuing Gao Zhan

850
00:30:59,009 --> 00:30:59,890
that you want to get into
the advanced stream?

851
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:00,930
How can it be the same?

852
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:01,769
Why not?

853
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:03,370
She's pursuing a celebrity,
and you're pursuing Gao Zhan.

854
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,289
Kang Jiawei, listen up.

855
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,089
I want to be in the advanced stream

856
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:07,450
because I want to get into
a good university.

857
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,850
It's not because of Gao Zhan.

858
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:11,529
Just say whatever you want.

859
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:13,729
What do you mean?

860
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,329
Do you want to fight again?

861
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:17,249
You're the one throwing tantrums,

862
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,130
not me.

863
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:19,690
Please make yourself clear then.

864
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:21,170
What do you mean by "You wanted
to get into the advanced stream

865
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,410
to pursue Gao Zhan"?

866
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,049
Tell me then.

867
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,410
Why must you choose the arts stream?

868
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,329
Have you decided

869
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:26,450
on the university you want to get into?

870
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,170
Did you just follow

871
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:28,890
Gao Zhan's choice of a major?

872
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:29,729
I never...

873
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,289
You've never

874
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,170
had your own opinions.

875
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:32,850
Is it wrong to say

876
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:33,930
that you're the same as Lu Xiaobai?

877
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,690
You're living
in someone's world every day.

878
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,850
What about your own aspiration?

00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,020
♪Without us realizing♪

880
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,329

♪Stopping at the crossroad,

In the end,

00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,890
you just want to laugh at me

884
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,529
for not having an aspiration.

885
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,249
Fine.

886
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:01,769
I've never had an aspiration.

887
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,809
Go on and laugh at me.

888
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,610
That's not what I mean.

889
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:06,049
I'm not laughing at you.

890
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:06,650
That's exactly what you meant.

891
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:07,170
You wanted to say

892
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:07,809
that I'm Gao Zhan's follower,

893
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,610
and I've never had my own opinions.

894
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:09,930
Do you think I desire this?

895

Xu Jingjing.

916

917
00:34:16,689 --> 00:34:18,089
Are you still mad at me?

918
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,049
I didn't mean

919
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:24,129
what I said that day.

920
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,009
Xu Jingjing,

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:29,209
that day, I...

922

Come on. Pull your desk apart.

923
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,770
It's time for the exam.

924

(Lu Xun)

925
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:51,049
All right.

926
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:52,089
Please put down your pen

even if you haven't finished yet.

928
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,009
All right. Stop writing.
Hand over your answer sheets.

929
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,450
How did it go?

930
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,009
I did the right thing
to pull you back, right?

931
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,569
The questions were so simple.

932
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,890
There's hope for you
to get into the advanced arts stream.

933
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:08,730
Did we get

934
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,970
the same exam paper?

935
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:11,250
Lu Xiaobai,

936
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:12,250
don't tell me

937
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,649
that it was difficult for you.

938
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,009
Xu Jingjing,

939
00:35:15,529 --> 00:35:16,169
you've changed.

940
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:18,209
You're not who you were.

941
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:20,049
Jingjing,

942
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:21,169
stop

943
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,049

944
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,730
I didn't.

945
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:28,290
What are your plans for the vacation?

946
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:29,209
I'll binge-watch

947
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,569
Qi's variety shows, of course.

948
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:33,049
Qi, here I come.

949
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,049
You keep thinking about Qi only.

950
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:35,930
How about you?

951
00:35:36,649 --> 00:35:37,450
I want to makeover

952
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:38,450
my room.

953
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,649
Let me tell you.

954
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,089
I've finished my drawings.

955
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,049
Where's my draft?

956
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,169
Can't find it?

957
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:53,009
Gosh, I left my draft behind.

958
00:35:53,209 --> 00:35:53,730
What about

959
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,930
you two wait for me
at the meat skewer restaurant?

960
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:55,609
I'll go back and get it.

961
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,370
Okay.

962
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,290
Go ahead. Bye.

963
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,970
She's so forgetful.

964
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,410
Are you looking for this?

965
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:10,890
No. I...

966
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,850
You aren't looking for this?

967
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,370
But it's better to return it to you.

968
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:24,970
What is this?

969
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,209
I don't know. It's not mine.

970
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:28,209
It's not yours?

971
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:28,810
Don't come near.

972
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:29,850
Don't move.

973
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:33,009
Why...

974
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:34,689
Why is it with you?

975
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,009
Did you read it?

976
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:40,250
Well...

977
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:41,569
That day, I accidentally...

978
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,330
Oh gosh. You...

979
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:45,089
Did you read it?

980
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:54,930
It's well-written.

981
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,009
Do you know that my stomach hurts

982
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:04,689
from laughing?

983
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,569
Stop laughing.

984
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,089
I can't hold it.

985
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,770
I'm completely doomed

986
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:12,569
in front of Gao Zhan this time.

987
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,370
Do you think

988
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:15,649
he'll feel I'm crazy?

989
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:16,970
That's who you really are.

990
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:18,250
Lu Xiaobai.

991
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,089
You think of me

992
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,330
as being crazy?

993
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:20,930
I'm not

994
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,169
as crazy as you as pursuing Qi.

995
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,290
All right. Stop arguing.

996
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:24,730
Why did you only

997
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,450
realize you lost your notebook

998
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:26,450
right before the summer vacation?

999
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:27,450
If you'd found it earlier,

1000
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,250
Gao Zhan wouldn't have read everything.

1001
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,970
I didn't update it recently,

1002
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,290
so I didn't look for it.

1003
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,529
So Gao Zhan knew everything now?

1004
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,370
Yes, everything.

1005
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:40,730
Lu Xiaobai,

1006
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,009
help me check

1007
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:43,209
if any asteroids are going

1008
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,049
to hit the earth.

1009
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,370
That's impossible.

1010
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:47,009
What should I do now?

1011
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:50,209
No way. I'll transfer to another school.

1012
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,169
Don't be anxious, Jingjing.

1013
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,209
Maybe Gao Zhan felt very moved

1014
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:56,529
after reading it.

1015
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,450
I think what Xiaobai said makes sense.

1016
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:01,609
Do you think

1017
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,529
an insensitive guy like Gao Zhan

1018
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,009
understands what feeling moved means?

1019
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,410
Transferring to another school
is still a better choice.

1020
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,569
Forget it, Jingjing.

1021
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,049
It's not the first time

1022
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:10,930
you've embarrassed yourself anyway.

1023
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:11,890
Take it easy.

1024
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,089
Besides, many girls

1025
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,810
like Gao Zhan.

1026
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,450
He must have been used to it now.

1027
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,730
Maybe he has already forgotten it.

1028
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:22,770
I think what you said

1029
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,169
makes some sense.

1030
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,370
Here. Eat some meat.

1031
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:28,370
Cheer up.

1032
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:29,890
Cheer up.

1033
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:31,890
Don't think too much.

1034
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,009
The vacation is around the corner.

1035
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:33,930
I'm excited.

1036
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,370
Didn't you say you want
to makeover your room?

1037
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:36,370
Do you have any plans?

Let me tell you.

1045
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,850
She must be still awake.

1046
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,609
Are you still mad at me?

1047
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,250
That's asking the obvious.

I...

1063
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:37,529
I have something
to look for Xu Jingjing.

1064
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:40,689
You...can go home now.

1065
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:42,129
I've asked her out

1066

to do homework together today.

1067

She's into learning now.

1072
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,689
She has many questions...

1073
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,209
What's going on between you two?

1074
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,569
Look.

1075
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,049
She's asking you what's going on.

1076
