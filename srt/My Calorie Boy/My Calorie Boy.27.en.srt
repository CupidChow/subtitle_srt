(May Fortune Smile On You)

17
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:50,856
The one you're rolling

18
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:51,776
is not round at all.

19
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:53,737
Look who's talking. See yours?

20
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:55,097
All the fillings will leak out

21
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:56,056
when you cook it them.

22
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:57,416
What are you even making?

23
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,416
You better mix the fillings.

24
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:00,216
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Xu.

25
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:01,457
Mr. Xu.

26
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:03,416
Mr. Xu, Happy New Year.

27
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,216
Happy New Year to you too.

28
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:05,257
You even brought things.

29
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:06,017
Mr. and Mrs. Xu, Happy New Year.

30
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:07,097
Happy New Year.

31
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:07,856
Sorry about this.

32
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:08,497
You see.

33
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:09,456
Our family ran into
some issues this year.

34
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:11,016
So we can only rely on you guys now.

35
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:12,537
Oh, come on.

36
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:14,016
We're happy that you came over.

37
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:14,696
You're welcome to join us.

38
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:16,537
Come.

39
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:17,657
You're hanging this Chinese knot, right?

40
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:18,057
Yes.

41
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:18,657
Let me help you.

42
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:19,497
It'd be great since you're tall enough.

43
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:20,337
Over here. That's right.

44
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:21,136
Okay.

45
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:22,337
They're all hung now.

46
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:26,296
Gao Zhan,

47
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:27,657
don't you know how
to release your skills?

48
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:28,657
How do I release it?

49
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:29,856
Use these two buttons.

50
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:30,456
Okay.

51
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:31,136
Try it.

52
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:31,497
Okay.

53
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,296
We're finally home.

54
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:34,136
Use your skills.

55
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:36,896
That one.

56
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:37,696
Kids.

57
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:38,616
Look

58
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:39,817
who's back?

59
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:41,057
Mom is back.

60
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:43,856
Mom.

61
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:47,377
Xu,

62
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,377
you can try

63
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,497
my home cooking.

64
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,337
I've long heard you're a good cook.

65
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:53,296
That's great.

66
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:54,337
Well,

67
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:55,377
I'll say a few words.

68
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,097
You already said it last year.

69
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,377
It should be my turn this year.

70
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:03,257
My wife wants to do it.

71
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:04,657
Okay, you'll do it.

72
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,296
Then I'll say a few words.

73
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:06,616
Okay.

74
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:08,777
I'm a little nervous.

75
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:09,696
Relax.

76
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,217
The Spring Festival

77
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:14,217
is coming...

78
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:14,937
You see.

79
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:15,937
You're a little exaggerating.

80
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:16,537
We're all friends here.

81
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,217
Say something grounded.

82
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:20,176
Something about life.

83
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:20,576
Yes, about life.

84
00:03:20,657 --> 00:03:21,657
Best wishes to Jingjing.

85
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:22,257
Here.

86
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:23,217
Mr. Kang too.

87
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:23,696
Welcome, welcome.

88
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:24,696
Best wishes to my beloved daughter too.

89
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:25,497
Welcome.

90
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:26,736
I wish the three of you

91
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:28,016
to attend a good university

92
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:28,896
next year.

93
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:29,736
I like that.

94
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:31,097
Also, enjoy your meal.

95
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,097
I didn't cook

96
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:32,937
all these dishes.

97
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:33,896
I made them.

98
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:35,537
Happy New Year.

99
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:37,736
Happy New Year!

100
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:38,296
Enjoy the New Year.

101
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:39,296
Drink up.

102
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,220
(Dad)

103
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:46,937
Xu, dig in.

104
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:47,616
Make yourself at home.

105
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:48,416
- Let's eat.
- Have some food.

106
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:49,696
My dad is making a video call to me.

107
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:54,817
Dad,

108
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:56,657
I'm celebrating the New Year
at Xu Jingjing's house.

109
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:57,576
Can you see us?

110
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,296
Mr. Kang, Happy New Year!

111
00:03:59,377 --> 00:03:59,896
Happy New Year.

112
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:01,057
Happy New Year.

113
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:04,456
Happy New Year, guys.

114
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:05,856
Don't miss celebrating it

115
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:06,736
with me next year.

116
00:04:06,977 --> 00:04:08,377
Don't worry. I won't miss it.

117
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:10,416
Dad,

118
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:12,136
you're working during the New Year.

119
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:13,736
Are they paying you three times the pay?

120
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:15,616
What do you mean?

121
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:16,897
Are you reminding me

122
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,056
to send you a red packet?

123
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,217
Don't worry. I won't forget about it.

124
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:21,936
That's not what I meant.

125
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:23,056
I'm having the time of my life

126
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,137
at Xu Jingjing's house.

127
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:25,856
Remember to rest

128
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:26,496
and eat more.

129
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:27,416
You've lost weight.

130
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,017
Sure, I'll eat more.

131
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:32,577
I have something to take care of.

132
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:33,777
I have to go now.

133
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:35,176
Okay, get back to work.

134
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:37,977
My dad is always like this.

135
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:39,697
He'll hang up

136
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:40,616
when he's busy with work.

137
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:42,137
It's called dedication.

138
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:43,736
That's how old people are.

139
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:44,577
You're right.

140
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:45,337
I guess

141
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:46,457
the glutinous rice balls
should be ready.

142
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:47,897
I'll go and take them.

143
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:48,256
Stay.

144
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:48,657
I'll go with you.

145
00:04:48,657 --> 00:04:49,457
Okay.

146
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:50,457
Take your time.

147
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:51,936
Let's continue eating.

148
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:52,936
No need to wait for them.

149
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:53,897
Here,

150
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:54,977
Mr. Kang.

151
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,017
Try the fish Mr. Xu prepared.

152
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:58,137
Thank you, Madam Wang.

153
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,697
He's a good cook. Try it.

154
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,490
(Inpatient Building)

155
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:10,097
(Inpatient Building)
Are you okay?

156
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:11,376
(Inpatient Building)
Do I need to call the doctor?

157
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,296
It's okay.

158
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,256
Thanks.

159
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,577
I made you come on New Year's day.

160
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:28,657
It's cold outside.

161
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:29,977
Let's go back inside
and prepare glutinous rice balls.

162
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,217
I want to stay here for a little while.

163
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,530
(Inpatient Building)

164
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,537
Do you still remember the time

165
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:45,856
the three of us
made glutinous rice balls

166
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:47,657
when Wei was a kid?

167
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:49,816
At the time, he insisted on

168
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,217
using chocolate as the filling.

169
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,496
How can I forget that?

170
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:54,977
I was against the idea at the time.

171
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,537
But you always spoil him.

172
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:57,616
You went out with him

173
00:05:57,697 --> 00:05:58,697
to buy chocolate right away.

174
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,256
He's my kid.

175
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:01,537
Of course, I have to spoil him.

176
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:05,657
How did he

177
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,017
grow up so fast in an instant?

178
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:12,856
How fast these days

I haven't seen you for a long time.

You look more handsome now.

Not at all.

Mom, the truth is...

189
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:20,816
Tomorrow,

190
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,416
I want to take you somewhere.

told me about you.

You have my respect.

198

Mr. Gao,

201

208
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,136
there's nowhere to take a stroll here.

209
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,457
Stop talking.

210
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:37,057
Just go.

211

Ni may appear that way.

215
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:04,896
But he's pretty nice.

216
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,536
He treats Gao Zhan and me well.

217
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:14,616

He  wants
to attend Public Security University.

220
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:21,136
I didn't agree

221
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:22,616
and argued with him.

222
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:28,817
I didn't expect

223
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:31,057
he was so determined.

224
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:36,376
I know

225
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,697
he wants to be a police officer

226
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,977
because he promised you that
when he was a kid.

227
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:47,536
His temperament

228
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:48,937
is so much like yours.

229
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:51,417
Once decided,

00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:53,457
it must be done.

give him your blessings

233

Hello.

Are you trying to brush me off?

250

No, I'd never dare to think that.

251
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,417
I was just worried

252
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:58,417
that you have too much to worry about.

253

Don't you worry about that.

254

Listen.

255

I cherish my 12th graders

00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:04,776
very much.

257

Don't worry.

258
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:07,057
I'll watch them

00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:13,856
Okay, I'll get going, then.

263
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:14,656

00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:27,656
the next 108 days,

267
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,217

All of you better

271
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:34,856
pull yourselves together.

272
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:37,496
The first mock exam is next week.

273
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,016
Don't take it lightly

274
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:39,856
because it's a mock exam.

275
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:41,856
Remind yourselves
there are second and third mock exams.

276
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,097
The first and the second are mock exams
for the college entrance examination.

277
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:45,817
So you only have two chances

278
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:47,817
to know

279
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:49,057
your current achievement.

280
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:50,297
Guys,

281
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,057
you'll get higher scores
if you work harder.

282
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:54,136
As they say,

283
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:55,337
a miss

284
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:56,577
is as good as a mile.

285
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:57,896
Missing by a point

286
00:11:58,297 --> 00:11:59,136
can widen your gaps

287
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,057
between hundreds of thousands
of other candidates.

288
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:03,697
That one point is enough
to change your life.

289
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:05,376
So in the first mock exam,

290
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:06,616
all of you must

291
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:07,736
do the best you can!

292
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:09,417
Do the best we can!

293
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:10,697
Do the best we can!

294
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:11,937
Do the best we can!

295
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,656
Shut up!

296
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,457
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

297
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:37,417
Shut up!

298
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,057
King Gou and...

299
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:50,656
Did I write this correctly?

300
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:02,697
Gather around!

301
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,297
Quickly now.

302
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:10,776
Put

303
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:11,376
those books away.

304
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:13,136
It's physical education class now.

305
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:14,457
Mr. Zhao,

306
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:15,616
the first mock exam
is more important now.

307
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,337
Can you give us

308
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:17,616
some time to study?

309
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:20,656
I know the 12th-graders
are under a lot of pressure.

310
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:22,256
But there are exams

311
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,256
for physical education classes too.

312
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:25,016
Keep your books.

313
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:27,937
Mr. Zhao.

314
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,097
We're studying Chinese.

315
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:31,057
Even if it's Chinese book...

316
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:33,736
That's right, Mr. Zhao.

317
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:34,937
She's right, Sir.

318
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:36,577
We're studying Chinese.

319
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:44,177
No exceptions next time.

320
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:46,217
Free activity for today, then.

321
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:47,496
Thank you, Mr. Zhao!

322
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:49,057
Let's continue.

323
00:13:49,097 --> 00:13:49,417
Okay.

324
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:00,856
Miss,

325
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,977
I'm losing a lot of hairs.

326
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,496
Miss, I have problems too.

327
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:07,256
I often have stomachaches lately.

328
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,016
But my period doesn't come.

329
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:10,337
Miss,

330
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:11,057
look

331
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,337
at this. This one and this one here.

332
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:13,376
They're all pimples.

333
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,136
I'm too ashamed to meet anyone.

334
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:17,776
Are you guys suffering

335
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,977
from these symptoms?

336
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:22,536
All these symptoms

337
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:23,817
are caused by stress.

338
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:25,337
What time do you sleep at night?

339
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:26,536
I sleep

340
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:27,496
at 1am.

341
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:28,937
That's early.

342
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:30,496
I sleep at 3 a.m.

343
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:31,896
I can't believe you said that.

344
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,057
Is it something to brag about?

345
00:14:34,337 --> 00:14:34,856
Sleeping late

346
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,256
is the cause of sub-health.

347
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,097
Don't stay up late anymore,

348
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:38,856
do you hear me?

349
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:40,376
I don't have the luxury to sleep early

350
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,136
because I'm not good at my studies.

351
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,057
I even ordered so much.

352
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:49,536
My fellow 12th-grade students!

353
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:50,977
My fellow 12th-grade students!

354
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:51,856
I know

355
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,577
everyone is nervous

356
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:54,856
about the first mock exam lately.

357
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:55,977
You're sleepy during the day

358
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,057
and awake during the night.

359
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,536
Some suffer from hair loss

360
00:14:58,736 --> 00:14:59,536
and acne problems.

361
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:01,977
Yes, I'm talking about you.

362
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,457
It wasn't me.

363
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:05,896
It's Li Huiya.

364
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,937
It doesn't matter who it is.

365
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,616
Today, I'm going

366
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:13,697
to recommend you guys

367
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:14,896
a divine object
for the college entrance examination!

368
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,417
You should just cage him.

369
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:21,457
I think he forgot his medication

370
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:22,376
before leaving the house today.

371
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:23,616
What are you up to?

372
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:24,736
Isn't this just chewing gum?

373
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:26,856
Good question.

374
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,817
This chewing gum isn't ordinary.

375
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:29,697
This is

376
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:30,937
a high-caffeine gum.

377
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:32,417
High caffeine gum?

378
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:33,536
Yes.

379
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:34,496
It was said

380
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:35,496
that this is a product developed

381
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,016
by foreign military experts
after years of research.

382
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:37,577
After eating this,

383
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,016
it's not a problem for a soldier to
go to battle.

384
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,536
Let alone the 12th-graders.

385
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:41,656
After you take this,

386
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:43,297
I guarantee

387
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:43,896
you won't feel tired

388
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:45,217
doing your homework until midnight.

389
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:46,256
After you take this,

390
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:46,937
I guarantee

391
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,297
you'll return to how you were.

392
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:49,776
Dapeng, I want one!

393
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:50,417
How much is it?

394
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:52,736
Money is a sensitive topic.

395
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,016
With me, Ni Dapeng around,

396
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:56,337
they're all free!

397
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:57,697
Just take it

398
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,977
as me making a small contribution

399
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,057
to the 12-graders.

400
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:02,376
Who wants one?

401
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:06,297
- Me!
- I want one!

402
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:06,856
I want one!

403
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,457
- I want one too!
- Me too!

404
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:08,896
Here.

405
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,097
Xiong, take note of this.

406
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:11,217
No rush. Plenty for everybody.

407
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:11,697
Okay.

408
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:14,057
Does it really work?

409
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:15,136
Even if it doesn't work,

410
00:16:15,337 --> 00:16:15,817
take it

411
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:16,856
as a pack of normal chewing gum.

412
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:17,937
You have nothing to lose anyway.

413
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:18,736
That's true.

414
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:20,376
I want one too.

415
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:38,817
Mr. Zhang,

416
00:16:40,736 --> 00:16:41,536
I feel sick.

417
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:44,496
What's the matter?

418
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:45,457
Me too.

419
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:46,776
My heart is racing.

420
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:47,977
Sir, I want to throw up.

421
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:48,817
Go to the toilet now.

422
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:49,376
Sir, I...

423
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:50,457
I need to...

424
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:53,697
Xu Jingjing!

425
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:54,376
Send her to the hospital now!

426
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:56,417
Gao Zhan,

427
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:58,256
bring the students to the infirmary.

428
00:16:58,577 --> 00:16:59,457
Who else is feeling sick?

429
00:16:59,577 --> 00:16:59,937
Gao Zhan, me.

430
00:17:05,617 --> 00:17:07,137
They were sent to the hospital together?

431
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:10,217
Was it food poisoning?

432
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,296
Was it the food from the cafeteria?

433
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:16,056
They said they chewed some kind of gum.

434
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:17,816
What chewing gum?

435
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:19,496
I only heard it from Mr. Zhang.

436
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,776
Everyone was so stressed out

437
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:22,816
because of the first mock exam.

438
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:24,617
They couldn't sleep or eat well.

439
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:25,536
They were anxious,

440
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:27,137
and they were cramming
until late at night.

441
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:28,536
So Dapeng

442
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:29,336
recommended

443
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:30,576
a type of chewing gum

444
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:31,256
that could energize them.

445
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,056
Oh, I know.

446
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:35,417
It's the one

447
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,177
with high caffeine content.

448
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:37,697
Yes, that's the one.

449
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,056
It's written on the package

450
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:41,617
that the dosage is two tablets
in three hours.

451
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:42,816
So did they?

452
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:44,776
They took a huge amount.

453
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,016
How can they be okay?

454
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:47,857
How are they now?

455
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:49,857
They're okay

456
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:50,617
now.

457
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:52,217
They rested for a day

458
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:53,016
and recovered.

459
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,096
The college entrance examination

460
00:17:58,217 --> 00:17:59,296
is months away.

461
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:01,296
They're already this anxious.

462
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:04,217
If they keep this state of mind,

463
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:05,457
we don't even know

464
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:06,296
if they last until the exam.

465
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,177
Precisely.

466
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,857
I wanted them to take their mind off it

467
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:10,816
by exercising

468
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:11,617
during the physical education class.

469
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:13,217
But no one listens to me.

470
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:14,977
All of them were holding their book,

471
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:16,657
and it was a Chinese book.

472
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,256
I don't know what else to say.

473
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:33,256
Drink this.

474
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:35,617
I can't drink anymore.

475
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,177
It's the tenth glass.

476
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:38,857
The caffeine is all flushed out now.

477
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:41,256
Really?

478
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:45,177
You scared me

479
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,177
yesterday.

480
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:47,256
Why?

481
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:49,016
Are you scared that I'll die?

482
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:50,776
Promise me

483
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,177
not to take

484
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,137
those shoddy things.

485
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:55,977
By the way,

486
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:57,897
I need to go home for a while.

487
00:18:59,137 --> 00:18:59,736
Why?

488
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:04,417
Nothing.

489
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,016
Then why do you want

490
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:07,016
to go home out of a sudden?

491
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:07,977
Stop asking.

492
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:09,177
I have something to do.

493
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,377
Just tell me.

494
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:11,016
Listen here.

495
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:11,697
I'm a patient.

496
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:12,417
I can't be agitated.

497
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:13,496
I feel dizzy

498
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:14,256
and want to throw up.

499
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:15,377
I only want to take my underwear!

500
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:16,897
I want to take my underwear, okay?

501
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:18,217
I'm running out of them, okay?

502
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,056
Go, then.

503
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:23,336
I'll go, then.

504
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:26,177
Finish your water.

505
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:56,217
Dad.

506
00:19:57,617 --> 00:19:58,536
Are you home?

507
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:11,457
Mom?

508
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:18,857
When did you come back?

509
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:20,617
Where's my dad?

510
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,720
(Inpatient Building)

511
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:31,816
Dad!

512
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,417
I guess I can't keep it from you.

513
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:46,496
Brat,

514
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:48,296
come here.

515
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,177
I miss you so much.

516
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:19,576
How's the food here?

517
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:27,536
It's good.

518
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,377
Every day, I always worry

519
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,697
if you're eating well,

520
00:21:37,657 --> 00:21:38,736
sleeping well,

521
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,417
or if you were late for school.

522
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,096
But I felt relieved

523
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:46,336
after knowing you moved

524
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:47,657
to Jingjing's place.

525
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:01,256
Why don't you move back with your mom?

526
00:22:02,776 --> 00:22:03,857
Your mom told me

527
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:06,137
she'd only return

528
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,137
after your college entrance examination.

529
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,937
I know you feel bad.

530
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:17,857
But

531
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,137
when you argued with Jingjing,

532
00:22:21,096 --> 00:22:21,897
you did give her

533
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:23,096
a chance to explain.

534
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,137
I know what to do.

535
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:32,377
Why aren't you eating?

536
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:39,816
I didn't notice it when I was not sick.

537
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:41,576
Now, I only realize

538
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,496
that being able to eat

539
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:46,816
is the happiest thing
in a person's life.

540
00:22:54,377 --> 00:22:55,096
Later, I'll give you

541
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:56,977
my Dianping.com's account to you.

542
00:22:58,217 --> 00:22:58,617
The

543
00:22:59,016 --> 00:22:59,736
netizens were asking

544
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:00,816
why I wasn't updating anything.

545
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:02,776
When you find

546
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:03,576
any tasty food,

547
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:04,816
you have to help me update it.

548
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,937
If you find my username tacky,

549
00:23:07,937 --> 00:23:08,496
you can change it.

550
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:09,937
I don't care about your account.

551
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:18,457
Forget that you didn't tell me

552
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,336
that you're sick.

553
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:22,177
Why are you saying all these

554
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:23,217
when it was hard to see you?

555
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:24,736
I'm not going to help you.

556
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:26,217
When you've recovered,

557
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:27,217
we'll go around the world

558
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:30,417
and eat delicious food together!

559
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:34,336
Why are you so agitated?

560
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,056
I only ask you

561
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:37,296
to update my post, that's all.

562
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:38,536
You're so mean.

563
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:40,016
Can't you do this small favor?

564
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:41,496
I'm not doing it!

565
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:43,457
If you want to update,

566
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,016
you'll do it after you've recovered.

567
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,496
All right.

568
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:47,937
I'm sorry, okay?

569
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:48,617
I won't say anything anymore.

570
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:00,296
Dad.

571
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:03,657
Believe in yourself.

572
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,096
You'll be okay.

573
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,056
I believe.

574
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:26,977
I promise you.

575
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:29,897
I'll take you to eat

576
00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:31,296
around the world.

577
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,016
Does it hurt?

578
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:56,657
A little.

579
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:02,377
Let me have a bite.

580
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,256
My appetite comes back

581
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,536
when I see you.

582
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:14,536
Not too fast.

583
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:19,977
It'll be nice

584
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:21,016
if there's mayonnaise.

585
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:30,857
During this time,

586
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,417
thank you for taking care of Wei.

587
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:34,496
Oh, it's nothing.

588
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:35,177
It's just another kid

589
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,256
and an extra pair of chopsticks,
that's all.

590
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:36,897
That's right.

591
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:38,016
Besides,

592
00:25:38,177 --> 00:25:38,816
he's been a great help

593
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,056
to Jingjing.

594
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:41,417
He's also very sensible.

595
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:43,697
Now that he's leaving,

596
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,417
I feel a little sad.

597
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:47,576
Come here.

598
00:25:47,857 --> 00:25:48,977
Let me hug you.

599
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:52,256
Thank you

600
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:53,576
for taking care of Jingjing.

601
00:25:56,937 --> 00:25:57,296
Also,

602
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,857
your dad's surgery

603
00:25:58,937 --> 00:25:59,857
is a minor surgery.

604
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:01,177
He'll be fine after that.

605
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:02,697
Now,

606
00:26:03,137 --> 00:26:04,657
your job is to prepare for the exam.

607
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:05,697
Your dad will feel at ease

608
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:06,857
during the surgery that way.

609
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:07,336
Am I right?

610
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:13,657
Ms. Zhang.

611
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:14,536
If

612
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:15,496
you need anything,

613
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:16,536
you can call us.

614
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:17,536
- Don't be shy about it.
- Yes.

615
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:18,296
That's right.

616
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,897
All right. I'll call if I need help.

617
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:20,377
Okay.

618
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:21,457
Let's go, Wei.

619
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:22,296
Let me send you guys.

620
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:23,977
It's okay. I can hail a taxi.

621
00:26:24,576 --> 00:26:25,496
Ms. Zhang, you just returned
to the country.

622
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,336
You're not familiar with the area.

623
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:27,016
It's hard

624
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:27,736
to hail a taxi at this hour.

625
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:28,096
He's right.

626
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:28,657
Let me send you.

627
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:29,496
It's not troublesome.

628
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:30,457
It's okay.

629
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:31,296
Let me take care of the luggage.

630
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:32,056
Sorry to bother you all.

631
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:32,937
Kang Jiawei,

632
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:37,096
your dad will be okay..

633
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:47,457
I'll get going, then.

634
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:49,217
Okay.

635
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,170
(Countdown College Entrance Examination
70 Days)

636
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:22,256
If you feel unhappy,

637
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:23,336
you can let it out.

638
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:27,217
Or I can bring you to the school field.

639
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:28,857
We can use what you taught me

640
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:29,816
and yell out loud.

641
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:35,256
I'm fine.

642
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:39,256
I'm very optimistic.

643
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:42,857
Now, the medical field is very advanced.

644
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:44,576
Besides,

645
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
my dad is a blessed man.

646
00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:49,576
He'll be fine.

647
00:27:54,377 --> 00:27:55,776
Then are you used to staying

648
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:56,617
with your mom?

649
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,377
I have to get used to it in any case.

650
00:27:59,336 --> 00:27:59,937
At this point,

651
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:01,016
I can't cause problems for my mom.

652
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,217
(Attention, advanced art students.)

Come on. Let's go.

660
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:27,576
Ms. Chen is back.

661
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,256
Ms. Chen!

662
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,296
Ms. Chen!

663
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:39,417
Ms. Chen!

664
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:41,056
So

665
00:28:41,857 --> 00:28:42,776
you're really back?

666
00:28:43,736 --> 00:28:44,256
Yes.

667
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:45,177
Do you welcome me?

668
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:46,857
Of course!

669
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:49,137
The other teachers told me

670
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,697
you went nuts from cramming.

671
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:53,417
So I had no choice

672
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:54,657
but to come back and help out.

673
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,536
Are you okay?

674
00:28:58,296 --> 00:28:58,736
What's wrong?

675
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:00,177
You're not happy?

676
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:03,336
What about your scriptwriting?

677
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:06,217
I knew you'd ask about this,

678
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:08,377
Ms. Chen.

679
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:10,296
Script written by the original author

680
00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:11,056
sure is different.

681
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:12,617
We've watched the first two episodes.

682
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:13,857
They're very well-written.

683
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:16,977
For the upcoming episodes,

684
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,536
it'll be better

685
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:19,256
if you get it done faster.

686
00:29:22,217 --> 00:29:22,536
Ms. Wang,

687
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:26,256
I...

688
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:27,617
What's wrong?

689
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:28,857
Just be frank.

690
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:33,576
I want to withdraw.

691
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:36,776
Why?

692
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:37,776
I told you

693
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:38,576
we think

694
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:39,977
this script is well-written.

695
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:44,576
Is it because I'm rushing you
to finish the script?

696
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,377
Okay.

697
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:46,857
I won't rush you

698
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,056
or put you under any pressure.

699
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:49,657
You can write at your pace.

700
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:51,417
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

701
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:53,657
But this is not what I meant.

702
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:58,457
The college entrance examination
is around the corner.

703
00:29:58,937 --> 00:29:59,296
The students

704
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:00,177
in my class

705
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:01,336
are under a lot of mental stress.

706
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:03,217
The other teachers said

707
00:30:03,336 --> 00:30:05,377
many things had happened after I left.

708
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:07,536
I can't let them continue to suffer
such mental stress.

709
00:30:07,576 --> 00:30:08,576
I can't help but worry about them.

710
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:09,937
I want to accompany them

711
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:10,816
until they graduate from school.

712
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:13,177
Ms. Chen,

713
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:15,256
are you sure about this?

714
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,296
I thought it was your dream
to be a screenwriter.

715
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:22,377
It is my dream.

716
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:26,336
But I have a lifetime

717
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,617
to achieve my dream.

718
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:29,816
This is perhaps

719
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:31,016
my last chance to be a teacher.

720
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:33,897
I must finish what I started.

721
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:35,576
At this stage,

722
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:36,496
my students' futures

723
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:37,697
are more important than my dream.

724
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:39,816
I hope you can understand.

725
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:46,296
Ms. Chen,

726
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:47,256
sorry

727
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:48,457
for making you worry about us.

728
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:53,657
By the way,

729
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:55,536
don't have any other plans
for this Saturday.

730
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,016
I want to take you guys somewhere.

731
00:30:57,977 --> 00:30:59,937
Where are we going?

732
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:09,496
It's been a long time

733
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:10,697
since we take some fresh air.

734
00:31:12,016 --> 00:31:13,296
It feels so good

735
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,736
to have the sea breeze
blowing on my face.

736
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:17,377
It's a lake, Taihu Lake.

737
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:18,217
Gao Zhan,

738
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,056
don't be a killjoy.

739
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:21,736
I'm just making a comparison,

740
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:22,377
you know?

741
00:31:22,657 --> 00:31:23,296
Adjective, okay?

742
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,256
He's still the same.

743
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:27,377
He's still a 24K titanium alloy steel

744
00:31:27,496 --> 00:31:28,336
straight man.

745
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:30,897
Are you mocking me?

746
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:33,336
Are you mocking me?

747
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:34,496
No, I'm not.

748
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:35,096
Tell the truth!

749
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,256
Xiong Shuai,

750
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:42,377
pass me the chili powder.

751
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:50,697
What are you thinking?

752
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:56,776
Are you nervous

753
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:57,697
because
of the physical education examination

754
00:31:58,137 --> 00:31:58,576
next week?

755
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:01,256
Your results

756
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:02,137
are usually good during training.

757
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:04,056
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

758
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:05,457
You'll be fine.

759
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:07,496
Almost done.

760
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:09,096
The food is ready!

761
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:11,177
Coming!

762
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:13,736
Here you go.

763
00:32:14,137 --> 00:32:15,296
Try my cooking.

764
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:15,897
Not bad.

765
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:18,056
- Mr. Zhao.
- Let me try and see if it's good.

766
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:18,857
I'm pretty picky with my food.

767
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,177
The pickier, the better.

768
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:20,897
I want this one.

769
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:21,776
This is my ancestor's secret recipe.

770
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,457
Ms. Chen,

771
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:25,056
why did you bring us here?

772
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:27,016
To relax, of course.

773
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:28,457
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

774
00:32:28,897 --> 00:32:29,417
For today,

775
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,776
let's forget

776
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:31,776
about homework and the exam.

777
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:32,977
Your job for today

778
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,177
is to have fun all you want.

779
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,137
Okay!

780
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:35,576
Okay.

781
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:36,496
Have you eaten?

782
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:37,536
I'll eat later.

783
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:40,977
I want one too.

784
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:45,096
You can eat mine.

785
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:45,937
Eat this.

786
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,217
Why are you alone here?

787
00:33:00,736 --> 00:33:01,496
I'm okay. You guys can go ahead.

788
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:02,417
I'm not hungry.

789
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:07,137
Are you thinking about your dad?

790
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:18,056
I'd think of him

791
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:18,776
whenever I eat.

792
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:24,217
I wonder

793
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,177
if he eats well today.

794
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,296
Don't worry. Trust him.

795
00:33:30,137 --> 00:33:31,056
You did say

796
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:32,736
the medical field is very advanced now.

797
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:34,697
Besides, your dad is a good person.

798
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:35,417
He'll be fine.

799
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:40,417
Let's go.

800
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:41,776
Everyone is waiting for you.

801
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:43,776
Okay.

802
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:09,696
Cheers!

803
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:10,977
Cheers!

804
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:15,696
Are you having a good time?

805
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:17,096
- Yes.
- Yes.

806
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:18,737
You're all back to yourself.

807
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:21,096
I thought you lost your mind
from studying.

808
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:22,297
Ms. Chen,

809
00:34:22,696 --> 00:34:23,377
did you really quit

810
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:24,337
being a screenwriter?

811
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:26,136
Aren't you afraid
they'll mess up the script?

812
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:28,737
I knew you were about this.

813
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,096
Don't worry about it.

814
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,937
The production company said

815
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:33,576
they won't find another screenwriter.

816
00:34:34,016 --> 00:34:34,737
They'll wait for me.

817
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:35,576
Really?

818
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:36,616
After your examination is over,

819
00:34:36,737 --> 00:34:37,656
I'll go back and continue
where I left off.

820
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:38,536
Yes!

821
00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:41,737
To be honest,

822
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:42,656
I've been hearing a lot

823
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:44,136
about you guys lately.

824
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,457
Don't look at me.

825
00:34:50,777 --> 00:34:51,937
I... I don't know anything.

826
00:34:52,977 --> 00:34:53,696
Stop pretending already.

827
00:34:54,297 --> 00:34:55,136
Mr. Zhao said

828
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:56,857
your study environment

829
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:57,937
is becoming heavier.

830
00:34:58,377 --> 00:34:59,696
All of you were so wound up

831
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:01,056
about not wanting to get left behind.

832
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:03,496
I felt relieved at first.

833
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:04,656
But I heard

834
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:05,377
all of you

835
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,377
are under a lot of pressure.

836
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:07,616
If such pressure

837
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:08,737
makes you collapse,

838
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:10,656
feelings all tensed,

839
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:12,216
and so anxious,

840
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:13,817
won't you lose more than you gain?

841
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:16,096
Do you want
to enter the examination hall

842
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,297
in such a mental state?

843
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:19,496
But

844
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:21,016
everyone is working hard

845
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:22,377
and improving.

846
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:23,536
If we don't work harder

847
00:35:23,696 --> 00:35:24,656
than others,

848
00:35:25,216 --> 00:35:26,297
won't we be left behind?

849
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:28,656
I understand your feelings.

850
00:35:29,737 --> 00:35:30,536
But

851
00:35:30,616 --> 00:35:31,576
without a good state of mind,

852
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:33,216
all your hard work

853
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:33,937
will be in vain.

854
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:36,977
Has it ever occurred to you

855
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:38,897
that if the chewing gum incident
happened

856
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,777
at the examination hall,

857
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,056
it'll be game over?

858
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:45,576
Ms. Chen.

859
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:47,457
I apologize for my mistake.

860
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:48,216
I'll drink this

861
00:35:48,737 --> 00:35:49,656
as a punishment.

862
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:51,536
So

863
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:53,176
I just want to tell you guys

864
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:55,096
that you do need some pressure.

865
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,016
But we must have the courage

866
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:58,576
to overcome the pressure.

867
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:00,216
We must not
let the pressure overwhelm us.

868
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:03,016
Since you put aside your script writing

869
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,257
to accompany us until the exam is over,

870
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:05,616
we'll never

871
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:06,417
let you down.

872
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:08,056
Let's enjoy ourselves
to our heart's content today.

873
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:09,616
The exam is not a big deal.

874
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:10,817
It's not destined yet.

875
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:12,096
You and I are still the dark horses.

876
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:12,897
That's right.

877
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,056
I'm not scared of the exam.

878
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:14,977
Why are you scared of it?

879
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:16,696
It's only
the college entrance examination.

880
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:19,897
We'll definitely beat you!

881
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:20,977
Guys, we can do this!

882
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:23,216
We can do this!

883
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:24,937
We can do this!

884
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:01,136
Is your mouse broken?

885
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:04,737
No.

886
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,096
I...

887
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:10,176
I just want

888
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:11,297
to check the results
of the public security examination.

889
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,377
But I don't dare to check it.

890
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:16,216
I didn't know a top student
would be troubled by this.

891
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:18,337
Stop teasing me.

892
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:19,937
I'll help you check the result.

893
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:30,216
Are you looking at it now?

894
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:33,176
Yes.

895
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:36,737
Why do you sound gloomy?

896
00:37:37,176 --> 00:37:37,937
Did I fail?

897
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:40,297
Congratulations.

898
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:41,417
You're in first place.

(Public Security University Result.

900

00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,290
(Overall Ranking: First Place)

902
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:46,817
Ah, it really is.

903
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:49,616
It must be nice

904
00:37:49,897 --> 00:37:51,337
to attend the university you want.

905
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:53,096
Things are still uncertain for now.

906
00:37:53,616 --> 00:37:54,897
If I fail in general courses,

907
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:55,457
then...

908
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:56,176
Gao Zhan,

909
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:58,016
do you know being overly humble

910
00:37:58,136 --> 00:37:59,056
means arrogance?

911
00:38:02,857 --> 00:38:03,257
In that case,

912
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:04,457
does that mean you
and your mom have reconciled?

913
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,176
You were right.

914
00:38:07,897 --> 00:38:08,777
The adults

915
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:10,377
will still respect our decisions

916
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:12,096
because it's our lives.

917
00:38:15,257 --> 00:38:15,857
We have several months left to go.

918
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:16,937
