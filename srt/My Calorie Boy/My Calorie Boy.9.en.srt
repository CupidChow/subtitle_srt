(Give-up Virtuoso: Are you there?)

17
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,174
I was quite disappointed

18
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:00,014
as you didn't come.

19
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:03,174
Something came up

20
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:04,174
at home that time.

21
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:05,215
So I didn't make it there.

22
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:06,615
Actually...

23
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,015
Right, by the way,

24
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:09,534
I... I... I...

25
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:10,935
The power went out in our neighbourhood.

26
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:12,534
The power seems to be forever out.

27
00:02:12,814 --> 00:02:13,814
I won't go online anymore.

28
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:16,094
I understand.

30
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:21,615
Actually,

31
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:24,414
I just want to talk to you.

32
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:27,854
Talk...

33
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:29,335
Talk about what?

34
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:34,335

It's very scary.

Gao Zhan talked to me again yesterday.

39
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:43,615
What should I do?

40
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:45,935
I'd like to tell him who I am.

41
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:46,574
But I...

42
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,175
I don't know how to tell him that.

43
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:49,015
I...

44
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:50,495
I... I think...

45
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:51,935
I think Gao Zhan has something
on his mind recently.

46
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:53,414
And I'm afraid to hit him hard.

47
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:54,814
What should I do?

48
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:55,775
Help me with it.

49
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:57,615
No, what's with the response?

50
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:58,654
Figure it out for me.

Help me to deal with him.

53
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,574
Can you stop disturbing me?

54
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:07,854
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:12,015
What's wrong?

56
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:17,374
What's the matter? Tell me.

57
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:21,814
The eight questions yesterday,

58
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:23,175
I did them again just now.

59
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,455
Yet, I still got two wrong.

60
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:25,895
But you have

61
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,414
taught me that yesterday.

62
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:28,254
I even revised

63
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:29,854
the learning points before I slept.

64
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:33,335
So this is the problem?

65
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:35,654
You got two wrong.

66
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:36,775
You've done better than yesterday.

67
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:37,935
You've improved.

68
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:40,935
This has been the third time.

69
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:41,654
Yet, I still got it wrong.

70
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:43,814
I'm such a fool.

71
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:45,895
Mastering

72
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:47,374
the learning point is an iterative

73
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:48,694
and gradual process.

74
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:49,735
The more mistakes you make,

75
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:50,534
the more it'll consolidate

76
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:51,134
the memory

77
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:52,455
about this learning point.

78
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:53,935
It's a good thing.

79
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:58,094

80
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,055

I, as their class teacher,

89
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,574
should do my part as well.

90
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:27,295
Don't you think?

91
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:28,454

I can't necessarily do it right either.

you mastered it by doing it
for four times.

147
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:15,055
And you've also mastered

152
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,975
I'm a rotten apple.

00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:27,735

Miss Chen troubles this time.

155
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,415

King of messing around series.

161
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:43,814
I thought

162
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:44,775
this was the voice of your heart.

163
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:46,814
What do you mean?

164
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:49,854
I mean

165
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,574
I'm very curious.

166
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:54,255
What exactly is it

167
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:55,655
that makes you resist exams so much?

168
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,214
Don't laugh at me

169
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:02,854
if I tell you about it.

170
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:04,614
I won't.

171
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,375
I'm worried that I can't get
good grades

172

00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:11,734
Just like last time.

174
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:13,255
But if I don't work hard

175
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,175
on studying,

176
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,334
though I get poor grades,

177
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:16,814
I can blame myself
for not paying efforts.

178
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:18,814
But if I study hard,

179
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,214
and I still get poor grades,

180
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:21,895
it'll show that I'm a fool.

181
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:24,175
Moreover,

182
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:25,535
if I screw it up this time,

183
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,854
it won't be as simple

184
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:27,895
as taking down the average.

185
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:29,655
I'll even get

186
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:30,614
Miss Chen into troubles.

187
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:31,415
Xu Jingjing,

188
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,255
first of all, you're not stupid at all.

189
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:36,334
You've got

190
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:37,775
a black belt in Taekwondo.

191
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:39,895
You can determine

192
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:41,415
the rival's plan of attack
in a few seconds.

193
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:42,655
Avoid them,

194
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:44,015
counter them,

195
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,214
flank and knock them out.

196
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,295
This requires extraordinary

197
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:48,214
resilience.

198
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:50,094
Also,

199
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:51,614
the entire Class 3

200
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:52,775
and Miss Chen,

201
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,214
we're a team.

202
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:55,375
We won't leave

203
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,535
any teammate behind.

204
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:58,895
Including you.

205
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:04,214
Just like the sports day.

206
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:06,055
We've got to win

207
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:08,614
the games within the rules.

208
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:12,295
You've put yourself

209
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:13,135
under so much stress.

210
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,094
For the remaining three days,

211
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,055
you don't have to revise the questions.

212
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:17,535
Just relax.

213
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:20,814
Really?

214
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:22,295
Can I not revise the questions?

215
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:23,935
Trust me.

216
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:25,415
Just be steady and it won't be

217
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:26,055
a problem.

218
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,494
You can try

219
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,135
to draw Pipi.

220
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:32,775
Draw Pipi?

221
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:34,895
Draw

222
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,814
Pipi who gets perfect scores.

223
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,015
Draw

224
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:40,574
Pipi who wins

225
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:41,175
the marathon.

226
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:43,535
Pipi who cheers

227
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:44,135
for herself.

228
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:46,015
To distract yourself.

229
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:49,535
Well,

230
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:51,854
I'll give it a try.

231
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:56,574
Xu Jingjing,

232
00:10:59,454 --> 00:10:59,935
you can do this.

233
00:11:15,094 --> 00:11:15,454
Miss Chen,

234
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:16,935
- have you had breakfast?
- Good morning.

235
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:18,214
I bought it for you.

236
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:19,734
A deep-fried dough sticks
and two burritos.

237
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:21,775
I wish your students
to get 100 in the exam.

238
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:23,415
Are you cursing me?

239
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,135
Don't you know it's out of 150?

240
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:26,854
It's the same.

241
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:27,935
Quickly take it.

242
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:28,494
Thanks.

243
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:30,854
You're obviously a P.E. teacher.

244
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,055
Looking good today.

245
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,494
It's for you, Master Kang.

246
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:55,454
Thank you.

247
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:56,775
You're welcome.

248
00:11:58,614 --> 00:11:59,454
Come.

249
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:00,295
Let me help you.

250
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:02,535
Come on.

251
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:03,655
Pick one.

252
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:09,334
I'll help you check it.

253
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:11,415
What is it?

254
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:14,574
Seven, Seven of Heart.

255
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:15,094
Your lucky number.

256
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:15,574
Let me take a look.

257
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:16,055
I want to see it.

258
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:19,655
Don't you believe in me?

(Mid-term Exam  Math Physics History)

260
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,094
Fellow students,

261
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,970
(Humble and Adaptive, Virtues and Duty)

262
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:27,574
(Humble and Adaptive, Virtues and Duty)
loosen up your mind when you take the test.

263
00:12:27,974 --> 00:12:29,295
Don't stress yourself out.

264
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:30,454
Bear this in mind.

265
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,494
You take the test for your own sake.

266
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:33,935
Just make your efforts worthwhile.

267
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:35,135
(Mid-term Exam  Math Physics History)
As for the ranking,

268
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:35,814
(Mid-term Exam  Math Physics History)
it doesn't matter.

269
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:36,775
Fight on.

270
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,015
Xu Jingjing,

271
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:45,094
you can do this.

272
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:24,535
The third question of the history exam,

273
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,175
the one about the World War II...

274
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,214
Wait.

275
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:29,655
Don't discuss about the answer.

276
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:30,535
No.

277
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:31,454
I just wanted to ask you

278
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:32,055
the meaning of that question.

279
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:32,775
Don't ask it either.

280
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:35,574
Jingjing,

281
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:36,895
how was the exam?

282
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:40,454
Let fate take its course.

283
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,214
I just don't want to get

284
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,334
Miss Chen into troubles.

285
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:46,214
Xu Jingjing.

286
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:48,535
I'll let you guys talk.

287
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:49,935
We'll get going.

288
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:50,415
Let's go.

289
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:51,055
We're leaving.

290
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:55,734
Why are they so excited?

291
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:57,375
Who knows?

292
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:58,255
They've gone crazy.

293
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,175
That's quite serious.

294
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:03,535
Didn't you ask me

295
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:04,734
how Kang Jiawei lost his weight

296
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:05,734
as he ate a lot

297
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:07,055
and lacked of exercise before?

298
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:08,775
You're willing to look into it for me?

299
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:10,094
I already knew the answer.

300
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:10,854
But I didn't

301
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:11,655
look into it on purpose for you.

302
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:13,535
Actually, I got a question

303
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:14,214
to ask you as well.

304
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,454
Do you know why Kang Jiawei

305
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:17,734
has been avoiding me lately?

306
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:19,494
Does he?

307
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:20,935
Doesn't he?

308
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:22,255
He doesn't.

309
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:25,694
I was going to find out

310
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:26,935
why he avoided me.

311
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,334
But during the inquest,

312
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:28,974
I found out

313
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:29,974
how he lost his weight.

314
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:31,135
How did he lose it?

315
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:32,814
Actually, it's simple.

316
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,375
He refused to eat anything.

317
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,015
It's not right.

318
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:38,094
He usually ate a lot.

319
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,375
I've watched him for several days.

320
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:40,974
He was faking it.

321
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:42,535
Faking it?

322
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:43,694
What do you mean?

323
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:45,135
He acted like he was eating.

324
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:46,255
In fact, he didn't eat anything.

325
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,295
Xu Jingjing, you know what?

326
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:53,214
The way to cook the tripe

327
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,295
must be "seven ups and eight downs".

328
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:55,214
You need to count it.

329
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:56,295
One.

330
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:57,734
Two.

331
00:14:58,655 --> 00:14:59,015
Three.

332
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:00,135
Four.

333
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:01,334
Five.

334
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,494
Six.

335
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:03,375
Seven.

336
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,775
It's done.

337
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:07,015
By the way,

338
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:07,614
why do you

339
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:08,574
suddenly succumb to your conscience

340
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:09,494
and buy me a meal today?

341
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,175
Of course it's to thank you

342
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,375
for encouraging me

343
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,255
and for being my tutor

344
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:14,415
all this time.

345
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:16,734
How was your exam?

346
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:20,334
Well, just as usual.

347
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:25,655
We've finished the sauce.

348
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:26,295
Do you want it?

349
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:27,295
I'll go get some for you.

350
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:29,694
Sure.

351
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:30,694
Wait here.

352
00:15:59,375 --> 00:15:59,895
I'm stuffed.

353
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:00,935
Thank you.

354
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:02,574
I'm not full yet.

355
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:05,334
You're not full yet?

356
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:06,935
If you don't want to eat,

357
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:07,734
you can watch me eat it.

358
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:08,895
Wait. Wait.

359
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:11,334
Let me teach you

360
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:13,334
a new way

361
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:14,375
to eat crispy meat.

362
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:16,775
Put some Mayonnaise

363
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,135
on top

364
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:19,935
of the crispy meat.

365
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:22,094
Look.

366
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,694
Dip its other side in the chili powder.

367
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:25,974
You must dip it all the way into it.

368
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:27,935
Then, you can taste

369
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,734
the double flavours of crispy meat.

370
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:32,895
It'll perfectly burst

371
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:34,295
in your mouth.

372
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,175
You... Why are you crying?

373
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:54,334
Kang Jiawei,

374
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:57,895
why would

375
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,175
you do this to yourself?

376
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:01,415
I feel so bad for you.

377
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:01,814
You...

378
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,535
What... what are you talking about?

379
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:07,014
Among the people I know,

380
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,014
you're the major foodie.

381
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,375
But you refuse to eat

382
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:12,534
and restrict yourself

383
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:13,855
from eating just to lose weight.

384
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:15,415
Don't you find it frustrating?

385
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:16,855
I... I...

386
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,095
I didn't do it.

387
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:21,575
That explains everything.

388
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:24,974
How you lost a lot of weight?

389
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:26,694
Why you'd faint after playing

390
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:27,375
basketball?

391
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,175
You even fainted
after running 100 meters.

392
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:31,694
No, I...

393
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:35,254
I just didn't

394
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,254
eat junk food.

395
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:36,774
Like you said,

396
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:37,734
I lost weight in a healthy way.

397
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:38,855
If you lost weight in a healthy way,

398
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:39,575
you wouldn't

399
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:40,494
have fainted so often.

400
00:17:43,415 --> 00:17:44,655
Besides, I've observed you just now.

401
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:46,855
You didn't eat anything.

402
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:49,014
If I ate nothing,

403
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,014
did you eat it all then?

404
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:50,815
You didn't eat it.

405
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,014
I... I did eat it. I ate it.

406
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,375
How are you going to explain these?

407
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:10,214
Kang Jiawei,

408
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,974
have you been doing this all the time?

409
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,335
When you ate out with the others,

410
00:18:14,734 --> 00:18:15,855
you acted like you were starving.

411
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:17,294
Then, you began

412
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:17,935
to rattle on,

413
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:18,534
making them

414
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:19,575
think that you ate a lot.

415
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:21,175
But in fact, you didn't eat anything.

416
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,615
You just kept talking to the others,

417
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:26,454
to distract them.

418
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:29,054
How did you usually draw those stickers

419
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:30,815
of yours?

420
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,375
It's very simple.

421
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:33,054
Just

422
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:34,935
figure out the theme.

423
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,335
For example, I'd like to draw

424
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:40,135
Sleeping Series or Games Series.

425
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,454
You kept raising questions.

426
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:43,454
To distract the others.

427
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:44,774
So they didn't have the time

428
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:45,415
to see what you did.

429
00:18:46,054 --> 00:18:46,615
Then, did you get

430
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:47,494
a lot of rewards now?

431
00:18:47,655 --> 00:18:48,254
Of course.

432
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:48,895
My Pipi

433
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,054
is very famous.

434
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,935
When a conversation ended,

435
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:54,575
you'd give the food

436
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:55,494
to the other party.

437
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:56,734
Here, eat up.

438
00:18:57,694 --> 00:18:58,054
Tripe.

439
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:02,615
Am I right?

440
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:22,214
Here.

441
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:27,774
It's not necessary.

442
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:29,615
What do you mean?

443
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:31,095
Kang Jiawei,

444
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:33,014
you'll get malnourished if this goes on.

445
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:33,935
It'll kill you, you know?

446
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,254
It's quite good to die

447
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:35,974
as a thin man.

448
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:37,774
Are you a kid?

449
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,014
Can you stop saying

450
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:39,815
something irresponsible?

451
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:41,494
I'll feel sad if you die.

452
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:52,974
I was joking.

453
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,135
I don't like such a joke.

454
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:03,895
This is healthy food.

455
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:04,974
You can eat it.

456
00:20:05,294 --> 00:20:06,335
It's a wholemeal bread.

457
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:07,895
The ham and egg in it can provide

458
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:08,655
the essential protein

459
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:09,534
for human.

460
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,135
The lettuce and tomato can

461
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:12,855
replenish fibre and vitamin.

462
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:14,214
So it only contains

463
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:15,415
300-odd calories.

464
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:16,415
A boy like you

465
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:18,254
needs to consume 1500 calories per day.

466
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:20,135
You won't gain weight
even if you eat it all.

467
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:23,655
It's true.

468
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:32,254
I've never eaten

469
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,014
a delicious sandwich like this.

470
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:36,655
Kang Jiawei,

471
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:38,454
why did you get

472
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:39,415
yourself into this situation?

473
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:41,615
Do you want to defeat me so much?

474
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:42,534
I want to lose weight.

475
00:20:46,054 --> 00:20:46,655
I want

476
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:47,815
to impress everyone.

477
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:53,974
But I can't control

478
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,655
and

479
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:55,855
motivate myself like you said.

480
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:57,575
To work out

481
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:00,494
and eat low-fat food everyday.

482
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,054
In contrast, it's easier to stop eating.

483
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:15,615
I live

484
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:16,575
by protein bar everyday.

485
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,135
Sometimes, I'll eat
some boiled vegetables.

486
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:20,615
On the sports day,

487
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:21,415
if Dapeng

488
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:22,214
didn't eat my protein bar,

489
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,815
I wouldn't have been a mess

490
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:24,855
in that relay race.

491
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:27,974
Kang Jiawei,

492
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:30,135
let's try it again.

493
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:32,615
I... I've reflected on myself.

494
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:34,494
It was indeed my fault on the holiday.

495
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:35,815
I shouldn't have argued with you.

496
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:38,294
I must've made you mad.

497
00:21:38,454 --> 00:21:38,815
That's why

498
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:40,294
you lost weight in such an extreme way.

499
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:41,294
How about this?

500
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:42,815
Trust me again.

501
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:44,294
I'll make another plan for you.

502
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:46,014
I'll let you eat good food

503
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:47,214
like a normal person.

504
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:48,855
No need. I'm afraid I'll get fat again.

505
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:51,135
Seriously.

506
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:55,135
I always have the same nightmare.

507
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,734
I gain weight once I eat.

508
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,615
Again and again.

509
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:00,895
I'm fat

510
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:01,615
like a balloon.

511
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:02,335
It becomes bigger.

512
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:04,855
I'm freaked out.

513
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,175
Didn't you always encourage me

514
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:09,774
to have faith in myself?

515
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:11,454
Why can't you

516
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:13,095
have faith in yourself?

517
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:15,575
Well,

518
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,534
you've lost a lot of muscles

519
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,175
due to excessive dieting.

520
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:20,734
Then, let's start

521
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:22,014
with some light exercises.

522
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:23,294
The bracelet I gave you,

523
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,135
put it on again.

524
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:25,895
We'll start

525
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:27,454
with 10,000 steps a day.

526
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:29,415
10,000 steps? That's too much, Sis.

527
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:30,054
It won't do.

528
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:31,214
It's not much.

529
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,335
You just have to walk. You can do it.

530
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:35,175
Also,

531
00:22:35,694 --> 00:22:37,014
take the photos
of all your meals for me.

532
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:37,895
What you eat

533
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:38,895
and how much you eat.

534
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,054
Preferably, live stream it.

535
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,294
So that I can confirm

536
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,135
if you're faking it.

537
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:43,494
Is it necessary?

538
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:44,734
It is.

539
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:45,815
Kang Jiawei,

540
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:48,054
do you want to live
by protein bars

541
00:22:48,335 --> 00:22:49,494
and fake eating forever?

542
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:53,335
Have faith in me again.

543
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,655
Just like I believe that you can help me

544
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:56,534
improve my score.

545
00:22:57,454 --> 00:22:57,895
Can you do that?

546
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:05,974
Kang Jiawei.

547
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,335
Let's

548
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:12,135
align with each other again.

549
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:34,095
Do you have water?

550
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,330
(Grade 11 Class 3)

551
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,570
(Humble and Adaptive,
Virtues and Duty)

552
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:48,214
Thank you.

553
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:51,575
Please bless me

554
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:52,895
to get good grades this time.

555
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:53,895
I beg of you.

556
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,855
What are you murmuring?

557
00:23:58,175 --> 00:23:59,135
I'm praying.

558
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:00,575
Praying?

559
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:01,054
You're annoying.

560
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:02,135
Who are you praying to?

561
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:04,095
The God of Math, the God of Language,

562
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:05,135
and the God of English.

563
00:24:07,335 --> 00:24:09,095
I've never seen you being
so superstitious.

564
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:11,294
You drew poker cards and prayed.

565
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:12,895
Can you stop messing around?

566
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,135
It won't work in this way.

567
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:16,575
Let's see.

568
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:20,774
Not bad.

569
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:24,294
Ninety-three.

570
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:26,135
Ninety, ninety-three, ninety-three.

571
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:30,855
How is it?

572
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:33,054
As usual.

573
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:36,815
Nintey-four!

574
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:37,855
I passed all the exams.

575
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:38,734
I've never scored

576
00:24:38,815 --> 00:24:39,335
a high mark like this.

577
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:40,415
I told you that you can do this.

578
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:41,655
I got a 103 on my language exam.

579
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:42,534
I got a 120 on my English test.

580
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,375
What about you, Kang Jiawei?

581
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:44,415
I got a 142.

582
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:45,415
No.

583
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,935
How can you three

584
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:48,135
be so smart?

585
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:50,494
Xiong Shuai and I passed
the tests as well.

586
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:52,054
Does it mean our class will make it

587
00:24:52,254 --> 00:24:53,214
to the top three this time?

588
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,815
Good!

589
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:55,415
Right?

590
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:58,294
Don't get excited too soon.

591
00:24:58,734 --> 00:24:59,734
Let's cheer after the grade results

592
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:00,734
come out.

593
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:04,895
The grade-point average has come out.

594
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:07,175
How is my class doing?

595
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:08,214
Your class

596
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:09,655
got the fourth place.

597
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:10,774
But,

598
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:12,294
you're only 0.1 point
less than the third place.

599
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:14,415
What a pity.

600
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:16,135
Miss Chen, your class

601
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:17,375
has improved a lot

602
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:18,575
in just over a month.

603
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:20,734
They've done a good job. I mean it.

604
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:21,294
Yes.

605
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:23,615
I think it's a miracle.

606
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:24,655
On the language test,

607
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:25,694
they've improved
by an average of 16 to 17 points.

608
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:26,734
As for the math test,

609
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,054
they've improved by an average
of almost 20 points.

610
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:29,014
The correct rate of basic questions

611
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:30,534
has exceeded Mr. Zhang's class.

612
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:31,655
I knew

613
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:33,655
they can do it if they're willing

614
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:34,494
to learn.

615
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:35,214
Yes.

616
00:25:36,774 --> 00:25:37,254
Miss Chen,

617
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:38,175
come here for a second.

618
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:52,974
Mr. Zhang, I know what to do.

619
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,700
(Resignation Letter)

620
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:57,575
I'm not talking about this.

621
00:25:59,895 --> 00:26:00,895
The students

622
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,454
in your class might've cheated
on this exam.

623
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:05,815
Cheat?

624
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,734
Miss Chen, you asked to see me?

625
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:18,615
Xu Jingjing,

626
00:26:20,135 --> 00:26:21,375
I asked you here because...

627
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:22,054
Xu Jingjing,

628
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:24,655
you came to my table

629
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:26,375
before the mid-term exam, didn't you?

630
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:29,095
I...

631
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:31,254
I...

632
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:31,855
It's alright.

633
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:34,175
Mr. Zhang is just asking
you some questions.

634
00:26:34,415 --> 00:26:35,214
Just answer him honestly.

635
00:26:37,254 --> 00:26:39,214
But I don't remember it anymore.

636
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:40,054
Okay.

637
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:41,855
Then, let me remind you.

638
00:26:46,054 --> 00:26:47,014
I had something urgent

639
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,655
to deal with at noon last Thursday.

640
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:49,774
And I didn't switch off the computer.

641
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,734
Someone took advantage of it.

642
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,534
Thursday?

643
00:27:01,774 --> 00:27:02,294
I remember it.

644
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,615
That day, I came to switch the paper.

645
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:04,895
I was supposed to hand in paper B

646
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:05,734
for the math homework that morning.

647
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:06,655
But I handed in paper A.

648
00:27:07,054 --> 00:27:08,054
Why didn't you leave after that?

649
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:11,375
You see here.

650
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:13,454
Obviously, you were looking
at my computer.

651
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:14,615
There was

652
00:27:14,655 --> 00:27:15,694
mid-term exam paper on my computer.

653
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:17,415
See.

654
00:27:17,974 --> 00:27:19,214
You even took a photo.

655
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:27,494
So, Mr. Zhang,

656
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:28,974
are you suspecting me of cheating?

657
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,575
The exam paper was on the computer.

658
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:32,974
And you looked at it for a long time.

659
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:35,214
Tell me, what were you looking at?

660
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:40,375
First of all, I didn't cheat.

661
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,175
Secondly, I didn't

662
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:41,895
look at your computer.

663
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:43,335
I was looking at this.

664
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:46,335
I didn't expect you'd like this too.

665
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:51,974
Of course you can say anything

666
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:52,655
you want now.

667
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,655
No, I'm not lying.

668
00:27:59,415 --> 00:27:59,774
Look.

669
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:01,135
The photo is still here.

670
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:06,855
I can't see it on the footage.

671
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:08,335
Who knows if you've taken other photos?

672
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:09,415
Mr. Zhang,

673
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,214
why are you always biased against me?

674
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:12,534
I'm not biased against you.

675
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:14,214
This is a reasonable doubt.

676
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:16,214
Since Grade 11,

677
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:17,935
of all the exams,

678
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:18,855
have you ever passed any of them?

679
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:20,974
Your average score has
always been 40 to 50 points.

680
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:22,694
You even have scored 20-odd points.

681
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:24,774
Tell me.

682
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:26,214
You've improved
by 70-odd points all of a sudden.

683
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:27,095
Who could believe it?

684
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,014
I believe it.

685
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:34,615
Miss Chen.

686
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:36,534
Go back to the classroom.

687
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:39,415
Let me talk to Mr. Zhang.

688
00:28:42,294 --> 00:28:42,855
No, but I...

689
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:43,415
Go back to the classroom.

690
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:56,335
Mr. Zhang,

691
00:28:57,254 --> 00:28:58,575
you've said it just now.

692
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:00,615
That this is your suspicion.

693
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:02,095
This is reasonable doubt.

694
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:04,615
But all the teachers can see

695
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:06,415
how hard our class

696
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:07,494
has worked this time.

697
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:08,895
Especially Xu Jingjing

698
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:09,774
and those underachievers.

699
00:29:09,974 --> 00:29:10,534
Why do

700
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:11,534
you ignore it?

701
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:12,855
If they passed the test

702
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:14,895
and achieved the result
by their own effort,

703
00:29:15,135 --> 00:29:16,494
I certainly would be happy for them.

704
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:18,214
But Xu Jingjing

705
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:19,494
came to my table

706
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:20,294
at such a sensitive time,

707
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:22,254
and with the footage as an evidence,

708
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:23,774
our school

709
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:24,895
will have to pursue it.

710
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:28,095
Miss Chen,

711
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,734
I can understand

712
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,774
that you want to stay.

713
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:33,214
But I hope

714
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:35,855
you don't get carried away

715
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:37,294
by self-serving concerns.

716
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:47,734
Cheat?

717
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:49,214
Are you kidding me?

718
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:50,014
Jingjing,

719
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:51,135
don't be sad.

720
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:53,135
Zhang Chang'an is paranoid.

721
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:54,254
I think he must be

722
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:55,054
frustrated to see

723
00:29:55,214 --> 00:29:55,895
our class's progress.

724
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:57,895
That footage of Mr. Zhang is barely

725
00:29:58,135 --> 00:29:59,415
a circumstantial evidence.

726
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:00,694
It can't constitute
an evidentiary chain.

727
00:30:00,895 --> 00:30:01,734
Besides, his statement

728
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:02,534
is speculative.

729
00:30:02,774 --> 00:30:03,655
It has no legal effect.

730
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:04,454
Jingjing,

731
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:05,895
why don't you just cry it out?

732
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:07,175
You'll feel better.

733
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,054
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

734
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,815
I won't be mad
even if the others are mad.

735
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:12,815
It's not worth it if I fall ill
because of getting mad.

736
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:14,294
You're so noisy.

737
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:17,575
It's just a small matter.

738
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,175
Anyway, I'm not afraid
as I didn't do it.

739
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:21,575
Just let him say whatever he likes.

740
00:30:21,974 --> 00:30:22,895
This is not the first time

741
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:23,575
he accuses me.

742
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:25,054
I've gotten used to it.

743
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:27,974
I'm just worried about Miss Chen.

744
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:46,294
Let me say something
before the class begins.

745
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:48,855
First of all,

746
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:51,774
I believe in Xu Jingjing.

747
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:53,294
I believe in our class.

748
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:54,935
We know very well

749
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,054
about our endeavours this time.

750
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:00,335
However,

751
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:02,214
we have to allow Mr. Zhang

752
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:03,575
to have the right to doubt it.

753
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:06,655
Our school is still investigating

754
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:07,375
this matter.

755
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,855
Hope that you won't be affected.

756
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:11,615
Always believe

757
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:13,135
a clean hand wants no washing.

758
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:14,214
Miss Chen,

759
00:31:15,014 --> 00:31:16,095
has the grade-point average come out?

760
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:20,254
I have to tell you

761
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:21,214
a good news.

762
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,375
On this mid-term exam,

763
00:31:23,694 --> 00:31:24,415
our Class 3,

764
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:26,175
has created a miracle.

765
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:30,095
Great!

766
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:31,895
I knew study

767
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:32,895
is not my rival at all.

768
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:33,815
And I knew study

769
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,254
is not your rival.

770
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:36,135
Miss Chen,

771
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:37,294
we rank second or third?

772
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:38,734
Don't tell me we rank first.

773
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:41,175
Good!

774
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,175
The fourth place!

775
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,774
We rank fourth, fellow students.

776
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:51,454
Not tenth.

777
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:53,375
Just be happy.

778
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:55,095
You have no idea how envious

779
00:31:55,175 --> 00:31:56,135
the teachers were of me.

780
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:57,694
I was nearly puffed up
by the compliments.

781
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:01,175
Miss Chen,

782
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:03,974
we don't want you to leave.

783
00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:05,415
Yes, Miss Chen.

784
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:06,494
We don't want you to leave.

785
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:07,494
Miss Chen, if you leave,

786
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:08,375
how are we going

787
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,375
to find a good teacher like you?

788
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:10,135
But Miss Chen,

789
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:11,294
you've done nothing wrong.

790
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:13,214
Why must you leave?

791
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:17,214
No!

792
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:21,694
Miss Chen can't leave.

793
00:32:22,095 --> 00:32:22,454
Yes.

794
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,615
Miss Chen, you can't leave.

795
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:25,135
Yes, guys, say something.

796
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,575
Miss Chen, don't go.

797
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:37,494
Well,

798
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,454
it's not conclusive yet.

799
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:42,335
Don't be so pessimistic.

800
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:43,655
Let's continue the lesson first.

801
00:32:58,014 --> 00:32:59,454
I think if we want to keep
Miss Chen here,

802
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,294
we'll have to use the marathon method.

803
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:02,254
Let's write a joint letter.

804
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:03,375
Forget it.

805
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:04,534
The joint letter we wrote

806
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:05,935
to Zhang Chang'an was useless.

807
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:07,575
What if we hand it to Principal Shen?

808
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,175
He's not reliable.

809
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:12,815
It's all because of my mum.

810
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:15,054
I'll go back and talk to her.

811
00:33:16,254 --> 00:33:17,454
From years of my observation

812
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:18,774
of you and your mother,

813
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:20,254
just forget about it.

814
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:24,135
Don't sulk.

815
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:26,935
Let's think of other ways.

816
00:33:27,935 --> 00:33:28,494
I've got an idea.

817
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:30,214
If they get us a new teacher,

818
00:33:30,454 --> 00:33:31,534
we'll join in a strike.

819
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:32,214
What do you think?

820
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:33,214
This is a good idea.

821
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:34,254
If we did this,

822
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:35,014
it'd make

823
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:35,974
Miss Chen upset if she knew it.

824
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:41,095
Can't you get it?

825
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:43,135
Miss Chen

826
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:44,054
doesn't care

827
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,054
if she can stay or not.

828
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:51,855
What she cares about is our results.

829
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:22,134
I ate

830
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,375
when I was stressed out back then.

831
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:24,614
There's no stress reliever

832
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,335
more helpful in the world than food.

833
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,415
I know that you feel wronged.

834
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,295
Just take it out.

835
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:45,215
Don't hold it in.

836
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:46,574
How?

837
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:47,375
I'll teach you a trick.

838
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:48,215
Do it like I do.

839
00:34:54,855 --> 00:34:55,335
Keep it down.

840
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:56,454
There are many people here.

841
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,375
It feels great. Try it out.

842
00:34:58,815 --> 00:34:59,215
Give it a go.

843
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:09,815
Who can hear it?

844
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:11,094
Didn't you

845
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:11,895
shout loudly

846
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:13,094
when you were practising Taekwondo?

847
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:14,174
Show your teeth!

848
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:15,295
Come!

849
00:35:15,454 --> 00:35:16,775
Three, two, one.

850
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:22,935
How do you feel?

851
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:25,215
I'm surprised.

852
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:26,895
It's quite useful.

853
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:29,215
I won't teach boys and girls this trick.

854
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:29,735
It's only for you.

855
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:30,974
Who are you calling a tomboy?

856
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:36,654
Tell me.

857
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:39,935
The adults say
we'll have a lot of worries

858
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:41,494
when we grow up.

859
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:42,855
But why do we

860
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,014
already have a lot of worries

861
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:45,574
even when we're still kids?

862
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:49,935
Perhaps our worries

863
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,494
are nothing compared

864
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:54,054
to that of adults.

865
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:57,775
Such as Miss Chen.

866
00:36:13,295 --> 00:36:13,695
Why hasn't she...

867
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:14,574
What is the time now?

868
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:15,574
It's already after eight.

869
00:36:15,815 --> 00:36:16,454
It's already after eight?

870
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:20,174
Here she comes, Dear.

871
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:22,295
I'm back.

872
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:23,855
What's the matter?

873
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:24,654
What's wrong with your voice?

874
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:25,014
Come.

875
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:26,014
Why do you sound hoarse?

876
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:30,215
I've got a sore throat.

877
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:31,295
I sound a little hoarse.

878
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,654
Hurry up. Pour her some water.

879
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:34,735
Well.

880
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:35,855
You were fine when you went out.

881
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:36,614
But you sound hoarse
when you come back. Geez.

882
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:37,335
Soothe the throat.

883
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:39,855
Slow down.

884
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:46,375
Jingjing,

885
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:48,775
have you gotten your result?

886
00:36:49,295 --> 00:36:49,855
Did you pass it?

887
00:36:50,695 --> 00:36:51,335
What do you mean?

888
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:52,375
My daughter is

889
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:53,295
more than that.

890
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:54,415
Let's not squabble.

891
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:55,335
Did you pass it?

892
00:36:59,094 --> 00:36:59,895
What's wrong?

893
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:00,855
Jingjing.

894
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:02,654
Don't cry.

895
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:05,014
This is ridiculous!

896
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:06,654
What did Mr. Zhang mean?

897
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:08,255
I'll go to him tomorrow.

898
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:08,775
Mum.

899
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:09,454
This ticks me off.

900
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:10,855
Calm... Calm down.

901
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:14,654
What?

902
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,454
Mum, calm down.

903
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:20,295
Dad!

904
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:21,534
Put it down!

905
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:22,815
It's not necessary.

906
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:24,974
You've thought too much.

907
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:26,775
Why did I talk like this?

908
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:28,255
You've thought too much.

909
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,094
I'd like

910
00:37:29,335 --> 00:37:30,534
to put these three exam papers

911
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:31,935
in picture frames and hang them up.

912
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:33,654
Yes.

913
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:34,094
Right.

914
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,335
Let's hang them up high.

915
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:35,935
Yes.

916
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:36,695
Hang them up high.

917
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:38,094
Dad, Mum,

918
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:40,654
you have very low expectations of me.

919
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:42,415
Is it enough to pass an exam?

920
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:42,895
It's not enough.

921
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:44,695
I'll get you two an acceptance letter

922
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:47,815
to the prestigious university
in the future.

923
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:49,855
What did she say?

924
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:52,654
Your daughter is going to get us two

925
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:55,134
an acceptance letter
to the prestigious university.

926
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:57,895
Come, Dear, knock me with the hammer.

927
00:37:58,134 --> 00:37:59,215
Am I dreaming?

928
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:00,454
Are you my daughter?

929
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:02,094
Give me back my daughter.

930
00:38:02,335 --> 00:38:02,735
Mum,

931
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:04,094
stop messing around.

932
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,855
I'm serious.

933
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:14,014
Jingjing,

934
00:38:15,614 --> 00:38:16,574
I'm proud of you.

935
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:19,494
Our daughter has really grown up.

936
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:29,614
Miss Chen,

937
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,335
so, what's the ranking of Class 3

938
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:34,255
in the average score this time?

939
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:38,134
We rank fourth.

940
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:40,335
It means you fail to live up
to your commitments.

941
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:44,174
Yes.

942
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:46,654
I've written

943
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:47,534
the resignation application.

944
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:49,574
There's nothing much to say.

945
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:51,415
A bet is a bet.

946
00:38:52,255 --> 00:38:53,054
You agreed to resign

947
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,174
if you can't make it to the top three.

948
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:57,295
Mrs. Xu,

949
00:38:58,014 --> 00:38:59,654
the top three positions are

950
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:01,415
just an expression.

951
00:39:04,415 --> 00:39:05,295
Comparing to the ranking,

952
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:07,134
I care more
about the students' attitudes

953
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,094
toward the exams.

954
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:10,494
Class 3 has improved this time.

955
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,054
Everyone can see that.

956
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:12,895
But

957
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:14,534
did they make

958
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:18,174
the progress by their true capabilities?

959
00:39:18,895 --> 00:39:20,174
I'm just worried that the students

960
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,534
from Class 3 would go astray

961
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:24,574
as they're eager

962
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,614
to keep Miss Chen here.

963
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:30,815
I think

964
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:31,895
certain students

965
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:34,974
might've cheated on this exam.

966
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,295
