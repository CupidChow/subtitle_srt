16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,679
What's wrong with you?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,759
Sorry.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,759
Have some water.

19
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,360
You're having milk tea
from another shop?

20
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,399
My mother will be devastated

21
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,759
when she knows about this.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,759
You deserve to choke.

23
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,000
Tell your mom

24
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,200
to start

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,319
expanding.

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
Please set up a branch

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,080
near my house.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,359
I shall visit her shop every day.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,479
I know Grade 12 is a stressful year

30
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,120
but you shouldn't

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,199
have milk tea this early in the morning.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,639
Its calorie is off the chart.

33
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,479
Did

34
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,639
something bad happen?

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,120
No.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,359
My dad left on a business trip.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,599
He found a housekeeper

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
to cook

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,759
for me.

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,319
So why aren't you
having your breakfast at home?

41
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,000
You see,

42
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,120
she

43
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,520
hails from Zigong, Sichuan.

44
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,319
I have reasons to believe her blood

45
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,960
is made of chili oil.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,440
Chili oil.

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,799
Is it funny?

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
No.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,199
What are you going to do then?

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,039
Order takeouts?

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,759
That seems to be the case.

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,960
Let's go.

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,960
Time for school.

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,199
Let's go.

55
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,160
You are carrying it for real now?

56
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,079
You told me to.

57
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,000
It was a joke.

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,799
Why?

59
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,120
I quite like it.

60
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,359
If you say so.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,400
Let's go.

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,039
It doesn't look cute?

63
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,840
It's all right.

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,359
It doesn't look cute?

65
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,120
Just all right.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,599
Gao Zhan.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,639
What are you doing?

68
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,000
I told Mr. Zhang

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,079
that I prefer the seat by the window.

70
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,359
It suits me better.

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,919
Seriously?

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,960
Master Kang.

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,720
I count on you

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,879
to tutor Jingjing.

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,479
I got it.

76
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,319
What are you waiting for?

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
Move the table for me.

78
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,160
Sure!

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,680
Thank you.

80
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,560
You're welcome.

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,160
Dad.

82
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,479
What are you cooking?

83
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,079
He hasn't come home.

84
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,400
You're cooking?

85
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,679
Why?

86
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,119
Did something happen to my nose?

87
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,080
It smells amazing.

88
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,280
It sure does.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,520
But your cooking
shouldn't smell like this.

90
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,520
It doesn't make sense.

91
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:34,960
That's just mean.

92
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm going to spank you later.

93
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,640
Jesus.

94
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,919
Come clean now, mom.

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,479
Which takeout are you reheating?

96
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:46,280
This is much healthier than takeouts.

97
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,039
What is this then?

98
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:50,479
Check the fridge.

99
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,880
Mamma mia.

100
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:02,799
Why did you

101
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,320
buy this many frozen food?

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,119
I get it.

103
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,679
Sales in the supermarket?

104
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,599
How did you know?

105
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:11,599
Like oh my god.

106
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,200
It has no idea

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,559
how crowded it was today.

108
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,080
I checked them out

109
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,119
and they are surprisingly convenient.

110
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,039
You have veggie and meat

111
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,320
and it comes with the condiment.

112
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,359
You just toss it into the wok,

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
stir fry it and you're done.

114
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,080
It saves me all the trouble

115
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,840
and it saves me all the complaints
I'm about to receive.

116
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,039
No one will complain.

117
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,999
You're a master chef.

118
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,679
Stop it.

119
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:34,640
Oh.

120
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,640
It doesn't have preservatives, does it?

121
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,559
I see you care about your health.

122
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,239
Don't worry.

123
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,999
I have already checked.

124
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,720
No preservatives added

125
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,799
and it's also organic.

126
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,119
You have nothing to worry.

127
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,119
Wash your hands before eating.

Kang Jiawei.

132
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
You have lost more weight.

133
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:13,439
Is it

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
that obvious?

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,280
You didn't have dinner last night?

136
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:19,400
Don't bring it up.

137
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,400
Madam Gu didn't put any
chilies this time

138
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,160
but it seems like  she didn't know

139
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,280
how to season without using chilies.

140
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,239
Is that funny?

141
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,880
For real?

142
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,960
So I spare

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,880
both of us the trouble.

144
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,239
I told her to work somewhere else.

145
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,840
There are

146
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,999
Yuxiang shredded pork,
sweet and sour pork,

147
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,559
and stir-fried
black pepper beef in here.

148
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,359
My mom...

149
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:49,799
I'm not hungry.

150
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,439
I'll order takeouts if I am.

151
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,160
Don't worry about me.

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,799
You can keep them.

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,720
Why are you so tense?

154
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,880
Let me finish.

155
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,080
My mom bought them for me.

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,320
Bought?

157
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,559
You should have told me earlier.

158
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,799
They are all frozen food.

159
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,039
You just have to reheat them.

160
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,439
Curry too?

161
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,559
(Curry Chicken)
I love curry.

162
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:12,359
Curry chicken.

163
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,439
I just need to buy a bowl of rice.

164
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,679
All right.

165
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:15,799
I'll give you another packet

166
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,799
in like two days.

167
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,640
Don't.

168
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,200
How much are they?

169
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,359
I'll pay you.

170
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,359
Kang Jiawei, we shouldn't measure

171
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,640
our friendship with money.

172
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,679
You know what?

173
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,039
You'll tutor me

174
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
and we'll be even.

175
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,479
What?

176
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,559
It's my duty

177
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,520
to tutor you.

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,080
I will be pissed

179
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
if you won't let me tutor you.

180
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,559
By the way,

181
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,799
when is your dad coming back?

182
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,439
No idea.

183
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,039
He's always like this.

184
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,919
I'm used to it.

185
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,580
(Inpatient Building)

186
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,479
(Inpatient Building)
Mr. Kang.

187
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,400
Dr. Zhou.

188
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,239
Your family isn't here?

189
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,919
No.

190
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,599
You see.

191
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,239
My son is in Grade 12

192
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,520
so...

193
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,320
And I don't

194
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,679
have any other relatives

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,080
so

196
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,320
can I...

197
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,080
No.

198
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,160
You can't.

199
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,359
You are a

200
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,919
stage four liver cancer patient
who's pending surgery.

201
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,160
If something occurs
during the operation,

202
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,439
we'll inform your family

203
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,359
and we need their signature.

204
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
After the surgery,

205
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
you need to convalesce.

206
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,160
You need

207
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,520
24-hour care.

208
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,320
I can hire a caregiver.

209
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,520
I...

210
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:19,960
It's just a suggestion.

211
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,359
Inform your family as soon as possible.

212
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,760
You need

213
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,160
their company

214
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,280
right now.

215
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:27,280
All right.

216
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,720
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

217
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,359
Rest here now.

218
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,799
Official Xu.

219
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,559
This is my tribute for you.

220
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,319
I went to the second floor
and snatched them.

221
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,520
Popcorn chicken!

222
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,520
They only serve 30 portions per day.

223
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,600
So?

224
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,280
Do you like those nutritious meals?

225
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Your mother

226
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,280
is my savior.

227
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,719
Have some.

228
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,480
Why? You don't want it?

229
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,799
I'm having three dishes.

230
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
If I have another one, it'll be four.

231
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:02,919
Four is an unlucky number.

232
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,120
You have been very superstitious lately.

233
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,360
Unified examination for art students
is around the corner

234
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,199
and I need some luck.

235
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,480
Seriously, Wang Jiayao?

236
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,719
And I thought

237
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,719
you were the voice of reason

238
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,719
among the trio.

239
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,319
What?

240
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,360
What are you implying?

241
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,079
Exactly.

242
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,839
What are you implying?

243
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:19,839
I shall drink to excuse myself.

244
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,839
Jingjing.

245
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,839
You should avoid

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,679
wearing anything yellow.

247
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:24,760
Yellow

248
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,319
is an ominous color.

249
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,919
You could have told me earlier.

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,760
Tell me now.

251
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,959
What other precautions should I take?

252
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,000
No pig's ear.

253
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Why?

254
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,559
I just had that yesterday at home.

255
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,799
Van Gogh will be displeased.

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,839
I like that joke.

257
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,640
You have my vote.

258
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,839
It's not funny at all.

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,839
But we can try

260
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,319
praying to Van Gogh or Picasso.

261
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,000
Ask these genius artists to bless us.

262
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,319
Oh.

263
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,719
Have you heard about

264
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,120
the Wish Tree in Fuxing University?

265
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,640
What Wish Tree?

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,240
There is a giant tree

267
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,719
next to the university.

268
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
I heard it's more than 300 years old.

269
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,559
My senior said

270
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,719
that if you write your name

271
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,520
and hang it on the tree,

272
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,679
you'll get into Fuxing.

273
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,120
And you believe that?

274
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,039
If you

275
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:04,760
fall from the tree,

276
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,360
you can even sit

277
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:05,880
the entire college
entrance examination out.

278
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,480
Shut up.

279
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,319
Okay.

280
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,000
It's true.

281
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:09,760
That senior

282
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,039
did get into Fuxing.

283
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,160
And they also said

284
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,559
the higher you hang your name,

285
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,799
the more effective it is.

286
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,280
I was just telling Dapeng a few days ago

287
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,360
that I wanted to visit that place.

288
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,380
(Kang Jiawei)

289
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,959
Hello. Yes?

290
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,039
Xu Jingjing. Help!

291
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

292
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,240
Where are you?

293
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,160
Kang Jiawei.

294
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,400
Kang Jiawei.

295
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
I'm up here.

296
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:08,799
You...

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,240
Why did you get up there?

298
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,719
I'm stuck.

299
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Stuck?

300
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,919
It's more like you can't get down.

301
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,439
Wait for me.

302
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,280
Xu Jingjing.

303
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,799
You went too far.

304
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,199
Just wait till I get down.

305
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Is that a threat?

306
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,919
Fine. I'll leave then.

307
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,880
Don't.

308
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,039
Go ahead. Take the photo.

309
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:30,559
Lift your butt.

310
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,240
Enough already.

311
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,959
And who said he wasn't superstitious?

312
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:37,880
But you are.

313
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,000
You are superstitious.

314
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,640
So you climbed the tree

315
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,600
for me?

316
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,160
What else?

317
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,280
For myself?

318
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,520
Do I even need the blessing?

319
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,199
Wait.

320
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:49,719
What?

321
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,760
I'll climb it too.

322
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,919
The higher I climb,

323
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,480
the more taken I am

324
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,319
by the view before me.

325
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,559
I begin catching the wonderful smell

326
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,559
in the gentle breeze.

327
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,199
It smells like sunshine and grass.

328
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
I breathe in greedily,

329
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
letting the sweet scent fill my body.

330
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,280
You have watched Flipped before?

331
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,160
Many times.

332
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:23,640
Xu Jingjing.

333
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,600
I want to go to the same university
as you.

334
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,160
If,

335
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,039
I mean if,

336
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,000
we can't get into the same university,

337
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,839
what should we do?

338
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,000
This again?

339
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:34,640
Don't get me wrong.

340
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,799
I mean

341
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,559
if I underperform

342
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,079
and I can't get into Fuxing,

343
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,559
then we won't be able
to go to school together,

344
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,360
to revise together,

345
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,880
to go to the canteen together.

346
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:48,240
But we can still

347
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,480
be together, right?

348
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,880
Of course.

349
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,799
During weekends,

350
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,480
we can watch a movie together.

351
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,839
We will eat all the good food

352
00:12:59,039 --> 00:12:59,959
in Wuxi.

353
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,439
And we will listen

354
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,839
to the latest music album

355
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,719
while gossiping the music critiques.

356
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,600
And when I draw,

357
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:08,880
you'll be my model.

358
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,319
Then I won't need to

359
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
use your photo as a reference.

360
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,240
You are drawing me now?

361
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:20,160
No.

362
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,480
Not at all.

363
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,120
Who will draw you?

364
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,640
But you want me to be your model.

365
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,959
I have to work out harder.

366
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,839
What are you implying, Kang Jiawei?

367
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,079
You two.

368
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,079
Come back down.

369
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,280
You hear that?

370
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,280
He asked you to get down.

371
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,439
After you.

372
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,760
I'm stuck. I can't come down.

373
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,000
So am I.

374
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,679
But you climbed up here

375
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:47,839
so swiftly.

376
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
I can climb up but not down.

377
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:53,319
Stay here.

378
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,839
I'll find a ladder for you.

379
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,839

Eat now. Don't be late.

407
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,679
Eat.

408
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,400
Have some dumplings, Jingjing.

409
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,439
Are they delicious?

that it doesn't matter whether

you ace or flunk

I can take care of you forever.

416
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,679
Nonsense.

417
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,880
I was too emotional.

418
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,839
Jingjing, listen to me.

419
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,240
Relax

420
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
and do what you usually do.

421
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,160
Exactly.

422
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,360

I think

426
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,600
I can ace it today.

427
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,799
Wonderful.

428
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,400

Don't just stare at me.

431
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:53,640
Eat the steamed buns.

432
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,480
They are

433
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,280
amazing.

434
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,240
It's for the ace students.

- You can have it.
- We're not hungry.

436
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,839
Eat all of them.

437
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,439
We're not hungry.

438
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:00,319
That's no good.

440

It's easy.

481

Just take the brush

and paint at the back of the canvas.

483

You'll ruin the work of the person

you'll buy us?

510
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,160
You'll decide.

511
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,640
No free meal, all right?

512
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:29,560
How's the exam?

513
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,679
I think I did quite well.

514
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,479
I'm serious.

515
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,320
I saw others and their works.

516
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,160
I want to tear their pieces already,

517
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,279
let alone Snape.

518
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,679
You guys can go ahead.

519
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:40,199
I have something to do.
I have to go now.

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,560
Jiayao.

521
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,479
What's wrong with her?

522
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,999
She underperformed?

523
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,919
No way.

524
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,759
Don't just stand there.

525
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:51,679
Chase after her.

526
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:56,800
Jiayao.

527
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,919
What's wrong?

528
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,560
You flunked the exam?

529
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,880
It's none of your business.

530
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,919
You're overthinking it.

531
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:08,840
Calm your mind down.

532
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,279
Superstitions are never accurate.

533
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:11,919
I ruined Xu Jingjing.

534
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,560
What should I do?

535
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,959
She's going to fail because of me.

536
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,080
What do you mean?

537
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,840
How did you ruin her?

538
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,199
Mister.

539
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,400
Please wait.

540
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
Why? You forgot something?

541
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,160
No.

542
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,640
We...

543
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,880
There

544
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,279
was a male student

545
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,519
who painted the back of the canvas

546
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,120
in an attempt to tarnish
others' art pieces.

547
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,320
The works of those candidates

548
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,160
sitting next to him

549
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,239
might have been dirtied.

550
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,479
Don't worry.

551
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,759
We noticed that when we were leafing

552
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:51,640
through the works.

553
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:52,800
The perpetrator

554
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,759
is now in the Academic Department.

555
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,640
His candidature will be revoked.

556
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,880
He has accomplices too.

557
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,880
Three in total.

558
00:20:58,279 --> 00:20:58,880
They were doing it.

559
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,640
Fret not.

560
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,199
When we collect the art pieces,

561
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,759
we will check the recto and verso
of the canvas.

562
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:03,560
This dirty trick

563
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
will never work.

564
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,840
You're a brave

565
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,919
and chivalrous student.

566
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:11,040
Go home now.

567
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,199
Mr. Zhao, you're looking for me?

568
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,239
Good timing.

569
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,759
Take a pump and help me inflate them.

570
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,919
Have you been training lately?

571
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,479
I have been busy
with the general courses

572
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,919
so I didn't train formally.

573
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:43,519
Student-Athlete Recruitment Test

574
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,479
is about to begin.

575
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:46,080
How confident are you?

576
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:48,959
I don't know.

577
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Be more confident.

578
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,679
You have the potential.

579
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Just train more often after school.

580
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:54,880
If you need my help,

581
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,919
just let me know.

582
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,600
All right.

583
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:58,519
Thanks, Mr. Zhao.

584
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,439
No worries.

585
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:09,919
All veggies again?

586
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,199
Xiong.

587
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,600
Let me give you a drumstick.

588
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,080
Thank you.

589
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,120
What are you reading? You're frowning.

590
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,780
(Men's Timed Track And Field Event
Performance Table)

591
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,600
You have a test too?

592
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,199
It's bound to happen.

593
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,160
Don't worry, Xiong.

594
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,160
You can do it.

595
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:31,600
Do you know

596
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,080
how many student-athletes
there are in our country?

597
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,959
Many of them play
in the provincial team.

598
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,600
I can't compare to them.

599
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,239
What are you on about?

600
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,919
You got a gold medal

601
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,800
in last year's

602
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,919
sports day.

603
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,080
Besides,

604
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,719
those athletes in the provincial team
from Class 6,

605
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:45,919
you defeated them, didn't you?

606
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,080
If you can defeat them once,

607
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,800
you can defeat them

608
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:48,999
twice or thrice.

609
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,279
Thank you.

610
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,560
Eat.

611
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:08,040
Hi, dad.

612
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,759
What are you doing?

613
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,800
I hope you're not stirring any trouble.

614
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:12,999
I

615
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,519
have been obedient.

616
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,560
Now only you realized

617
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:17,439
you have a son.

618
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,959
I've been busy lately.

619
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,519
How's Madam Gu?

620
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,080
I told her to work somewhere else.

621
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,120
Why didn't you

622
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:28,800
tell me?

623
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,080
How are you supposed

624
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,120
to feed yourself on your own then?

625
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,880
Madam Gu's cooking

626
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,560
is too spicy for my liking.

627
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,439
I'll find someone else for you.

628
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,679
No need.

629
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:41,479
Xu Jingjing

630
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,439
has been helping me.

631
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:43,959
She gives me many things to eat.

632
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,479
But you can't

633
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,719
bother her all the time.

634
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,999
Kang Minzhi.

635
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:53,080
What was that?

636
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,959
I heard a female voice.

637
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,360
Are you dating someone

638
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,560
behind my back?

639
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,479
Watch your mouth,

640
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,120
kid.

641
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,160
I...

642
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,880
I have a meeting soon.

643
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,160
Dad.

644
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,439
When are you coming back?

645
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
In a month, I suppose.

646
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,120
All right.

647
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,199
Just go back to your work.

648
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:16,919
Okay.

649
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:18,679
Take care of yourself.

650
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:19,840
You too.

651
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,400
Bye.

652
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:58,999
Quiet. Everyone's asleep.

653
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,040
Mom.

654
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:01,959
You shouldn't scare people like that.

655
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Why do you need them?

656
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:05,959
I...

657
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,040
Feeding the stray cats and dogs again?

658
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
No.

659
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,679
I'm hungry.

660
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,679
I have been studying lately

661
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:13,959
and it requires a lot of brain power.

662
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,320
I get hungry easily.

663
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,479
You can finish all of them alone?

664
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:22,199
No wonder the nutritious meals

665
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,600
disappear so quickly lately.

666
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,679
Come clean now.

667
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:35,880
So the food

668
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,800
is for Jiawei?

669
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,439
Give him

670
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,160
all the food

671
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,640
in the fridge then.

672
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:47,320
You're the best.

673
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,439
Thanks, mom.

674
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,199
But this is not sustainable.

675
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:53,519
Did his dad

676
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:54,840
mention when he will be back?

677
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,279
Jingjing.

678
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,840
Let's walk together.

679
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,400
I heard the unified examination
for art students is over.

680
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,840
You can take a breather now.

681
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,040
Impossible.

682
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,479
We still have general courses
to go through.

683
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,679
By the way,

684
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,600
how are you and your mother

685
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,479
lately?

686
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,320
Does she support your decision to pursue
hip-hop now?

687
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,840
She's brainwashing you again?

688
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,320
She applied

689
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,719
to three companies on my behalf.

690
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:26,120
None of them replied.

691
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:28,999
I guess

692
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,679
maybe

693
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,080
I overestimated myself.

694
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,439
It's just three companies.

695
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,279
If that doesn't work,

696
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,519
we'll apply to 300 companies.

697
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,199
Worst comes to worst, I'll apply
for you.

698
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,880
Jingjing.

699
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,279
Thank you for your support

700
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:43,160
and encouragement.

701
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:46,199
But I guess this is it.

702
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,360
I don't want to see

703
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,239
all my applications go unanswered.

704
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,800
And I don't have the courage

705
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,080
to face it.

706
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,320
The dance academy

707
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,400
will have its exam soon.

708
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:58,959
I should seize whatever opportunity

709
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,199
I can.

710
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,040
Morning.

711
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:13,959
Thank you.

712
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,679
I finished the last box last night.

713
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,040
I thought I would have to starve again.

714
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm speechless.

715
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,560
My mom caught me as I smuggled

716
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,080
the food for you.

717
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:27,919
Smuggled?

718
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,320
You have been smuggling?

719
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,160
Did she scold you?

720
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:33,519
No.

721
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,560
After I told her

722
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,600
about your situation,

723
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
she let me give you

724
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:37,919
all the food.

725
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,320
Tell me

726
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,999
how I can

727
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,120
thank her.

728
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:46,439
Just thank me.

729
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,759
When is your father coming back?

730
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,640
He said in a month.

731
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,999
All right.

732
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,600
I'll feed you for another month.

733
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,880
Why do you look so happy?

734
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,400
I feel like

735
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,120
a Master now.

736
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,560
Perhaps you

737
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,160
can be my domesticated elf
as a token of gratitude.

738
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,479
I will thank your mom. Not you.

739
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,279
What are you doing?

740
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:16,919
Give it back.

741
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,840
What are you doing?

742
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,080
You already gave it to me.

743
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,719
I want to take it back.

744
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:20,479
I won't give it back.

745
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,279
Give it back.

746
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,160
What are you doing?

747
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,400
Everyone is looking at us.

748
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:25,919
Mom.

749
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,439
No need to be this serious.

750
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:30,840
The exam is this Saturday.

751
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,439
You will perform

752
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:33,279
your entire routine.

753
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,640
Pretend I'm the judge.

754
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,800
Walk from there to here.

755
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,239
Start.

756
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,679
You're arching your back.

757
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,759
Straighten it.

758
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:57,160
Hi.

759
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,279
I'm Xu Jingjing,

760
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,759
from Yuming Senior High School.

761
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,160
Your voice is too meek.

762
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,560
Be louder.

763
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,679
Hi.

764
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
I'm Xu Jingjing,

765
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:08,919
from...

766
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,040
Smile.

767
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,279
Smile.

768
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,320
Remember it.

769
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,479
Mom.

770
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,080
They will mainly evaluate my movement.

771
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,160
I beg your pardon?

772
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:20,439
When you make your appearance,

773
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,999
your voice, your image

774
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,800
should leave an impression.

775
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,840
Ms. Liu.

776
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:25,719
They are giving away mandarin oranges.

777
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,919
Come get some.

778
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,320
Practice on your own now.

779
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,080
Remember what I told you.

780
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,860
(Manager Huang, Shidai Entertainment)

781
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:01,719
Hi.

782
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:02,279
Hi.

783
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,199
Hi, Ms. Liu.

784
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,719
Sorry for taking up your time.

785
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,279
You haven't been picking up our calls.

786
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,360
You must have been very busy.

787
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,679
We just want to know

788
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,120
if Xu Jingjing

789
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,519
can return

790
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,320
for a second interview.

791
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,360
A second interview?

792
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,800
Are you Ms. Liu?

793
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
Yes.

794
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,600
Go ahead.

795
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,640
We believe

796
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,400
Xu Jingjing has good potential.

797
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:24,080
If you agree to work with us,

798
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,919
we promise to devise her

799
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
a personal talent-nurturing plan.

800
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,199
Hello?

801
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,160
Hello?

802
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,040
Hello?

803
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,279
Can you hear me?

804
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,600
I...

805
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,199
She can come.

806
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,640
Wonderful.

807
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,279
I'll see you on Saturday then.

808
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:43,360
Okay.

809
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,479
Oh.

810
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,959
I'll send you

811
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,199
a new number.

812
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:48,519
This is my

813
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:49,400
work phone

814
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,640
so please don't call this number again.

815
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,040
Bye.

816
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,840
Your mom has no right to do that.

817
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,880
Why didn't she tell you?

818
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,759
Why did she apply

819
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:06,919
on your behalf then?

820
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:08,199
I think

821
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:09,759
she wants me

822
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,080
to give it up.

823
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,880
And I trusted her back then.

824
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:16,999
Will you go then?

825
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,279
But the second interview

826
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,959
is on the same day as the college
entrance examination for art students.

827
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,719
What a coincidence.

828
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,199
My mom will come with me

829
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,640
for the entrance examination.

830
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:27,959
So I need to find a way

831
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:28,999
to get rid of her.

832
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,880
I invited all of you here

833
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,320
to see if any of you

834
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,759
has any idea.

835
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,080
Jingjing.

836
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,800
You started dancing

837
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,560
when you were in kindergarten.

838
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:39,959
It's as if you've been toiling

839
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:40,800
for this

840
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,160
entrance examination.

841
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:43,360
Is this

842
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
your final decision?

843
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,120
Yes.

844
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:46,999
I have always wanted

845
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,239
to give up ballet.

846
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm not quitting ballet

847
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:49,840
because I want

848
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,120
to be an idol trainee.

849
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,040
The thought has been floating in my mind
for a long time.

850
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,120
I don't know

851
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,040
if you know

852
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,360
the pain of forcing yourself
to do something

853
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,040
that you want

854
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,400
to give up on.

855
00:31:59,239 --> 00:31:59,880
I see.

856
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,199
As long as you won't regret it.

857
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,439
I won't.

858
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,439
All right.

859
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,919
Now that we know

860
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,840
what the problem is,

861
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,160
the rest is to figure out

862
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,040
how to get rid of Jingjing's mom.

863
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,880
Yes, how.

864
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,919
I can pretend that I have an upset tummy

865
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
and distract your mom.

866
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,120
But

867
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,120
if you have an upset tummy,

868
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,600
shouldn't you turn to your parents?

869
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,040
True.

870
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,080
Then get rid of

871
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,320
Xu Jingjing's parents first.

872
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:26,640
We will then have an excuse

873
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,679
to distract your mom.

874
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,959
What if your mom

875
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:29,999
asks your dad to take care

876
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,080
of her?

877
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,439
My dad is on a business trip that day.

878
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:33,640
He'll be back on Sunday.

879
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,800
And now, the problem

880
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,120
is how

881
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,080
we can get rid of my parents.

882
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:40,759
That's easy.

883
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,160
Your tickets.

884
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,160
Thank you.

885
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,959
Two tickets for The Mermaid

886
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,479
on 9 a.m. this Saturday.

887
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,959
Told them they are from
my dad's company.

888
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,840
Thank your mom for buying me food.

889
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,199
So reliable. Go. Let's eat.

890
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,840
Is it done?

891
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,640
Yes.

892
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,800
I gave the tickets to my parents.

893
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,880
They will never say no

894
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,640
to free tickets.

895
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:04,800
I'll leave around

896
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,320
9:15 a.m. tomorrow morning.

897
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,800
Keep in touch.

898
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,400
Okay.

899
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,999
You know right from left, don't you?

900
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,800
Of course.

901
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,400
Remember now.

902
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,199
Appendicitis is a stomach ache
in the bottom right abdomen.

903
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,279
Don't mess it up.

904
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,360
Don't worry.

905
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:17,199
Gao and I

906
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:18,479
will be on standby
near your house entrance.

907
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,199
Once Xu Jingjing leaves with Ms. Liu,

908
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
we'll bring the other Xu Jingjing

909
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,080
to the entertainment company.

910
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,040
To a successful

911
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,160
mission.

912
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,080
Come.

913
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

914
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:29,919
Cheers.

915
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,160
Jingjing.

916
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:36,959
I have prepared for you

917
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,080
two sets of costumes.

918
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
I put them in here.

919
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,479
Don't forget it.

920
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,919
The breakfast will be ready soon.

921
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,759
Don't just stand there.

922
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:46,800
Rehearse a bit.

923
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,999
How's everything?

924
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:56,600
All is well.

925
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,199
My parents have left home.

926
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,160
Oh, no, Ms. Liu.

927
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,560
My stomach hurts a lot.

928
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,239
It hurts like hell.

929
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,600
Help me.

930
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,359
I feel like this isn't good enough.

931
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,560
We leave in one minute.

932
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,239
Roger!

933
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:31,480
Ms. Liu!

934
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:32,560
Oh, no.

935
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:33,920
Save me!

936
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,960
We should make one.

937
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,839
The ribs will affect the beef...

938
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,399
Jingjing!

939
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,080
What's the matter?

940
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
What is the problem?

941
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,679
Her lips are blanched.
Call the ambulance!

942
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:43,600
120. Hurry!

943
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:44,799
Stop!

944
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,719
Gao, the code name should be

945
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Operation Rescue Whale Alice.

946
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,920
What do you think?

947
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,480
Is it too long?

948
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,799
What is going on?

949
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:01,359
I had some

950
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,960
dried persimmons.

951
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,920
The powder got on my lips.

952
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,000
Goodness me.

953
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:05,799
You had dried persimmons

954
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,080
but you forgot to wipe your lips.

955
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,080
A princess should be mindful
of her image.

956
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,640
How many times did I tell you?

957
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,799
Wait.

958
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,480
Why did you two come back?

959
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,120
We sold the tickets.

960
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,040
You sold them?

961
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,799
It was some

962
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,560
casting meet and greet.

963
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,480
So many young girls

964
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,440
lined up in front of the cinema.

965
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,799
Those who got the tickets were laughing

966
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,520
but those who didn't

967
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:26,759
were fussing.

968
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,399
- It was so annoying.
- So annoying.

969
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:30,120
We're not there to meet the celebrity.

970
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:30,759
Right?

971
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,279
Exactly.

972
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,160
No!

973
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:33,920
How can you squander Mr. Kang's

974
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,920
gift away just like that?

975
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,359
Squander?

976
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,960
We sold the tickets and used

977
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,799
the money to buy some beef filets

978
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,480
to make beet filets with rice for him.

979
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,399
Didn't we?

980
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,199
Didn't you say

981
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,239
he and I will split the filets?

982
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:45,839
Don't always take the children's food.

983
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,520
But...

984
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,839
Jingjing!

985
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,080
Oh, no.

986
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:54,279
My parents

987
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,399
sold the movie tickets.

988
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,279
They came home.

989
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,239
What should we do?

990
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,399
Don't panic.

991
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,160
If this doesn't work,

992
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,520
you can head to the exam venue

993
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,199
and feign sickness over there.

994
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,080
Why would I appear

995
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:05,920
at her exam venue?

996
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:06,920
Just say you're there

997
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,879
to support her.

998
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:09,520
Wait.

999
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:10,640
Even if you're there,

1000
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,120
if Ms. Liu calls

1001
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:13,080
your parents,

1002
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:14,440
the other Xu Jingjing
will still be stuck there.

1003
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,279
That's possible.

1004
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,160
I have a solution.

1005
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,239
Just go to the exam venue now.

1006
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,399
Okay.

1007
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,679
What solution do you have?

1008
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:25,560
We'll wing it.

1009
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,640
Wing it?

1010
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,480
We'll have braised prawns today.

1011
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,239
Mr. and Mrs. Xu.

1012
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,000
Why are you two here?

1013
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,560
Come in.

1014
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:38,920
We just passed by here.

1015
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:39,799
Okay.

1016
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,440
Mrs. Xu, I have several questions

1017
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,879
For Xu Jingjing.

1018
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,440
Come in and have a seat.

1019
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,679
Stop playing.

1020
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,120
Greet the guests.

1021
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,719
Jingjing went out.

1022
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,520
She'll be back in a moment.

1023
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:49,600
You can wait here.

1024
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:50,640
It won't be long.

1025
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,879
Let me finish this round.

1026
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
My highest score yet!

1027
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,920
What are you playing?

1028
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,759
Anipop.

1029
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,759
Anipop.

1030
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,399
Mr. Xu, where is the toilet?

1031
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,239
On the right of the corridor.

1032
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:08,839
Kang.

1033
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,160
Do you play games?

1034
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,440
Not a lot. I like to study.

1035
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,719
If only my Jingjing

1036
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,600
was half as hardworking as you are.

1037
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,399
I'll be over the moon.

1038
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,679
Mr. Xu.

1039
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,239
Your toilet is leaking.

1040
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:38,960
Again?

1041
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,719
Just go.
I'll play the game on your behalf.

1042
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,399
You know how to play it?

1043
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,239
I can try.

1044
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,359
Don't give me a dead round.

1045
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,120
Okay.

1046
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,040
Coming!

1047
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,799
Kang.

1048
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,080
Have some water.

1049
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,000
Anipop is a tough game.

1050
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:53,799
And he lets you play

1051
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,480
on his behalf?

1052
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,160
Yes.

1053
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,199
It's just a game. Ignore him.

1054
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,359
It's fine.

1055
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,080
When you're doing the Arabesque turn,

1056
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,199
pay attention to your core.

1057
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,799
Straighten your back and lift it.

1058
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,679
Don't forget.

1059
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,759
Relax.

1060
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,520
You'll be fine.

1061
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,199
Jingjing.

1062
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:08,920
Jingjing.

1063
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:09,839
Why are you here?

1064
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,679
I'm here to support Jingjing.

1065
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,480
Jingjing.

1066
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,040
You gave me this protective amulet.

1067
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,239
I want you to have it back.

1068
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,600
All the best

1069
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,839
for your exam today.

1070
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,799
Isn't your dad on a business trip?

1071
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,080
If something happens to you back home,

1072
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,359
just call me.

1073
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,839
Don't be shy.

1074
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,520
Thanks, Mrs. Xu.

1075
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,920
What's the matter?

1076
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,799
Is your phone vibrating, Mrs. Xu?

1077
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,040
Where is my phone?

1078
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:34,839
Yes.

1079
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,040
It's not this one?

1080
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,199
It's here.

1081
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:38,560
No.

1082
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:39,600
I didn't hear any vibration.

1083
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,399
It's not from Mr. Xu's phone either.

1084
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:41,520
No, no call at all.

1085
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:42,359
All is fine.

1086
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,000
I must have misheard.

1087
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:43,640
All this studying

1088
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,719
is giving me a headache.

1089
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:45,839
Which university are you

1090
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,759
attending?

1091
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,160
I want to go to Fuxing.

1092
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,199
Fuxing?

1093
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,359
Jingjing wants to get into Fuxing too.

1094
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,920
What a coincidence.

1095
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,120
All right. Go in now.

1096
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,199
Hurry.

1097
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,560
Mom.

1098
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,040
What's going on?

1099
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,160
My stomach

1100
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,920
hurts.

1101
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,000
Is it serious?

1102
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:05,160
It's okay.

1103
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,359
Maybe it's because

1104
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,120
I ran too fast.

1105
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,319
Go now.

1106
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:11,239
Mom.

1107
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,199
I can't do this.

1108
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:12,879
Hold on.

1109
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,520
Tell me

1110
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,279
where it hurts.

1111
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,239
Show me.

1112
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,520
Bottom right abdomen.

1113
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:17,759
Side stitch?

1114
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Worse than that.

1115
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,160
Bottom right abdomen.

1116
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,000
Can it be acute appendicitis?

1117
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,040
I...

1118
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,600
Are you still thirsty?

1119
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,759
I'll give you another glass.

1120
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,480
Mrs. Xu.

1121
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,199
Can I have warm water, please?

1122
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,160
I have been having an upset tummy.

1123
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:30,879
Sure.

1124
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,199
I'll boil the water for you.

1125
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,120
Sit tight.

1126
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:33,960
Okay.

1127
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,620
(Liu Wan, Block)

1128
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,500
(Enter Passcode)

1129
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:51,759
It should be fine right now.

1130
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,040
Xu Jingjing. Hang in there.

1131
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:55,239
I'll call your family.

1132
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:56,719
What is going on?

1133
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,940
(Incorrect Passcode,
Three Attempts Remaining)

1134
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,640
Gao Zhan, you're tall and handsome!

1135
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,440
Thank you. Have a seat.

1136
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:12,600
How was that round? You completed it?

1137
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:13,399
Not yet.

1138
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,199
Not...

1139
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,040
I'm not familiar with it.

1140
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:15,920
I knew it.

1141
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:16,759
You can study very well

1142
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,279
but you can't play games at all.

1143
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,279
Can you reach them?

1144
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,679
No. Hang on.

1145
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:27,600
Why can't I reach them?

1146
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,960
It's okay.

1147
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,600
You two just go in first.

1148
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,239
I can wait here.

1149
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,359
Mom.

1150
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,839
Jingjing, leave us here.

1151
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,879
Go inside for your exam.

1152
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,520
I'll send her to the hospital.

1153
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:39,679
Come.

1154
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,679
Just go inside now.

1155
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,719
I'll go now then.

1156
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,799
Relax. You will be fine.

1157
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,520
Go.

1158
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,560
Good luck, Jingjing.

1159
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:51,000
- Come.
- Oh, no!

1160
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,960
I'll send you to the hospital.

1161
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,640
Mrs. Xu!

1162
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,759
Oh, dear.

1163
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:55,679
Does it hurt that much?

1164
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:05,960
After going through your lab result,

1165
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,199
I see no inflammation.

1166
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,480
You're fine.

1167
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,120
Does it still hurt?

1168
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:14,640
But doctor,

1169
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,960
it still hurts a bit.

1170
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,679
Can you give me

1171
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,359
a CT scan

1172
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:22,719
or do an MRI on me

1173
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,960
just to check thoroughly?

1174
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:24,920
You know what?

1175
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,359
I'll give you some painkillers.

1176
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:27,799
Wait and see how it goes in a few days.

1177
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,640
Thanks, doctor.

1178
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,319
How long have you learned to dance?

1179
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,440
I started ballet when I was little

1180
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,600
and I picked up hip-hop two years ago.

1181
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,000
Where did you learn to do hip-hop?

1182
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:02,879
I just followed

1183
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,359
online tutorials.

1184
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:08,520
I've been through your application.

1185
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,199
You're in Grade 12, aren't you?

1186
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:11,640
Are you attending a university?

1187
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,759
Of course.

1188
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:13,879
My grades

1189
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,239
will go to waste otherwise.

1190
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,000
So you're an excellent student too.

1191
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,120
Good.

1192
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,960
I have a question for you.

1193
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:22,199
If you get into a university,

1194
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:23,719
how can you balance

1195
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,920
your study

1196
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,560
and our training?

1197
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:28,920
My academic performance

1198
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,279
is consistently ranked

1199
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,160
within the top ten among my peers.

1200
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,000
My ballet skill is good enough

1201
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:33,719
to get myself

1202
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,799
into a professional ballet academy.

1203
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,640
As for hip-hop...

1204
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,879
I have an account

1205
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,319
that I use to post dance videos

1206
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,080
and I have garnered some fans.

1207
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,359
These three things

1208
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:42,160
can sufficiently prove

1209
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,040
that

1210
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:44,839
I can multitask.

1211
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,679
I am also very confident

1212
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,040
to break the mold

1213
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,679
and become a pop idol
with stellar academic performance.

1214
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,120
Careful.

1215
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,960
Just sit here.

1216
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:00,000
I'll get your medicine.

1217
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,239
Thanks, Mrs. Xu.

1218
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:17,719
