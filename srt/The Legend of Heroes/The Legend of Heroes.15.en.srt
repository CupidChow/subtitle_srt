=Episode 15=

3
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,530
Jing.

4
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,050
Jing.

5
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,210
Jing!

6
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,470
Rong.

7
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,810
Jing!

8
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,090
Jing!

9
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,190
Uncle.

10
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,400
Uncle.

11
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,630
Jing.

12
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,470
Rong.

13
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,720
- Qigong.
- Rong, stop calling their names.

14
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,440
My uncle's boat

15
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,840
was wrecked by the waves like this.

16
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,650
Guo Jing and my uncle

17
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,580
must have been crushed to pieces.

18
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,530
Stop talking nonsense!

19
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,090
Why did I talk nonsense?

20
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,020
- Jing!
- Rong.

21
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,050
Qigong.

22
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,770
Rong, you just have to accept reality.

23
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,680
Don't touch me.

24
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,930
Qigong.

25
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,120
Qigong.

26
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,230
Qigong.

27
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,440
Great.

28
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,280
Go look around

29
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,090
and see if there are
any houses on the island.

30
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,560
We can't keep walking like this.

31
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,050
We're in this desolate mountain.

32
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,560
No one will live here.

33
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,090
Just go look around.

34
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,820
What?

35
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,390
You just said you wouldn't

36
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,330
let me suffer grievances.

37
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,910
Now you can't even do

38
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,750
this small thing.

39
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,370
I will go. I will go.

40
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,670
I'll go take a look now.

41
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,530
Rong, wait for me.

42
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,580
Master.

43
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,610
Let's go this way.

44
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,050
(The boat suddenly sank.)

45
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,250
(Old Imp disappeared without a trace.)

46
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,490
(Me and Jing drifted for several days)

47
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,350
(and saw Ouyang Feng's boat.)

48
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,250
Everything is ready.

49
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,760
Once light the fire,

50
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,970
this big boat will turn into ashes.

51
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,340
Okay.

52
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,640
(They coveted the Nine Yin Manual)

53
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,760
(and wanted to kill us.)

54
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,900
(Later,)

55
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,440
(we fought on the boat.)

56
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,560
(I saved Ouyang Feng out of good will.)

57
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,750
(Who would have thought)

58
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,050
(he stabbed me in the back?)

59
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,370
Where is Jing?

60
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,810
Qigong, don't worry.

61
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,730
Jing is a lucky person.

62
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,200
He will be fine.

63
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,370
The most important thing now is

64
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,520
to detoxify the snake venom on you.

65
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,680
I can do that.

66
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,020
Why are you here?

67
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,460
This poison

68
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,830
is the king of all poisons

69
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,760
cultivated by my uncle.

70
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,780
Rong.

71
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,000
We have a telepathic connection.

72
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,930
Since you are not taking me with you,

73
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,000
I can only follow my heart.

74
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,880
Enough with the talk.

75
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,320
Give me the antidote.

76
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,290
I can give it to you,

77
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,760
but not for free.

78
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,970
What do you want?

79
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,930
I want to remove the thorns from you.

80
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,640
Cut to the chase!

81
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,200
You give me the Soft Hedgehog Armor,

82
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,810
and I will give you the antidote.

83
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,020
How is it?

84
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, I'll give it to you.

85
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,370
You go out first.

86
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,880
I'm wearing the Soft Hedgehog Armor.

87
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,110
If you don't go out,

88
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,330
how can I take it off
and give it to you?

89
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,120
Rong, you have always been clever.

90
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,230
If I go out,

91
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,270
and you do something

92
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,250
on the Soft Hedgehog Armor,

93
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,680
what should I do?

94
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,170
There's no one here.

95
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,740
Why don't you take off your clothes

96
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,440
one by one

97
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,860
so I can appreciate your beauty?

98
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,410
You deserve a beating, scoundrel!

99
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,610
Little Venomous Creature, unfreeze me.

100
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,220
Rong.

101
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,590
How can I easily

102
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,170
let you go?

103
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,710
Today,

104
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,540
I will get you

105
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,710
and let you see

106
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,490
what makes me better than Guo Jing.

107
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,880
Little beast.

108
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,270
I am here,

109
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,520
and you're still messing around.

110
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,170
You are not poisoned?

111
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,910
Your uncle's dirty tricks

112
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,440
can't work on me.

113
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,560
I disdain to kill you.

114
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,640
But I don't want to see you.

115
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,810
If you come again,

116
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,370
I'll have to take your life.

117
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,900
Get lost.

118
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,040
Great, Master.

119
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,550
You're fine.

120
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,000
Master.

121
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,730
The snake poison is really powerful.

122
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,250
Just by talking,

123
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,250
I couldn't suppress the poison

124
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,250
and let it get into my meridians.

125
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,490
Now I

126
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,730
have lost all my power.

127
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,190
There's no use anymore.

128
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,800
No, it won't happen.

129
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,980
Master.

130
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,040
I'll go find him and get the antidote.

131
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,090
Rong.

132
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,000
You are so smart.

133
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,120
How could you not know
that little beast was deceiving you?

134
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,980
No.

135
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,330
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

136
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,520
I won't give up.

137
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,760
I can't find Jing.

138
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,250
I can't lose you, either.

139
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,690
Fate is predetermined.

140
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,370
Even if you lose me,

141
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,570
you can't compromise yourself.

142
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,210
No.

143
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,850
I don't have much time left.

144
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,380
If that little beast

145
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,280
found out that I was bluffing,

146
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,970
I can't protect you anymore.

147
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,490
You go by yourself.

148
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,070
No.

149
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,030
Master.

150
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,760
We should leave together.

151
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,090
Jing is missing.

152
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,040
We can't put you in danger too.

153
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,920
Wait until it gets dark.

154
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,390
Master.

155
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,610
I'll take you to find a small boat

156
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,700
and leave here.

157
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,570
What are you here for again?

158
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,670
Sir.

159
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,230
I accidentally

160
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,850
offended Rong.

161
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,640
I feel guilty about it.

162
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,120
Please forgive me.

163
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,430
Don't think that I don't know

164
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,730
what are you up to.

165
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,450
Thinking that
you two have not eaten yet,

166
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,880
I caught a rabbit

167
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,450
and delivered it to you.

168
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,570
If you really mean it,

169
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,690
I appreciate it.

170
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,110
If you came to

171
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,400
check whether I lied,

172
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,040
get started

173
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,000
and don't dawdle.

174
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,000
You must be joking, sir.

175
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,690
I wouldn't dare.

176
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,190
Get lost.

177
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,160
Farewell.

178
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,310
Master.

179
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,330
I may fool him once,

180
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,490
but I can't fool him three times.

181
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,030
Rong.

182
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,510
Today I want you
to do something difficult

183
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,370
and against your nature.

184
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,800
Can you do that?

185
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,090
Please tell me.

186
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,030
Kid,

187
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,880
kneel down.

188
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,610
Master, you created the Beggars' Gang,

189
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,160
and passed it down to me.

190
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,330
I failed

191
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,120
to bring glory to our gang.

192
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,370
Today my time is coming,

193
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,760
and I have to take this burden off.

194
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,370
Please bless

195
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,160
this girl in front of me,

196
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,520
and always keep her safe.

197
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,060
Help her bring blessings

198
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,370
to the suffering disciples of our gang.

199
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,100
Master.

200
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,880
Are you going to make me
the Chief of Beggars' Gang?

201
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,090
I can't accept that.

202
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,160
If you refuse,

203
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,970
I will not rest in peace.

204
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,450
Master, I will do that.

205
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,280
Good girl.

206
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,040
The Dog-Beating Staff

207
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,490
is the token of the Chief of our gang.

208
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,040
Now I'm giving it to you.

209
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,250
Come take it.

210
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,160
From now on,

211
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,490
you are the 19th chief
of the Beggars' Gang.

212
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,490
You must escape from here.

213
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,400
On July 15th,

214
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,090
take this Dog-Beating Staff

215
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,450
to the beggars' meeting
by the Dongting Lake.

216
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,690
Beggars' meeting?

217
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,470
The four elders of the gang

218
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,730
and all the leaders

219
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,150
will be waiting for me there

220
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,570
to appoint the next Chief.

221
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,570
When they see this Staff,

222
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,800
they'll know what it means.

223
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,430
But, Master,

224
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm still young.

225
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,090
If I become the Chief,

226
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,160
the four elders won't agree.

227
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,330
They dare not.

228
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,490
This has been the rule.

229
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,620
As long as the Chief
of the Beggars' Gang gives an order,

230
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,120
all beggars in the world must obey.

231
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,160
It's a pity

232
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,690
that you, a little girl,

233
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,120
have to deal with all the beggars.

234
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,330
Your Highness.

235
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,460
Father.

236
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,090
Why did you summon me urgently?

237
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,550
Do you know why I said the other day

238
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,120
that we must wait for Ouyang Feng?

239
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't know.

240
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,880
Ouyang Ke told me

241
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,980
he's going to Peach Blossom Island

242
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,270
with his uncle Ouyang Feng

243
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,690
to find the Nine Yin Manual.

244
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,740
If he fails to obtain the Manual,

245
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,850
he will ask me to send soldiers to help.

246
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,250
As a trade-off,

247
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,350
he will persuade his uncle

248
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,310
to fully help us

249
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,850
get the Book of Wumu.

250
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,580
Now,

251
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,070
I've already received

252
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,280
a letter from Mr. Ouyang,

253
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,920
asking me to send troops.

254
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,280
That's great.

255
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,490
If Ouyang Feng can help us,

256
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,280
we will easily obtain the Book of Wumu.

257
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,780
I'm willing to go
to Peach Blossom Island

258
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,850
together with you

259
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,760
to assist Mr. Ouyang.

260
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,330
I must teach you
the Dog Beating Staff Technique

261
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,850
while I can still move.

262
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,400
Dog Beating Staff Technique?

263
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,230
What kind of dog

264
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,150
needs to get beatened

265
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,020
with a kind of technique?

266
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,570
Since ancient times,
poor people would be bullied by dogs.

267
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,260
You have never been poor,

268
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,100
so you don't know

269
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,860
those vicious dogs

270
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,690
specifically target poor
and vulnerable families.

271
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,730
If there are too many
vicious dogs on the road,

272
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,250
and they can't be driven away,

273
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,450
can't we use a weapon to beat them?

274
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,030
I got it.

275
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,610
Bad people are like vicious dogs,

276
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,800
and that lecher
is just a despicable dog.

277
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,490
The 36 styles of
Dog Beating Staff Techniques

278
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,370
were created by our grandmaster.

279
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,110
It's always been passed down

280
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,450
to the next Chief by the last one.

281
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,920
Never passing it on to an outsider.

282
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,760
Study it carefully.

283
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,040
The first style.

284
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,790
Master.

285
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,570
It's okay.

286
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,890
Keep practicing.

287
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,360
The second style.

288
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,800
The third style.

289
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,450
The fourth style.

290
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,320
Master, how is it?

291
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,180
The Dog Beating Staff Technique
is subtle

292
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,560
with marvellous moves,

293
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,000
catching the enemy off guard.

294
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,450
Originally,
you were the most suitable to learn,

295
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,560
it's just a pity that
time is too limited.

296
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,650
I taught it too simply.

297
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,060
Master.

298
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,550
I'm too stupid

299
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,830
to grasp the essence of it.

300
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,650
Don't blame me for being anxious.

301
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,840
We are trapped here.

302
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,990
That little brat

303
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,930
is still lurking outside.

304
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,590
If you can't learn faster,

305
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,430
I'm afraid...

306
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,450
I'm afraid...

307
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,430
Master.

308
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,860
Master.

309
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,210
Stop shouting.

310
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm not dead.

311
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,840
I'm just thirsty,

312
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,650
and don't want to talk anymore.

313
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,800
I'll go get you some water.

314
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,670
Rong.

315
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,700
Are you thirsty?

316
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,860
You want to find water to drink, right?

317
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,970
I have water here.

318
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,600
You are really a mangy dog.

319
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,030
If you bother me again,

320
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,940
I'll call Master.

321
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,780
Master.

322
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,150
Rong.

323
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,970
If I die,

324
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,410
you won't get my water.

325
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,300
Little Venomous Creature.

326
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,650
You really don't know

327
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,170
how scarce drinking water is
on the island.

328
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,110
The pot of water in your hand

329
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,250
can last long.

330
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,700
Right.

331
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,600
You grew up in the Western Regions.

332
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,950
Naturally you don't know

333
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,890
how to obtain fresh water on an island.

334
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,040
We can obtain fresh water?

335
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,520
That's for sure.

336
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,390
On our Peach Blossom Island,

337
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,280
everyone knows how to do it.

338
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,870
So

339
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,070
keep it for yourself to drink.

340
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,910
I don't care.

341
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,700
Rong.

342
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,320
Don't say angry words.

343
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,740
I will give

344
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,730
this water to you.

345
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,130
Given your sincerity,

346
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,760
how about we each play to our strengths

347
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,830
and make a deal?

348
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,670
Sure.

349
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,450
I'll be in charge of
making fresh water from now on,

350
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,350
and at this time every day,

351
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,560
I'll bring fresh water to you.

352
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,110
And you need to prepare

353
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,040
enough food for us as an exchange.

354
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,690
To get fresh water,

355
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,800
he hasn't made a move yet.

356
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,700
But he definitely won't

357
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,650
give up easily.

358
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,210
Rong, stop working on that.

359
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,520
Quickly show me
the technique I taught you.

360
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,320
Okay, Master.

361
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,890
Master, how are my moves?

362
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,020
Not bad.

363
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,460
Add a bit more finesse
to the final strike,

364
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,300
that'll be better.

365
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,460
Master.

366
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,000
Let me practice it again for you.

367
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,910
Rong.

368
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,730
I see Qigong

369
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,490
is not teaching you appropriately.

370
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,490
Why don't you become
my disciple instead?

371
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,180
I'll teach you.

372
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,020
How does it sound?

373
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,320
With your skills,

374
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,280
teach them to your female disciples.

375
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,210
Little beast, you're asking for death!

376
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,320
Rong, don't be mad.

377
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,390
Qigong.

378
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,890
I brought you some food out of goodwill.

379
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,620
But I didn't expect you

380
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,210
need medicine now.

381
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,590
How about

382
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,750
let me take your pulse?

383
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,730
Are you qualified?

384
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,700
Let's not fight.

385
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,740
Rong.

386
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,220
Rong.

387
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,460
Rong.

388
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,830
Rong.

389
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,700
Rong.

390
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,020
Don't come over.

391
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,040
Guo Jing is already dead.

392
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,700
We don't know when

393
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,760
we can leave this place.

394
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,430
You know too

395
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,970
that I really like you.

396
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,210
Just promise to be with me.

397
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,860
All you do is

398
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,840
just blabbering.

399
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,730
Jing is fine.

400
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,930
I will never be with you.

401
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,280
You have to do it the hard way.

402
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,130
You know I can't swim?

403
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,130
I will wait for you right here.

404
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,970
You will come up finally.

405
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,250
(I never thought
it was connected to the sea.)

406
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,250
(It's unexpectedly a hidden paradise.)

407
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,930
(Luck is on my side.)

408
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,210
- Rong.
- Master.

409
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,410
Did that little beast bully you?

410
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,220
No.

411
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,170
Master, have some water first.

412
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,080
How dare he bully me?

413
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,450
It's actually him
who has suffered a lot.

414
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,800
But I showed weakness in front of him.

415
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,520
Next,

416
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,030
he is coming to take my life.

417
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,940
So we have to

418
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,800
strike first

419
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,080
before he starts.

420
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,320
This clam meat is so delicious.

421
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,590
Eating it makes me feel

422
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,520
my injuries are getting better.

423
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,450
The clam meat can heal injuries?

424
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,360
Master, you should eat more of it.

425
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,210
Clam meat cannot heal injuries.

426
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,930
But it can fill my stomach.

427
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,700
Once I'm full,

428
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,650
I feel my injuries have gotten better.

429
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,970
Our Rong

430
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,650
is not only beautiful

431
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,410
but also so skillful

432
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,180
to make

433
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,840
such delicious food.

434
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,130
Little Venomous Creature.

435
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,220
How dare you come again?

436
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,760
Haven't had enough beating, huh?

437
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,180
Rong, you should leave quickly.

438
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,270
I will take it from here.

439
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,110
Master.

440
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,560
I've long heard about

441
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,890
your Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

442
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,080
Seeing it today,

443
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,280
it is indeed worth the reputation.

444
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,280
How shameless.

445
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,220
If you didn't know my master

446
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,060
was seriously injured,

447
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,040
would you
act recklessly in front of him?

448
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,300
Yes.

449
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,510
If it weren't for knowing

450
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,650
he was seriously injured

451
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,210
and lost all the power,

452
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,080
I'm afraid I wouldn't
have had the chance.

453
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,260
Rong.

454
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,650
Kill him,

455
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,040
and you'll be the only one left
on this deserted island with me.

456
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,970
Isn't it wonderful?

457
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,450
I have come through.

458
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,840
Now both of us
are trapped on the island.

459
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,000
It's no use fighting anymore.

460
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,930
I can be with you if you want.

461
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,170
But you can't hurt my master.

462
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,560
Rong.

463
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,220
Okay.

464
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,890
Rong,
you should have said that long ago.

465
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,600
I am just a weak woman.

466
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,110
Taking care of Master alone

467
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,130
is hard for me.

468
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,260
Later,

469
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,080
I will need your help.

470
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,210
I've been waiting for you to say that.

471
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,410
But we need to clarify first

472
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,360
how we'll live together.

473
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,130
Okay, whatever you say.

474
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,870
I just want to find a husband

475
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,840
to rely on.

476
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,450
What do you mean by that?

477
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,320
Are you asking me
to take care of everything?

478
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,870
What's the point

479
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,710
of living with you then?

480
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,250
Rong, that's not what I meant.

481
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,310
What I mean is

482
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,030
living with you,

483
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,490
I'll listen to everything you say.

484
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,250
You'll be the boss.

485
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,500
Rong.

486
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,800
Listen to me, Rong.

487
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,990
I didn't mean that, Rong.

488
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,900
What I mean is

489
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,080
I will take good care of you

490
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,970
and also Qigong.

491
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,620
You and Qigong

492
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,080
will just need to enjoy.

493
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,450
Listen to me, okay, Rong?

494
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,780
Okay?

495
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,930
Do you dare to swear?

496
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,350
Sure.

497
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,080
I am Ouyang Ke.

498
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,620
From now on, I will only
have Rong in my heart,

499
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,690
no other women.

500
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,180
I will treat Qigong

501
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,600
like how I treat my uncle.

502
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,760
If I break the vow,

503
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,360
I will have a tragic death.

504
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,830
How about it?

505
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,740
Really?

506
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,780
Really.

507
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,320
Then close your eyes.

508
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,350
Close my eyes?

509
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,060
Okay.

510
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,800
The retribution has come.

511
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,890
Jing.

512
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,060
Rong.

513
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,460
♪I stride into the fierce battlefield♪

514
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,600
Is it really you?

515
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,650
Yes, it's really me.

516
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,840
I thought you were dead.

517
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,730
I haven't successfully proposed yet.

518
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,970
I can't die.

519
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,690
♪In all directions,
there is still confusion♪

520
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,650
Where did you go?

521
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,510
After the three of us left the island,

522
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,730
the boat sank.

523
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,890
Big Brother's whereabouts are unknown.

524
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,520
My master and I
were saved by Ouyang Feng,

525
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,420
Ouyang Feng and Ouyang Ke

526
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,490
plotted against me and my master
for the Nine Yin Manual.

527
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,930
Master was harmed by Ouyang Feng.

528
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,840
The boat exploded
while I was fighting with him.

529
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,280
We both fell into the water together.

530
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,500
Then

531
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,410
we encountered an underwater current.

532
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,870
It carried the two of us

533
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,210
to the sea area tens of miles away.

534
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,940
Fortunately on the sea,

535
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,210
there was half a broken mast.

536
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,260
We desperately grabbed

537
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,180
that half broken mast

538
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,250
and survived.

539
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,110
Are you saying

540
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,490
Ouyang Feng and you were together?

541
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,110
Uncle.

542
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,980
Ke.

543
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,560
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle.

544
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,650
You'd better just kill me.

545
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,650
You'd better just kill me.

546
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,260
Ke.

547
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,170
Ke, don't be afraid.

548
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,840
I'm thinking of another way.

549
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,320
Rong, let's go help them.

550
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,590
Jing.

551
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,450
The evil will have their retribution.

552
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,110
Let's go see Master first.

553
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,950
Let's go.

554
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,840
Oh, Master.

555
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,840
How is Master doing?

556
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,830
If something happens to Ke,

557
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,070
you won't live either.

558
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,910
Old Venomous Creature,

559
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,150
what's your nephew's life

560
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,350
got to do with us?

561
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,490
If you want to survive,
you must help me save Ke.

562
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,520
Jing, Haughty Dragon Repents.

563
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,080
Rong, the Pitbull technique.

564
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,630
- Stop!
- Stop!

565
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,510
You've lost your power.

566
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,930
Still pretending here?

567
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,420
Let go of my master quickly.

568
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,620
You help me save Ke,

569
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,750
and I will spare his life.

570
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,870
It was fate who threw the stone

571
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,840
towards your nephew.

572
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,030
You saw it too.

573
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,870
Who can save him?

574
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,690
If you continue to do evil,

575
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,110
even God won't let you off.

576
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,800
Then let him die with my nephew.

577
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,410
We'll help you save him.

578
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,170
But you have to promise me three things.

579
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,220
Go ahead.

580
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,260
First,

581
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,800
after we save your nephew,

582
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,270
you must not hurt

583
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,310
the three of us again.

584
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,150
Okay.

585
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,130
I won't kill you three on this island.

586
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,350
Second,

587
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,970
you must not propose the marraige again.

588
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,350
Fine, next one.

589
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,970
You also saw that big stone.

590
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,840
We will do our best to help you,

591
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,460
but if the heavens insist

592
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,520
on taking your nephew's life,

593
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,280
you must not make any more trouble.

594
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,000
I will decide on this matter.

595
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,790
If you delay saving Ke,

596
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,280
none of you three will survive.

597
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,060
Master.

598
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,220
Master.

599
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,870
Up.

600
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,600
Stop, stop.

601
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,630
Ke.

602
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,450
Uncle, Uncle.

603
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,390
Let's lift again.

604
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,190
No.

605
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,750
This stone is too big.

606
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,210
If Qigong wasn't poisoned,

607
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,660
the four of us will definitely

608
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,650
be able to move this stone.

609
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,250
If we continue like this,

610
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,490
it will only add pain to Ouyang Ke.

611
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,970
What else can we do?

612
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,980
I remembered.

613
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,820
My father used bamboo as a winch

614
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,150
to move stones and transport wood

615
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,990
on Peach Blossom Island.

616
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,210
Winch?

617
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,750
Jing.

618
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,030
We go cut some bamboo

619
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,070
before the tide comes in

620
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,910
to make a winch.

621
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,310
Okay.

622
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,270
Uncle.

623
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,580
Uncle.

624
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,710
Uncle.

625
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,610
It hurts, Uncle.

626
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,740
Just kill me with one strike.

627
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,580
Bear with it.

628
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,460
Bear with it.

629
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,430
Rong.

630
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,650
Thank you.

631
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,480
You don't need to thank me.

632
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,390
Don't you know I set up this mechanism?

633
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,230
Keep it down.

634
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,880
Don't let my uncle hear you.

635
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,530
He will kill you.

636
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,840
Actually, I knew it long ago.

637
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,760
But I'm willing

638
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,170
to die

639
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,530
in your hand.

640
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,610
Why isn't it ready yet?

641
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,950
The tide has already risen.

642
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,880
Why rush me?

643
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,020
It's done.

644
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:17,830
Uncle.

645
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,500
Uncle.

646
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,540
It's just

647
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,920
a little bit short.

648
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,480
You all leave.

649
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,170
Let me be alone with Ke for a while.

650
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,140
Should we...

651
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,690
We have tried our best.

652
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,140
Yes.

653
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,530
I'm just worried once Ouyang Ke dies,

654
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,110
Ouyang Feng will definitely come

655
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,050
to us for trouble.

656
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,210
Master is seriously injured now.

657
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,570
The two of us are no match for him.

658
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,780
Ouyang Ke

659
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,690
had it coming.

660
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,660
If he didn't harm me and Qigong,

661
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,960
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

662
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,550
If Ouyang Feng wants to come,
let him come.

663
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,470
I'm not afraid of him.

664
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,780
Master is still seriously injured.

665
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,620
Rong.

666
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,360
You are the smartest.

667
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,030
Why don't you think about

668
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,880
some other way?

669
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,010
If the tide doesn't rise,

670
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,800
we can indeed try a few more times.

671
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,660
But now the tide

672
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,840
is rushing in.

673
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,660
Even if Ouyang Ke's
martial arts are skillful,

674
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,770
he can't hold his breath underwater
until the tide recedes, right?

675
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,230
That's right.

676
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,270
Hold breath?

677
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,710
Jing.

678
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:51,320
I have a way now.

679
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,430
- Uncle.
- Ke. Ke.

680
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,840
Uncle, I'm scared.

681
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,400
Ke, don't be afraid.

682
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm here with you.

683
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,360
I'm afraid

684
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,590
I can't

685
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,250
escape this.

686
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,010
No, Ke.

687
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,440
Uncle is here.

688
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,400
I have something

689
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,480
to ask you.

690
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,400
Tell me, Ke.

691
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,650
When I was young,

692
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,320
I heard that on the Mount White Camel,

693
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,690
there was a woman

694
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,880
who often looked southward,

695
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,130
waiting for her lover.

696
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,570
But after waiting for many years,

697
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,400
her beloved never returned.

698
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,010
Later,

699
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,920
she married

700
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,610
her lover's brother,

701
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,090
and became his sister-in-law.

702
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,610
On the night of her wedding,

703
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,480
her lover suddenly came back.

704
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,090
But everything was already set in stone.

705
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,690
Although they missed each other,

706
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,440
they still violated moral ethics,

707
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,400
and gave birth to a child.

708
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,050
To cover this up,

709
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,530
she wanted her son

710
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,610
to call her lover

711
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,400
Uncle instead.

712
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,540
Uncle.

713
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,050
Uncle, is this true?

714
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,660
Uncle.

715
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,130
During my whole life,

716
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,760
I've been waiting for an answer.

717
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,660
Should I

718
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,840
call you Uncle

719
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,530
or

720
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,020
Father?

721
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,750
There is a way!

722
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,180
You let him

723
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,360
put this in his mouth.

724
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,800
He won't die underwater then.

725
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,180
Before the tide recedes,

726
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,400
breathe with this first.

727
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,530
Listen to me.

728
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,460
Okay.

729
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,280
Uncle.

730
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,980
Okay.

731
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,840
This is not a long-term solution.

732
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,610
What to do next?

733
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,960
At high tide,

734
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,250
there will be helpers.
