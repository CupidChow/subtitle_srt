00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,340
(Xiangyang City)

4
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,690
Now the whole city

5
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,590
is celebrating the success

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,520
of the coalition between Song
and Mongolia.

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,260
I hope this alliance

8
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,950
can bring peace and stability

9
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,230
to the people.

10
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,110
My disciple Cheng Yaojia said,

11
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,850
Huang Yaoshi once appeared

12
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,690
in Niujia Village.

13
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,310
But somehow,

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,310
he insisted on arranging a marriage
for my disciple

15
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,110
in a shabby tavern.

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,770
If we know why he did that,

17
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,060
he wouldn't be the Eastern Heretic.

18
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,510
Huang Yaoshi

19
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,260
is rebellious and cruel in nature.

20
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,540
He believes his daughter's death

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,260
has something to do with Guo Jing.

22
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,410
Now

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,630
even Jing's masters

24
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,860
are all implicated.

25
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,540
How could he do this?

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,860
Everyone knows

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,440
Jing is a loyal and honest,

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,510
and quite righteous.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,950
Perhaps there is some misunderstanding

30
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,740
which made Huang Yaoshi
believe the rumors.

31
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,630
What a small world.

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,160
Could this be the legendary

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,230
Seven Immortals of Quanzhen?

34
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,880
It's Mr. Qiu from the Iron Palm Gang.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,070
No need to kneel down.

36
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,190
Mr. Qiu, what do you have to say?

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,070
If I'm not mistaken,

38
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,670
you must be here

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,570
to take revenge

40
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,670
for the Old Imp, right?

41
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,070
You mean

42
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,440
my martial uncle, Zhou Botong?

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,280
Of course.

44
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,850
My martial uncle has lost contact

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,480
with our Quanzhen School for a long time.

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,510
Is it that

47
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,670
you know the whereabouts of his?

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,070
It seems that you still don't know.

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,040
Your martial uncle

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,510
was trapped on Peach Blossom Island

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,470
for fifteen years,

52
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,740
having endured all kinds of hardships.

53
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,470
Right after he escaped, he...

54
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,440
Got killed by Huang Yaoshi.

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,300
- What?
- What?

56
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,260
How did you know?

57
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,790
Naturally, I saw it with my own eyes.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,920
If I had taken action,

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,720
he could have avoided death.

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,350
But fate had other plans.

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,070
I was one step late.

62
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,580
Is this true?

63
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,540
I always speak and act cautiously.

64
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,300
How dare I joke about this?

65
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,250
It is said that because of

66
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,830
the death of Huang Yaoshi's daughter,

67
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,880
your martial uncle

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,540
helped him search for Guo Jing at sea.

69
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,910
Unfortunately he died in the sea.

70
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,270
I didn't want to
get involved in this matter.

71
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,500
But I respect Mr. Wang.

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,300
You can figure out what to do.

73
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,860
Huang Yaoshi is going too far.

74
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,520
He is challenging our Quanzhen School.

75
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,940
First, he bullied my disciple,

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,590
then he killed my martial uncle.

77
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,730
If we find him,

78
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,740
we won't let him off easily.

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,830
Everything has been sorted out.

80
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,010
Let's go.

81
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,650
Okay.

82
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,440
Master.

83
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,590
Don't call me Master.

84
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,110
One day as a teacher,

85
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,640
a lifetime as a father.

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,940
You're too bold

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,830
to come back here.

88
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,600
Master.

89
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,710
Now both my parents are dead.

90
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,370
I no longer want

91
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,790
the identity of the prince of Jin Empire.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,370
Can't I even go home?

93
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,470
Your surname is Wanyan.

94
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,470
You are not worthy to have a home
on the land of Great Song.

95
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,360
Today,

96
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,420
I will avenge my deceased friend
Yang Tiexin,

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,520
and kill you treacherous son.

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,030
Mr. Qiu, please calm down.

99
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,690
He already realized his mistake.

100
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,170
Give him another chance, please.

101
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,050
Miss Mu, don't plead for him.

102
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,080
He has given up

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,030
his identity as a Jin person

104
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,710
and changed back to his father's surname.

105
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,150
Now he's called Yang Kang.

106
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,450
Is that so?

107
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,540
If I still crave for fame and wealth,

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,520
I would hide in the palace

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,710
and enjoy.

110
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,880
Why bother to travel thousands of miles

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,270
to the south and suffer like this?

112
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,410
Yang Kang.

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
I heard that you and Jing

114
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,790
have become sworn brothers.

115
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,150
Where is he now?

116
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,980
Seems like

117
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,060
you've met Guo Jing.

118
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,740
How's Jing doing now?

119
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,970
Tell us.

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,910
Guo Jing...

121
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,710
He...

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,030
is dead.

123
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,760
What happened?

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,670
Who did it?

125
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,300
It was Huang Yaoshi.

126
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,130
My brother and Huang Rong

127
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,110
loved each other.

128
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,910
He rushed to Peach Blossom Island
to find Huang Rong,

129
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
but Huang Yaoshi disagreed

130
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
to let them get married.

131
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,880
Jing

132
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,500
had to elope with Miss Huang.

133
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,350
A few days ago,

134
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,670
Huang Yaoshi chased them to Lin'an,

135
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,030
and killed him.

136
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,380
Wanyan Kang

137
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,570
must have learned this

138
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,640
from Qiu Qianren,

139
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,340
spreading false news
of people's death everywhere.

140
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,110
It was him who hurt you.

141
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,910
How dare he slander my father?

142
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,740
Is what you said

143
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,300
all true?

144
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,830
Every word I said is true.

145
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,110
I saw it with my own eyes.

146
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,590
There is no deception.

147
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,710
It's such a pity.

148
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,320
Fate always messes up with geniuses.

149
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,470
Jing.

150
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,140
What a good kid.

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,860
Huang Yaoshi must have gone mad!

152
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,110
First, he killed my martial uncle,

153
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,860
and now he killed Jing.

154
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,600
Now

155
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,070
he owes us two lives.

156
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,070
Senior,

157
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,730
my disciple Cheng Yaojia said,

158
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,900
Huang Yaoshi is right here.

159
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,560
Let's wait for him here.

160
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,590
If he comes back,

161
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,880
let's ask him for an explanation.

162
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,900
Although Huang Yaoshi is a senior,

163
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,780
and a friend of our master's,

164
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,860
he has committed such evil deeds.

165
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,620
I think if Master were alive,

166
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,260
he would not tolerate it.

167
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,140
Let's set up

168
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,660
the Big Dipper formation

169
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,260
and wait to kill him.

170
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,560
Yes.

171
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,260
The Big Dipper formation.

172
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,730
Central Divine Wang Chongyang

173
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,120
created this formation for their school.

174
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,660
The Seven Immortals of Quanzhen

175
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,740
are determined to kill my father.

176
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,210
Your father

177
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,710
may not come back.

178
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,140
I hope my father has gone far away.

179
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,230
Otherwise, with his temper,

180
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,980
he would definitely
have a big fight with them.

181
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,900
The sound can only be made
by strong internal forces.

182
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,980
Could it be that
your father has returned?

183
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,930
Not my father.

184
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,500
This visitor is not easy to deal with.

185
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,740
Let's go out and have a look.

186
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,740
Quite a lot of helpers.

187
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,260
Wanyan Kang,

188
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,980
come out.

189
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,860
It's a small world after all.

190
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,930
Mei Chaofeng.

191
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,500
The Seven Immortals of Quanzhen.

192
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,880
Be careful.

193
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
We're leaving like this?

194
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,280
Won't we go back to help your master?

195
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,560
Although Mei Chaofeng is powerful,

196
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,780
she can't kill my master.

197
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,130
While they're dealing with Mei Chaofeng,

198
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,070
we should leave quickly.

199
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,610
Is is true

200
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,680
that Guo Jing died?

201
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,010
I will explain this to you later.

202
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,850
Go first.

203
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,950
Are you the only one who came
from Peach Blossom Island?

204
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,740
Where is your master?

205
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,190
Why are you looking for my master?

206
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,980
He owes several lives to our school.

207
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,900
We'll settle the account with him.

208
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,660
After Wang Chongyang died,

209
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,640
you Quanzhen School

210
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,500
learned to bully the few?

211
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,310
Don't try to provoke us.

212
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,430
Tell us where your master is!

213
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,140
We want to reason with him.

214
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,710
We won't bother with
a blind person like you.

215
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,430
Are you worthy of talking with Master?

216
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,830
Just a bunch of Taoists
from Zhongnan Mountain.

217
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,070
No need for my master to come personally.

218
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,350
Even if the seven of you attack together,

219
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,950
I, Mei Chaofeng, am not afraid.

220
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,660
What a powerful whip!

221
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,250
Mei Chaofeng
has strong martial arts skills.

222
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,260
Brothers, be careful.

223
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,480
Set the formation.

224
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,090
Mei Chaofeng.

225
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,590
She is ruthless and cunning.

226
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,710
I'm really afraid she will hurt them.

227
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,260
She's evil

228
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,970
but alone.

229
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,860
She's not very powerful.

230
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,380
And she is blind.

231
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,950
The Seven Immortals of Quanzhen
won't get hurt.

232
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,290
Jing.

233
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,740
Don't worry.

234
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,780
One Great ultimate. Dubhe.

235
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,330
Two forms. Merak.

236
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,350
Three talents. Phecda.

237
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,900
Four symbols. Megres.

238
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,370
Five elements. Alioth.

239
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,430
Six harmonies. Mizar.

240
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,010
Seven stars. Benetnach.

241
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,850
Come on.

242
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,830
This formation

243
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,860
borrows the shape of
the Big Dipper constellation,

244
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,650
and combines the strength
of the seven people into one.

245
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,110
The first four form the upper part of
the Dipper, doing the main attack.

246
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,620
The last three are the handle of
the Dipper, responsible for defense.

247
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,100
Their positions can be changed freely,

248
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,550
alternates between offense and defense.

249
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,010
Therefore,
the possibilities are endless.

250
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,880
Senior Mei

251
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,950
cannot break this formation.

252
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
I remember it was mentioned

253
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,900
in the Nine Yin Manual.

254
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,710
I couldn't understand it before,

255
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,500
but now seeing this formation

256
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,230
and hearing your explanation,

257
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,620
I seem to have realized something.

258
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,140
Martial arts and Taoism
originate from the same source.

259
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,070
The fundamental principles
are essentially the same.

260
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,190
If you can comprehend it,

261
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,030
your martial arts
will surely improve significantly.

262
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,170
Rong.

263
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,240
I am slow-witted.

264
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,780
I really can't understand
the Nine Yin Manual.

265
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,660
Jing, don't underestimate yourself.

266
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,860
You have practiced so well now.

267
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,230
In my eyes,

268
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,620
you are already very powerful.

269
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,360
Adjust your breath.

270
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,710
Master.

271
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,980
My father is here too.

272
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,310
There will be big trouble.

273
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,070
Let's go out and explain.

274
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,900
Both sides are emotional now.

275
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,590
It's hard to explain clearly.

276
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,350
If you and I go out recklessly,

277
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,560
it will not only hurt ourselves

278
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,550
and lose our lives,

279
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,280
but also be of no avail.

280
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,120
What should we do?

281
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,210
Are we just going to watch them
kill each other like this?

282
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,710
The best option for now is to wait.

283
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,660
Wait for you to recover.

284
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,400
Seven little rascals

285
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,310
joined forces to bully my disciple alone.

286
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,600
Shameless.

287
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,690
Old Heretic Huang.

288
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,500
Your evil disciple

289
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,950
slaughtered the martial world.

290
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,470
She's sinful!

291
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,950
We are carrying out justice.

292
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,800
We're not bullying her.

293
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,140
Who gave you the authority to claim
you represent justice?

294
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,350
People have their own conclusions

295
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,780
about who's evil and who's righteous.

296
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,090
Your disciple is causing havoc
in the martial world.

297
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,350
Old Heretic Huang,
you killed innocent lives.

298
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,090
First, Martial Uncle Zhou,

299
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,210
and then Guo Jing.

300
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,070
Today, it's time for us

301
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,660
to settle the score.

302
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,590
I killed Zhou Botong?

303
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,620
How do you want to settle it?

304
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,310
Bring it on.

305
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,480
Yaoshi.

306
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,930
Ouyang.

307
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,610
I didn't expect you to be

308
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,710
faster than me.

309
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,970
Eastern Heretic, Western Venom.

310
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,610
They are indeed in cahoots.

311
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,970
Both sinister and evil.

312
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,020
That's rude.

313
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,480
Yaoshi.

314
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,590
Let them learn a lesson.

315
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,520
A bunch of useless disciples

316
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,620
Wang Chongyang took.

317
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,190
You're going too far.

318
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,780
Mr. Wang has passed away.

319
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,160
Today

320
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,660
let me witness

321
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,160
the Big Dipper Formation

322
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,550
left by Wang Chongyang.

323
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,490
I've already seen

324
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,470
the Formation Mr. Wang left.

325
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,260
It's not that powerful.

326
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,240
Yaoshi.

327
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,590
I'll help you break the formation.

328
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,020
Tan!

329
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,140
I don't need your help,
Old Venomous Creature.

330
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,880
That's right.

331
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,380
Then I will help them.

332
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,050
Chaofeng.

333
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,400
Chaofeng.

334
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,770
Yaoshi.

335
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,550
I helped you break the formation
set up by Wang Chongyang,

336
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,730
and get rid of

337
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,420
the treacherous disciple.

338
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,760
You deal with

339
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,750
the remaining six people.

340
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,920
You're welcome.

341
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,660
Old Venomous Creature
is really insidious.

342
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,030
He took advantage of others' weakness

343
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,420
and attacked Mr. Huang.

344
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,070
Why do you think
he's called Western Venom?

345
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,170
He not only uses poison,

346
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,250
he himself is even more poisonous.

347
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,310
He killed Tan Chuduan

348
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,760
and shifted all the blame

349
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,650
onto my father

350
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,660
with just a few words,

351
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,700
so the Quanzhen School

352
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,350
will seek revenge from my father.

353
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,490
Tan.

354
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,830
Tan. Tan...

355
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,920
Tan.

356
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,800
Qiu, don't be impulsive.

357
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,940
What enmity does our school have
against you?

358
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,930
You killed Martial Uncle Zhou

359
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,170
and then Tan

360
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,520
together with Ouyang Feng.

361
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,860
Why are you doing this?

362
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,600
Old Heretic Huang.

363
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,110
I'm going to kill you!

364
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,400
Qiu.

365
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,550
Calm down.

366
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,930
Senior,

367
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,220
are we just going to let it go?

368
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,290
Yes.

369
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,650
Are we just going to let it go?

370
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,520
Yeah, Senior. We can't let it go.

371
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Shut up.

372
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,620
The Formation has been breaked.

373
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,140
We are no match
for Huang Yaoshi anymore.

374
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,590
It's okay if the six of us die.

375
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,760
But what about our brothers and sisters

376
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,620
in Quanzhen School?

377
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,810
At that time,

378
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,120
how can we face

379
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,750
our master?

380
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,960
Tan.

381
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,140
Go, go, go.

382
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,400
Let's go.

383
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,200
Sirs,

384
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,620
what's the matter?

385
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,070
Now that you have found out,

386
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,990
there is no need to hide it.

387
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,120
Can I take a look at

388
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,140
the treasure in your hand?

389
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm afraid this thing

390
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,120
is not yours.

391
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,180
What does it

392
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,120
have to do with you?

393
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,180
Then don't blame us

394
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,700
for being rude.

395
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,940
- Someone!
- Nianci, be careful.

396
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,640
Want to rob it?

397
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,070
You can give it a try.

398
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,200
Wait a moment.

399
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,320
Are you

400
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,460
Miss Mu Nianci?

401
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,490
You are...

402
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,070
It's really Miss Mu.

403
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,890
A few years ago,
I was destitute in Jiaxing.

404
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,760
Luckily Miss Mu

405
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,830
gave me a bowl of hot soup

406
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,180
and half of a bun.

407
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,550
Everyone, put down your weapons.

408
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,510
Miss Mu once learned from Qigong.

409
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,270
She is one of our own.

410
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,970
- Miss Mu.
- Miss Mu. Miss Mu.

411
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,940
Hello.

412
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,700
I am Yang Kang.

413
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,650
Sorry for offending you just now.

414
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,490
Miss Mu.

415
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,970
Does the object in Mr. Yang's hand

416
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,940
belong to Chief Hong?

417
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,280
That's right.

418
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,120
Mister,

419
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,700
this is the personal belonging of Qigong.

420
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,110
It is the token of our chief
in the Beggars' Gang.

421
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,750
But now it is in your hands.

422
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,350
Could it be that Qigong

423
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,030
asked Miss Mu to keep it?

424
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,600
Right.

425
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,220
To tell you the truth,

426
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,550
Chief Hong has been missing
for several months.

427
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,890
It's almost time

428
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,500
for the beggars' meeting
on the fifteenth of July.

429
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,030
All of us

430
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,990
are looking for Chief Hong.

431
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,460
The two of us

432
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,560
are carrying Chief Hong's staff

433
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,400
to Yuezhou.

434
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,900
It's just

435
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,840
there are some things we have to say

436
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,990
until we see people
in charge of the Gang.

437
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,790
Since you are Qigong's friends,

438
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,860
you are our honored guests.

439
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,660
Let us escort you

440
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,070
on the way.

441
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,140
That's great.

442
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,520
I deliberately had people

443
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,460
make chicken soup for you.

444
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,770
What's wrong?

445
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,320
During the day,

446
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,560
why did you lie to them?

447
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,790
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

448
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,420
I didn't lie to them.

449
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,590
Aren't we going to Yuezhou?

450
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,410
This is a big deal.

451
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,000
The more people know,
the more trouble it'll bring.

452
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,850
I want

453
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,110
to return the staff

454
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,350
until we see a senior in the Gang

455
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,400
and tell him the truth.

456
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,030
But you can't deceive people.

457
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,040
Aren't you also hoping

458
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,730
I can become Qigong's disciple

459
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,860
by returing the staff to him?

460
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,350
Fine.

461
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,690
You can't hide things

462
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,790
from me anymore.

463
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,880
Don't worry.

464
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,350
I know you want what's best for me.

465
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,730
Have some soup.

466
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
Master.

467
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,460
Don't waste your inner force on me.

468
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,220
You are not allowed to die.

469
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,700
I order you not to die.

470
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,220
Do you still want to disobey me?

471
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,700
I dare not.

472
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,490
Master.

473
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,140
I have been lonely since I was a child.

474
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,380
Only you treated me well.

475
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,220
But I made many mistakes

476
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,140
and betrayed you,

477
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,790
hurting your feelings.

478
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,790
I never thought

479
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,990
there would still be hope

480
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,110
that I could lie in your arms again.

481
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,310
Don't talk nonsense.

482
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,750
Let me heal your wounds for you.

483
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,270
Then we'll go back
to Peach Blossom Island.

484
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,120
Master.

485
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,590
I really want to

486
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,310
go back to Peach Blossom Island.

487
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,750
I want you to be what you used to be.

488
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,380
I want to stay forever

489
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,220
by your side

490
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,900
on Peach Blossom Island.

491
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,620
I promise you.

492
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,860
But

493
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,990
in the future,

494
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,650
you must be obedient

495
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,860
and listen to me.

496
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,250
Otherwise...

497
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,640
Otherwise,

498
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,810
I...

499
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,510
Master.

500
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,460
I, Ruohua,

501
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,700
will always listen to you.

502
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,790
Everything changes

503
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,830
with the wind of the four seasons.

504
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,070
Being detached and content.

505
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,220
I could call you

506
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,270
Mei Chaofeng.

507
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,590
Please accept a bow from me, Master.

508
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,880
Master.

509
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,550
I'm leaving.

510
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,330
Dad.

511
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,640
Rong.

512
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,620
It's my fault.

513
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,310
You can't leave here because of me.

514
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,700
As long as we persevere through this,

515
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,030
everything will get better.

516
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,660
Is anyone there?

517
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,030
No one would be here.

518
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,510
My masters.

519
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,520
How did they come?

520
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,360
Zhen'e.

521
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,660
There's smell of blood.

522
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,920
Something's not right.

523
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,490
Calling for people in the room

524
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,750
and worshipping the gods in the temple.

525
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,270
Whoever inside,

526
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,140
please reveal yourself.

527
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,420
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

528
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,350
Mr. Huang.

529
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,860
Why are you looking for us?

530
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,270
Even if we can't beat you,

531
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,660
we're not afraid of you.

532
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,330
However,

533
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,420
you have to tell us

534
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,030
what grudges you hold against us.

535
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,900
But you

536
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,860
killed my disciple Chen Xuanfeng

537
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,460
and blinded

538
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,380
Mei Chaofeng.

539
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,070
It looks like today

540
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,040
we cannot resolve it peacefully.

541
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,880
Come on.

542
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,140
Dad, stop!

543
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,160
Jing.

544
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,350
How did Jing get so seriously injured?

545
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,380
It's all because of Wanyan Kang.

546
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,620
I knew it.

547
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,510
He was not truly repentant.

548
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,510
They say that Yang Tiexin

549
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,180
were a moral man.

550
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,830
How come his son

551
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,420
is so wicked.

552
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,530
Jing.

553
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,920
Rong.

554
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,380
Thank you, Mr. Huang, for saving my life.

555
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,550
I'm extremely grateful.

556
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,350
Get up.

557
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,120
Mr. Huang.

558
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,400
I want to

559
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,650
explain the matter
of the Nine Yin Manual.

560
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,490
No need.

561
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,070
Zhou Botong

562
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,070
already explained it all.

563
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,030
Thank you for forgiving Jing, Dad.

564
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,440
Dad,

565
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,180
for my sake,

566
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,040
make peace with the six seniors.

567
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,220
How else can I make peace with them?

568
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,270
I didn't take their lives.

569
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,050
Dad.

570
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,550
What about Ouyang Feng?

571
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,650
Do we have to find him

572
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,590
to avenge Senior Mei?

573
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,220
My history and entanglement

574
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,880
with Old Venomous Creature,

575
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,850
you don't understand it.

576
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,460
Just now

577
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,180
I don't know

578
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,180
if he was trying to save me

579
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,620
or not.

580
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,220
I'll see when we meet again.

581
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,310
These are his bones.

582
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,690
He died

583
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,530
in this secret room.

584
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,700
Respectfully Master Huang
of Peach Blossom Island,

585
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,530
I, Qu Lingfeng,

586
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,210
obtained some calligraphy,
painting, and utensils

587
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,940
from the palace,

588
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,030
intending to present them
for your appreciation.

589
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,840
I could only address you as Master Huang,

590
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,380
not my own master.

591
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,900
But in my dreams,

592
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,660
I often long to
return to Peach Blossom Island,

593
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,100
and serve by your side,

594
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,500
that would be a life

595
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,620
without regrets.

596
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,660
Unfortunately,

597
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,460
I was surrounded by the palace guards.

598
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,500
I've left behind a daughter.

599
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,630
Dad.

600
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,780
Lingfeng definitely wouldn't want

601
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,940
to see you sad.

602
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,540
Left behind a daughter.

603
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
I don't know

604
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,580
where she is now.

605
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,300
Shagu.

606
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,140
Shagu.

607
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,500
Shagu is here.

608
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,140
You want me to do the laundry?

609
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,660
Do you know what your last name is?

610
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,340
Of course, my last name is Sha.

611
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,780
Is your name Qu Shagu?

612
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,100
You peeked.

613
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,900
How did you know my name is Qu Shagu?

614
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
I am Qu Shagu.

615
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,260
Is your father Qu Lingfeng?

616
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,140
How do you know everything?

617
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,420
Did you peek?

618
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,860
Child,

619
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,900
where is your mother?

620
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,060
Mother?

621
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,100
What is a mother?

622
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,820
I have no mother.

623
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,860
Let me take you to Peach Blossom Island.

624
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,580
Peach Blossom Island?

625
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,340
There must be a lot of peaches there.

626
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,740
There are no peaches in this season.

627
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,180
But there are many peach trees.

628
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,900
Where there are peach trees,
there are peaches.

629
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,980
Peach trees bear peaches.

630
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,100
How could there be no peaches?

631
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,660
Girl, are you silly?

632
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,220
Child.

633
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,620
I'll take you back to the island.

634
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,340
You are the flesh and blood of Lingfeng.

635
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,980
In the future,

636
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,140
I will teach you martial arts.

637
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,060
For the rest of the life,

638
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,100
I'm afraid

639
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,700
my daughter just wants
to travel around the world

640
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,340
with Jing.

641
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,740
In the future,

642
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,820
we will eat

643
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,740
peaches together,

644
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,100
okay?

645
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,620
Peaches.

646
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,500
Dad.

647
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,980
You allowed me to be with Jing?

648
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,060
Dad is the best.

649
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,740
I knew that Dad loves me the most.

650
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
Dad.

651
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,180
Jing.

652
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,180
Dad.

653
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,900
How should we deal with

654
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,580
the treasures in this secret room?

655
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,740
If we bring everything back
to Peach Blossom Island,

656
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,980
wouldn't it be a bit too much trouble?

657
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,780
Just let them

658
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,940
stay here.

659
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,940
This is the painting

660
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,780
Jing liked at Guiyun Manor.

661
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,140
In martial attire stained
with dust many years old,

662
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,740
I tarry here,
taking in the beauty of Cuiwei Hills.

663
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,740
On the sight of our land
I feast my eyes greedily,

664
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,340
while the trotting horse
urges me to go back by moonlight.

665
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,220
Dad.

666
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,540
If you don't want this painting,

667
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,380
give it to me.

668
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,260
I think

669
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,500
you want to give this painting to him

670
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,020
as a gift.

671
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,060
You admire Yue Fei?

672
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,340
Yes.

673
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,860
It's not difficult to live
in the martial world.

674
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,220
If you want to stem the surging tide

675
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,980
like Yue Fei did,

676
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,620
it's difficult.

677
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:41,140
(Tomb of beloved disciple Qu Lingfeng)

678
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,620
Rong.

679
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,860
Where are your dad

680
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,700
and Shagu?

681
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,700
I think Dad took Shagu
back to Peach Blossom Island.

682
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,340
(Old Beggar went missing,
Old Imp is looking for him)

683
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,460
Old Imp!

684
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Big Brother

685
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,940
lost Qigong?

686
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,180
What should we do?

687
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,620
Old Imp said he went to find Qigong.

688
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,780
Do you think Qigong has left

689
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,220
for the beggars' meeting in Yuezhou?

690
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,820
It's almost the fifteenth of the July.

691
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,820
Qigong must have gone to Yuezhou.

692
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,700
But my Dog Beating staff is still
in the hands of Yang Kang.

693
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,780
What should we do?

694
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,340
Rong.

695
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,380
We must find Yang Kang

696
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
before the meeting in Yuezhou,

697
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,620
get back the Dog Beating Staff

698
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,460
and give it to Master.

699
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,060
Okay.

700
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,340
Let's go to Yuezhou now.

701
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,220
But Rong,

702
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,820
have you made up your mind

703
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,820
to become the chief of the Beggars' Gang?

704
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,300
My father and I
have already discussed it.

705
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,060
When we get back the Dog Beating Staff,

706
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,140
we will choose

707
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,900
a more suitable candidate

708
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,550
in front of the heroes
in Beggars' Gang with Qigong

709
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,820
and pass the Dog Beating Staff to him.

710
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,260
Wouldn't it be perfect?

711
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,220
That's great.

712
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,740
Your Royal Highness, it is
His Highness's confidential letter.

713
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,660
(Father, I obtained the token
of the Beggars' Gang accidentally)

714
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
Laughing already.

715
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,820
What is it for?

716
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,780
This is a great thing.

717
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,580
My son Kang

718
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,780
accidentally got

719
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,540
Hong Qigong's token
of the Beggars' Gang.

720
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,580
And he has gained

721
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,370
the trust of many disciples
of the Beggars' Gang.

722
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,980
At this moment, he is on his way to

723
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,660
Yuezhou

724
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,140
to attend the beggars' meeting,

725
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,420
planning to subdue the Gang.

726
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,220
Like father, like son.

727
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,340
A hero from a young age.

728
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,900
The Beggars' Gang

729
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,700
is really despicable.

730
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,140
They have many disciples

731
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,660
all over the world,

732
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,820
occupying several grain
and commercial routes

733
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,620
of my Jin Empire

734
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,100
harassing and killing

735
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,300
the officials of my Jin Empire.

736
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,780
It has always been
a great concern of mine.

737
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,660
You're right, Your Royal Highness.

738
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,580
My Iron Palm Gang

739
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,900
has also been greatly troubled by it.

740
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,620
Like a fishbone stuck in the throat

741
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,180
and a thorn in the back.

742
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,500
Like sitting on pins and needles.

743
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,620
If His Highness can truly

744
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,300
take over the Beggars' Gang,

745
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,540
I think

746
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,940
my Iron Palm Gang

747
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,660
will definitely serve
the Jin Empire better.

748
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,340
Wait until the Mongolian delegation
is intercepted,

749
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,380
I hope Master Qiu

750
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,700
can go to Yuezhou

751
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,380
to help Kang with this.

752
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,700
Of course.

753
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,460
- Slow down, Master.
- Jing.

754
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,580
Since the misunderstanding
between you and Master Huang

755
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,420
has been resolved,

756
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,300
us old folks

757
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,900
won't stay long.

758
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,620
Master.

759
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,740
I haven't seen you for a while.

760
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,540
Please let me

761
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,500
spend more time with you.

762
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,380
Okay, Jing.

763
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,500
You and Rong
have important matters to attend to.

764
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,020
During these days,

765
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,900
we've been running around.

766
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,460
We want to go home and rest now.

767
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,100
When it's time for your wedding banquet,

768
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,000
we will naturally go to
Peach Blossom Island to find you.

769
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,300
You must all come.

770
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,980
- Sure.
- Sure.

771
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,700
Jing.

772
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,060
Now

773
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,020
you've become Chief Hong's disciple

774
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,820
and are marrying the daughter
of Master Huang.

775
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,420
We are truly

776
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,820
happy for you.

777
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,220
I am happy for you, Jing.

778
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,980
I'm just lucky

779
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,540
to have met all the masters.

780
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,820
And also, Jing,

781
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,980
Qigong is always respected

782
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,580
in the martial world.

783
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,820
The task Qigong entrusted to you,

784
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,860
you must get it done properly.

785
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,460
Do not break

786
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,500
the trust he has in you.

787
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,820
Understood.

788
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,660
