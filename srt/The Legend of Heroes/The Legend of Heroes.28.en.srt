=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,440
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

4
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,580
No.

5
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,160
You guys go over there.

6
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,920
You guys go over there to find her.

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,340
Hurry up.

8
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,740
Brother Lu.

9
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,600
We've been looking for Rong
for over a month,

10
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,320
traveling a long way north.

11
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Is she really in this direction?

12
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,580
Guo.

13
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,780
A few days ago I received

14
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,240
a pigeon post from the gang.

15
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,820
It said that he'd seen

16
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,440
a woman who looked
just like Chief Huang here.

17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,740
But why did this place

18
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,820
get like this?

19
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,660
Brother Lu.

20
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,190
This is the border where the Jin army
and the Mongol army are fighting.

21
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,220
It seems like

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,440
these innocent villagers are implicated.

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,760
Guo, there is a situation.

24
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,410
- Let's go take a look.
- Go.

25
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,860
The Jin army is ambushing here

26
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,040
for the Mongol grain deliverty army.

27
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,460
Guo.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,240
The Songs and Mongols are jointly
attacking the Jin.

29
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,800
Should we lend a hand?

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,440
Kill these Jin soldiers.

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,740
It's Guo Jing.

32
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,680
He is our Gold Knife Prince Consort.

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,640
Greetings, Gold Knife Prince Consort.

34
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,240
Guo Jing.

35
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,220
Tolui.

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,340
Master Jebe.

37
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,140
I wondered why the Jin army

38
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,480
is in such disarray today.

39
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,920
So you were helping me.

40
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,040
Master Jebe, how come

41
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,860
you are here?

42
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,820
Father has been conquering lands

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,750
and expanding territories.

44
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,420
Those generals have all
made great contributions.

45
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,360
I don't want to fall behind,

46
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,140
so I headed south with Master Jebe

47
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,200
and won several battles.

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,060
The Jin army suffered
one defeat after another.

49
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,920
Now you are the number one warrior
on the grassland.

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,420
In my heart,

51
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,920
you are the number one warrior.

52
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,300
Jing.

53
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,140
Are you coming with us

54
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,150
back to the grassland this time?

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,840
To be honest,

56
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,700
I still have some things

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,540
to deal with.

58
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,720
I can't go back for now.

59
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,420
What is it?

60
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,620
Is more important than seeing

61
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,460
your mother and Huazheng?

62
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,940
Father urgently summoned me back,

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,160
and you have been away for a long time.

64
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,500
This time,

65
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,800
why don't you come back with us?

66
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,980
I...

67
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,500
Guo.

68
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,080
We still don't know

69
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,320
where did Chief Huang go.

70
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,280
She may not necessarily be in the north.

71
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,120
You'd better go back first
to see your mother.

72
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,700
I'll take my brothers

73
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,250
to continue to search
for Chief's whereabouts.

74
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,500
If there's any news,

75
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,840
I'll let you know immediately.

76
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,300
Okay.

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,360
Thank you, Brother Lu.

78
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,460
(Mongolia, Golden Horde)

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,340
Fetched some firewood?

80
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,700
Mother.

81
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,140
It's me.

82
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm back.

83
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,500
Get up.

84
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,700
Mother.

85
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,440
How have you been during this time?

86
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,020
You've become stronger.

87
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,120
What happened next?

88
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,580
Then

89
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,980
I went north with Elder Lu

90
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,320
to find Rong together.

91
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,140
Thank you, Mother.

92
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,260
My favorite food

93
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,680
is this bun you made for me.

94
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,320
By the way, Mother,

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,560
if you meet Rong,

96
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,880
you will definitely like her.

97
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,540
It seems that

98
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,860
you really like

99
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,200
this girl named Huang Rong.

100
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,020
While you were

101
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,560
telling me those stories happened to you,

102
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,920
you mentioned

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,560
her name the most.

104
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,600
When I am with Rong,

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,900
I feel the most relaxed and comfortable.

106
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,180
Just like

107
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,520
when I'm with you.

108
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,580
Although I haven't met

109
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,000
this girl named Rong,

110
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,180
she must be

111
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,080
a nice girl.

112
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,540
But

113
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,120
Princess Huazheng...

114
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,900
Yes.

115
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm also in a dilemma.

116
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,680
You have been engaged to Huazheng.

117
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,160
And Great Khan treats us kindly.

118
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,040
Between true affection

119
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,640
and a promise,

120
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,360
it's really hard to choose.

121
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,200
This question has been troubling me
for a long time.

122
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,300
Mother.

123
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,100
If my father

124
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,160
encountered this situation,

125
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,400
what would he do?

126
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,800
Throughout his life,

127
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,720
he'd rather suffer himself

128
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,840
than do things that are sorry for others.

129
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,160
My father was a man of great integrity.

130
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,180
I should learn

131
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,120
from him.

132
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,440
But I really like Rong.

133
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,180
Now she has been taken away
by bad people,

134
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,040
and she's in danger.

135
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,160
I really don't know what to do.

136
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,040
How do you plan to tell Greaet Khan?

137
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,380
Even if Great Khan

138
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,640
and Huazheng blame me,

139
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,840
I have to tell them the truth.

140
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,000
You already have an idea.

141
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,720
Just follow your heart.

142
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,520
No matter what choice you make,

143
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,920
I will support you.

144
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,100
Okay.

145
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,760
Wanyan Honglie

146
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,840
has high and thick walls for defense.

147
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,100
But our Mongol soldiers

148
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,920
can only fight on the grassland.

149
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,600
I'll let him know

150
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,340
since we're already at war,

151
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,440
we will fight to the death.

152
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,000
Nothing can stop

153
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,520
our Mongol heroes.

154
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,680
Great Khan, you're wise.

155
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,800
Guo Jing pays respects to you,
Great Khan.

156
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,960
Not bad, not bad.

157
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,560
The little condor has grown up

158
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,280
and can soar in the sky now.

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
You've seen mountains

160
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,840
and seas,

161
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,520
and now returned to the grassland

162
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,120
to stay by my side.

163
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,580
I just heard

164
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,280
you're being disturbed by Wanyan Honglie.

165
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,160
It's a pity

166
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,760
that I have encountered him several times

167
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,340
but I couldn't kill him

168
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,320
to avenge you.

169
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,240
I accept punishment.

170
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,320
The eagle on the grassland

171
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,560
will definitely catch the fox one day.

172
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,280
What's the rush?

173
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,620
Get up first.

174
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,240
I have something to report to you.

175
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,860
Are you going to talk about

176
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,960
your marriage with Huazheng?

177
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,460
Yes.

178
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,960
I was just thinking

179
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,600
to pick a good day

180
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,280
for you to marry Huazheng.

181
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,380
Great Khan,

182
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,120
I can't marry Huazheng.

183
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,280
Guo Jing.

184
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,100
Do you know what you are talking about?

185
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,320
You are so bold!

186
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,760
(Mongol Princes Ögedei, Chagatai)
Breaking off the engagement many times

187
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,300
not only is an insult
to my sister Huazheng,

188
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
you will also

189
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,140
let my father down.

190
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,600
You should be punished.

191
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,020
Stop!

192
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,360
If you dare to touch Guo Jing,

193
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,280
- Huazheng.
- I will kill myself here.

194
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Huazheng.

195
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,560
Make way.

196
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,520
I'll take care of it.

197
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,660
Don't let this kid think
no one on the grassland

198
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,690
- can beat his ass.
- Brother.

199
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,560
You...

200
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,480
Stop it.

201
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,960
Step down.

202
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,340
Guo Jing.

203
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,780
I'm only asking you,

204
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,040
how am I inferior to Huang Rong?

205
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,280
Can you tell me?

206
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,740
Okay.

207
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,940
You know

208
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,760
I just want to marry you.

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,360
If you don't answer,

210
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,680
I will keep waiting.

211
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,700
Huazheng.

212
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,520
Put the knife away.

213
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,320
I won't kill him.

214
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,740
You guys

215
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,040
are all my children on the grassland,

216
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,360
daring to love and hate.

217
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,020
Guo Jing.

218
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,120
Since you have another one in your heart,

219
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,020
how can I

220
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,440
marry my beloved daughter

221
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,160
to you to suffer?

222
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,720
Thank you for your understanding.

223
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,220
I'll give you a chance

224
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,320
to make amends for the mistake.

225
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,200
Join me on the western expedition.

226
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,900
There, we have a common enemy,

227
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,940
Wanyan Honglie.

228
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,780
Great Khan.

229
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
You can ask me

230
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,320
to kill the enemy alone.

231
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,820
But I am

232
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,540
completely clueless when it comes to
fighting battles in the army.

233
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,740
Both of you, get up.

234
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,180
My son-in-law

235
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,360
surely has to know how to fight.

236
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,820
The more you fight,

237
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,880
the more you'll learn it, right?

238
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm willing to follow you.

239
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,900
Good.

240
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,840
I've been waiting for this moment.

241
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,760
I now appoint you as Noyan,

242
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,700
and give you ten thousand
soldiers and horses.

243
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,740
From now on,

244
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,640
go out to battles with me

245
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,880
and conquer Samarkand City.

246
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,140
Guo Jing.

247
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,400
- Come up.
- Okay.

248
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,180
Guo Jing.

249
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,640
Only nobles or relatives can be a Noyan.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
It shows that Great Khan
values you greatly.

251
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,460
I am truly happy for you.

252
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,920
But I am feeling

253
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,720
worried now.

254
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,060
I could handle

255
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,960
duels with martial artists.

256
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,800
But I know nothing

257
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,160
about leading an army into battles.

258
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,440
Don't worry.

259
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,100
Isn't there a lot of books
on the art of war in the Central Plains?

260
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,940
Books on the art of war?

261
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,900
(Vital Information Against the Jins)

262
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,760
I actually forgot

263
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,040
I had these military texts.

264
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,780
(Training Soldiers)

265
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,880
The defending enemy will mistakenly believe
their vanguard has successfully broken through

266
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,600
and cleared the way to retreat.

267
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,280
Its elite soldiers will surely
continue to flee the city.

268
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,960
See through mechanisms with the eyes

269
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,520
and be flexible with the heart.

270
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,240
The fundamental to grasp this principle

271
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,800
lies in oneself.

272
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,100
Your Lordship,
the food and supplies are in place.

273
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,940
How to allocate them?

274
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,540
The soldiers have become more confused

275
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,520
about the formation recently.

276
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,520
Can you explain it more clearly,
Your Lordship?

277
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,320
Yes, Your Lordship, we still have...

278
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,660
Well,

279
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,700
you decide for yourselves.

280
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,680
Let me think about it.

281
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,650
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

282
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,280
So in all directions
between heaven and earth,

283
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,600
all sorts of things have their place.

284
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,060
- Report.
- Didn't I tell them

285
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,360
to decide for themselves?

286
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,560
Your Lordship,
some Han people want to see you.

287
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,740
Guo.

288
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
Martial Uncle Guo.

289
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,080
Elder Lu. Mr. Lu.

290
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,500
How did you come here?

291
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,460
We heard

292
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,140
you're leading the army
on a western expedition.

293
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,000
So we came to help.

294
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,680
How did you know about this?

295
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,700
We have wide connections,

296
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,580
this news

297
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,840
can't be kept from us.

298
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,740
You

299
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,500
already knew that me and Khan

300
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,680
are going to conquer the west.

301
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,920
Have you heard of Rong?

302
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,480
We have been searching everywhere for her

303
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,440
but there's still no news.

304
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,480
Could it be that Rong is...

305
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,280
Martial Uncle, please don't be sad.

306
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,380
My master, upon learning of this matter,

307
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,590
has already gone to Mount White Camel

308
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,280
to find Ouyang Feng.

309
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,440
Even if Old Venomous Creature is capable,

310
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,020
he can't escape

311
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,860
this time.

312
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,740
Okay.

313
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,480
I hope so.

314
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,300
At present,

315
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,190
the Songs and the Mongols
are joining forces to attack Jin.

316
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,580
This concerns the safety
of the Song people.

317
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,060
How can we stand by and do nothing?

318
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,280
So we brought our disciples to help.

319
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,060
Guiyun Manor also gathered

320
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,080
many heroes from the Taihu Lake.

321
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,420
As long as you agree,

322
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,760
they will come immediately.

323
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,000
Thank you.

324
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,040
I feel unworthy of it.

325
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,280
Although I have the intention
to kill the enemy,

326
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,980
I'm clueless when it comes to

327
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,000
leading troops into battles.

328
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,240
I'm afraid I'll hurt everyone's lives.

329
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,380
Guo.

330
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,160
Don't you have the Book of Wumu?

331
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,760
What are you worried about?

332
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,080
I'm not afraid that you'll laugh at me.

333
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,540
In this book,

334
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,080
the arts of war

335
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,720
all cited some famous sayings.

336
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,680
It's a pity

337
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,860
that I can't understand

338
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,880
the meanings behind them.

339
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,520
Even though

340
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,680
I am not a clever person,

341
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,020
at least,

342
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,120
I've led the Beggars' Gang
for Chief Hong for many years.

343
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,080
I have some experience in leadership.

344
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,440
I could offer you some advice.

345
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,420
I learned some knowledge
of eight trigrams

346
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,880
from my father.

347
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,480
It's most suitable
for military organization.

348
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm willing to give suggestions.

349
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,360
That is really great.

350
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,760
Thank you so much.

351
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,140
Sirs,

352
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,900
I have been training the troops

353
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,500
according to the Book of Wumu
for nearly a month,

354
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,760
but they still haven't improved.

355
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm afraid

356
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,480
if Yue Wumu hears about this,

357
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,480
he won't rest in peace.

358
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,860
Martial Uncle.

359
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,080
The Mongol cavalry is accustomed
to field warfare.

360
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,120
They're not good at deployment.

361
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,220
Now it's difficult
to disobey military orders.

362
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,860
They can only

363
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,960
muddle along.

364
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Yes.

365
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,780
I do apply the techniques mechanically.

366
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,380
When General Yue was young,

367
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,480
he only liked field battles.

368
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,800
His superior Zong Ze once told him,

369
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,820
"Your wisdom and bravery

370
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,220
can surpass those great generals',

371
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,460
but field battles are not
a one-size-fits-all solution."

372
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,480
Then he taught him the way
to arrange troops.

373
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Do you know

374
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,620
what General Yue said?

375
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,360
Please enlighten me.

376
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,460
It is the custom of war

377
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,940
to take up positions
and go out into battle.

378
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,440
But the dexterity of use it
is all in thinking.

379
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
It means

380
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,300
when marching and fighting,

381
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,040
we must know how to be flexible,

382
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,220
and adapt to local conditions.

383
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,320
I seem to understand a little.

384
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,200
General Yue's military strategy is good,

385
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,660
but

386
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,500
we need to apply it

387
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,550
according to the combat habits

388
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,920
of the Mongols.

389
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,660
We can't just copy it mechanically.

390
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,500
Isn't that right?

391
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,840
Yes.

392
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,960
You're so smart.

393
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,320
Then how about the eight formations

394
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,920
in the book?

395
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,280
I can't figure out

396
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,280
this question yet.

397
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,080
Let me think about it carefully.

398
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,220
Tomorrow

399
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,440
I will reply to you.

400
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,220
Brother Lu.

401
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,960
The eight formations
described in the book

402
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,180
are Heaven Covering, Earth Carrying,
Wind Rising,

403
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,620
Clouds Hanging, Dragon, Flying,
Tiger's Wings,

404
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,980
Birds Soaring and Snakes Coiling.

405
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,040
These eight formations

406
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,740
were originally created by Zhuge Liang,

407
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,580
then it was passed on to General Yue

408
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,000
with some more changes.

409
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,560
That's why

410
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,360
he conquered the enemy.

411
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,960
How to understand

412
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,160
(Heaven Covering Formation)
the Heaven Covering Formation?

413
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,080
Wait for me to think about it.

414
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,860
Tomorrow

415
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,040
I will reply to you.

416
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,940
16 positions in the Heavenly Array.
The outside is square and the inside is round.

417
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,140
The wind represents
the four corners of the sky.

418
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,780
The leader of the array
is the vanguard of the troops.

419
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,380
Skillfully use the three armies,
and the formation will be kept.

420
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,740
This is the Heaven Covering Formation.

421
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,460
(Heavenly Balance, Tianheng)

422
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,770
(Earth Carrying Formation)
Brother Lu.

423
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,000
How to explain

424
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
the Earth Carrying Formation?

425
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,340
Let me

426
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,880
think about it carefully.

427
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,220
Tomorrow,

428
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,800
I will reply to you.

429
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,040
Tomorrow again.

430
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,000
The Earth Array is in the shape
of a square with twelve positions.

431
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,700
The cloud array has four corners,
making it difficult for the enemy to attack.

432
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,120
Its form is unpredictable
and its movements are endless.

433
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,040
It cannot stand alone
and is matched with Yang.

434
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,520
Bravo!

435
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,560
Greetings, Great Khan.

436
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,820
Guo Jing.

437
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,520
Little rascal.

438
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,160
How dare you lie to me?

439
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,840
I don't know what I lied to you.

440
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,660
Didn't you tell me

441
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,120
that you didn't know how to lead troops?

442
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,680
How come

443
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,380
you defeated the enemy forces

444
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,520
and made them like stray dogs?

445
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,880
Because you taught me well.

446
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,720
You are born to be a warrior.

447
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,120
My son-in-law

448
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,760
should be a hero.

449
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,860
Congratulations, Great Khan.

450
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,400
Congratulations,
Gold Knife Prince Consort.

451
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,060
Today

452
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,800
our four armies

453
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,380
fought the enenmy bravely all the way

454
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,320
and have gathered here.

455
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,080
A hundred miles away

456
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,520
is the last line of defense of the Jins,

457
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,040
Samarkand City.

458
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,300
Tonight,

459
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,400
I will reward the entire army.

460
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,140
Guo.

461
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,840
Great Khan gave us drinks
to boost our morale.

462
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,480
Let's have a good drink.

463
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,500
Guo.

464
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,820
We won the battle.

465
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,660
Why are you still

466
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,960
looking so troubled?

467
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,260
Brother Lu.

468
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,440
I'm just thinking

469
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,440
(Wind Rising Formation)
in the Wind Rising Formation,

470
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,240
the main soldier
is in the position of Xun

471
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,800
to defend the Rest Door.

472
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,400
How should we comprehend this?

473
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,320
Get good and drunk so long

474
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,820
as I have wine today.

475
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,640
Let tomorrow take care
of its care anyway.

476
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,440
Tomorrow again.

477
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,460
Don't worry, I will
definitely tell you tomorrow.

478
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,000
Come on, Guo,
let me pour you some wine.

479
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,160
Little rascal.

480
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,080
Your martial arts have improved a lot.

481
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,260
Old Venomous Creature.

482
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,560
What are you doing here?

483
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,340
Where is that girl Huang Rong?

484
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,240
Hand her over.

485
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,400
Rong has escaped?

486
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,040
Stop playing the fool.

487
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Without her guidance,

488
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,060
how can you understand the Book of Wumu

489
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,040
and dream about conquering the city
and attacking the enemy?

490
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,840
(Thankfully, Rong's fine.)

491
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,600
Forget about whether Rong is here or not.

492
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,160
Even if she's here,

493
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,480
I won't hand her over to you.

494
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,580
Then I'll just take you with me.

495
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,720
I don't believe she won't show up.

496
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,680
Since Rong is fine,

497
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,560
why should I be afraid of you?

498
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,560
Old Venomous Creature,
you've come at the right time.

499
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,400
I'll seek revenge for my five masters.

500
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,700
Over there.

501
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,060
Quick.

502
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,740
Guo.

503
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,580
Are you okay?

504
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,880
I'm fine, Brother Lu.

505
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,380
How did you come here?

506
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,520
Well, here's the thing.

507
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,080
A few days ago, Mr. Lu mentioned that

508
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,440
there are spies

509
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,200
in the army.

510
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,620
So we came up with a plan,

511
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,480
trying to lure him out.

512
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,420
But unexpectedly, Ouyang Feng came.

513
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,260
Brother Lu,

514
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,260
don't tell anyone that

515
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,480
Ouyang Feng's hidden in the army

516
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,280
just to avoid chaos.

517
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,340
Okay.

518
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,040
Less than a day,

519
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,540
we lost four thousand

520
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,000
Mongol warriors,

521
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,740
yet we couldn't even pry open

522
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,280
a single brick of the Samarkand City.

523
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,000
Where is your bravery?

524
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,140
Father.

525
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,240
Samarkand City

526
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,680
was built on Bald Wood Peak,

527
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,360
with the mountain serving
as the city wall.

528
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,840
It's difficult

529
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,480
to break in.

530
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,880
Even monkeys find it hard
to climb up from it.

531
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,720
If we can't conquer it now,

532
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,200
the weather will get colder

533
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,290
and the difficulty will increase.

534
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,620
We can withdraw our troops
and rest first.

535
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,560
Wait until the weather
warms up in early spring,

536
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,200
we'll attack the city again.

537
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,900
Great Khan.

538
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,200
It's not appropriate to retreat now.

539
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,920
If we retreat now,

540
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,720
all our previous efforts are wasted

541
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,120
and the tens of thousands of Jin soldiers

542
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,960
waiting in the city

543
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,800
will attack us

544
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,900
when we retreat.

545
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,700
By then,

546
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,820
we will definitely

547
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,740
crash into pieces.

548
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,420
Guo Jing is right.

549
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
But facing the fortified walls,

550
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,980
if we can only stand off
under the city wall,

551
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,780
our food supply

552
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,180
will not

553
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,980
be enough.

554
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,420
It'll be hard to withdraw
even if we want to.

555
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,260
At present, our army

556
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,740
is caught in a dilemma.

557
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,940
I have guessed

558
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,140
it must be Rong's idea.

559
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,220
Take me to see her quickly.

560
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,660
No.

561
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,100
Well...

562
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,300
Chief Huang is not here.

563
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,980
I was curious before.

564
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,460
Why every time I ask you

565
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,260
to explain the techniques

566
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,860
in the Book of Wumu,

567
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
you always have to answer me

568
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,100
the next day?

569
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,940
Now thinking about it,

570
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,260
there must be someone behind the scenes

571
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,900
who knows the Eight Diagrams
to guide you.

572
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,060
But in this vast desert,

573
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,700
where can we find such a person?

574
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,500
The arts of war

575
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,860
are exquisite.

576
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,060
It's fair that I need some time

577
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,740
to understand it.

578
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,300
It hasn't been long

579
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,540
since I led my troops westward,

580
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,220
and you have already gathered troops

581
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,060
to arrive at this place.

582
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
If it weren't for someone

583
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,380
in the Mongol army
to inform you in advance,

584
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,660
how could you

585
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,060
hear the news so quickly?

586
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,820
And

587
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,260
who else

588
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,580
can mobilize the Beggars' Gang

589
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
and the heroes of Taihu Lake?

590
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,140
Also,

591
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,580
Chief Huang's life is uncertain,

592
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,820
but you're helping me

593
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,100
attack the Jins here calmly.

594
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
Therefore,

595
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,860
Ouyang Feng

596
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,340
said confidently

597
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,420
that Rong is in the Mongol camp.

598
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,700
It's not fully fanciful.

599
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,660
Brother Lu.

600
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,460
You know

601
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,980
I've been looking for Rong
for a long time.

602
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,260
Hurry and take me to see her.

603
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,780
Brother Lu.

604
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,140
You said Rong is on this mountain?

605
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,500
(Bald Wood Peak)
Yes. She's at the mountaintop.

606
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,540
This Bald Wood Peak

607
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,020
is several times higher

608
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,440
than the Middle Peak
of Iron Palm Mountain.

609
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,660
How can I climb up

610
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,060
without the help of a rope?

611
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,260
Rong.

612
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,740
Rong.

613
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,580
Guo.

614
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,340
I've told you this place.

615
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,220
It's up to you

616
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
how to get up.

617
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,860
Rong must be

618
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,620
angry at me because I misunderstood her,

619
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,220
so she left me with a difficult task.

620
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,260
It's killing me

621
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,140
not being able to see her.

622
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,300
I'd rather just to climb up.

623
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,980
(Even if I fall and die,)

624
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,860
(it can show my affection to her.)

625
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,660
(Chief Huang just wants him to learn)

626
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,260
(how it feels to be unable to see her.)

627
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,980
(But what if something happens to him?)

628
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,780
(I would become the villain here.)

629
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Guo, please stop.

630
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,980
Watch my method.

631
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,980
Cut off the lamb legs,

632
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,940
and while the blood is hot,

633
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,500
put it on the mountain peak.

634
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,980
After the blood freezes,

635
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,740
the lamb leg can be frozen on the peak,

636
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,620
and become stronger than steel nails.

637
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,220
If you climb it step by step,

638
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,380
you can build a ladder.

639
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,900
Rong.

640
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,100
Rong.

641
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,260
Rong.

642
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,300
Rong.

643
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,020
Rong.

644
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,540
It's really you.

645
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,500
What?

646
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,140
During the days you can't see me,

647
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,100
is it not enought for you to call my name

648
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,060
dozens of times a day?

649
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,900
Not enough.

650
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,580
Even if I call your name

651
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,600
a thousand times, it's not enough.

652
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,140
Rong.

653
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,300
It's really you.

654
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,300
Great.

655
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,780
By the way,

656
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,500
how did you know?

657
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,300
So you were in my army.

658
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,460
That's because you are too dump.

659
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,580
Elder Lu showed it so obviously.

660
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,140
Why did you just realize it?

661
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,860
Yes.

662
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
I am too dump.

663
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,700
Otherwise,

664
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,260
I wouldn't have fallen for Yang Kang

665
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,420
and Ouyang Feng's schemes,

666
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,540
and misunderstood you and Master Huang.

667
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
I'm sorry.

668
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,460
I don't know what to do

669
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,220
to make you forgive me

670
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,140
and be willing to see me.

671
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,340
Why do I need to see you?

672
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,780
If you knew I was safe and alive,

673
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,340
would you agree

674
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,460
to marry Huazheng?

675
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
Then I would rather
you don't know my whereabouts.

676
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,620
Yes.

677
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,060
No matter what I do now,

678
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,820
I'm sorry for you.

679
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,340
But Rong,

680
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,980
my kindness towards you

681
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,500
was all sincere.

682
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,000
Heaven and earth can testify it.

683
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,100
Of course I know your sincerity.

684
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,180
Or why would I look for you?

685
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,900
Rong.

686
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,940
How did you escape

687
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
from Ouyang Feng?

688
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,380
That's a long story.

689
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,820
On the way,

690
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,940
Ouyang Feng forced me

691
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,460
to explain the Nine Yin Manual to him.

692
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,860
We happened to pass by
Guiyun Manor that day.

693
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,860
I came up with an idea

694
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,420
and forced him to go to Guiyun Manor.

695
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,740
That Old Venomous Creature is arrogant.

696
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,100
He never expected

697
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,860
I used the Eight-Diagram Formation
of Guiyun Manor

698
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,700
to escape from his clutches.

699
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,660
I was planning to return
to Peach Blossom Island.

700
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,100
Unexpectedly,

701
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,460
(Dock)
he had already guessed my thoughts

702
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,260
and waited for me at the dock
early in the morning.

703
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
I avoided him all the way

704
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,220
to the north.

705
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,500
The disciples of the Beggars' Gang said

706
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
you went to the north.

707
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,060
So they were right.

708
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,020
It's a pity that when I went there,

709
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,380
you had already left.

710
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,060
Ouyang Feng was chasing me closely.

711
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,220
When I heard that
you went to the grassland,

712
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,900
I decided to come and find you.

713
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,180
I even managed to hide
in the Mongol camp.

714
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,860
What a pity.

715
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,460
Old Venomous Creature is cunning.

716
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,900
He was also hiding in it.

717
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,540
I was afraid of causing you trouble,

718
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,740
so I chose not to see you.

719
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,420
What happened next?

720
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,460
Then,

721
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,660
I knew you were going to
lead the troops westward.

722
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,300
I thought

723
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,860
you were not good at
commanding troops,

724
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,500
and afraid that
you would get yourself killed,

725
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,180
so I found Elder Lu.

726
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,620
He came with a group of disciples
from the Beggars' Gang,

727
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,100
partly to deceive Old Venomous Creature,

728
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,460
and on the other hand,

729
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,660
to give you some advice

730
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,900
and lend you a helping hand.

731
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,780
While Elder Lu

732
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,900
was explaining the mysteries

733
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,140
of the Book of Wumu,

734
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,580
I should have guessed it was you.

735
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,820
I'm just too dumb.

736
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,180
You are not dumb.

737
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,660
Or

738
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,500
how could you

739
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,540
force Elder Lu to tell you

740
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,700
how to get on top of this mountain

741
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,540
and see me?

742
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,540
Rong.

743
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,620
From now on,

744
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,980
stay by my side.

745
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,220
Don't leave me, okay?

746
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,420
Let me think about it.

747
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,980
By the way, Jing.

748
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,060
Do you still remember the essentials

749
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,620
of the chapter of
muscle-bone strengthening

750
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,020
in Nine Yin Manual?

751
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,060
I...

752
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,500
Why are you so careless?

753
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,900
My dad took a lot of time
to translate it.

754
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,740
The strange words

755
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,220
in the last chapter of Nine Yin Manual.

756
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,180
You must learn the Nine Yin Manual.

757
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,740
If you don't understand,

758
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,580
I can slowly translate it for you.

759
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,300
Okay, Rong.

760
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,980
But

761
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,540
I am now a military general.

762
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,020
I can't be away for too long.

763
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,300
I need to go back for an hour

764
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
to deal with military affairs.

765
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,660
Okay.

766
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,980
Then I'll wait for you here.

767
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,460
You go back to the military camp.

768
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,340
I will write the words on the manual.

769
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,300
When you come back,

770
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,180
I will finish it.

771
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,620
No.

772
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,400
Well,

773
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,140
going up and down the mountain
is quite troublesome.

774
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,900
You'd better come back
to the camp with me.

775
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,140
No.

776
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,660
Ouyang Feng is extremely cunning.

777
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,660
We can't escape from him
no matter where we go.

778
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,820
But, no matter how cunning he is,

779
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,100
he would never expect

780
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,300
we were at the top of this mountain peak.

781
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,940
In order to guard against him,

782
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,860
we must not take the manual

783
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,940
away from the top of the mountain.

784
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,100
Okay.

785
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,380
It's so cold, Jing.

786
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,180
When you come back,

787
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,580
bring some warm clothes.

788
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,460
Tonight,

789
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,420
we will study the manual here.

790
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,780
Okay, Rong.

791
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
You wait for me here.

792
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,100
(Young)

793
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,540
(but trickery.)

794
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,020
(Then I'll wait for you for an hour.)

795
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
So Rong, you were prepared.

796
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,180
I was worried Old Venomous Creature
would follow you here,

797
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,580
so I asked Elder Lu

798
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,940
to pour hot oil

799
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,420
on these ropes

800
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,460
just in case.

801
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,820
Last time, he saw you,

802
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,060
so he narrowly escaped.

803
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,780
But this time he may not be so lucky.

804
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,940
Let's burn the bridge

805
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,820
after we cross it.

806
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,540
Chief Huang, you're wise.

807
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,060
Even with Ouyang Feng's
high martial arts skills,

808
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,180
he won't be able to escape.

809
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,380
He might freeze to death
on the mountaintop.

810
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,140
Young people.

811
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,780
You did not honor your words.

812
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,580
Are you bullying
an honest person like me?

813
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,340
You guys wait and see!

814
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,700
Yours.

815
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,100
Thank you.

816
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,740
Slow down.

817
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,660
Rong.

818
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,220
Jing.

819
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,860
You've arrived just in time.

820
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,220
I made something delicious for you.

821
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,980
Braised lamb trotters.

822
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,540
That bad guy on the mountain will drool.

823
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,140
Smells so good.

824
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
What's wrong, Jing?

825
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,100
I feel like you're not very happy.

826
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,980
The city has been surrounded
by the army for several days,

827
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
but we couldn't conquer it.

828
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,500
Our troops are facing a shortage of food.

829
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,660
The soldiers are suffering
from hunger and cold.

830
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,300
How can I have the mood

831
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,420
to enjoy this delicious food?

832
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,460
It turns out you are

833
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,500
worrying about this.

834
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,700
There is no record in the Book of Wumu

835
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,860
about how to break into the city?

836
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,580
I have been pondering over it for days.

837
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,620
I have read the Book of Wumu

838
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,740
over and over again,

839
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,140
but still can't find a suitable way.

840
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,420
The Book of Wumu

841
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,780
has some clever strategies,

842
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,220
but the cases are all

843
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,340
in the Central Plains.

844
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,660
There's no former example

845
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,460
to conquer a strange city like Samarkand.

846
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,860
It's just a pity that Wanyan Honglie

847
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,940
is still hiding in this city.

848
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,020
But I can only watch him

849
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,100
and do nothing.

850
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,380
Actually

851
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,060
it is not that difficult
to conquer the city.

852
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,420
Just get one hundred

853
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,940
skillful martial artists like you

854
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,300
to fly to the top
of the city wall quietly

855
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,700
and open the city gate.

856
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,620
Then the Mongol cavalry

857
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,860
can enter the city.

858
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,700
Rong.

859
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,420
Are you joking with me again?

860
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,340
The city wall of Samarkand
is a hundred feet high,

861
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,300
with a smooth surface.

862
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,220
Even if it's me,

863
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,220
I can't climb up from it.

864
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,820
Not to mention

865
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,380
so many of us.

866
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,020
Unless we put a pair of wings
on everyone.

867
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
So

868
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,780
since we can't solve this problem now,

869
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,660
let's just

870
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,820
enjoy the meal

871
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,940
in front of us.

872
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,620
Rong, look.

873
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,460
Ouyang Feng can't hold on anymore.

874
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:38,860
He is seeking death on one's own.

875
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,100
Strange.

876
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,820
Why does Ouyang Feng look like

877
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,060
he has a pair of wings?

878
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,540
Let's go catch up with him.

879
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,140
Wait a moment.

880
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,420
Even if we catch up with him,

881
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,780
we won't be able to capture him.

882
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,900
At this moment, we can't
do anything to Wanyan Honglie,

883
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,900
and let Ouyang Feng run away.

884
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,020
Jing.

885
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,660
Don't worry.

886
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,100
I'll give you a big gift.

887
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,860
Brothers,

888
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,460
now

889
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,540
cut all the tents

890
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,980
to make the wings,

891
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,260
and use woods to make the frame.

892
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,980
The bottom should be able
to tie up with you.

893
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,100
Within three hours,

894
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,940
finish making ten thousand
leather umbrellas.

895
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,900
Let's set off at three in the morning,

896
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,620
set up formations at four,

897
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,900
and break into the city at five.

898
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,020
Yes.

899
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,140
Jing.

900
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,340
Now is the right time.

901
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

902
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,420
Brothers.

903
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,500
Let's go.

904
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,350
Yes.

905
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,980
Rong, be extremely careful.

906
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,060
