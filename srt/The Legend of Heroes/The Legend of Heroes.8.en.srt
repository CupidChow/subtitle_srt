00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,980
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,180
Capture the Jin envoy alive

4
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,820
and kill the young prince!

5
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,680
Your Highness, we are ambushed.

6
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,220
Kneel down.

7
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,660
You are the envoy?

8
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,120
Since you know my identity,

9
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,680
how dare you tie me up?

10
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,560
You're not afraid of
getting into trouble?

11
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,580
Young Master,
don't listen to his nonsense.

12
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,920
Just kill him.

13
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,660
Take him away

14
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,720
and wait for my father's decision.

15
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,180
Let's go.

16
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,240
Young Master is right.

17
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,420
Let's hurry

18
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,400
to clean up the battlefield.

19
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,080
- Go.
- Go.

20
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,960
Jing.

21
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,500
What are you doing?

22
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,580
I will go and talk

23
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,820
to Young Master Lu.

24
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,660
Yang Kang is definitely not the envoy
of the Jin Empire.

25
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,280
Yang Kang helps the villain to do evil.

26
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,060
If we rush to help him,

27
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,940
we will definitely be regarded
as Jin people's allies.

28
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,240
Rong, there must be a misunderstanding.

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
Yang Kang must have been manipulated.

30
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,120
Okay, Jing,

31
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,820
we don't know

32
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,860
if Yang Kang is really

33
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,840
the secret envoy of the Jin Empire.

34
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,020
But since he showed up

35
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,100
on the ship of the Jin people,

36
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,480
he must be involved.

37
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,200
If Yang Kang loses his life here,

38
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,800
Mu Nianci

39
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,520
would regret it all her life.

40
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,240
Mu Nianci.

41
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,120
You always think about her.

42
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,220
Rong.

43
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,520
I didn't mean that.

44
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,660
Alright.

45
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,560
I was just kidding.

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
At present,

47
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,400
we are not sure about
Lord Lu's background.

48
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,640
We must not act recklessly.

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,960
So let's wait

50
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
and choose the right time to help,

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,660
okay?

52
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,480
Okay, I'll listen to you.

53
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,840
You are the secret envoy

54
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,040
of the Jin Empire?

55
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,500
You robber.

56
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,460
You guys used tricks

57
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,600
to take a cheap shot on me,

58
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,920
not daring to confront me fairly.

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,160
Heroes in the martial world
will laugh at you.

60
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,280
You are one of the Jins.

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,820
You're not qualified

62
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,280
to mention the martial world to us.

63
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,540
I thought men on the Taihu Lake

64
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,820
were all upright and honest

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,280
heroes.

66
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,360
Turns out

67
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,720
you're not as good as they say.

68
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,280
Why?

69
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,820
Just a batch of villains

70
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,160
who takes advantage of the few.

71
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,360
If I defeat you in a one-on-one fight,

72
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,720
then you will die without complaint?

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,860
Right.

74
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,920
If anyone in the Guiyun House

75
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,500
can beat me

76
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,600
with real skills,

77
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,360
I'll surrender willingly

78
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,920
and let you do as you like

79
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,040
with me.

80
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,180
Dad.

81
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,500
I'll go challenge him.

82
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,040
Someone, untie him.

83
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,480
We'll have a duel.

84
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,680
I'll make you lose fair and square.

85
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,720
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,840
I have seen this move before..

87
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,360
It seems that Yang Kang

88
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,600
has many secrets that we do not know.

89
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,660
You kid,

90
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,600
how dare you act recklessly
in my Guiyun House!

91
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,700
Lord Lu

92
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,520
kept his martial arts well hidden.

93
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,360
Who are the Twin Killers
in the Dark Wind to you?

94
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,360
Twin Killers in the Dark Wind?

95
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,160
I don't know them.

96
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,840
Since you refuse to speak,

97
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,360
you might as well stay in this house

98
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,040
and answer my question

99
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,920
until you figure it out.

100
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,960
Your son couldn't beat me,

101
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,040
so he asked his father for help.

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,500
So this is your so-called

103
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,260
one-on-one battle?

104
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,100
Take him away.

105
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,180
Go.

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
What should we do, Rong?

107
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,920
Should we save him?

108
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,400
Calm down.

109
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,680
Let me think about it first.

110
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,940
I have always thought that

111
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,660
Lord Lu is very eccentric.

112
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,520
Why is that?

113
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,620
I thought Guiyun House

114
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,340
was just the headquarters
of the heroes near Taihu Lake.

115
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,260
But I never expected that

116
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,300
the moves Lu Chengfeng used

117
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,040
were all from Peach Blossom Island.

118
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,260
But I have never heard my father

119
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,160
mention them.

120
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,400
There must be something fishy going on.

121
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,800
I need to investigate further.

122
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,580
Do you think he knows

123
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,420
Mei Chaofeng?

124
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,620
There are people out there.

125
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,710
Shush!

126
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,060
Mu Nianci.

127
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,220
Well...

128
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,900
She's going to save her hero.

129
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,040
What are you doing here?

130
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,200
But the roads here are strange.

131
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm afraid Mu Nianci will get lost.

132
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,180
Rong, you are the smartest.

133
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,120
Can you help her come up with ideas?

134
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,020
Okay.

135
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,260
I just wanted to see

136
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,480
what ways she has to save him.

137
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,020
But it seems

138
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,720
if she continues to walk like this,

139
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,000
she won't be able to save Yang Kang.

140
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,540
Who is it?

141
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,720
Go left.

142
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,580
Believe it or not.

143
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,720
Otherwise, you'll be trapped here.

144
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,940
Who?

145
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,460
Kang.

146
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,420
Nianci.

147
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,320
Is it really you?

148
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,720
It's me.

149
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,560
It's not easy to get in

150
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,960
this creepy place.

151
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,600
It's useless.

152
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,020
Look.

153
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,000
These handcuffs
are made of stainless steel.

154
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,720
They can't be opened without a key.

155
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,960
What should we do?

156
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,100
I will go steal the key right away.

157
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,940
Don't go.

158
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,760
The enemies here are powerful.

159
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,720
You can't take the risks.

160
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,420
Well,

161
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,460
I can't just stand by and watch you

162
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,840
being imprisoned like this.

163
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,460
Rest assured.

164
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,760
They dare not hurt me easily.

165
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,240
At present,

166
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,000
there is an urgent matter
that I need you to help me with.

167
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,420
Come.

168
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,020
Take off the gold chain

169
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,860
around my neck

170
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,420
and give it Prime Minister Shi Miyuan

171
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,720
of Lin'an Prefecture.

172
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,420
Tell him

173
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,900
if a Mongolian envoy

174
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,840
comes to Lin'an,

175
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,880
do not meet him.

176
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,080
Kill him as soon as he sees him.

177
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,240
Why kill the envoy?

178
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,960
Your life is at stake.

179
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,600
But you want me
to send the message first.

180
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,120
This is a very important matter

181
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,000
which concerns our future happiness.

182
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,480
If it goes wrong,

183
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm afraid our lives will be in danger.

184
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,600
Don't lie to me.

185
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,700
I've been watching you
hanging out with the Jin people.

186
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,480
And now you want me
to pass on the message.

187
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,080
Is it that

188
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,340
the Jins are trying to drive a wedge

189
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,000
in the relations between the Mongols
and the Song Dynasty?

190
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,600
You're indeed brilliant.

191
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,880
But now,

192
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,940
I don't care at all

193
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,440
the relations between the Song Dynasty,

194
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,100
the Jin Empire

195
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,440
and the Mongols.

196
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,360
I only care about getting things done

197
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,080
and saving my own life.

198
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,600
So I can spend
the rest of my life with you.

199
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,720
If only by colluding with the enemy
can we survive,

200
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,240
I would rather die.

201
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,560
Why act recklessly

202
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,120
to ruin our future happiness?

203
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,840
Stop trying to deceive me
with your sweet words.

204
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,020
Anyway,

205
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,120
I will never help the Jins.

206
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,060
Well,

207
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm not forcing you
to go against your will.

208
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,440
But this place is dangerous.

209
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,480
Neither you nor I can come and go freely.

210
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,760
You go to the temple in the barren hills

211
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,960
30 miles north of Suzhou

212
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,960
and ask my master to come and rescue me.

213
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,940
Is he

214
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,240
Taoist Qiu?

215
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,660
No.

216
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,560
It's my other master.

217
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,420
Okay.

218
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,880
My master is blind in both eyes.

219
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,480
You need to find a wooden board

220
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,940
and carve the letters,

221
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,600
"Wanyan Kang is in trouble

222
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,720
at Guiyun House

223
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,940
on the west bank of Taihu Lake."

224
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,060
When she reads this,

225
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,720
she will come to rescue me.

226
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,440
My master has a strange temper.

227
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,360
Just place the wooden board
under the skull

228
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,600
and leave quickly,

229
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,360
in case she hurts you.

230
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,480
Take care, Kang.

231
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,660
I will.

232
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,320
A treacherous person

233
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,080
who associats with the evil.

234
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,840
He is not worth saving.

235
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,360
I just feel sorry for Mu Nianci.

236
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,960
- Let's go, Rong.
- Okay.

237
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,580
(Wanyan Kang is in trouble at Guiyun House
on the west bank of Taihu Lake)

238
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,440
Who's out there?

239
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,260
Let me go.

240
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,240
Smells so good.

241
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,720
You pervert.

242
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,740
Such a beautiful girl,

243
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,600
coming here alone so late at night.

244
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,840
What if something dangerous happens?

245
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,700
I would feel heartbroken.

246
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,560
Stay away from me.

247
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,640
I can do that

248
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,840
as long as you accept me as your master.

249
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,360
I can leave immediately.

250
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,840
I'm just worried

251
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,720
you don't want me to go.

252
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,460
Young Master.

253
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,300
She's here.

254
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,240
Take her with you

255
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,720
and take good care of her.

256
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,140
Yes.

257
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,720
What do you want to do?

258
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,440
Let me go.

259
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,240
Who is here?

260
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,420
Witch.

261
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,960
If you hand over
the Nine Yin Manual today,

262
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,460
I can spare your life.

263
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,360
It depends

264
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,640
on your abilities.

265
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,220
Witch.

266
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,980
You stole the manual.

267
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,940
After more than twenty years,
you should have learned it well.

268
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,460
Why don't you give it to me?

269
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,740
Let us be reconciled

270
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,900
and forget the past grievances.

271
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,760
How nice it would be.

272
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,540
Break the snake formation.

273
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,000
Give me the manual.

274
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,360
Then catch it.

275
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,380
Witch.

276
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,120
You have to do it the hard way.

277
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,620
Lord Lu.

278
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,880
There is no solution to this move.

279
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,200
You better admit defeat.

280
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,440
I didn't expect that

281
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,680
you're knowledgeable about
calligraphy and painting

282
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,800
and your chess skills are also superb.

283
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,460
One more game.

284
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,820
One more game.

285
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,340
Dad.

286
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,080
Someone brought this.

287
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,160
Who sent it?

288
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,260
I don't know.

289
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,000
The person who brought it
has already left.

290
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,140
Dad.

291
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,520
What's the mystery behind this skull?

292
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,800
It must be the work

293
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,440
of the Twin Killers in the Dark Wind.

294
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,120
The two of them have had
a long-standing feud with me,

295
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,360
and this time,

296
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,840
they'll bring great disaster.

297
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,060
What disaster

298
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,600
can scare you so much?

299
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,700
Guanying.

300
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,260
Escort your mother

301
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,920
to the North Manor in Wuxi.

302
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,560
Pass my order
to the chiefs of each village

303
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,040
to watch their villagers.

304
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,220
Regardless of the situation
in Guiyun House,

305
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,400
none of them can come to help.

306
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,080
What about you, Dad?

307
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,340
Me?

308
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,440
It's time

309
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,640
to settle the old grudges.

310
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,560
- Dad.
- Go ahead.

311
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,320
- Dad.
- Go.

312
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,860
Since you know
you'll be outmatched by them,

313
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,760
you should find a place to hide.

314
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,400
A wise man knows when to retreat.

315
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,600
These two betrayed their sect,

316
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,680
but I was implicated

317
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,440
and ended up half disabled.

318
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,520
For the past twenty years,

319
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,160
I didn't go after him for revenge.

320
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,320
Now they have come to me instead.

321
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,360
I just hope we can perish together.

322
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,980
(Year of Bumper Harvest)

323
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,940
Thank you for your hospitality, Lord Lu.

324
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,360
I met you two by chance

325
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,920
but we really hit it off.

326
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,600
In just a few days,
I have taken you as my confidants.

327
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,200
I really don't want this
to implicate you.

328
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,160
If I can luckily survive this,

329
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,920
I'll invite you both

330
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,680
to Guiyun House again.

331
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,100
Okay.

332
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,660
You two really make

333
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,600
a perfect match.

334
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,540
This is a little something from me

335
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,620
to congratulate you

336
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,840
on your marriage in the future.

337
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,280
Please take it.

338
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,100
Lord Lu.

339
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,640
When did you realize I was a woman?

340
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,760
I am just physically disabled,

341
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,080
it's not like I have eye problems.

342
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,060
I have no other talents.

343
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,740
In the past, my mentor taught me

344
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,640
some medical knowledge.

345
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,120
I could make some medicine

346
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,120
that prolong lives.

347
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,440
We have known each other for a while,

348
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,120
so I will give it to you.

349
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Consider it my way

350
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,400
of paying respect.

351
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,520
Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pill.

352
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,920
You know this pill?

353
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,740
When I was young, I was weak and frail.

354
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,800
An eminent monk gave me three pills.

355
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,740
They were very effective.

356
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,160
Therefore, I know that
they are very precious pills.

357
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,860
This Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pill

358
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,940
are made from

359
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,320
precious herbs,

360
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,600
and also need

361
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,200
morning dew
on nine types of flower petals.

362
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,020
It can only be refined

363
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,880
at special times and seasons.

364
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,560
Requires a lot of effort.

365
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm deeply grateful

366
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,780
to your affection.

367
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,460
You two don't need to refuse.

368
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,800
I have no use for it.

369
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,160
Thank you, Lord Lu.

370
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,140
I heard that Guiyun House
was in trouble,

371
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,440
so I came to help.

372
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,540
Having Mr. Qiu Qianren,

373
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,980
Iron Palm Water Skimmer,

374
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,120
here to help,

375
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,640
I think

376
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,760
the Twin Killers in the Dark Wind

377
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,440
are not a concern anymore.

378
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,360
Sir, please sit down.

379
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,800
Since the last duel atop Mount Huashan,

380
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,540
it's been more than twenty years

381
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,440
since I appeared in the martial world.

382
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,440
Over these twenty years,

383
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,740
the only thing accompanying me

384
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,920
is myself

385
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,760
and endless loneliness.

386
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,060
I appreciate it that

387
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,600
you still remember my name.

388
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,700
I once heard

389
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,220
about the duel atop Mount Huashan

390
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,920
and you were invited to attend.

391
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,420
But you didn't make it

392
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,560
due to some urgent matters.

393
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,020
But your martial arts skills
must be extraordinary,

394
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,160
not inferior to the Five Greats.

395
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,260
It's been said in the martial world

396
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,700
that Western Venom,
Northern Beggar, Eastern Heretic,

397
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,740
Southern Emperor, and Central Diviner

398
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,680
are the best martial artists.

399
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,000
When it comes to the powers,

400
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,760
the Central Diviner Wang Chongyang
ranks top.

401
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,600
The other four

402
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,600
each has their own strengths

403
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,000
But the shortcomings

404
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,560
are also particularly obvious.

405
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,300
Why don't you defeat

406
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,540
the Five Greats

407
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,200
and make a name for yourself?

408
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,200
I have this intention.

409
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,680
Who said that?

410
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,320
I have long heard of your name.

411
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,120
I am just a nobody,

412
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,380
asking for

413
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,440
a few tips from you.

414
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,940
The Guiyun House

415
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,220
is the brain of the heroes of Taihu Lake.

416
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,080
Mr. Lu's martial arts
are already wonderful.

417
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,380
If I give him some guidance,

418
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,260
it will surely enhance his skills

419
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,600
and double the might.

420
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,560
By that time,

421
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,180
even the Twin Killers in the Dark Wind

422
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,080
will have to fear you

423
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,920
or become

424
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,120
terror-stricken.

425
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,320
You flatter me.

426
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,520
I have been disabled for a long time.

427
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,440
I dare not

428
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,400
show my incompetence in front of you.

429
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,280
Mr. Qiu.

430
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,740
If you are willing

431
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,160
to give some advice to my son,

432
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,540
that's really his blessing.

433
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,600
Mr. Qiu.

434
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,840
I learned from Master Kumu

435
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,640
of Yunqi Temple in Lin'an Prefecture.

436
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,120
Kumu?

437
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,760
He is a skilled practitioner
of Xianxia Sect.

438
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,400
His martial arts

439
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,160
can get by.

440
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,880
In this case,

441
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,420
let me test

442
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,160
what you're capable of.

443
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,560
Please instruct me.

444
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,280
Enough.

445
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,400
You broke the tile with one kick.

446
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,260
It seems you're powerful,

447
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,760
but it's actually useless.

448
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,220
The enemy is not a tile.

449
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,160
He won't let you punch him at will.

450
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,500
If the enemy has strong internal power,

451
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,660
and your fist bounces back,

452
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,920
what will you do?

453
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,080
Watch carefully.

454
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,520
Impressive.

455
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,120
Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Qiu.

456
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,900
Rong.

457
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,800
Do you recognize this move?

458
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,500
It's called

459
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,600
"burning firewood in the belly".

460
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,620
Which sect is this from?

461
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,060
Why does the name sound so weird?

462
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,920
The move is also weird.

463
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,800
Miss Huang, you must be joking.

464
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,260
If Mr. Qiu has

465
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,380
such strong internal power,

466
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,360
then he can harm people easily.

467
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,280
Rong.

468
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,880
You're teasing me again.

469
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,600
I'm flattered.

470
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,320
You do have great martial arts skills.

471
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,460
If you attended

472
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,040
the duel atop Mount Huashan,

473
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,640
you would have had a seat

474
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,600
among the Five Greats.

475
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,120
Let's not mention the past.

476
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,460
Lord.

477
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,860
Lord, six strange people have come.

478
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,080
They want to break in.

479
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,600
Dad, I'll go take a look.

480
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,320
Who are you?

481
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,200
If you don't say your names,

482
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,680
I won't be polite then.

483
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,020
Zhen'e,

484
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,320
this guy is acting like a snob.

485
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,460
Since that's the case,

486
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,500
why bother

487
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,340
talking to him?

488
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,840
Let me teach him a lesson first.

489
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,220
Is it really

490
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,840
the Twin Killers in the Dark Wind?

491
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,640
But there are six of them.

492
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,280
They must have known that I am here

493
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,600
so they got scared

494
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,640
and brought helpers.

495
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,400
It is possible.

496
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,840
Wait a moment, Young Master.

497
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,300
- Jing.
- Jing.

498
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,140
Jing.

499
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,600
Masters,

500
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,880
it's really you guys.

501
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,020
Jing.

502
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,360
How come you are here?

503
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,620
Young Master.

504
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,880
They are my masters.

505
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,060
Masters,

506
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm truly sorry

507
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,340
for the misunderstanding.

508
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,500
It's a misunderstanding.

509
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,820
Jing.

510
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,840
Why are you two still together?

511
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,360
Jing.

512
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,220
If you don't

513
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,360
go with us today,

514
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,600
don't recognize us as your masters.

515
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,920
The six of you

516
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,160
are like parents to me.

517
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,020
I can't abandon you.

518
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,320
Well, in that case,

519
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,320
leave this little witch.

520
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,800
Cranky old man.

521
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
Master.

522
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,600
I really like Rong.

523
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,640
I can't leave her.

524
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,840
We Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

525
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,440
always act decisively.

526
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,980
How could our disciple

527
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,380
be so indecisive?

528
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,220
Old man,

529
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,860
stop dilly-dallying.

530
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,990
If the Twin Killers
in the Dark Wind come...

531
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,680
Don't talk to me.

532
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,280
Twin Killers in the Dark Wind?

533
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,120
I have long heard of your name.

534
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,600
I was being rude today.

535
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,000
I will drink a toast

536
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,280
to express my apologies.

537
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,980
I thought

538
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,460
Mr. Guo didn't know martial arts.

539
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,700
But unexpectedly,

540
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,760
you learned from great masters.

541
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,000
Today adding your help,

542
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,140
we could easily deal with

543
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,360
the Twin Killers in the Dark Wind.

544
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,140
Lord Lu.

545
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,080
Don't be so polite.

546
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,560
This is...

547
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,140
He's Mr. Qiu,

548
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,120
Iron Palm Water Skimmer.

549
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,820
These six heroes can be counted

550
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,880
as seniors
in the martial world of Jiangnan.

551
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Why are you also trapped

552
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,500
in personal grievances

553
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,320
and can't extricate yourselves?

554
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,120
Mr. Qiu.

555
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,640
Why say that?

556
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,640
People in the martial world

557
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,400
should be chivalrous

558
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,520
and save the people from suffering.
This is the high road!

559
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,200
You're right.

560
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,120
You're right.

561
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,280
We should reflect on this.

562
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,560
I have a good thing here.

563
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,700
If we can get your help,

564
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,000
it would be better.

565
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,920
Mr. Qiu,

566
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,840
please enlighten us.

567
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,440
The Jin army is advancing southward

568
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,060
and many innocent people

569
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,980
will die

570
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,200
when the war starts.

571
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,840
Every time I think of this,

572
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,640
I feel despondent

573
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,600
and shed tears.

574
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,120
How can we save the people?

575
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,900
I heard you

576
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,520
captured the young prince
of the Jin Empire.

577
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,920
If we can release him...

578
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,020
What are you saying?

579
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,120
Let him go back?

580
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,260
Exactly.

581
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,640
This is the first step.

582
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,180
And then gather
the heroes of martial world

583
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,140
to collaborate,

584
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,500
so that our emperor will understand

585
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,820
we can make them retreat without a fight

586
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,740
and avoid the war

587
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,260
for the common people.

588
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,800
It also proves our chivalrous spirit.

589
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,840
I may not be extremely

590
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,520
talented and capable,

591
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,660
I always uphold the principles

592
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,640
of loyalty and righteousness.

593
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,440
Did you say that

594
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,900
to test me

595
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,360
on purpose?

596
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,120
Sort of.

597
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,840
It appears that

598
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,120
I am simply not satisfied.

599
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,740
The Song Dynasty is already in decline.

600
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,120
What benefits are there
to resist the Jins?

601
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,740
In the end, we will only

602
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,560
perish tragically.

603
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,020
I thought Mr. Qiu

604
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,460
was warm-hearted person

605
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,440
of integrity.

606
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,460
I didn't expect him

607
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,080
to be so shameless as a person.

608
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,840
(Such strong finger strength.)

609
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,940
(This person's strength is probably)

610
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,280
(comparable to my father's.)

611
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,000
Contradictions of thoughts
defriend people.

612
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,620
With superb martial arts skills,

613
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,280
you won't use that to threaten us, right?

614
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,760
Showing off.

615
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,000
I have long heard of
the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

616
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,580
I've been wanting

617
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,440
to see what you are capable of.

618
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,580
Bring it on!

619
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,420
Zhen'e.

620
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,660
I'll go first.

621
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,720
No need to argue.

622
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,880
You can fight me together.

623
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,260
Come.

624
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,120
Masters, please wait.

625
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,340
You've always

626
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,440
taught me

627
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,980
that a martial artist

628
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,880
should uphold righteousness.

629
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
But as a skilled master,

630
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,600
Mr. Qiu

631
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,480
is thinking about betrayal.

632
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,640
I will challenge you

633
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,720
for my masters first.

634
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,160
- Jing.
- Jing.

635
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,440
You are no match for him.

636
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,120
Good advice is harsh to the ear.

637
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,880
Why bother?

638
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,300
Don't waste

639
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,600
your own life.

640
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,880
Please enlighten me, sir.

641
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,920
I thought it was some
extraordinary martial arts.

642
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,520
Turns out to be just
Through Back Fist Palm.

643
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,300
Stop.

644
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,480
This is incorrect.

645
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,120
My palm technique

646
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,600
seems ordinary,

647
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,700
but I've practiced

648
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,000
and refined it for years.

649
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,160
It confuses the opponent

650
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,280
and kills him unknowingly.

651
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,920
- Jing.
- Jing.

652
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,520
Jing, are you okay?

653
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,980
Old crap,

654
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,820
dared to bully my disciple.

655
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,420
Do you think we're dead?

656
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,260
Masters,

657
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,220
I'm fine.

658
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,100
Let me try again.

659
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,080
You are from the Iron Palm Sect.

660
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,760
Let me take another palm from you.

661
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,820
Jing.

662
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,920
Don't do this.

663
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,500
Hearing you say such words

664
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,000
in front of me

665
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,500
makes me have

666
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,120
a little respect for you.

667
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,200
Since you are determined to die,

668
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,800
I will grant your wish.

669
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,640
No need to force yourself.

670
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,200
You can fall down now.

671
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,180
Rong.

672
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,260
Masters.

673
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,720
This old man's martial arts are mediocre.

674
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,540
It's fine if he doesn't hit me.

675
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,460
But after this palm,

676
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,520
he revealed his weakness.

677
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,240
Those are just some superficial moves.

678
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,120
What did I say?

679
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,820
I actually thought

680
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,600
you were some kind of hero.

681
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,060
Turns out

682
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,520
you're just a liar.

683
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,720
I just pitied him

684
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,320
for being young

685
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,240
and immature.

686
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,480
So I retracted 90 percent of my power.

687
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,000
Otherwise he would be
either dead or seriously wounded.

688
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,080
Take care of yourself.

689
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,600
Take a palm from me.

690
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,640
I have not asked for your name.

691
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,120
Mei Chaofeng.

692
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,720
We meet again.

693
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,440
Enough with the greetings.

694
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,280
I am already blind in both eyes.

695
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,020
And Xuanfeng

696
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,120
was killed.

697
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,160
Are you satisfied now?

698
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,560
(Lord Lu is indeed
a disciple of my father.)

699
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,460
Who killed Senior Chen?

700
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,480
Have you avenged him?

701
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,280
I am searching for them everywhere.

702
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,500
Okay.

703
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,400
Well, in that case,

704
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,120
I will help you find the murderer.

705
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,240
After you avenge him,

706
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,480
we can settle our old accounts.

707
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,220
No.

708
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,600
Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

709
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,980
Be careful.

710
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,160
She carries poison in her hands.

711
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,580
Jing.

712
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,580
Since you're so skilled,

713
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,500
why not stay and watch the battle?

714
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,400
You could give some advice.

715
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,860
Advice?

716
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,240
How ridiculous.

717
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,280
Their master is dead.

718
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,720
What's the point
of talking about revenge here?

719
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,200
What did you say?

720
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,660
I said it hurts.

721
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,420
What did you say?

722
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,260
Huang Yaoshi is dead.

723
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,280
Who killed him?

724
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,580
Seven Immortals of Quanzhen.

725
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,420
Who killed Master?

726
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,260
I...

727
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,680
Let me say it one last time.

728
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,820
Seven Immortals of Quanzhen

729
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,400
under Wang Chongyang.

730
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,440
Is what you said

731
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,740
all true?

732
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,400
I always speak and act cautiously.

733
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,880
How could I joke about this?

734
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,000
It just happened.

735
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,740
Master.

736
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,920
I will charge into Zhongnan Mountain

737
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,120
and destroy the Quanzhen School.

738
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,880
Is my father dead?

739
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,100
Rong.

740
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,680
It can't be true.

741
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,400
I will accompany you

742
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,680
to go back to Peach Blossom Island.

743
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,960
Miss Huang.

744
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,880
I didn't expect you to be...

745
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,720
Why am I so ignorant?

746
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,460
Except for the people
of Peach Blossom Island,

747
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,440
who else would know
the Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pill?

748
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,940
Junior sister.

749
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,720
I will go find
the Seven Immortals of Quanzhen

750
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,480
to avenge Master.

751
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,860
Lu Chengfeng.

752
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,200
Let's go now.

753
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,240
We won't come back

754
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,480
until we avenge him.
