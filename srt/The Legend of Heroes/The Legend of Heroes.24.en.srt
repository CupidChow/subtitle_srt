1
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,680
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,580
Since the fall of the Central Plains,

4
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,720
foreign invasions have plagued us.

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,700
I took up arms
in the north of the Yellow River,

6
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,730
rising from Xiangtai.

7
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,990
I joined the troop when I was young.

8
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,190
I have taken part in over 200 battles.

9
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,270
It's truly General Yue's

10
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,260
powerful handwriting.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,000
What's going on?

12
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,800
Why are you setting fire to the mountain?

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,730
How could we burn ourselves?

14
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,400
It must be your brother's

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,260
devious plans

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,500
setting fire to the mountain to force us down.

17
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,570
Not good, the fire is spreading.

18
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,780
We can't stay here.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,760
- Qiu Qianzhang.
- What should I do?

20
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,530
Ask your brother to put out the fire.

21
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,870
He surely wouldn't

22
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,430
let his brother burn to death.

23
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,300
He absolutely would.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,120
If he knew I went to the forbidden area,

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,270
he would refuse to save me

26
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,800
and he'd roast me alive.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
Hard to say.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,830
Let's go to the top of the Zhongzhi Peak.

29
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,670
Let's go.

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,760
Count me in.

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,130
Maybe we can take care of each other.

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,040
I didn't expect

33
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,360
that I'm

34
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,180
the first one to step in

35
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,410
the heavily guarded forbidden area

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,090
of the Iron Palm Gang.

37
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,780
Oh, Qianren.

38
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,140
Even though you are skilled,

39
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,100
you're still a step behind me.

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,860
I didn't expect that we would die here.

41
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,700
But thankfully, you're here with me.

42
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,580
Jing.

43
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,900
You're finally a step behind me.

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,660
I'll always be with you, Rong.

45
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,340
A step behind me!

46
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,660
The white eagles?

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,460
The white eagles.

48
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,060
Those two birds

49
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,220
are not bigger than my face.

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,620
How can they save you?

51
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,340
That lad's lightness skill

52
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,060
could be on par with mine.

53
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,460
Count me in.

54
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,860
Rong.

55
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,940
How do you feel?

56
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,020
Your friends from the grasslands

57
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,860
are loyal to you.

58
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,220
No.

59
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,340
The Iron Palm Gang is here.

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,420
Let's head that way.

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,660
We have to try our luck, Rong.

62
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,300
Why do we stop?

63
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,700
Ahead is the Miasma Forest

64
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,260
filled with foul air

65
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,300
and poisonous insects.

66
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,340
Anyone entering it faces near certain death.

67
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,020
It's okay to stop.

68
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,820
But they are hard to kill.

69
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,940
We need to ensure they're dead.

70
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,060
You're right.

71
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,900
If you aren't afraid of death,

72
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,860
you can go chase them.

73
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,980
Wait, Rong.

74
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,060
I clearly saw

75
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,340
the house is this way.

76
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
Where is it now?

77
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,540
Jing.

78
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,060
You walk around.

79
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,980
Let me have a look.

80
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,860
Someone has set up a formation here.

81
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,060
Turn left.

82
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,420
Now go to the right.

83
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,580
This formation

84
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,020
is like one place of

85
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,940
Peach Blossom Island.

86
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,620
I wonder what connection the owner

87
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,740
of this place has with Peach Blossom Island.

88
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,100
Jing.

89
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,980
I see. It's right ahead.

90
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,100
Right ahead?

91
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,740
Okay. Hold on tight.

92
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,580
Come down. Rong.

93
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
Is anyone home?

94
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,660
Why is it so quiet?

95
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
We're just passing by.

96
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,260
May we come in and rest for a while?

97
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,700
Since you could reach this place,

98
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,540
you must have the ability to enter.

99
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,020
Do I have to come out to greet you?

100
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,060
Jing, let's go in.

101
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,060
Okay.

102
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,140
Let's go.

103
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,260
Here. Slowly.

104
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,060
Easy.

105
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,940
Rong.

106
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,100
Sorry for stopping by.

107
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,860
Could we have some water?

108
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,300
Careful, Rong. Slowly.

109
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,540
These bamboo roots are like abacus beads,

110
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,060
arranged in division, multiplication,
subtraction, and addition.

111
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,020
It's calculating

112
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,900
the square root of 55,225.

113
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,500
It's 235.

114
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,300
(Yinggu, Divine Mathematician)

115
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,260
You're severely injured.

116
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,340
Don't just give me any anwer.

117
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,060
Whether it's correct,

118
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,260
you can check the calculation.

119
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,380
It was just a lucky guess.

120
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,100
These beads

121
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,660
are arranged in a way

122
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,060
for root extraction.

123
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,100
So You are

124
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,060
calculating the cube root

125
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,380
of 34,012,224?

126
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,620
It's easy to see the question.

127
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,460
But can you calculate it?

128
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,420
It's 324.

129
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,420
Follow me.

130
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,060
Little girl.

131
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,020
Do you know these?

132
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,820
This is Tianyuan Method
in Computational Canons.

133
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,660
Quite a challenging math problem.

134
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,820
It's complex,

135
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,460
but I can handle it.

136
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,620
Done. What do you think?

137
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
You solved it so quickly.

138
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,980
There are 19 unknowns in this method.

139
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,540
And there are

140
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,340
19 single characters

141
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,900
used to represent

142
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,380
the ninth power

143
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,900
and negative ninth power

144
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,420
of each unknown.

145
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
I got stuck when I calculated

146
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,820
the 19th unknown.

147
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,380
These problems took me days to solve,

148
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,940
but I still couldn't figure them out.

149
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,700
How could you solve them

150
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,900
at a glance...

151
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,220
Yinggu, Divine Mathematician,

152
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,300
sorry for interrupting you.

153
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,260
Two thieves, a man and a woman,

154
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,500
entered your place.

155
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,340
They are my gang's enemies.

156
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,340
I hope you can help us catch them.

157
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,180
You're in big trouble.

158
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,220
Even Qiu Qianren comes

159
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,100
to get you in person.

160
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,180
Who are you?

161
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,380
We...

162
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,860
I can guess you must have

163
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,740
a connection with Hong Qigong,

164
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,780
Nine Fingered Divine Beggar.

165
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,340
We are Qigong's apprentices.

166
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,060
Senior,

167
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,020
my love interest just take over

168
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,700
the new chief of Beggars' Gang in Yuezhou.

169
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,220
But she was injured
by Qiu Qianren for trespassing

170
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,300
into their forbidden area.

171
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,980
So we came here to seek refuge.

172
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,900
If you have any ties with

173
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,340
the Iron Palm Gang and can't help us,

174
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,500
we will leave immediately.

175
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,980
Young man.

176
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,140
If you don't want

177
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,020
this girl to die outside,

178
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,060
you should follow my lead.

179
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,260
People can't come and go

180
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,620
as they please in my Black Swamp.

181
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,460
I'll take care of them.

182
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,900
You can go.

183
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,420
Thank you, Yinggu.

184
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,660
Senior, how is she?

185
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,780
Hard to treat.

186
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,660
This girl is clever.

187
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,300
I wanted to give you some anesthetic

188
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,900
to lessen your pain.

189
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,220
But now,

190
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,700
it's unnecessary.

191
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,380
Give it back.

192
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,620
Bear with it.

193
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,940
Senior,

194
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,060
she is gravely injured.

195
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,500
There's no need to anger her.

196
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,740
She was hurt by

197
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,860
Qiu Qianren's Iron Palm.

198
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,620
She'll die in a few days.

199
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,740
Not even gods can save her.

200
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,500
Even if you won't help us,

201
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,940
please don't

202
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,020
frighten us

203
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,900
with harsh words.

204
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Rong, I'll take you to see a doctor.

205
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,980
How can I let you two younglings

206
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,100
come and go as you please?

207
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,660
Senior, why are you being so unreasonable?

208
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,340
I've been hiding here

209
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,020
for over ten years,

210
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,460
diligently practicing high-level martial arts,

211
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,020
and hoping to save someone
after mastering them.

212
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,340
But now, I can't even

213
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,300
beat a kid.

214
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,180
Have all my years of hardship

215
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,820
been for nothing?

216
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,660
Senior,

217
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
I don't want to fight.

218
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,340
Please forgive me

219
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,340
and let us go.

220
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,460
Where can you go?

221
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,180
This girl was injured by the Iron Palm,

222
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,780
and poisoned by the miasma in the forest.

223
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,060
Her face is already showing dark aura.

224
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,780
The poison will reach her heart in three days.

225
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,540
Don't act rashly. Or she'll die.

226
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
Three days...

227
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,900
Rong.

228
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,820
How are you feeling?

229
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
Jing.

230
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,500
I feel terrible.

231
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,860
Jing.

232
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,100
Stay with me for three days,

233
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,500
and don't leave me for a moment,

234
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,340
okay?

235
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,100
Okay.

236
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,980
I won't leave you, Rong.

237
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,180
I won't let that happen to you.

238
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,860
But if

239
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,700
this injury truly proves fatal,

240
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,620
I'll accompany you

241
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,140
on the path to the afterlife.

242
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,980
Okay?

243
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,260
I wanted

244
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,140
to try to save her.

245
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,420
But if you keep wasting time

246
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,580
with all this weeping,

247
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,060
even a divine doctor

248
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,740
wouldn't be able to help.

249
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,860
Rong.

250
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,020
Stay.

251
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,220
Please tell me

252
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,220
how to save Rong.

253
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,060
If you can save her,

254
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,380
I'll do anything for you.

255
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,820
How can I save people?

256
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,780
If I can do that,

257
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,100
why would I be suffering

258
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,620
in this damp and cold place?

259
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,180
Then what's the way to save her?

260
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,340
Only one person

261
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,180
in the world

262
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,780
can save her.

263
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,660
But we don't know whether the person

264
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,660
is willing to help.

265
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,700
Who is that?

266
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
I'll go find him right now.

267
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,420
I'll beg him.

268
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,780
He wouldn't refuse to save her...

269
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,180
How do you know that?

270
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,300
Ignoring the suffering of others
is human nature.

271
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Everyone can beg others.

272
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,620
But in this world,

273
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,900
who can be moved by desperate pleas?

274
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,860
After leaving the forest,

275
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,020
you should avoid the Iron Palm Gang

276
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,860
and head northeast.

277
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,420
When you arrive at Taoyuan County,

278
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,180
open the white pouch.

279
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,100
Then you'll know

280
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,380
what you should do next.

281
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Don't open it

282
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,020
until you arrive.

283
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,980
You should go now.

284
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,460
She can't hold on much longer.

285
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,420
It's all up to your fate now.

286
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
Thank you, Senior.

287
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,380
Rong.

288
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,420
Let's go.

289
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,980
- Jing.
- Rong.

290
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,540
My chest hurts.

291
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,460
Give me a Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pill.

292
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,300
Okay.

293
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,940
Here.

294
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,020
Are these Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pills?

295
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,180
Let me have a look.

296
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,060
It's a sacred medicine of Peach Blossom Island.

297
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,300
How did you get it?

298
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,140
Rong is the daughter

299
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,140
of Master Huang.

300
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,340
You are Old Heretic Huang's daughter?

301
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,100
If you are my father's enemy,

302
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,580
then we won't take

303
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,820
these pouches.

304
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,700
Never mind.

305
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,460
You should go.

306
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,380
Since I've given you the pouches,

307
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,700
this is all I can do to help.

308
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,620
Little girl,

309
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,860
did your father ever tell you that the weak

310
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,060
can't tolerate nourishment?

311
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,260
Though it is a sacred medicine,

312
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,540
it can be detrimental to your injury.

313
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,860
Do not take it anymore.

314
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,540
Thank you, Senior.

315
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,220
(Taoyuan County)

316
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,300
Rong. We're here.

317
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,860
What does the pouch say?

318
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,660
Here it is.

319
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,780
It's a hand-drawn map.

320
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,580
We should keep going ahead

321
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,700
to a river.

322
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,900
When we get there,

323
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,940
open the red pouch.

324
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,620
Here we are.

325
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,020
It's a note.

326
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,940
Jing.

327
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
Read it to me.

328
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,500
Only Emperor Duan

329
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,700
can save the girl.

330
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,780
Emperor Duan?

331
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,740
My father talked about him.

332
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,940
He is the Southern Emperor of Five Greats,

333
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,740
the Emperor of Dali.

334
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,060
But Dali is very far

335
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,020
from here.

336
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,300
How can we make it in three days?

337
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,300
Don't worry about that.

338
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,620
We have more here.

339
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,460
Listen.

340
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,420
The Southern Emperor stays hidden in Taoyuan.

341
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,980
It's difficult for outsiders to meet him.

342
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,740
And don't even say that

343
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,660
you come for medical help.

344
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,900
You must say that you're under your master

345
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,820
Hong Qigong's order

346
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,580
to meet Emperor Duan for an important message.

347
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
Once you meet the Southern Emperor,

348
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,460
hand over the map in the yellow pouch.

349
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,060
So the Southern Emperor is here.

350
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,540
Let's go find him.

351
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,980
Master.

352
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,740
Benefactors,

353
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,980
may I help you?

354
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,460
We're here to see Emperor Duan.

355
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,940
Please direct us to him.

356
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,980
Emperor Duan has left this world.

357
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,820
I'm sorry.

358
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,860
How come? That's not possible.

359
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
He is here as a master,

360
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,540
not as the influential

361
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,780
Emperor Duan of Dali.

362
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,020
Young master, am I right?

363
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,540
Do you have an appointment with my master?

364
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,260
I hope he can meet us for the sake

365
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,420
of Nine Fingered Divine Beggar

366
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,660
and Peach Blossom Island.

367
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,740
Please give this

368
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,820
to your master.

369
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,260
Benefactors, please follow me.

370
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,780
Let's go.

371
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,220
Rong, slowly.

372
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,020
- I'm Huang Rong.
- I'm Guo Jing.

373
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,780
- Kowtow to Uncle Duan.
- Kowtow to Uncle Duan.

374
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,780
Emperor Duan has long left the world.

375
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
I'm a monk

376
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,460
(Duan Zhixing, Southern Emperor)

377
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,740
named Yideng.

378
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,420
How did you get injured so badly?

379
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,500
Here. Get up.

380
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,300
Qiu Qianren did this to her.

381
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,620
Reverend,

382
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,340
please save Rong.

383
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,020
Don't worry.

384
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,780
I can heal her.

385
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,300
Thank you, Uncle Duan.

386
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,660
Thank you, Reverend.

387
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,140
Thank you, Reverend.

388
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,380
Buddha blesses you.

389
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,260
As a monk, it's my duty.

390
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,180
Girl.

391
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,060
Relax your body.

392
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,740
Even if you feel unbearably hurt and itchy,

393
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,020
you can't use your inner strength to resist.

394
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,580
Okay.

395
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,540
I'll pretend to be dead later.

396
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,140
You talk like your father.

397
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,340
Alright, let's begin.

398
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,260
(Buddha)

399
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,140
Master.

400
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,460
Rong.

401
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,700
How are you feeling?

402
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,460
Rong?

403
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,540
Jing.

404
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,820
Where's the fire?

405
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,220
Where's the ice?

406
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,580
What are you taking about?

407
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,740
Jing.

408
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,140
I had a horrible dream.

409
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,100
I saw Ouyang Feng,

410
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,940
Ouyang Ke,

411
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,180
and Qiu Qianren.

412
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,580
They roasted me

413
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,740
over a fire.

414
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,180
And they froze me.

415
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,980
- I was so scared.
- Don't worry.

416
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,820
It's okay now.

417
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,340
That was

418
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,620
Uncle Duan healing you.

419
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,940
That's great.

420
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,420
That's great.

421
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,060
Uncle Duan?

422
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,500
Uncle Duan.

423
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,740
Uncle Duan.

424
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,580
Uncle Duan.

425
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,140
Thank you for saving Rong.

426
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,500
How are you feeling?

427
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
I'm fine.

428
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,700
Rong.

429
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,780
You are healed.

430
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,220
You should go back and have some rest.

431
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,660
Don't running around.

432
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,580
Jing.

433
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,620
Take Rong back.

434
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,740
Now,

435
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,300
I need to rest too.

436
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,980
You exhausted

437
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,420
a lot of energy to heal me.

438
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,260
Please take

439
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,020
Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pill

440
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
made according to my father's recipe.

441
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
That year,

442
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,300
at Duel atop Mount Hua,

443
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,580
we all exhausted our energy.

444
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,260
Your father used these pills

445
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,300
to help us recover.

446
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,420
These pills

447
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,260
are precious.

448
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,340
I'll take two.

449
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,180
Uncle Duan.

450
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,940
I want to give you

451
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,100
all the magic pills

452
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,060
in the world.

453
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,860
Jing.

454
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,060
Promise me one thing.

455
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,500
Reverend.

456
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,500
Anything you say.

457
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,460
Do not tell anyone

458
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,860
that you came to see me,

459
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,300
not even your master.

460
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,660
And you

461
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,020
don't come here again.

462
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,620
I will

463
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
be moving soon.

464
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,060
Where will you move to?

465
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,740
How are we going to visit you?

466
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,580
Jing.

467
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,660
Uncle Duan is revealing his location

468
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,940
to heal me.

469
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,700
That's why he's moving.

470
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,500
Master. Master!

471
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,180
- Master!
- Uncle Duan.

472
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,020
Reverend.

473
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,540
Rong.

474
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,780
Are these pills

475
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,500
made by your father?

476
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,140
They were made by my senior Lu Chengfeng,

477
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,500
according to my father's recipe.

478
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
Did your father

479
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,660
tell you

480
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,620
that taking too many of these pills

481
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,340
can be harmful?

482
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,540
Are these pills poisonous?

483
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,300
Master exhausted his energy

484
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,180
to heal you.

485
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,020
But you repay him with poison!

486
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,220
Impossible.

487
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,820
My father said

488
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,820
the more one takes, the better.

489
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,300
It's complicated to make them.

490
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,500
My father only saves them
for special occasions.

491
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,340
It's not your fault.

492
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,700
Quick.

493
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,540
Go to the backyard and find my junior.

494
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,860
Yes.

495
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,620
- Uncle Duan!
- Reverend!

496
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,900
(Universal mercy and succor)

497
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,660
Uncle Duan.

498
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,780
How are you feeling?

499
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,020
I'm fine.

500
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,300
My junior is an antidote expert

501
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,500
from India.

502
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,300
This poison

503
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,180
won't take my life.

504
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,380
Reverend.

505
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,860
Rong and I didn't know

506
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,340
those pills were poisonous.

507
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,540
We've taken them before,

508
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,740
but nothing happened.

509
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,260
Of course I know

510
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,860
you didn't poison me.

511
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,540
Did Yinggu

512
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,060
give you this painting?

513
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,300
Yes.

514
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,740
Yinggu told us

515
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,820
to say we're here to see you,

516
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,820
but not

517
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,140
for the medical help.

518
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,140
She also said to

519
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,900
talk only about Qigong, not about her.

520
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,660
This painting

521
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,540
depicts Shibi Jataka cutting his flesh

522
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,620
to save a dove.

523
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,620
She urged me

524
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,260
to heal Rong.

525
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
She also predicted

526
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,020
that I would be weakened for this,

527
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,540
and you would give me medicine.

528
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,380
I see.

529
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,940
She held the bottle

530
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,940
of Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pills

531
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,700
for a while before returning it to me.

532
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,780
Right,

533
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,340
she also told me

534
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,300
I've been injured,

535
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,620
and cannot take the pills.

536
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,380
Yes.

537
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,820
It seems

538
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,420
she poisoned the pills.

539
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,820
You scoundrels.

540
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,300
Are you here on that madwoman's orders

541
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,260
to harm Master?

542
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,580
Master.

543
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,140
It's not their fault.

544
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,300
I should suffer through this in my life.

545
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,260
Since it's Yinggu,

546
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,180
I'll consider it

547
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,700
the end of our karma.

548
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,460
The end of your karma?

549
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,220
I have only myself

550
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,060
to blame for all of this.

551
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
(22 years ago)

552
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,940
That year

553
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,700
after Duel atop Mount Hua,

554
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,940
Nine Yin Manual

555
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,300
was kept by Taoist Wang of Quanzhen School.

556
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,220
He worried about being unable

557
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,180
to resist Ouyang Feng

558
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,660
from taking the manual.

559
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,580
So I taught him Yiyang Finger

560
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,140
and he taught me First Heaven Skill
in Dali Palace.

561
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,300
Wang Chongyang

562
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,420
came to Dali

563
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,100
with Zhou Botong.

564
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,860
He roamed the palace all day long

565
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,820
out of boredom.

566
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,620
Until one day,

567
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,460
he came across Consort Liu,

568
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,300
my favorite concubine.

569
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,900
You can't practice martial arts like this.

570
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,060
I'm here.

571
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,740
Here. Here. Here.

572
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
Who are you?

573
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,460
Why are you sitting on the elephant?

574
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,340
I train elephants.

575
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,740
Be good!

576
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,940
I'm practicing martial arts

577
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,580
for my leg lightness skill.

578
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,700
There's such a marvelous method?

579
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,740
Of course.

580
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,900
Aren't you afraid

581
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
sitting so high up?

582
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,140
Little maid,

583
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,540
you know nothing.

584
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,020
Little maid?

585
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,980
A maid can

586
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,100
practice martial arts in Dali Palace.

587
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,780
Impressive. Impressive.

588
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
But your martial arts is poor.

589
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,100
Is your martial arts good?

590
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,580
Of course.

591
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,580
My senior is Wang Chongyang,

592
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,220
the best in the martial world.

593
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,540
We practice authentic

594
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,580
martial arts from the Taoist Quanzhen School.

595
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,140
What do you think?

596
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,300
Since you're impressive,

597
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,060
can you teach me?

598
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,660
Of course... not.

599
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
Then don't.

600
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,980
Anyway, your senior is impressive,

601
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,900
not you.

602
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,860
I'm impressive too!

603
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,740
I'll teach you.

604
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,660
What do you want to learn?

605
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,980
Not anymore.

606
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,220
I'll teach you for sure.

607
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,060
Tell me.

608
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,100
Touch of Death.

609
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,500
Heard of it?

610
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,340
You're so silly.

611
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,660
I'll teach you a simple move.

612
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,620
Here.

613
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,140
Here.

614
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,020
Don't laugh.

615
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,220
Zhou Botong practiced

616
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,470
- Youthful Skills.
- Do you want to learn?

617
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,940
He had never been physical with a woman.

618
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,220
Consort Liu was naive and lively,

619
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,580
- not shy about being with him.
- Stop!

620
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,460
- They kept poking and touching,
- Don't run!

621
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,820
gradually opening up to each other

622
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,420
- and becoming inseparable.
- You can't get me!

623
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,460
- Zhou Botong was lively and playful,
- Stop!

624
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,980
quite different from me,

625
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,260
the Emperor of Dali,

626
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,340
giving Consort Liu

627
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,100
a sense of novelty.

628
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,940
You treat me so well.

629
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,180
I have something

630
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,220
for you.

631
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,380
Here.

632
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,900
What is it?

633
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,060
My junior has always been carefree.

634
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,740
I never expected him

635
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,860
to do such a disgraceful thing.

636
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,780
Since he confessed everything

637
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,620
to me,

638
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,980
I'm here to ask Emperor Duan for punishment.

639
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,860
Taoist Wang.

640
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,380
Dali has gotten along well

641
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,900
with the Quanzhen School.

642
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,980
We can't

643
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,260
ruin our friendship

644
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,020
because of a woman.

645
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,100
Guards.

646
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,060
Untie him.

647
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,140
Zhou Botong.

648
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,100
Don't come to Dali.

649
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,380
But we always

650
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,580
welcome the Quanzhen School.

651
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,020
Your Majesty.

652
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,260
This is all my fault.

653
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,740
Please punish me alone.

654
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,100
Since you two

655
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
truly love each other,

656
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,260
I'll grant your wish.

657
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,140
You can get married.

658
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,980
Then you can go

659
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,060
wherever you want.

660
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,940
Don't come back to Dali.

661
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,580
Emperor Duan,

662
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
I disagree.

663
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,300
I'm deeply ashamed

664
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,700
of doing this.

665
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,340
Emperor Duan sparing my life

666
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,940
is a great mercy.

667
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,140
How can I marry her?

668
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,140
You two think about it.

669
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,860
Marriage is

670
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,020
a lifelong commitment.

671
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,300
I...

672
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,340
I didn't know you are

673
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,540
a concubine.

674
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,700
If I had known,

675
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,700
I wouldn't have done this.

676
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,220
I'm sorry, Emperor Duan.

677
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,420
I'm sorry, Consort Liu.

678
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,780
Botong...

679
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,900
I won't come again.

680
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,140
Never.

681
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

682
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,580
After Zhou Botong left,

683
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,820
Consort Liu stayed in that study

684
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,980
never returning to her chamber.

685
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,780
I didn't visit her for a long time

686
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,540
until I heard

687
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,460
she had given birth

688
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,820
to a boy in the study.

689
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,260
So,

690
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,820
the father is Old Imp?

691
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,820
Back then,

692
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,660
I was obsessed with martial arts

693
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,380
and didn't go to the harem often.

694
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,540
Maybe that's why

695
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,300
Consort Liu fell for Zhou Botong.

696
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,180
But Uncle,

697
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,180
it seems like Consort Liu

698
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,100
betrayed you.

699
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,300
Why do you blame yourself?

700
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,220
That's because...

701
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,700
If you are still mad at me,

702
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,180
you can kill me.

703
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,540
But why did you

704
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,380
harm my child?

705
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,100
What's wrong?

706
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,260
Don't play dumb!

707
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,900
In this heavily guarded palace,

708
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,020
who else

709
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,060
could hate this child so much?

710
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,260
If you are kind,

711
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,900
please save this child.

712
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,140
I'm willing to trade my life

713
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,020
for the child's.

714
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,580
Though the vital channels are severed,

715
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,100
the critical part isn't harmed.

716
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,700
Not fatal.

717
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:42,020
(In spring's green water, grass
and cold depth of dawn, we bathe in red robes.)

718
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,780
In the end,

719
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
I didn't save the child.

720
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,100
All worldly love,

721
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,940
royal power and wealth

722
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,780
are fleeting.

723
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,780
I passed the throne to the Duan heir

724
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,020
and

725
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,020
became a Buddhist monk.

726
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,860
My senior knew

727
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,020
Yinggu lived in Black Swamp, Taoyuan,

728
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,460
and practiced martial arts.

729
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,020
He worried she would lose control,

730
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,580
so he stayed here

731
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,620
to help her secretly.

732
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,820
Uncle Duan,

733
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,340
you've always loved her.

734
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,980
And you can't leave her.

735
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,380
Right?

736
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,820
Master, the person downhill sent this.

737
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,740
(In spring's green water, grass
and cold depth of dawn, we bathe in red robes.)

738
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,380
One wrong step

739
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,340
led to this.

740
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,940
After years of living secluded,

741
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,580
I still

742
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,620
can't get away with this.

743
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I thought

744
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,460
Yinggu wanted to help us.

745
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,500
So she asked us to come here.

746
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,540
However,

747
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,220
we became her tools

748
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,300
for revenge.

749
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,580
Don't worry.

750
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,700
Though I didn't kill

751
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,620
Yinggu's child.

752
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,540
It was my indifference and jealousy

753
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,860
that caused his death.

754
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,880
The grudge between her and me

755
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
has troubled me for years.

756
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,860
Now,

757
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,420
it's over.
