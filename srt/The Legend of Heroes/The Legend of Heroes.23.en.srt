1
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,680
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,620
Brothers of the Beggars' Gang,

4
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,900
we've been dominating the martial world,

5
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,210
but today,

6
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,420
he's come to bully us.

7
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,850
He's here on purpose

8
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,750
to break our Great Song.

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,980
His surname is not Yang,

10
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,950
but Wanyan.

11
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,750
He's the son of Prince Zhao
of the Jin Empire.

12
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,850
You little girl

13
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,440
are slandering people just to survive.

14
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,490
Do you have any evidence?

15
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,700
If you can't provide evidence,

16
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,440
then you must be framing our new master.

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,820
How can we let you go?

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,910
(You don't believe me
when I tell the truth,)

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,790
(then I have to lie.)

20
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,300
Everyone, look!

21
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,180
(Qiu)

22
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,720
This is what I just took

23
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,630
from this Jin person.

24
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,580
This is the token of the Iron Palm Gang.

25
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,670
Why does he have it?

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,720
It's not mine.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,250
You scoundrel, you're framing me.

28
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,600
You have the Dog Beating Staff,

29
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,580
so you want to be the master.

30
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,110
Then why don't you

31
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,480
recognize this token?

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,580
Why don't you acknowledge it?

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,700
Yes, why doesn't he admit it?

34
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,810
Having the token in hand,

35
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,790
he needs to recognize it.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,810
Our Beggars' Gang
has been practicing chivalry

37
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,860
in the north for hundreds of years.

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,910
Why does he want to move to the south

39
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,740
immediately after he takes office?

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,110
This is because
he is a lackey of the Jin Empire.

41
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,110
If you weren't feeling guilty,

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,390
why would you take a cheap shot on me?

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,300
Such a despicable guy

44
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,820
dares to usurp the position of the master

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,740
of the biggest gang in Great Song.

46
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,690
Do you all agree?

47
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,660
No!

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,250
- No!
- Brothers.

49
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,920
- No!
- Brothers.

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,950
Don't get excited.

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,720
If a random token

52
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,420
could frame our master,

53
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,640
wouldn't it be easy for outsiders

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,790
to subvert our Beggars' Gang?

55
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,300
Once we have investigated thoroughly,

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,690
we will definitely give all of you

57
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,580
an explanation.

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,140
Then let me ask you.

59
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,440
When the former master

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,140
passes the position to the new master,

61
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,690
should he teach the new master

62
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,200
the whole set of
Dog Beating Staff Technique?

63
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,530
That's right.

64
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,740
This has been a tradition of our gang.

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Good.

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,320
Wanyan Kang,

67
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,320
you said Qigong didn't teach you

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,410
the complete set of the technique,

69
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,780
at least he should've taught you

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,460
one or two moves.

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,620
Do you know any moves?

72
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
How can you prove

73
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,660
you are using
the Dog Beating Staff Technique?

74
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,300
Then I will use this staff

75
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,900
to beat you.

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,980
This is the Dog Beating Staff technique.

77
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,620
This is the authentic
Dog Beating Staff technique.

78
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,460
Before Qigong passed away,

79
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,740
he didn't have time to teach master Yang

80
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,810
the Dog Beating Staff Technique.

81
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,700
There was a reason for it.

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
It was fair and reasonable.

83
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,540
But we can't tell

84
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,140
if this little girl

85
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,180
showed the real

86
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,260
Dog Beating Staff Technique.

87
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,820
How do you want me to prove it?

88
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,100
Girl.

89
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,260
How about this?

90
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,940
If you can beat us by using

91
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,060
the Dog Beating Staff Technique,

92
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,380
we'll recognize you as our master.

93
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,660
It's a deal.

94
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,860
Please.

95
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,580
This is the Dog Beating Staff technique.

96
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,610
Greetings, master Huang.

97
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,020
Greetings, master Huang.

98
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,220
Master Huang.

99
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,700
Sorry for offending you just now.

100
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,900
I was deceived by Yang Kang.

101
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,580
He has a few words

102
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,900
that I want to pass on to you.

103
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,540
Go ahead.

104
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,180
Elder Peng.

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,660
Rong.

106
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,860
Are you okay?

107
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,540
I'm fine.

108
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,580
Master Huang, please
go to the Xuanyuan Terrace.

109
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:30,100
Master Huang!

110
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,100
Thank you, everyone.

111
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,980
I am just temporarily acting
as the master for Qigong.

112
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,020
In the future, please

113
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,540
support me.

114
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,020
Master Huang inherited the mantle
of the old master,

115
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,100
and is wise and brave.

116
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,940
I dare not disobey your orders.

117
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,220
Elder Jian, Elder Liang.

118
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,740
Please take the disciples
below the eighth tier

119
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,900
to Lin'an

120
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,220
to welcome master Hong.

121
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
Yes.

122
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,900
(Xuanyuan Terrace)

123
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,740
Elder Lu.

124
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,580
Please bury Yu

125
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,500
and Li.

126
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,900
You are seriously injured for our gang.

127
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,620
Please take some time to recover.

128
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,940
While I am not in the gang,

129
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,940
all major and minor matters of the gang

130
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,660
will be decided by Elder Lu.

131
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,300
Where's Wanyan Kang?

132
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
He must have escaped.

133
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,940
From now on,

134
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,820
we must not let this heinous villain go.

135
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,780
Yes, master.

136
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,740
Everyone,

137
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,260
mountains are high and rivers are long.

138
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,380
We will meet again someday.

139
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,980
Farewell, master.

140
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,220
This old swindler and Yang Kang

141
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,580
really are a perfect match.

142
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,740
Why only Qiu is here?

143
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,420
Where's Yang Kang?

144
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,040
Bravo!

145
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,880
Rong.

146
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,860
When I was fighting him

147
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,070
at the Xuanyuan Terrace,

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,100
I found his martial arts skills

149
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
had improved a lot.

150
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,180
Jing.

151
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,900
Don't let him deceive you again.

152
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,220
I've beaten up this old swindler

153
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,060
many times.

154
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,460
I know clearly

155
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,740
what he's capable of.

156
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Now

157
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,820
he can only perform this kind of trick

158
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,420
like pushing an iron cup by a magnet.

159
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
Rong, you must not underestimate him.

160
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,280
Bravo!

161
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,580
This

162
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,540
is the essense

163
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,020
of Iron Palm Gang's internal martial art.

164
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,220
If you're not fated to learn, I won't
teach you no matter how much you pay.

165
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,300
If you're fated to learn,

166
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,460
it costs

167
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,500
one hundred taels.
No counteroffer will be made.

168
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,440
One hundred taels?

169
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,140
Listen to how well he brags.

170
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,070
Don't go.

171
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,060
Once this old swindler sees us,

172
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,020
he runs away.

173
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,460
Jing.

174
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,460
Let's catch up.

175
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,380
Rong.

176
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,460
Stop there.

177
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,340
After we parted in Lin'an,

178
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,500
we met again here unexpectedly.

179
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,500
Fate is truly indescribable.

180
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,180
Kids,

181
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
how have you been?

182
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,340
How have we been?

183
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,580
Parted in Lin'an?

184
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,220
You just want to pretend

185
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,860
what you did
at the Beggars' Gang Assembly

186
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,060
had never happened, right?

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,060
Trying to shirk responsibility?

188
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
It's not that easy.

189
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,020
Someone's coming.

190
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,340
No, no, no.

191
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,180
It hurts.

192
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,120
Hold on.

193
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,180
Speak up and stop playing tricks.

194
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,380
Why is it like this?

195
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,020
Suddenly I feel unbearable pain
in my belly.

196
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,380
I suppose I'm going to defecate again.

197
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,620
It is possible.

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,940
Here it goes again.

199
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,260
Again?

200
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,940
What again?

201
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,780
Well,

202
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,380
how can you fight me when I'm like this?

203
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,260
After all, I'm considered as

204
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,300
a grandmaster.

205
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,140
In case something happens,

206
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,980
the consequences would be unimaginable.

207
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,980
It will be an insult to me.

208
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,110
Even if you win,

209
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,690
it's because you had an unfair advantage.

210
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,980
Why are you always defecating?

211
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,820
I don't allow it.

212
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
Girl.

213
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,280
Is it a bit too much to ask?

214
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,780
For example, one can never

215
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,340
hold the fart.

216
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,580
Those who fart are proud and complacent,

217
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,500
those who smell it
naturally feel discouraged.

218
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,540
Girl.

219
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,140
If you continue
to be unreasonable like this,

220
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,260
I will really be unhappy.

221
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,270
Fine.

222
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,620
I'd like to see

223
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,460
what new tricks do you have.

224
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,700
I have been traveling
in the martial world for decades.

225
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,800
The only thing I care about

226
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,860
is integrity.

227
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,980
I didn't expect after saying so much,

228
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,780
you still don't believe me.

229
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,470
Since that's the case,

230
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,500
to prove my innocence...

231
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,660
What are you doing?

232
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,300
I'm defecating in front of you.

233
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,780
Stop.

234
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,260
Why? Why?

235
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,020
Why?

236
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,180
Do you have to wait

237
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
to find trouble with me

238
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,220
when I'm feeling unwell?

239
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,540
Isn't it nice

240
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,400
to wait until

241
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,500
my body is adjusted

242
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,340
to have a fair duel?

243
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,160
Do you have to take advantage
of people's perilous state

244
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
so you have the confidence to win?

245
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,780
You must be afraid.

246
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,020
Put on your pants first.

247
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,820
What do I have to be afraid?

248
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,660
Okay.

249
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,060
Then in seven days,

250
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,500
meet me at the foot
of Iron Palm Mountain.

251
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,460
Iron Palm Mountain?

252
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,820
(Iron Palm Peak)

253
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,930
Okay, how do we get
to Iron Palm Mountain?

254
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,140
Go to the west from here,

255
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,010
pass through Changde, Chenzhou,

256
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,540
and up the Yuan River.

257
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,590
Between Luxi River and Chenxi River,

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,840
there is a high mountain

259
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,810
in the shape of five fingers.

260
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,580
This mountain is Iron Palm Mountain.

261
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,060
Scared, huh?

262
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,460
It's better to kowtow and apologize now

263
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,460
than waiting until then

264
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,140
to humiliate yourself.

265
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,660
Sure.

266
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,580
Old swindler.

267
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,100
Then it's a deal.

268
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,460
Seven days later,

269
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,860
see you on Iron Palm Mountain.

270
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,180
Courageous.

271
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,980
I hope you will come as promised.

272
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,550
Seems like I have to defecate.

273
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,170
Rong.

274
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,060
We just let him leave like this?

275
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,140
The Iron Palm Mountain he mentioned

276
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,540
should be the one in the painting.

277
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,010
Yes.

278
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,350
It is clear in the painting

279
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,710
that the Book of Wumu

280
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,500
is in the second section

281
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,260
of the peak in the middle...

282
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,020
Could there be some mystery behind it?

283
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
Now, Senior Qu's painting

284
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,450
has already been taken away
by Yang Kang.

285
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,100
I guess they should have seen

286
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,940
the words on it too.

287
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,660
So we have to get there before them.

288
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,740
Then let's go to Iron Palm Mountain.

289
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,500
Father,

290
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,220
I have let you down

291
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,940
and failed.

292
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,780
It's good that you came back safely.

293
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,100
Please forgive me, Father.

294
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,620
Although this time you didn't
lead the Beggars' Gang

295
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,740
to head south,

296
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,020
you achieved something.

297
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,620
You found out the whereabouts
of the Book of Wumu.

298
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
That's the most important thing
at the moment.

299
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,460
You promised me

300
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,140
to avenge Ke.

301
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,500
Why not make a quick decision

302
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,180
and kill Guo Jing and Huang Rong?

303
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,380
Maybe that wicked couple

304
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,260
are fated not to die.

305
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,580
Please rest assured, Master.

306
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,660
One day, I will kill them for sure.

307
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,070
Mr. Ouyang, please don't be angry.

308
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,780
Kang did want to kill them

309
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,800
at Xuanyuan Terrace.

310
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,260
But there were some unexpected changes.

311
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,230
It's a pity.

312
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,740
I thought

313
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,220
after you went to the Beggars' Gang,

314
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,140
you wanted to repent

315
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,500
and start anew.

316
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,380
So I came to Yuezhou with you.

317
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,860
But I didn't expect

318
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,380
you not only deceived me

319
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,620
but also used me.

320
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,900
How many times you betrayed my trust?

321
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,900
Now I even betrayed the Beggars' Gang.

322
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,020
You've made me

323
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,940
the foolest person.

324
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,940
Kang.

325
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,380
I have said before

326
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,740
that keeping this woman by your side

327
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,940
will be troublesome sooner or later.

328
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,420
Now,

329
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,980
you put yourself in trouble

330
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,860
and you fix it yourself.

331
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,180
Father.

332
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,380
Nianci and I have gone through
life and death together,

333
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,300
and experienced ups and downs.

334
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,500
She has given everything to me

335
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,420
and kept faith with me.

336
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,980
Please spare her, Father.

337
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,760
You are too soft-hearted

338
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,740
and indecisive,

339
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,460
how can you achieve great things?

340
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,500
Except for you

341
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,500
and my mother,

342
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,780
Nianci is the person
who loves me the most in the world.

343
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,700
If you want me to kill her,

344
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
I can't do it.

345
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,380
Okay.

346
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
For your sake and your mother's sake,

347
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,220
I will spare her one more time.

348
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,700
Thank you, Father.

349
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,780
Nianci, you go back first.

350
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,880
I will come find you.

351
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,870
Stop messing around.

352
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,170
Wanyan Kang.

353
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,820
I, Mu Nianci,

354
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,820
will cut ties with you

355
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,780

the both of you.

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,180
Father.

381
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,420
♪No room for regrets♪

382
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,990
♪I won't give myself time to regret♪

383
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
Here you are.

384
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,700
Two bowls of Yangchun noodles.

385
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,220
Please enjoy.

386
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,260
Sir,

387
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,820
how far it is

388
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,740
to Iron Palm Mountain?

389
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,660
Where?

390
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,060
Iron Palm Mountain.

391
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,580
I won't ask for your money.

392
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,020
You can take it for free.

393
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,420
Sir.

394
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,420
Why are you so nervous?

395
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
You must be very familiar
with Iron Palm Mountain.

396
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,500
Girl.

397
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,180
Keep it down.

398
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,060
A radius of dozens of miles here

399
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,580
is the territory of the Iron Palm Gang.

400
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,900
We can't talk about it.

401
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,020
Please tell me more about it

402
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,780
and this silver ingot will be yours.

403
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,580
Alright, I'll say.

404
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,380
I advise you

405
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,780
not to go there.

406
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,740
There are a bunch of fierce guys

407
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,900
living on Iron Palm Mountain.

408
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,860
They rob houses

409
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,860
and bully people.

410
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,300
They do nothing but evil.

411
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,100
Anyone who approaches Iron Palm Peak

412
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,380
will not survive.

413
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,060
Is it true that

414
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,620
the Iron Palm Mountain has five peaks

415
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,700
like the palm of a human hand?

416
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,940
Yes.

417
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,420
Those five mountain peaks

418
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,100
are really strange.

419
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,660
How strange?

420
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,500
Those five peaks

421
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,380
are arranged

422
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,060
just like five fingers,

423
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,660
with the middle one the highest,

424
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,500
with the peaks on both sides
descending in order.

425
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,180
But that's not the strangest part.

426
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,080
What's even more peculiar is

427
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,460
each of its peaks
is divided into three sections,

428
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,180
just like the joints of fingers.

429
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,540
Isn't it strange?

430
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,100
(Iron Palm Mountain)

431
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,580
Your gang is called Iron Palm Gang.

432
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,900
Is it named after Iron Palm Mountain?

433
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,100
Right.

434
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Master Qiu is a local here

435
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,420
on Iron Palm Mountain?

436
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,860
No.

437
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,380
I am from Jiangnan.

438
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,980
How did you become the master

439
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,020
of the Iron Palm Gang?

440
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,980
It started with General Han Shizhong.

441
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,820
Han Shizhong?

442
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,780
The general who fought against

443
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,300
the Jin Empire with Yue Fei?

444
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,660
That's right.

445
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,860
General Han was brave
and skilled in battle,

446
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,300
equally famous as Yue Fei.

447
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,660
Just because he refused to align

448
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,540
with the then Prime Minister Qin Hui,

449
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,460
and opposed to making peace
with the Jin Empire,

450
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,340
he was stripped of military power
by the Imperial Court.

451
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,220
So that's how it is.

452
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,300
What is the relationship

453
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,300
with General Han Shizhong and your gang?

454
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,260
General Han had a fierce general

455
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,380
called Shangguan Jiannan.

456
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,140
He was my mentor.

457
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,020
Originally from the Iron Palm Gang,

458
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,820
he later led his old brothers

459
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,100
to return to Iron Palm Mountain

460
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,140
and succeed as the thirteenth master.

461
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
It seems like

462
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,580
your gang and the Jin Empire

463
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,540
were not on good terms.

464
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,260
My mentor's subordinates

465
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,500
were staunch anti-Jin soldiers,

466
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,300
loyal and fearless,

467
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,980
facing death unflinchingly.

468
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,980
It's a pity

469
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,500
that the treacherous minister

470
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,240
put the loyal souls to death.

471
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,400
Hearing just a few words,

472
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,240
one can tell it is our dynasty.

473
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,820
Corrupted and incompetent,
unable to distinguish loyalty and treachery.

474
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,660
Tell me,

475
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,940
why should I save

476
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,140
a court like this?

477
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,220
Even such loyal and courageous people

478
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,060
like Yue Fei

479
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,140
and Han Shizhong

480
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,340
could not be tolerated.

481
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,380
How could they tolerate the common people?

482
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,500
Whether they were unfilial

483
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,350
or disloyal...

484
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,260
Master Qiu, you need to move on

485
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,100
from the past.

486
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,620
A fine fowl perches only on a fine tree.

487
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,820
The heroes believed

488
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,140
the Song Dynasty was desperate,

489
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,980
that's why they placed their hopes
on our Jin Empire

490
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,140
to unify the world
and bring benefits to the people.

491
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,340
Too much.

492
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,940
The common people

493
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,300
have their own destiny.

494
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,900
I just want to protect

495
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,300
our gang

496
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,620
and seek prosperity for my brothers.

497
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,580
Sixth Prince,

498
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,380
do you agree?

499
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,180
(Iron Palm Mountain)

500
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,020
Rong.

501
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,020
What should we do with these people?

502
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,900
Forcing our way through
is definitely not an option.

503
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,900
How about we come back at night?

504
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,300
Don't worry.

505
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,340
We will just walk in

506
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,180
fair and square.

507
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,400
They won't stop us.

508
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,320
Stop.

509
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,050
Who are you

510
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,500
to break into the Iron Palm Gang's gate?

511
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,420
(Qiu)

512
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,220
You guys keep an eye on the gate.

513
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,060
Do not be careless.

514
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,350
Yes.

515
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,970
Let's go.

516
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,340
Rong.

517
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,860
Just as you said,

518
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,940
they have seen through the secret
of the painting

519
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,820
and also came.

520
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,740
After all, they're in cahoots

521
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
with the swindler Qiu.

522
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,420
They're much freer to come and go here.

523
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,500
Let's find a way

524
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,380
to look for the Book of Wumu.

525
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,500
Let's go.

526
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
Father,

527
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,460
this Iron Palm Mountain
is quite picturesque.

528
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,130
Look.

529
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,500
On every peak,

530
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,970
there are several
straight mountain paths,

531
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,740
just like the joints on our fingers.

532
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,260
Right.

533
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,540
As shown in this painting,
it is in the joint of the finger.

534
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,500
The second knuckle
of the middle finger peak.

535
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,820
The Book of Wumu is right there.

536
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, Kang,

537
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,700
go ahead and explore the road first.

538
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,500
After all, this is

539
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,620
the territory of the Iron Palm Gang.

540
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,340
If we start

541
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,060
to search extensively,

542
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,580
I'm afraid there will be trouble.

543
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,340
But Father,

544
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,780
didn't you already subdue
the Iron Palm Gang?

545
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,220
The Iron Palm Gang

546
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,020
appeared to have submitted to us,

547
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,620
but these Han people

548
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,980
are too scheming.

549
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,780
They're only interested in money,

550
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,340
not surrendering to us wholeheartedly.

551
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,100
Or why didn't he help you

552
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,580
to become the master

553
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,020
yesterday at the Beggars' Gang?

554
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,860
You're thoughtful, Father.

555
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,060
If Master Qiu changes his mind,

556
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,900
we are unable to escape

557
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,340
trapped in this Iron Palm Mountain.

558
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,420
If we alert the enemy now,

559
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,820
it will be difficult
to go up the mountain again.

560
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,340
In this case,

561
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,020
I'll go and explore the road first.

562
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,820
(Forbidden Area of Iron Palm Mountain)

563
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,660
Stop.

564
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,380
Up from here

565
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,080
is the forbidden area in our gang.

566
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,180
(Forbidden Area of Iron Palm Mountain)
No one is allowed to enter.

567
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,540
I see the scenery here is picturesque,

568
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,740
with many birds flying.

569
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,380
Just now there was a rare

570
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,340
budgerigar.

571
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,180
So beautiful.

572
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,620
It seems to have flown over.

573
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,660
Let me go see...

574
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,340
Anyone for any reason

575
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,460
can't go up the mountain from here.

576
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,580
Even if the master of our gang

577
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,420
can't go through here.

578
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,820
I am an honored guest
of the master of the gang,

579
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,060
the son of the Sixth Prince

580
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,940
of the Jin Empire.

581
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
I just want to take a look

582
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,020
at that budgerigar.

583
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,880
You are too...

584
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,500
Even the emperor of the Jin Empire

585
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,580
cannot take this path.

586
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,380
Look.

587
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,860
That old swindler.

588
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,460
Pretending to be mysterious again.

589
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,100
I've said that
when I practice martial arts,

590
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,260
no one can approach me.

591
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,260
Who is making noise?

592
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,220
Me, of course.

593
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,660
Rong.

594
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,380
It's you guys.

595
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,380
Yes, old swindler.

596
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,220
You even pretend to be very surprised.

597
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,420
Wasn't it you who invited us

598
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,300
to meet you here?

599
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,580
What did I lie to you?

600
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,500
When did I ask you to come?

601
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,580
Trying to deny it again.

602
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,260
The seven-day agreement.

603
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,460
We didn't miss it.

604
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,380
Seven-day agreement?

605
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,820
What is the seven-day agreement?

606
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,740
I really don't understand

607
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,140
what you guys are talking about.

608
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,060
You're quite good at pretending.

609
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,980
Last time after you defecated,

610
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,220
you forgot everything you said?

611
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,140
I let it slide

612
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,660
at the last Beggars' Gang Assembly,

613
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,220
it's not that I'm afraid of you.

614
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Today you trespassed

615
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,900
the Iron Palm Mountain's gate.

616
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
If you can't give me

617
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,140
a satisfactory answer,

618
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,300
you will definitely going

619
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,460
to die here.

620
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,500
Okay.

621
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,300
I like it

622
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,620
when you are bluffing.

623
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,660
Come on.

624
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,780
Don't hold back.

625
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,660
Rong.

626
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,820
Rong, how are you?

627
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,660
There are trespassers.

628
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,460
(This girl deliberately provoked me
to hit her.)

629
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,900
(Could it be a poison sting?)

630
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,740
There are trespassers.

631
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,020
Stop!

632
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,380
- This way.
- Yes.

633
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,900
Here, Rong.

634
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,420
How are you feeling?

635
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,660
I'm fine.

636
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,540
Fortunately, I have
the Soft Hedgehog Armor.

637
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm taking you down the mountain
for treatment now.

638
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,900
Let's go.

639
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,980
They must have

640
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,820
cut off the way down the mountain.

641
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,540
I will fight our way out.

642
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,900
Let's go up the mountain

643
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,820
and find a place to hide.

644
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,980
Okay.

645
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,020
Okay.

646
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,300
Let me take you to hide first.

647
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,190
Then we can find a way
to go down the mountain for treatment.

648
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,980
(Forbidden Area of Iron Palm Mountain)
Stop!

649
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:44,233
(Forbidden Area of Iron Palm Mountain)

650
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,450
We will definitely find your family

651
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,720
and kill them all!

652
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,540
Rong.

653
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,020
Why aren't those people chasing us?

654
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,620
It must be because we intruded

655
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,480
into their forbidden area.

656
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,860
They dare not come.

657
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,380
Here is the second knuckle

658
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,580
of the middle finger peak

659
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,780
depicted in that painting.

660
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,800
Great.

661
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,860
Don't talk now.

662
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,420
I see a hole

663
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,580
up there in front of us.

664
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,900
Let's go there to treat you.

665
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,180
Rong.

666
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,060
How are you now?

667
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,100
How are you?

668
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,980
Who is it?

669
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,900
How come you are here?

670
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,260
You really have the courage

671
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,020
to come for the seven-day appointment.

672
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,510
As the saying goes, newborn calves
are not afraid of tigers.

673
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,660
Besides saying I admire you,

674
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,540
what else can I say?

675
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,540
I really admire you.

676
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,500
Do you have

677
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
two personalities?

678
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,380
Why do you keep changing words?

679
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,980
The subtlety of this

680
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,780
is not something you can comprehend.

681
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,060
Hold on.

682
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,100
This is the forbidden area
of the Iron Palm Gang.

683
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,940
Intruders will not get out alive.

684
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,900
It seems that you are truly

685
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,100
courting death.

686
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,140
Listen to my advice.

687
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,380
Quickly go down the mountain and wait.

688
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,180
Otherwise your lives will be in danger.

689
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,020
Old man,

690
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,060
since this is the forbidden area
of the Iron Palm Gang,

691
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,580
how come you are here?

692
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,500
I'm an exception.

693
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,780
Because I make

694
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
the rules here.

695
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,540
Don't ask.

696
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,660
Four hours later,

697
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,180
meet me at the foot
of Iron Palm Mountain.

698
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,820
I have other important matters
to attend to.

699
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,420
See you around.

700
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,420
What do you mean?

701
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,020
My stomach is not well yet

702
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,980
and my little general is hurt again.

703
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,660
Misfortunes never come singly.

704
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,500
Jing.

705
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,140
Take a look at his palm.

706
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,980
Is there a blood hole pierced
by the Soft Hedgehog Armor?

707
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,180
Strange.

708
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,140
What's going on? Tell me quickly.

709
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,260
Do you still need to ask?

710
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,300
The one we just met
at the foot of the mountain

711
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,700
is the real Qiu Qianren.

712
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,020
The one in front of us

713
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,420
is just a fake.

714
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,820
Fake?

715
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Who is a fake?

716
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,820
I am real.

717
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,260
You can also say that we are both real.

718
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,340
Because we are twin brothers.

719
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,300
Old swindler,

720
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,140
what's your name?

721
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,980
I never conceal my name.

722
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,700
I am the famous

723
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,860
Iron Palm Water Skimmer

724
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,700
in the martial world, Qiu Qianren.

725
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,540
Jing.

726
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,820
Hit his laughing acupoint.

727
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,820
I dare you!

728
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,020
How dare you do this?

729
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,980
Despicable.

730
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,540
I have more despicable means

731
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,740
to deal with you.

732
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,540
Will you tell us or not?

733
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,060
A man may be killed but not insulted.

734
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,460
Quickly ask me. Quickly.

735
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,380
The most vicious is women's heart.

736
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,220
What's your name?

737
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,540
My father gave me a name,

738
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,660
surnamed Qiu.
The first name is Qiu Qian...

739
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,420
Qiu Qianzhang.

740
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,150
It's not that I didn't want to say it.

741
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,660
It was a long time ago,

742
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,900
and I've forgotten about it.

743
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,980
So you are Qiu Qianzhang.

744
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,820
That's right.

745
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,820
Qianzhang is me.

746
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,860
"Zhang" is equal to ten feet,

747
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,860
and "Ren" seven feet.

748
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,940
Calculating like this,

749
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,220
I'm more important than him.

750
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,300
Whose martial arts skills are better?

751
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300
It's easy to tell.

752
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,580
Why don't you just change your name

753
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,460
to Qianli or Qianfen?

754
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,300
Don't even compare yourself
to Qiu Qianren.

755
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,540
You're just a loser.

756
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,940
Girl.

757
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,860
You can scold me however you want,

758
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,380
but don't call me a loser.

759
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,220
Do you know why?

760
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,140
Because I am not one.

761
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,140
I have my own abilities.

762
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,020
He's just luckier than me.

763
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,140
When I and my younger brother
were young,

764
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,740
we accidentally saved Shangguan Jiannan,

765
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,060
the former master of the Iron Palm Gang.

766
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,060
In gratitude for saving his life,

767
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,980
he decided to teach us martial arts.

768
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,620
Now I think

769
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,820
that was a rare

770
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,420
happy time.

771
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,740
Luck is something

772
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,900
that's impossible to come by.

773
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,180
At that time, I

774
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,380
was weak and sickly.

775
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,500
Naturally he taught Qianren
the martial arts.

776
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,140
I was so jealous.

777
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,460
I thought,

778
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,180
if I were the one

779
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,380
who learned the martial arts,

780
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,740
perhaps I would have also

781
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,660
made some achievements.

782
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,580
It is possible.

783
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,740
Why didn't you
let your brother teach you?

784
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,580
How can I do that?

785
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,980
It'd shake the foundation
of the Iron Palm Gang.

786
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,820
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

787
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,620
Then what's the point of hiding here?

788
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,340
Want to harm your brother?

789
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,460
Didn't you agree

790
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,780
to find trouble with me here
seven days ago?

791
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,100
Then I saw there were

792
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,300
some weapons and armors,

793
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,940
and self-defense techniques.

794
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,380
I could use them someday.

795
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,780
So I wouldn't be bullied by you.

796
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,180
Why is the second knuckle
of the middle finger peak

797
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,300
a forbidden area?

798
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,860
It seems that you two don't know.

799
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,820
This is the place where

800
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,740
the former masters of the gang
passed away.

801
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,020
There are treasures
and rare items everywhere.

802
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,500
So, have you found any treasures?

803
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,460
Let us take a look.

804
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,140
You've asked the wrong person.

805
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Though in the Iron Palm Gang,

806
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,380
I'm

807
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,940
unpopular,

808
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,420
I always belong here

809
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,140
in life and in death.

810
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,460
How could I betray

811
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,740
our own gang?

812
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,580
Jing.

813
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,100
After watching,
please return it quickly.

814
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,020
(Vital Information Against the Jins)

815
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,900
Thieves, if you don't come down now,

816
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,820
our Iron Palm Gang

817
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,340
will definitely find
your family members

818
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,420
and exterminate your entire clan.

819
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,500
Are the two thieves

820
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,700
Guo Jing and Huang Rong?

821
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,060
Everyone.

822
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,740
Everyone.

823
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,420
Let's go in together

824
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,500
to catch the thieves,

825
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,600
and clear out the gang.

826
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,640
(Forbidden Area of Iron Palm Mountain)
No one is allowed to enter.

827
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,040
Not even the master himself.

828
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,260
How could the master...

829
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,500
Where's Qiu Qianren?

830
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,980
Kang, go find Qiu Qianren quickly.

831
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,260
The rules of the gang
must not be violated.

832
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,820
Regardless of the Songs or the Jins,

833
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,820
ghosts or gods,

834
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,860
if there's a place I want to go,

835
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,180
nothing will stop me.

836
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,860
Masters,

837
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,380
let's not turn against each other.

838
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,300
I have a plan

839
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,620
to break the deadlock.

840
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Set fire to the mountain.

841
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,300
The smoke will force them to leave.

842
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,060
Master Qiu.

843
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,820
How is this plan?
