00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,920
Kang.

4
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,180
Where are we going?

5
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,920
We're almost there.

6
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,610
Nianci.

7
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,490
These three are the elders

8
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,330
of Beggars' Gang.

9
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,790
They are Elder Jian,

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,700
Elder Peng, and Elder Liang.

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,750
Greetings, Elders.

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,420
No need to be so formal, Miss Mu.

13
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,210
I heard Chief Hong

14
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,110
guided you.

15
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,650
So you should be

16
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,900
a member of our gang.

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,210
Given our relationship

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,670
with Mr. Yang,

19
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,460
there's no need for such formality.

20
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,980
You...

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,140
I've decided to join the Beggars' Gang.

22
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,410
Really?

23
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,470
Does Miss Mu object?

24
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,540
Mr. Yang is a young hero.

25
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,110
If he joins us,

26
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,600
that would be fortunate

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,630
for our gang.

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,260
Miss Mu, please agree.

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,980
Why would I disagree?

30
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,190
The Beggars' Gang is
the largest gang in the world.

31
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,540
Qigong mentored me and showed me kindness.

32
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,470
If you can accept Kang,

33
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,300
I'd be most grateful.

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,630
Of course I'll agree.

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,760
From now on,

36
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,160
I'll fulfill my dreams

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,670
and ambitions in the Beggars' Gang.

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,810
I won't let you down

39
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,650
or worry again.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,630
It's wonderful to hear that.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,250
Elders,

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,090
please guide Kang

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,010
in the future.

44
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,300
Of course.

45
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,530
Today,

46
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,110
in front of the elders

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,950
and the Beggars' Gang brothers,

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,580
I want to do something I've longed for.

49
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,130
Nianci.

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,740
I know you've suffered a lot

51
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,670
along the way with me.

52
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,020
No matter what happened,

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,720
you've always been

54
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,090
by my side.

55
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,970
From today on,

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,540
let me protect you.

57
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,300
I've owed you too much.

58
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,210
Let me

59
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,980
stay by your side to repay my debt, okay?

60
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,930
Okay.

61
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,650
Elders,

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,540
tonight is the Beggars' Gang Assembly.

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,230
There no time like the present.

64
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,390
I wish to marry Nianci today.

65
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,580
Will that be good?

66
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,950
Good! Good ! Good!

67
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,300
(Double Happiness)

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,500
(Qinxin Pavilion)

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,710
- Father.
- Kang.

70
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,570
How is it?

71
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,300
The location of the Book of Wumu

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,790
records in this painting.

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,360
This...

74
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,690
I got this painting

75
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,710
from Guo Jing and Huang Rong.

76
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,620
These words

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,370
must record the location

78
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,380
of the Book of Wumu.

79
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,690
(Book of Wu)

80
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,790
Middle Peak of Iron Palm Mountain?

81
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,880
It's in Master Qiu's

82
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,720
Iron Palm Mountain.

83
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,500
That would be easier.

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,920
Kang.

85
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,030
You've made another great contribution.

86
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,380
For Father's career,

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,030
I will do anything.

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,160
Good boy.

89
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800
Now,

90
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,470
there's another important task

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,830
for you.

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,480
What's that?

93
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,980
The Beggars' Gang has always been

94
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,590
our enemy in the North of Yangtze River.

95
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,380
When our army advances south,

96
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,300
the Beggars' Gang

97
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,670
will attack our leaders

98
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,980
and burn our supplies.

99
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,420
I have been constantly troubled,

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,980
with no solution in sight.

101
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,910
If we can make the Beggars' Gang
move to the south,

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,930
it would save us

103
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,770
a lot of trouble.

104
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,910
No one knows a father better than his son.

105
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,970
After tonight,

106
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,110
I'll be the chief of the Beggars' Gang.

107
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,610
Then, I'll arrange for them

108
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,450
to migrate south.

109
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,670
But I just took over and my foundation

110
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,010
is unstable.

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,590
I'm afraid they won't obey me.

112
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,850
Don't worry.

113
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,740
I'll send people to support you.

114
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,600
Thank you, Father.

115
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,740
Where is my Ke?

116
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,360
Mr. Ouyang?

117
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,830
Greetings, Mr. Ouyang.

118
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,620
May I ask what are you doing here?

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,240
Prince,

120
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,980
where is my Ke?

121
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,530
Mr. Ouyang Ke?

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,200
I went to get the Book of Wumu.

123
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,350
You were supposed to look after Ke.

124
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,380
How could you not know where he is?

125
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,370
Mr. Ouyang, you never returned

126
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,210
when you left that day.

127
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,730
I thought you went to search for

128
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,790
Mr. Ouyang Ke.

129
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,350
When I reached Niujia Village,

130
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,110
Ke was gone.

131
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,010
Maybe Mr. Ouyang Ke

132
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,380
left first?

133
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,570
Impossible.

134
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,610
I can't even

135
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,960
see our secret signals

136
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,800
we use.

137
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,030
He might have been killed.

138
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,860
I left Niujia Village

139
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,150
and went to the Iron Palm Gang.

140
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,180
I don't know where Mr. Ouyang Ke is.

141
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,180
You can't even protect Ke.

142
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,790
You are of no use to me anymore.

143
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,920
It was Guo Jing!

144
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,170
I saw that at Qu Tavern

145
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,050
that day.

146
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,420
Guo Jing killed Mr. Ouyang Ke.

147
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,360
Kang...

148
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,030
Mr. Ouyang Ke harassed Huang Rong.

149
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,230
Guo Jing held a grudge

150
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,030
and killed him

151
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,590
when he didn't notice.

152
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,440
If you lie to me, you'll wish you were dead.

153
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,740
If I lie,

154
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,690
may I die from

155
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,670
Mr. Ouyang's poison.

156
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,850
It's my fault.

157
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,180
I couldn't defeat Guo Jing

158
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,760
and watched

159
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,830
Mr. Ouyang Ke

160
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,450
being...

161
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
Being...

162
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,670
Wait, Mr. Ouyang.

163
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,500
Guo Jing and Huang Rong are in my hands.

164
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,240
I got this Beggars' Gang

165
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,500
token from Huang Rong.

166
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,110
I planned to kill them

167
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,950
at midnight at Xuanyuan Terrace,

168
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,590
Junshan Island

169
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,260
to avenge Ke.

170
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,020
But I have one more request.

171
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,660
Please agree.

172
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,260
After Mr. Ouyang Ke passed away,

173
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,230
I realized that without skills,

174
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,520
one can be easily harmed

175
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,710
in the martial world.

176
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,730
I am about to become

177
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,740
the chief of the gang.

178
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,380
It's like walking on thin ice.

179
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,860
I've long admired you

180
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,490
and wish to be your apprentice,

181
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,380
learning martial arts

182
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,620
to unite the Beggars' Gang.

183
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,020
If you take Kang as your apprentice,

184
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,550
the Beggars' Gang

185
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,550
and the Mount White Camel will be close.

186
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,860
My son and I

187
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,130
will try our best

188
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,040
and help your manor

189
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,740
become the most powerful in the martial world.

190
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,140
Master, please accept my kowtow.

191
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,470
I will

192
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,430
avenge your nephew!

193
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,110
You two sleep soundly.

194
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,230
Elder Peng,

195
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,850
Jing and I are both

196
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,350
Qigong's apprentices.

197
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,610
So,

198
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,660
we are peers.

199
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,660
Aren't you afraid of Qigong's wrath

200
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,860
for tying us up with no reason.

201
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,460
You rebellious apprentices

202
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
dare to mention

203
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,140
Chief Hong?

204
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,660
We'll end your lives

205
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,730
at tonight's Beggars' Gang Assembly

206
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,800
to comfort Chief Hong

207
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,860
in heaven.

208
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,400
No one believes you,

209
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,260
old man...

210
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,290
Enough.

211
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,540
(Double Happiness)

212
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,900
It's not the time yet.

213
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,380
Why are you here now?

214
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,070
On the wedding night,

215
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,110
only when the groom

216
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,490
lifts the bride's veil

217
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,500
are they truly married.

218
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,290
Nianci.

219
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,690
I can't wait.

220
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,110
You should go to the assembly.

221
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,710
Don't delay.

222
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,090
I'll wait for you.

223
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,850
Okay.

224
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,620
I'll come for you

225
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,480
after the assembly.

226
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,720
You should go.

227
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,820
(Beggars' Gang Central Altra)

228
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,350
Brothers!

229
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,550
Tragedy has struck the Beggars' Gang.

230
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,660
Chief Hong

231
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,950
was attacked in Lin'an City!

232
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,500
What's wrong with Chief Hong?

233
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,830
Chief Hong

234
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,190
has passed away.

235
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,250
- Who killed Chief Hong?
- Yes.

236
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:42,550
We'll avenge Chief Hong!

237
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,570
Elder Peng,

238
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,160
who witnessed

239
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,280
Chief Hong's death?

240
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,230
If Chief Hong is still alive,

241
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,520
who has the nerve

242
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,430
to curse him?

243
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,110
The witness who saw Chief Hong's death

244
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,070
is right here.

245
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,950
Who is it?

246
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,710
Mr. Yang, please come here.

247
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,780
Brothers!

248
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,380
I am Yang Kang.

249
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,430
I witnessed Huang Yaoshi,

250
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,660
Master of Peach Blossom Island,

251
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,660
Eastern Heretic,

252
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,550
his daughter Huang Rong,

253
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,310
and son-in-law Guo Jing

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,860
killing Chief Hong!

255
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,010
Miss Huang and Brother Guo

256
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,380
are Chief Hong's apprentices.

257
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,470
Why would they kill him?

258
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,860
Huang Rong and Guo Jing eloped.

259
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,380
But Huang Yaoshi got angry

260
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,900
at Qigong

261
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,740
and attacked him.

262
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,570
They fought for a long time.

263
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,230
But to please Old Heretic Huang,

264
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,740
Guo Jing ambushed

265
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,250
and killed Chief Hong.

266
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,090
Nonsense!

267
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,560
Chief Hong and Master Huang

268
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,400
were friends.

269
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,880
Why would they kill each other

270
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,020
over such a trivial matter?

271
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,130
If Huang Yaoshi wanted to

272
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,280
gain an advantage

273
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,190
in Duel atop Mount Hua,

274
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,620
wouldn't he eliminate his rival first?

275
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,480
Elder Lu,

276
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,680
even if you don't believe him,

277
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,520
you can't deny

278
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,590
this token.

279
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,980
If the chief hadn't given it willingly,

280
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,980
who could have taken it

281
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,260
from him?

282
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,780
Since Chief Hong gave the token to Mr. Yang,

283
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,780
it's clear that

284
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,040
he intended for Mr. Yang

285
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,880
to succeed

286
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,350
as the chief.

287
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,170
Brothers!

288
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,500
We have two major tasks now.

289
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,810
First,

290
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,830
follow the Chief Hong's last wish

291
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,550
and appoint a new chief.

292
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,400
Second,

293
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,830
let's discuss

294
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,980
how to avenge

295
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,850
Chief Hong.

296
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,330
Appoint a new chief!

297
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,970
Avenge Chief Hong!

298
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,430
Appoint a new chief!

299
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,240
Avenge Chief Hong!

300
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,800
Appoint a new chief!

301
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
Avenge Chief Hong!

302
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,940
- Brothers!
- Appoint a new chief!

303
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,950
Listen to me!

304
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,550
When Chief Hong

305
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,350
was alive,

306
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,400
he intended for Elder Lu

307
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,240
to be the new chief.

308
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,590
Today,

309
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,110
an outsider wants to take over?

310
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,640
I say

311
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,640
Elder Lu should be the chief!

312
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:44,500
Elder Lu! Elder Lu!

313
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,490
Elder Lu!

314
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,560
Tell your

315
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,780
Dirty Clothes Faction to stop!

316
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,210
Is the Beggars' Gang Assembly

317
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,730
not open for discussion?

318
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,570
You...

319
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,710
Brothers of the Dirty Clothes Faction.

320
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,740
In terms of virtue,

321
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,050
martial arts,

322
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,550
and popularity,

323
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,260
Elder Lu

324
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,900
is most suitable as the new chief.

325
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,430
But with Chief's token here

326
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,380
and his last wish,

327
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,350
we must follow it.

328
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,500
If any brothers

329
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,310
have doubts,

330
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,710
please come up and have a look.

331
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,190
Recently, Mr. Yang has been wielding this staff

332
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,950
in Yuezhou, rallying support.

333
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,040
I thought it was just talk

334
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,140
and ignored it.

335
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,780
But now,

336
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,380
Mr. Yang dared to come here.

337
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,020
I must take a good look.

338
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,790
Since

339
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,790
it's Chief Hong's last wish,

340
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,660
how can we disobey?

341
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,660
I, Lu Youjiao,

342
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,690
pledge to support Mr. Yang

343
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,620
as the 19th chief of the Beggars' Gang!

344
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,590
Since Elder Lu has no objections,

345
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,380
neither do

346
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,030
the three of us.

347
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,200
Four Elders,

348
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,190
I'm not that talented

349
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,830
and virtuous,

350
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,600
unworthy of this responsibility.

351
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,320
Since it's Chief Hong's last wish,

352
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,830
you don't have to underestimate yourself.

353
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,270
We'll help you

354
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,460
handle the gang's affairs.

355
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,730
Mr. Yang, don't worry.

356
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,760
Mr. Yang!

357
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,970
Mr. Yang can be the chief!

358
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,940
It's settled then.

359
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,090
Mr. Yang.

360
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,360
Don't let Chief Hong

361
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,140
and the brothers down.

362
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,980
I can't refuse such kindness.

363
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,190
Since that's the case,

364
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,750
I will accept.

365
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,890
Brothers.

366
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,720
Please welcome Mr. Yang

367
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,030
to the initiation ceremony.

368
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,690
To Xuanyuan Terrace, please!

369
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,340
(Xuanyuan Terrace)

370
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,790
Chief Yang, please don't be mad.

371
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,300
This is a tradition of our gang.

372
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,940
When a new chief is appointed,

373
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,940
he must endure spitting from the members.

374
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,140
As beggars, we face

375
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,380
humiliation from all.

376
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,620
So, as the chief of beggars,

377
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,380
one must endure humiliation from members.

378
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,220
I see.

379
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,660
Chief Yang,

380
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,820
please don't mind us.

381
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,980
That's okay.

382
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,460
Now I'm a member of the gang,

383
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,100
so I should follow the rules.

384
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,220
This is Chief Yang,

385
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,700
19th chief of the Beggars' Gang!

386
00:19:50,780 --> 00:20:07,660
Chief Yang!

387
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,100
Although the main culprits
of killing Chief Hong

388
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,060
have not been caught,

389
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,390
two accomplices

390
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,940
have been captured.

391
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
Bring them up.

392
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:42,940
Kill them! Kill them!

393
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,780
They betrayed Chief.

394
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,980
That's a grave sin.

395
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,020
Tonight,

396
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,380
I'll kill these two rebellious apprentices

397
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,700
for the soul of Chief Hong!

398
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,860
There must be

399
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,140
some misunderstanding.

400
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,740
Yes. Chief Yang.

401
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,380
I met them

402
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,580
in Baoying.

403
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
They are righteous

404
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,300
young heroes.

405
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,620
I can bet

406
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,820
my soul on it

407
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,220
that they had nothing to do

408
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,980
with Chief Hong's death.

409
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,940
Only Elders can speak here.

410
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,460
You can't interrupt!

411
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,900
Chief,

412
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,100
this involved the serious matter of the gang.

413
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,060
Please investigate thoroughly.

414
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Investigate thoroughly!

415
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,100
Lu Youjiao!

416
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,140
Investigate thoroughly!

417
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,100
You pledged to support the new chief.

418
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Now why do you

419
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,540
defy his orders?

420
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:40,180
Investigate thoroughly!

421
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,660
Since the Dirty Clothes Faction

422
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
has doubts,

423
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,260
I'll ask them directly

424
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,940
to clear things up.

425
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,780
I'll ask your questions

426
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,380
but you don't need to speak it out.

427
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
Nod if

428
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,900
I am right.

429
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,660
Shake your head if I am wrong.

430
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,500
If you lie,

431
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,220
don't blame my sword.

432
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,380
This woman is Huang Yaoshi's daughter,

433
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,580
right?

434
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,740
Hey!

435
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,140
Answer Chief Yang!

436
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,460
This woman is Huang Yaoshi's daughter,

437
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,420
right?

438
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,260
You want to marry her,

439
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,620
but Huang Yaoshi doesn't want to

440
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,500
marry his daughter to you,

441
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,220
right?

442
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,540
Chief Huang was ambushed

443
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,700
and gravely injured

444
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,620
with you two present,

445
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,540
right?

446
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:37,380
Kill him! Kill him!

447
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,340
They admit their guilt directly.

448
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,420
We should give them

449
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,540
a swift end.

450
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:49,100
Kill them! Kill them!

451
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,340
Decapitate!

452
00:23:50,340 --> 00:24:17,820
Kill them! Kill them!

453
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,060
Decapitate!

454
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,300
Look!

455
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,820
What's that?

456
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,220
Elders.

457
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,700
What's this?

458
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,460
An important guest is here.

459
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,780
Who?

460
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,780
Iron Palm Gang.

461
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,980
Chief,

462
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,940
The Iron Palm Gang is a major faction
in Sichuan and Hunan.

463
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,660
Their master is here to pay tribute.

464
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,100
We must welcome him properly.

465
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,380
Chief,

466
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,380
we can deal with

467
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,060
these two later.

468
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Alright.

469
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,980
Master Qiu, welcome. Your presence honors us.

470
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,420
I heard

471
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,740
Chief Hong passed away?

472
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,980
Yes.

473
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,220
The world lost a hero.

474
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,100
I have never dueled with him.

475
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,460
What a pity.

476
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,700
Master Qiu.

477
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,020
let me introduce him to you.

478
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,380
He is our new chief

479
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,260
appointed today.

480
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,380
A young hero.

481
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,140
Congratulations to you.

482
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,300
I've long heard of Master Qiu.

483
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,540
Seeing you today,

484
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,100
I understand why people call you

485
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,660
Iron Palm Water Skimmer.

486
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,900
Master Qiu, may I ask

487
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,380
what brings you here today?

488
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,700
Our gangs have long

489
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,860
fought over territory.

490
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,820
I heard Chief Yang

491
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,060
is taking over tonight,

492
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,180
so I bring you a great gift

493
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,420
on someone else's behalf

494
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,500
to apologize.

495
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,630
I also want to

496
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,860
ask you an important question.

497
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Master Qiu,

498
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,780
I'm afraid we can't accept

499
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,260
such a great gift from you.

500
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,540
I mean I was acting for someone else.

501
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Didn't you hear?

502
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,140
The Sixth Prince of Jin asked me

503
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,740
to give these to you.

504
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,140
What did he mean?

505
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,620
I don't know.

506
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,980
We can't accept that.

507
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,860
Don't worry.

508
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,020
I'll send people

509
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,900
to support you.

510
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,100
Is the important question you mentioned

511
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,140
also from the Sixth Prince?

512
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,900
The Sixth Prince told me,

513
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,020
the north

514
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,820
is poor and barren,

515
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,060
not suitable for expansion.

516
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,100
He hopes...

517
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,140
He hopes our gang

518
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,860
move to the south of the Yangtze River.

519
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,100
Exactly.

520
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,780
The north is harsh

521
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,300
compared to the warm and rich south.

522
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,780
Your gang could rest in the south.

523
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,020
Everyone will be envied.

524
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,660
Master Qiu and the Prince's suggestion

525
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,780
is exactly what I want to do.

526
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,780
Our gang leads a modest life

527
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,460
and suffers in the cold weather.

528
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,620
Moving to the south

529
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,940
would ease our hardships.

530
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,900
So,

531
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,860
Chief Yang agrees to

532
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,060
move the gang to the south,

533
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,340
never to return to the north?

534
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,300
Chief.

535
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,780
Think it over!

536
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
Chief Hong was known as the Northern Beggar.

537
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,460
People know our gang's stronghold in the north.

538
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,860
How can we abandon everything?

539
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,300
Besides, our gang has been loyal and brave.

540
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,700
The Jins are our enemies.

541
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,180
We can't accept their gifts,

542
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,300
let alone move to the south

543
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,700
of the Yangtze River!

544
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,740
Elder Lu,

545
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,380
we should listen to the chief,

546
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,660
not you, right?

547
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,500
Elders,

548
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,300
what do you think?

549
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,380
We will follow Chief's lead

550
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,060
and won't disobey.

551
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,820
Alright.

552
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,340
We'll move to the south

553
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,060
on August, 1st!

554
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,940
How can we move?

555
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,020
Move to the south?

556
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,620
But our home is here.

557
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,420
Even if you are determined,

558
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,540
I won't go!

559
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,260
Lu Youjiao!

560
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,100
Are you trying

561
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,260
to defy the chief?

562
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,540
Even if I am dismembered,

563
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,700
I will not betray the chief.

564
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,340
But I can't disregard

565
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,100
the teachings of our ancestors!

566
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,620
Our gang has hundreds of thousands of members,

567
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,140
spreading across the world.

568
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,300
How can we be confined by the Jins?

569
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,100
You defy Chief's orders.

570
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,660
You must intend to

571
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,860
split our gang

572
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,180
after failing to become the chief.

573
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,340
Lu Youjiao, if you want to rebel,

574
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,940
you must first ask the members

575
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,300
behind me if they agree.

576
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,540
No!

577
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,580
The new chief

578
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,580
is collaborating with the Jins

579
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,220
to destroy our foundation.

580
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,150
Brothers, don't be fooled!

581
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,180
Our gang

582
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,300
has always

583
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,980
fought for justice

584
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,380
and protected the people.

585
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,700
Who are you really working for?

586
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,220
Brothers!

587
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,700
Master Qiu is here

588
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,060
for the sake of our gang's future.

589
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,780
I know it's hard for you

590
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,380
to accept moving to the south.

591
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,980
But don't worry.

592
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,500
As long as I'm here...

593
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
Yang!

594
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,740
How can we let our great land

595
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,060
be taken by enemies?

596
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,780
I don't accept you

597
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,740
- as the chief!
- You...

598
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,700
We, the Beggars' Gang,

599
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,100
would rather die than be traitors!

600
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:47,620
We can't be traitors!

601
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,620
(The Seven Stars transformation)

602
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,100
(is similar to the grand formation)

603
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
(of Quanzhen School.)

604
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,860
Rong. I got it.

605
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,500
Jing.

606
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,460
You got what?

607
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,380
I considered Tiangang Big Dipper Formation
of Seven Immortals of Quanzhen

608
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,460
and found it's connected to

609
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,540
the Nine Yin Manual.

610
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,300
So, I combined the seven's strength into one

611
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,820
according to the manual.

612
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,140
I didn't expect it to be so powerful.

613
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,900
That's great, Jing.

614
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,220
Do you

615
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,100
accpet that or not?

616
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,700
Just kill me.

617
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,940
Okay.

618
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,820
Brother Guo, don't underestimate him.

619
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,980
Master Qiu.

620
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,380
Since you are here,

621
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,500
how can we let him mess around?

622
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,220
(He is quite skilled.)

623
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,460
(Duel atop Mount Hua is approaching.)

624
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,100
(I don't have to waste energy on him.)

625
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,700
- Rong.
- Jing.

626
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,540
Master Qiu.

627
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,940
Please kill these thieves.

628
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,220
I'll reward you generously.

629
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,140
After we ambush the Mongol envoys,

630
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,460
I hope Master Qiu

631
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,700
can go to Yuezhou

632
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
and assist my son, Kang.

633
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,820
No problem.

634
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,580
Thank you, Master Qiu.

635
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,940
I'll take my leave.

636
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,940
Brother!

637
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,780
How was my performance?

638
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,060
Wasn't it impressive?

639
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,700
A bit over-the-top and exaggerated.

640
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,300
Impossible.

641
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,420
I must have looked imposing.

642
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
It's fine.

643
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,020
Duel atop Mount Hua is approaching.

644
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,060
I need to focus on training

645
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,700
and don't want to be bothered.

646
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,820
I'll leave the assassination

647
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,860
of the Mongol envoys to you.

648
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,220
Really?

649
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,500
Great!

650
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,900
Fighting may occur with the Beggars' Gang.

651
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,220
I'll go in person.

652
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,660
That's not necessary.

653
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,340
I think you can

654
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,020
(Qiu Qianzhang/ Qiu Qianren)
leave it to me.

655
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,280
I'll take good care of it.

656
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,460
You will ruin my plans.

657
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,180
Do you know why?

658
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,900
Why?

659
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,140
Because a loser

660
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,340
can always be a loser.

661
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,380
Yes.

662
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,700
I know

663
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,660
what to do

664
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,620
and what not to do.

665
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,540
It's not for you to tell me.

666
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,980
Chief Yang is appointed tonight.

667
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,140
You should assert your authority.

668
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,660
I can't steal your thunder.

669
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,980
Elders.

670
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,740
We have many heroes here.

671
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,220
We can't let him look down on us.

672
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,300
Chief, don't worry.

673
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,300
We won't let an outsider look down on us.

674
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,220
All members!

675
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Fortified Wall Formation!

676
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,860
He has indeed learned

677
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,780
Chief Hong's whole set palm technique.

678
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,820
We must put an end

679
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,100
to both of their lives.

680
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,900
Kill them

681
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,380
and avenge Chief Hong!

682
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,580
Jing, give me a hand.

683
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,460
Let me show you the real

684
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,900
Beggars' Gang martial arts.

685
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,540
That's Untroubled Ease Palm.

686
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,300
The authentic Untroubled Ease Palm!

687
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,980
Wanyan Kang,

688
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,060
you want to be the chief of the Beggars' Gang?

689
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,580
Brothers!

690
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,380
Chief Hong isn't dead.

691
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,220
He is a Jin Prince, spreading rumors

692
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,820
and plotting to seize power.

693
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,660
Nonsense!

694
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,180
Brothers!

695
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,220
Don't be swayed by our enemy!

696
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,100
You said one month ago,

697
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,300
Qigong was ambushed during a duel.

698
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,660
But one month ago,

699
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,120
I was with Qigong.

700
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,620
He was perfectly fine,

701
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,540
eating at least three Beggar's Chickens a day.

702
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,100
He had a great appetite

703
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,180
and was in good health.

704
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,820
Qigong is alive!

705
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,620
Chief asked you to catch them.

706
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,620
What are you waiting for?

707
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,060
How could

708
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,420
the mighty Beggars' Gang

709
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,300
be fooled by a little girl?

710
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,740
Brothers! Look!

711
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,780
Qigong's Dog Beating Staff

712
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,740
is in my hand.

713
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,100
I'm the chief personally appointed

714
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,340
by Qigong.

715
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,380
You snatched the staff

716
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,020
of our gang from me.

717
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,660
Everyone saw that clearly.

718
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,500
Wanyan Kang,

719
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,140
you claim the Dog Beating Staff is yours.

720
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,140
Do you know how to use it?

721
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,780
You keep calling it Dog Beating Staff.

722
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,460
How dare you belittle this staff?

723
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,380
You deserve to be punished.

724
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,850
As the chief of the Beggars' Gang,

725
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,940
you just call it "staff".

726
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
What?

727
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,900
Are you looking down on our Dog Beating Staff?

728
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,980
Or don't you know

729
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,820
it's the Dog Beating Staff?

730
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,340
Because you stole it

731
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,740
from me?

732
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,300
Simply holding the Dog Beating Staff

733
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,460
doesn't make someone the chief.

734
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,210
If it were kept in a cupboard,

735
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,880
would the cupboard become the chief?

736
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,270
We've already appointed Chief Yang.

737
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,280
How can we let an outsider insult him?

738
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,940
Brothers!

739
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,060
Our gang travels the world,

740
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,620
but today we've been humiliated.

741
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,980
Who caused Li Sheng and Yu Zhaoxing

742
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,340
to be killed?

743
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,300
Who injured Elder Lu?

744
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,980
Who is forcing us to move to the south?

745
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,820
Shut up!

746
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,020
How can we let a little girl

747
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,380
boss us around here?

748
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,380
Brothers!

749
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,300
He intends to destroy our Song Dynasty.

750
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,500
His surname isn't Yang.

751
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,500
He is Wanyan,

752
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,980
the son of Prince Zhao of Jin Empire!
