00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,650
Where did you go?

4
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,850
Of course we went
to figure out a solution.

5
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,020
Where is the helper?

6
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,460
The helper is right here.

7
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,270
Ke.

8
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,920
They have gone out.

9
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,040
Rong, your method is great.

10
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,450
Saving Little Venomous Creature
may not necessarily be a good thing.

11
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,060
What's the problem?

12
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,550
Previously Ouyang Feng
asked for our help.

13
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,850
Now Ouyang Ke has broken his legs.

14
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,920
He may not be grateful to us.

15
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,010
All of you get out.

16
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,600
Ke needs to rest.

17
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,550
Mr. Ouyang.

18
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,290
This is where my master lives.

19
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,430
Your nephew is injured,

20
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,760
so we saved him for you.

21
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,920
Now my master is injured like this,

22
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,740
and you actually want us to get out?

23
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,970
He's a toad spirit.

24
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,410
He'll never be humane.

25
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,690
Go out.

26
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,570
- Ouyang Feng.
- Jing.

27
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,710
Jing.

28
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,670
It's okay.

29
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,690
Help me up.

30
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,300
Let's go.

31
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,760
Let them have it.

32
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,230
Let's go.

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,060
So impressive.

34
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,010
So fierce.

35
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,060
Wait a moment.

36
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,830
What?

37
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,320
You had a change of heart?

38
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
You two

39
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,170
go get some wild foods.

40
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,570
If you dare to poison the food,

41
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,040
I will kill you both.

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,530
Go ahead then.

43
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,200
Let's see what to feed them.

44
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,580
Uncle.

45
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,180
Is there still hope

46
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,200
for my legs?

47
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,530
Of course there is.

48
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,530
When we return to the Western Regions,

49
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,970
I will make a prosthetic limb for you
using sheep bones.

50
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,970
You can still walk.

51
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,430
Sheep bones?

52
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,290
Then it's hopeless.

53
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,530
It's hopeless.

54
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,110
I lost my legs! I lost my legs!

55
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,950
Ke.

56
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,500
Uncle.

57
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,000
You shouldn't have saved me.

58
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,800
My legs are useless.

59
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,590
What am I still alive for?

60
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,540
What for?

61
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,240
I don't allow you to give up on yourself.

62
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,290
Don't worry,

63
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,730
I will definitely cure you.

64
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,850
How did you end up
being under that huge rock?

65
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,600
I went after Rong

66
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,440
all the way there.

67
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,290
I didn't expect

68
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,770
there was a huge rock

69
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,770
on that cliff.

70
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,350
Uncle.

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
If it weren't for Rong
letting go of past grievances,

72
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,170
and risking her life to save me,

73
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,770
I'm afraid I would have...

74
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,990
Really?

75
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,700
Really.

76
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,430
Jing.

77
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,240
Add some seasoning on top of this.

78
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,590
No.

79
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,230
What's wrong?

80
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,120
You are here.

81
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm embarrassed.

82
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,970
Let me do it.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,920
I've been holding it in for a long time.

84
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,190
Come on, come on.

85
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,480
Okay, okay.

86
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,360
Hurry up, go.

87
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,300
Leave this one behind.

88
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,480
Give the clean one to him.

89
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,870
Hurry up and deliver it.

90
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,360
Just send the clean one over.

91
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,230
Okay.

92
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,940
Well...

93
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,410
Why is it taking so long?

94
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,990
Mr. Ouyang.

95
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,970
Roasting a rabbit takes time.

96
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,980
We can't let you eat raw meat.

97
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,820
Here.

98
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,600
I want that one.

99
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,420
That one is headless.

100
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,440
You can have this one.

101
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,780
This one is too cruel.

102
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,890
I'm afraid of scaring Ke.

103
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,600
I want the one you're having.

104
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,590
Okay.

105
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,790
Master.

106
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,940
Rong.

107
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,510
Why did you bring it back?

108
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,770
Ouyang Feng insists on having ours,

109
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,590
he also said

110
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,530
the rabbit head will scare Ke.

111
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,020
Could it be that Western Venom

112
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,340
actually admires

113
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,460
me, the Northern Beggar?

114
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,800
He insists on tasting my urine.

115
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,600
That's for sure.

116
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,670
Well,

117
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,220
quickly send that one over to him.

118
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,750
- Okay.
- Ouyang Feng

119
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,240
doesn't like bland food.

120
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,790
Uncle.

121
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,440
This must be made by Rong.

122
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,920
I've heard about
Rong's excellent cooking skills.

123
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,350
Unexpectedly,

124
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,170
on this deserted island,

125
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,530
she can still roast this wild rabbit

126
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,320
to be so savory and delicious.

127
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,200
Uncle, you should try it too.

128
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,500
Okay.

129
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,370
Delicious.

130
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,740
Rong.

131
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,010
How did you know

132
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,410
Ouyang Feng would want to exchange?

133
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,410
Based on Ouyang Feng's character,

134
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,900
he thinks everyone in the world

135
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,740
is like him.

136
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,540
He will definitely think

137
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,040
I tampered with the food.

138
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,800
He doesn't want to be fooled.

139
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,890
But I have to make him fall for it.

140
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,890
What if

141
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,370
he didn't fall for your trick?

142
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,200
What should we do
if we can't eat the clean one?

143
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,440
Jing.

144
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,440
Can't we eat something else

145
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,890
instead of that seasoned rabbit?

146
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,710
That's right.

147
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,530
I'll just go catch another one.

148
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,380
Qigong.

149
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,410
Please eat slowly.

150
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,270
If you have a good appetite,

151
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,610
the injury will naturally heal faster.

152
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,290
I believe resting for a few more days,

153
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,350
and you'll be fine.

154
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,840
No need to say these words to coax me.

155
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,740
I know the condition

156
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,010
of my own injuries.

157
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,860
I used all of the inner force

158
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,820
to force out the snake venom

159
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,890
and save my life.

160
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,130
But my martial arts skills

161
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,170
are considered ruined.

162
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,010
Leave some for Master.

163
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,070
Master.

164
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,990
Don't worry.

165
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,910
Even if you lose
your martial arts skills,

166
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,800
it's okay.

167
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,610
Me and Rong

168
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,490
will always be there for you.

169
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,190
Okay.

170
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,780
Finally, Heaven

171
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,370
still favors me

172
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,900
and give me

173
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,650
roast rabbit to eat

174
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,910
and a pair of good disciples

175
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,170
to accompany me.

176
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,720
Not bad, not bad.

177
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,420
Rong.

178
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,040
Your father must still be mad at me.

179
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,610
My father is not a bad person.

180
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,170
He is just suspicious.

181
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,780
But it's also Old Imp's fault

182
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,460
to make him believe

183
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,800
you took Senior Mei's Nine Yin Manual.

184
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,740
I know.

185
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,530
But I really don't know

186
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,150
Mei Chaofeng's Nine Yin Manual

187
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,440
is wrriten on that piece of sheepskin.

188
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,110
The dagger,

189
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,170
our family heirloom,

190
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,490
was wrapped by that piece of sheepskin.

191
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm afraid of losing that dagger,

192
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,530
so I haven't even taken it out.

193
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,170
I believe in you.

194
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,470
Rong.

195
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,320
You are so good to me.

196
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,990
Guo Jing.

197
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,680
You have taken away my love.

198
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,200
I will kill you.

199
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,410
Stay calm, Ke.

200
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,040
The top priority

201
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,510
is to leave this island

202
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,680
and cure your legs,

203
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,200
instead of rushing to kill someone.

204
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,490
But Uncle,

205
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,290
as soon as I see him,

206
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,250
I can't put aside the hatred.

207
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,290
I promised them

208
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,650
not to kill on this island.

209
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,920
- But...
- Don't worry.

210
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,490
I will help you vent your anger.

211
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,830
Old Venomous Creature.

212
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,110
What are you here for again?

213
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,590
I'm here to find him.

214
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,650
He took my things.

215
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,040
I didn't take your things.

216
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,190
No.

217
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,610
You did.

218
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,290
You took my Nine Yin Manual.

219
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,720
Jing learned that on his own.

220
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,170
What's it to you?

221
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,110
You Old Venomous Creature are so boring.

222
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,820
You only know how to use me
to threaten the children.

223
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,250
What else can you do?

224
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,420
Qigong.

225
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,370
You really don't know
how to speak properly.

226
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,630
I'll give you an hour.

227
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,080
If you can't write Nine Yin Manual down,

228
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,800
you won't see your master again.

229
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,490
- Old Venomous Creature.
- Don't mind me.

230
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,500
Rong.

231
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,720
It seems that
if we don't give the Manual to him,

232
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,170
Master will be in danger.

233
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,490
Mr. Zhou and his senior Wang Chongyang

234
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,530
protected the Manual with their lives.

235
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,230
It seems like

236
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,610
their effort is wasted.

237
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,440
Why are you so serious?

238
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,790
The content

239
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,800
of this Nine Yin Manual

240
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,010
is only known by you alone.

241
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,560
The Nine Yin Manual is

242
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,130
whatever you write.

243
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,800
Are you saying

244
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,920
I should deliberately
write the wrong content?

245
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,680
That's right.

246
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,130
Is it itchy lying there?

247
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,900
I've slept there.

248
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,170
There are fleas everywhere.

249
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,560
I have to say, you are quite interesting.

250
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,940
You even used such superficial skills

251
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,580
like acupoint pressure on me.

252
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,420
Come on.

253
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,270
Unlock my acupoints

254
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,350
and let's have a fight.

255
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,190
Master.

256
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,670
Jing.

257
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,790
What are you here for?

258
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,910
Don't mind me.

259
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,710
You can't give the Manual to him.

260
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,550
Master.

261
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,990
This time, I can't listen to you.

262
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,070
No.

263
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,550
Stop yelling.

264
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,110
I really don't understand

265
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,430
why the Nine Yin Manual

266
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,150
can't be shared by the world.

267
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,510
Why only you can enjoy it?

268
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,830
As long as Guo Jing
writes the Manual down,

269
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,830
I won't make things difficult for you.

270
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,870
Mr. Ouyang.

271
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,470
There are no paper and pen here.

272
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,830
How can I write it to you?

273
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,270
Go to the fire pit
and get a piece of charcoal.

274
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,070
My martial arts are unique.

275
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,510
The Nine Yin Manual is nothing to me.

276
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,390
Even if I have it,

277
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,150
I won't even bother to look at it.

278
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,830
Only those

279
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,070
weak martial artists

280
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,110
would want to see

281
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,750
what kind of skills they can steal.

282
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,590
Fantasizing about shortcuts.

283
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,150
Shameless!

284
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,510
Wang Chongyang and Old Heretic Huang

285
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,830
also got the Manual before.

286
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,630
Why didn't they practice it at all?

287
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,180
Uncle.

288
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,790
Are you going to just let him
insult you like that?

289
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,470
Don't be angry, Ke.

290
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,430
Yes.

291
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,430
I'm telling you,

292
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,710
it's a shame to count you

293
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,070
as one of the Five Greats.

294
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,630
How about changing your nickname?

295
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,050
Don't call yourself
Western Venom anymore.

296
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,710
Change your name to Western Thief.

297
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,990
Eastern Heretic, Western Thief,
Southern Emperor, Northern Beggar,

298
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,390
and Central Divine, alright?

299
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,430
He wants the Nine Yin Manual.

300
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,670
Let's just create some random content.

301
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,430
In this way, Ouyang Feng will find out.

302
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,910
So

303
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,110
you must not fake everyting.

304
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,910
Part of it is real,

305
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,030
and part of it is fake.

306
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,750
If Ouyang Feng practices it,

307
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,750
what will happen to him?

308
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,390
One false step
will make a great difference.

309
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,350
Wait until he finishes practicing,

310
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,390
he will either gain nothing

311
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,350
or lead to obsession.

312
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,470
Mr. Ouyang.

313
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,070
It's done.

314
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,630
You don't need to help me.

315
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,150
- I can handle it myself.
- Master.

316
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,950
What's wrong?

317
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,190
Anyway, you guys are all amazing.

318
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,070
I'm a loser now.

319
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,710
What's wrong, Jing?

320
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,430
Master is blaming me

321
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,300
for giving the Nine Yin Manual
to Old Venomous Creature.

322
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,950
Qigong.

323
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,630
You don't know that Jing

324
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,910
gave him the fake Manual.

325
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,510
Fake?

326
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,710
Master.

327
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,790
It's Rong who taught me to do this.

328
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,070
You didn't reveal anything, did you?

329
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,600
No.

330
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,670
Old Venomous Creature seems
to be reading it seriously.

331
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,750
How did you write it?

332
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,310
It's not easy to deceive
Old Venomous Creature.

333
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,950
Let's hear it.

334
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,110
I wrote it according to the rules.

335
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,150
Facing the south,

336
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,790
so I wrote facing the west.

337
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,310
Five centers toward the sky,

338
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,150
and I wrote

339
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,990
toward the ground.

340
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,830
When I finished writing,
and gave it to him,

341
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,790
he was like this.

342
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,750
Yes, that's exactly how he was like.

343
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,550
The Nine Yin Manual.

344
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,750
This suits him very well.

345
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,190
Five centers toward the ground.

346
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,590
Isn't that just a toad?

347
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,950
Let him practice.

348
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,790
Are you guys hungry?

349
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,710
How about I go make some food?

350
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,550
What do you want to eat?

351
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,830
What delicious food
are you going to make?

352
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,550
Looks so happy.

353
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,350
What are you here for?

354
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,670
I have been taking care of you
for so many days.

355
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,430
It's time to work.

356
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,910
Nephew.

357
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,430
Cut down a hundred trees
before sunset tomorrow.

358
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,550
One tree less,
and I'll break one of your legs.

359
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,670
Two trees less,

360
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,910
two legs.

361
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,070
Who is your nephew?

362
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,550
There's no way I'm going.

363
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,390
Are you crazy?

364
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,470
That's rude.

365
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,710
You don't need to chop trees, my niece.

366
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,230
You go take care of Ke.

367
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,670
Why should I do that?

368
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,510
That's impossible.

369
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,270
Come on, Old Beggar.

370
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,390
Come with me again.

371
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,230
Come.

372
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,830
Forget it.

373
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,070
OK.

374
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,150
We'll do it.

375
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,710
Be good next time.

376
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,150
Jing.

377
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,990
Jing.

378
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,750
Last time, didn't you say

379
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,070
you wanted to be like me

380
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,870
with unparalleled martial arts skills

381
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,950
and travelling the martial world

382
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,350
as the Chief of Beggars' Gang,

383
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,630
no one can control me

384
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,390
and I can act chivalrously?

385
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,230
But you don't know

386
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,550
my grandfather,

387
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,390
my father,

388
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,830
including me when I was young,

389
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,470
all served

390
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,110
as a slave for the Jin people.

391
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,510
It was hard.

392
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,150
Really hard.

393
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,030
Master.

394
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,510
I didn't know you had
such an experience.

395
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,670
So the grievances in front of you

396
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,310
don't really count.

397
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,430
A real man

398
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,510
has to endure sufferings

399
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,630
to toughen up.

400
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,150
Moreover,

401
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,110
that girl Rong,

402
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,590
her father is Old Heretic Huang.

403
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,110
Even if the Ouyangs suffer,

404
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,990
she won't suffer any losses.

405
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,110
Isn't that right?

406
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,470
Master.

407
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,150
I seem to understand now.

408
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,550
Thank you, Master.

409
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,150
Jing.

410
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,670
This won't do.

411
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,230
Take a break.

412
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,750
Master.

413
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,870
I can continue.

414
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,910
That Old Venomous Creature

415
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,910
just wants to tire you out.

416
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,150
Now you're the hardest to deal with

417
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,550
among the three of us.

418
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,190
He asked you to cut down 100 trees today,

419
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,550
and 1,000 trees tomorrow.

420
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,710
What should you do?

421
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,590
Master.

422
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,270
Then how should I deal with it?

423
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,190
The Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms

424
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,830
are extremely powerful.

425
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,270
The only drawback

426
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,590
is that it consumes
a lot of inner force.

427
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,990
Even before I got hurt,

428
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,110
I couldn't strike 100 palms

429
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,950
in a row.

430
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,230
I haven't cut down 100 trees yet.

431
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,870
That Old Venomous Creature

432
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,230
will definitely cause trouble for us.

433
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,350
It won't work

434
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,750
cutting down those 100 trees

435
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,230
by brute force alone.

436
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,070
We need to find a clever way.

437
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,510
Mr. Zhou also mentioned it

438
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,390
to me before.

439
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,310
He said that my
''Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms''

440
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,350
are too powerful to be true.

441
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,310
So he taught me his Old Imp's Manual,

442
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,910
which is also the Nine Yin Manual.

443
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,270
He said

444
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,710
this could solve my problem.

445
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,150
But I am too dull-witted.

446
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,830
I definitely haven't figured out

447
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,950
what he taught me.

448
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,430
It's okay.

449
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,910
Jing.

450
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,070
Talk about the Nine Yin Manual

451
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,990
with me.

452
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,870
Let's figure it out together.

453
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,870
It is the Way of Heaven

454
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,990
to diminish superabundance,
and to supplement deficiency.

455
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,550
Therefore...

456
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,510
Don't always start from the beginning.

457
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,750
The beginning and the end

458
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,590
are all nonsenses.

459
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,630
Recite the middle part.

460
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,990
Cathode in the six,

461
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,830
why the word nine.

462
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,470
Change again. Change.

463
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,430
People only know
to build up inner strength

464
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,470
through meditation.

465
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,830
But they don't know that superior men

466
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,910
cultivate in both ways.

467
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,420
The effect of meditation practice
can be achived through physical exercise.

468
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,950
This is from the Nine Yin Manual?

469
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,630
Yes, this is from the Nine Yin Manual.

470
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,030
The chapter of muscle-bone strengthening.

471
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,630
Mr. Zhou just asked me

472
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,710
to memorize it by heart before.

473
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,990
These words are strange.

474
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,870
I can't understand them.

475
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,270
This is quite interesting.

476
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,070
Can you explain it to me carefully?

477
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,310
Let me give it a thought.

478
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,830
Okay.

479
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,750
At the hours of Zi, Wu, Mao, You,

480
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,350
gather the Qi in the belly
and push your palm forward.

481
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,310
Focus your mind on the belly
until you feel the Yang energy.

482
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,150
Aim the two palms
at the two acupuncture points.

483
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,670
Clasp the hands together
against the breast.

484
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,710
Rotate the vital Qi inside the body.

485
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,030
Move the energy
to the governor and conception vessels.

486
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,310
Collect the Qi in the belly
for half an hour.

487
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,790
People only know
to build up inner strength

488
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,150
through meditation.

489
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,390
But they don't know that superior men

490
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,190
adopt the principle of harmony

491
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,070
and cultivate in both ways.

492
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,150
The effect of meditation practice

493
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,630
can be achived
through physical exercise.

494
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,870
Master.

495
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,350
You have recovered.

496
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,670
It's not that quick.

497
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,870
I didn't take a magic pill.

498
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,550
Just recovered a little.

499
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,550
That's great, Master.

500
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,070
Sickness goes slowly like spinning silk.

501
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,710
It takes time to heal gradually.

502
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,470
But they don't know that superior men

503
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,870
adopt the principle of harmony

504
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,830
and cultivate in both ways.

505
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,550
This sentence has enlightened me.

506
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,550
I only practice

507
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,070
external martial arts.

508
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,870
But after being injured,

509
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,950
I only knew to meditate and sleep.

510
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,840
Little did I know that
the more I use my martial arts skills,

511
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,390
the more it helps with healing.

512
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,750
Jing, did you just feel like

513
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,750
you weren't so tired

514
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,990
when you struck that palm?

515
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,510
Yes, Master.

516
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,150
What's going on here?

517
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,790
The chapter of muscle-bone strengthening

518
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,070
adjusted your breath

519
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,830
and reduced the consumption

520
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,910
of your palm strikes.

521
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,150
This Nine Yin Manual

522
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,230
does live up to its reputation.

523
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,510
Then wouldn't I

524
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,910
cut down 100 trees

525
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,830
with ease?

526
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,070
But

527
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,150
you still have to pretend to be

528
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,310
very tired.

529
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,510
Old Venomous Creature.

530
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,390
I understand, Master.

531
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,310
Jing.

532
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,190
- Jing.
- Rong.

533
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,030
Are you tired?

534
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,670
A little.

535
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,430
They didn't bully you, did they?

536
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,350
No, don't worry.

537
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,310
Let's go back.

538
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,990
Did you finish cutting down 100 trees?

539
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,870
Why don't you count yourself?

540
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,510
It is getting late,

541
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,390
go get some food.

542
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,030
Ke is weak now.

543
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,030
We need wild foods and mountain fruits.

544
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,550
You've been ordering us around all day.

545
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,190
We've just finished cutting down trees,

546
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,910
and now you want us
to go pick fruits and cook.

547
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,830
What are you thinking about?

548
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,430
Trying to exhaust us?

549
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,270
Young people should

550
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,310
get more exercise.

551
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,830
You won't die of exhaustion.

552
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,910
Send it over within two hours.

553
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,870
Otherwise, I will have to go

554
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,910
find your master again.

555
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,310
Jing.

556
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,270
Are you exhausted?

557
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,270
I am indeed a bit tired.

558
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,110
Let's go.

559
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,470
Sit down.

560
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,670
Come on, over here.

561
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,670
Jing.

562
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,350
Stop pretending.

563
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,430
Master.

564
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,870
Jing, were you pretending?

565
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,310
Sorry, Rong,

566
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,390
Master asked me to do this.

567
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,750
Jing and I

568
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,910
studied the Nine Yin Manual.

569
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,670
His power has advanced
by leaps and bounds.

570
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,310
Now cutting down 100 trees

571
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,310
is already

572
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,990
not a problem for him.

573
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,470
My skills

574
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,910
are also starting to recover
little by little.

575
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,670
Really?

576
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,510
Shh.

577
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,870
Old Venomous Creature is cunning.

578
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,350
Don't let him find out about this.

579
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,670
Or if he takes action against us now,

580
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,750
none of us can resist.

581
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,470
But we definitely
can't hide it from him for too long.

582
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,670
We still need to figure out a solution.

583
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,670
It's okay.

584
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,350
If he lets me cut down
more trees tomorrow,

585
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,390
I'll just pretend to be more tired.

586
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:14,750
Oh my goodness.

587
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,590
What are you doing so early?

588
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,030
There is no one on this island

589
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,270
who can wake up later than me.

590
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,750
Then can I beg you

591
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,430
to get up a little later?

592
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,790
Mr. Western Venom.

593
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,390
What are your orders again?

594
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,230
Build a boat with

595
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,470
the 100 tress in three days.

596
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,430
It should be able to shelter
from wind and rain.

597
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,270
I can't let Ke suffer.

598
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,030
I can cut down trees for you

599
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,950
to build a wooden raft,

600
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,510
but I don't know how to build a boat.

601
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,710
You silly boy.

602
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,590
I don't expect much from you.

603
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,270
My niece is from Peach Blossom Island.

604
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,350
She grew up by the sea.

605
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,470
Building a boat shouldn't be
a problem for her, right?

606
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,790
Yes, Mr. Western Venom.

607
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,830
I did learn boatbuilding from my father.

608
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,390
So I guarantee that
the boat will be solidly built.

609
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,350
We also need food and fresh water.

610
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,470
Okay.

611
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,470
All will be prepared.

612
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:04,990
Good.

613
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,270
You've finally come around.

614
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,190
We will build a wooden boat
for Ouyang Feng during the day,

615
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,510
and secretly build a raft at night.

616
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,110
Uncle.

617
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,030
Why not wait for Rong and the others

618
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,230
to build the boat before we leave?

619
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,590
That boat can provide shelter
from wind and rain.

620
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,830
This raft

621
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,510
doesn't look safe.

622
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,550
You should make do with it first.

623
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,390
I can't trust them.

624
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,110
This raft can save our lives.

625
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,270
Better get ashore quickly

626
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,590
to cure your legs.

627
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,470
Okay.

628
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,190
I will listen to you, Uncle.

629
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,270
Old Venomous Creature.

630
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,270
You stole our raft.

631
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,310
Do you have no shame?

632
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,230
We cut down hundreds of trees

633
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,070
to build a boat for you.

634
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,110
Why did you steal our small raft?

635
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,190
The boat is very comfortable.

636
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,270
See you later.

637
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,190
Can't stop them.

638
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,070
Last time we gave them
a seasoned roasted rabbit.

639
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,230
This time, a sinkable raft.

640
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,270
We someow enforced justice

641
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,510
and helped the martial world
get rid of the two Venomous Creatures.

642
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,750
Rong.

643
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,950
You gussed everything right.

644
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,470
Old Venomous Creature

645
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,950
is ruined by his own wisdom.

646
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,470
He brought this upon himself.

647
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,390
Jing.

648
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,910
We can now leave here

649
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,150
with our master securely.

650
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,870
Let's set off quickly.

651
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,230
Let's go.

652
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,230
Alright.

653
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,430
Master.

654
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,670
Rong.

655
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,590
It's time for us to go.

656
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,230
The three of us

657
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,790
almost died on this island.

658
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,070
I feel a bit reluctant

659
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,030
to leave here today.

660
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,270
Rong.

661
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,230
If you can't bear to leave here,

662
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,310
we will revisit here

663
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,550
when we are free.

664
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,630
Okay.

665
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,550
But if we are going to revisit,

666
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,230
let's come up with a name for it.

667
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,870
Master.

668
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,630
You can give this island a name.

669
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,230
Let's call it Ghost-crushing Island.

670
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,070
We crushed the little ghost
with the rock here.

671
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,030
- Ghost-crushing Island.
- Ghost-crushing Island.

672
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,270
This island

673
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,830
is the place of rebirth
for the three of us.

674
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,910
I don't want it to have something

675
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,150
to do with the Small Venomous Creature.

676
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,870
Then you can figure it out yourself.

677
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,190
I can't come up

678
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,310
with a good name.

679
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,790
Think about it.

680
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,750
I look afar at vast sea
while pacing around.

681
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,710
Glow casts on clear sky and limpid water.

682
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,790
Just call it Glow Cast Island.

683
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,270
Okay.

684
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,230
Glow Cast Island.

685
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,830
Rong, isn't that the raft

686
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,190
we built for Ouyang Feng?

687
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,510
Master.

688
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,350
The two Venomous Creatures

689
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,710
were eaten by some shark.

690
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,990
Old Venomous Creature,

691
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,710
I don't want to part with you.

692
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,030
But you have to think for yourself,

693
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,870
why are you so wicked?

694
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,030
We three old folks

695
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,470
have lost you.

696
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,190
Master, you just need some rest.

697
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,310
You'll be the Northern Beggar again.

698
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,870
- Master, Master.
- It's fine.

699
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,470
- Master.
- Stand still.

700
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,950
Master, be careful.

701
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,790
It's okay.

702
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,030
Hold me.

703
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,190
Quick, look!

704
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,230
There is a big ship ahead.

705
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,590
Call them.

706
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,110
Look here.

707
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,550
It's you guys.

708
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,350
What a small world.

709
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,430
Kang.

710
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,510
Didn't you go back to Niujia Village?

711
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,030
Why are you with him again?

712
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,710
Do you still need to ask?

713
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,910
He's their henchman of course.

714
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,710
Snake thief.

715
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,070
Eavesdropping thief.

716
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,910
Seeing your lifesaver,

717
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,950
why don't you kneel down?

718
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,430
This is the enemy who killed my father.

719
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,710
It seems today

720
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,510
Heaven arranged for me to take revenge.

721
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,230
Stop!

722
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,990
After we parted on the deserted island,

723
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,870
I didn't expect
to meet you again so soon.

724
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,430
Aren't they Old Venomous Creature

725
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,710
and Small Venomous Creature?

726
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,030
What?

727
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,430
You're full of poison

728
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,910
so even the sharks don't care to eat you?

729
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,110
What a sharp tongue.

730
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,710
Be careful, I'll throw you down
to feed the sharks.

731
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,990
Chief Hong.

732
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,230
To a top talent in the martial world,

733
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,550
our Sixth Prince of the Jin Empire

734
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,910
is really... What is it called?

735
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,390
There is a saying in the Central Plains,

736
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,550
can't wait to drink someone.

737
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,390
What is it called?

738
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,430
- How would I know?
- It's called being thirst for talents.

739
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,390
Yes, yes, yes.

740
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,110
Being thirst for talents.

741
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,390
Me and my disciples

742
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,150
don't want much to do
with the Jin people.

743
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,310
That's right.

744
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,590
We don't know the two Venomous Creatures

745
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,470
and this Jin person surnamed Yang

746
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,790
at all.

747
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,710
Since we are all strangers to each other,

748
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,710
then...

749
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,430
Someone.

750
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,270
Yes.

751
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,950
- Throw these three into the sea.
- Yes.

752
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,790
- Your Highness.
- Father.

753
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,230
I have some kind of relationship

754
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,510
with these three tough-talking people.

755
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,190
Let's give them a ride.

756
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,670
Since Mr. Ouyang

757
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,590
pleaded for you,

758
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,590
I will spare their lives.

759
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,950
Take them down.

760
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,230
I didn't wrongly accuse
your sworn brother, right?

761
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,350
That day,

762
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,030
he swore solemnly

763
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,990
to heaven and earth.

764
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,190
I thought I had lost my parents,

765
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,750
but I got a brother.

766
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,670
Unexpectedly...

767
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,470
Times change, and people change.

768
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,110
Maybe at that time,

769
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,870
he wanted to change and start anew.

770
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,230
But today, Wanyan Honglie

771
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,230
saved us.

772
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,990
The former father-killer

773
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,590
has become the savior.

774
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,830
I really can't figure it out

775
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,830
this unpredictable world.

776
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,990
Then just think less about it.

777
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,190
The most important thing now is

778
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,270
to find something

779
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,790
to fill our stomaches.

780
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,150
Yes, Jing.

781
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,470
Let's figure out a solution

782
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,510
to get enough to eat.

783
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,470
Master.

784
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,430
How about I break the door?

785
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,150
Let's fight our way out.

786
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,870
Sure.

787
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,150
What's the plan after we break out?

788
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,030
Go back to the sea again?

789
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,950
Let me ask you.

790
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,870
This time you returned to the palace,

791
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,510
and also became sworn brothers

792
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,230
with Guo Xiaotian's son.

793
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,150
Why is that?

794
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,430
Father,

795
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,230
I became sworn brothers with Guo Jing

796
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,070
just because I heard

797
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,070
he has deep ties with

798
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,990
the Nine Yin Manual.

799
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,950
And it seems that

800
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,910
the Nine Yin Manual is really

801
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,990
in his hand.

802
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,390
Otherwise, why would Ouyang Feng
speak for them?

803
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,030
This is just what you think.

804
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,030
How could others guess your intentions?

805
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,270
You became Guo Jing's sworn brother.

806
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,670
Have you ever thought about me?

807
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,670
You are not my biological child.

808
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,150
If you do this,

809
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,430
how will the people around me say?

810
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,670
What will it make them think?

811
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,990
Father,

812
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,430
you know clearly

813
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,390
my loyalty to you.

814
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,070
I'm loyal to you

815
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,950
and to the Jin Empire.

816
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,190
But at the moment,

817
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,230
we failed to help Ouyang Feng

818
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,270
get the Nine Yin Manual.

819
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,030
It may be difficult to convince him

820
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,710
to help us seize the Book of Wumu.

821
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,230
If I pretend to be close to him,

822
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,870
and make Guo Jing tell me

823
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,720
the whereabouts of the Manual,
then get it for Ouyang Feng,

824
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,150
maybe he can help us.

825
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,990
Father.

826
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,790
In the martial world,

827
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,830
Guo Jing

828
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,350
was just a nobody.

829
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,710
I didn't expect him to be so capable.

830
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,710
First, he learned superior martial arts

831
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,310
from Chief Hong Qigong.

832
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,190
Now he even laid his eyes

833
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,310
up the Nine Yin Manual.

834
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,990
I heard that even Ouyang Ke

835
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,590
may be no match for him.

836
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,630
How can you be so sure

837
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,630
that your plan

838
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,070
will succeed?

839
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,270
(Guo Jing.)

840
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,110
(Guo Jing, Guo Jing, Guo Jing.)

841
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,390
(Lingering like a shadow.)

842
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,430
(Your existence is an insult to me!)

843
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,750
Why would Hong Qigong

844
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,150
like you, a numskull,

845
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,750
so does the daughter of Huang Yaoshi?

846
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,630
Even Ouyang Feng wants to save your life.

847
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,470
Why?

848
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,190
All day,

849
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,870
you're accompanied b
y Huang Yaoshi's daughter,

850
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,950
but Huang Yaoshi's mere disciple

851
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,910
became my master.

852
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,030
Why is God treating me like this?

853
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,710
Kang.

854
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,350
Don't be like this.

855
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,270
Have you been here all the time?

856
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,950
I heard everything.

857
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,870
Kang.

858
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,310
Guo Jing is your sworn brother.

859
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,990
If he's doing well,

860
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,630
it's a good thing for you too.

861
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,190
I understand.

862
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,430
They are still locked up now.

863
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,550
When shall we

864
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,390
go and rescue them?

865
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:09,670
Nianci.

866
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,350
Now is not the right time yet.

867
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,150
But you can rest assured.

868
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,590
I will definitely rescue them.

869
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,270
Even if I'm not content
to be below Guo Jing,

870
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,590
I will definitely beat him

871
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,470
fair and square.

872
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,470
I will never win him

873
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,310
by the hand of others.

874
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,230
I believe

875
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,990
that one day,

876
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,230
you will definitely

877
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,310
impress everyone.
