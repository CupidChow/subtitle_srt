00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,060
Sir, take a look at this.

4
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,190
Try it.

5
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,750
It's free to have a try.

6
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,060
Steamed buns.

7
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,620
Hot steamed buns.

8
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
Not bad, right?

9
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,550
Help me choose one.

10
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,310
Jing.

11
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,730
Unscrupulous!

12
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,420
Unscrupulous!

13
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,260
Unscrupulous!

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,350
- If I can't get revenge,
- Master.

15
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,300
- I'd rather die.
- Master.

16
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,960
- Master.
- Jing.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,020
Master, what's wrong with you?

18
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,530
Where are the other masters?

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,710
Jing, it's not convenient here.

20
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,370
Let's take Master to the inn
to rest first.

21
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,360
Little witch, you are also here.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
Little witch!

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,580
I will take your life!

24
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,520
Master, you haven't...

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,690
Who is your master?

26
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,150
Jing

27
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,460
has got some abilities

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,220
to dare to hit me.

29
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,830
You dare to hit me!

30
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,430
Master, I wouldn't dare

31
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,370
to offend you.

32
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,810
It was an accident.

33
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,400
Please punish me, Master.

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,850
You ungrateful

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,180
and treacherous guy.

36
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,740
You have Master Huang
as your father-in-law,

37
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,250
Hong Qigong as your master.

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,900
We Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,480
don't deserve to be your masters.

40
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,320
Master.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,800
Mr. Ke.

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Well,

43
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,480
I taught Jing

44
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,500
that move.

45
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
How about I

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,990
apologize to you? Is that okay?

47
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't be angry, okay?

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,690
Eastern Heretic, Western Venom,

49
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,370
Southern Emperor and Northern Beggar.

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,580
Just because you have
unparalleled martial arts skills,

51
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,580
you think you can dominate the world.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,250
He who is unjust
is doomed to destruction.

53
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,690
I can't deal with you,

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,850
but Heaven will.

55
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Master.

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,590
What did Qigong

57
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,550
and my father do to you?

58
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,580
Don't talk to me.

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Guo Jing.

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,930
If you still remember

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,970
the kindness
of the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan,

62
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,060
take the lives

63
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,870
of Old Heretic Huang

64
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,080
and this little witch.

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
Master.

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,400
How did Rong and Master Huang

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,310
offend you?

68
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,220
If you don't want to kill them,

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,850
I won't bother to ask again.

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,410
Today, we can have

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,740
a clean break.

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,650
I know now.

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,580
The one who should die

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,810
is not this little witch.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,410
My brothers

76
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,220
deserved it.

77
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,670
Master.

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,240
Master.

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Don't worry.

80
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,940
Master just got too excited.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,170
He'll recover after resting
for a few days.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
Master.

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,390
Do you know

84
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,610
what's wrong with my master?

85
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,830
I don't know.

86
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,160
I don't think there is

87
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,220
enmity and malice

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,700
between Old Heretic Huang
and your master.

89
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,480
But when I saw him,

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,290
he was already so angry
that he lost his mind.

91
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,280
Can you see

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,580
my other masters?

93
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,790
No.

94
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,580
This is strange.

95
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,430
My masters

96
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,970
are always together.

97
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,850
They've never acted alone.

98
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,580
Let's not jump to conclusions for now.

99
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,950
I guess

100
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,870
Master won't tell us

101
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,710
anything now.

102
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,220
Why don't we go back
to Peach Blossom Island

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
and ask my father?

104
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,090
Then everything will become clear.

105
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
That's right.

106
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,800
Don't worry.

107
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,720
Your master is here.

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,920
Me and Old Imp will take care of him.

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,780
He will be fine.

110
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,310
You should hurry back to the island

111
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,530
and get things sorted out.

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,710
Jing, let's leave now.

113
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,790
Okay.

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
By the way, Master,

115
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
a few days ago,

116
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,580
Reverend Yideng saved Rong and I.

117
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,750
And by chance,

118
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,160
he translated the strange chapter

119
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,260
in the Nine Yin Manual.

120
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,730
He instructed us to tell you

121
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,700
that if you open up your meridians

122
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,870
following the methods on the manual,

123
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,650
your martial arts skills
will naturally be restored.

124
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,910
Here.

125
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,970
You've met Emperor Duan?

126
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,150
Okay.

127
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,190
If he said I could restore my skills,

128
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,900
then I definitely will.

129
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
Don't worry.

130
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,470
Hurry up and go.

131
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,050
Yes, Master.

132
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,380
I suddenly feel very scared.

133
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,470
What's wrong?

134
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,140
I don't know why.

135
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,970
I just feel

136
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,510
panic in my heart

137
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,900
at the thought of your master

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,730
asking you to kill me.

139
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,990
I feel that one day

140
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,140
you will listen to his words.

141
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
Rong.

142
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,610
You are the most beloved person to me.

143
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,070
I would rather die

144
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,910
a thousand times myself.

145
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,970
How could I ever kill you?

146
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,340
What if your mother, your masters,

147
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,800
and your friends

148
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,650
on the grassland

149
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,020
all ask you kill me?

150
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
Will you do it?

151
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,190
Even if everyone in the world

152
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,410
gives you a hard time,

153
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,850
maybe I cannot protect you,

154
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,290
but I will die before you.

155
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Don't worry about it.

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,020
- Well...
- Rong.

157
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,530
Do you think we have arrived?

158
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,620
(Tomb of Ms. Feng,
mistress of Peach Blossom Island)

159
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Mother.

160
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,830
Seventh Master.

161
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,340
Seventh Master.

162
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,110
Second Master.

163
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,440
Second Master, wake up!

164
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,460
Second Master.

165
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,420
This is my mother's sacrificial offering.

166
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,220
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

167
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
Third Master.

168
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,090
Sixth Master.

169
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,040
Fourth Master.

170
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Dad.

171
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,280
Fourth Master.

172
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,220
Fourth Master.

173
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,230
Dad.

174
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,830
Dad.

175
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,730
This is your father's clothes.

176
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,700
He must have wiped it

177
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,670
after killing my third master

178
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,600
with Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

179
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Why would my father

180
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,460
kill your masters?

181
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,200
Perhaps Marvellous-Handed Scholar

182
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,180
got greedy

183
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,870
and touched the treasures

184
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,790
in my mother's grave,

185
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,220
that's why he displeased my dad.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,670
Ke Zhen'e, Zhu Cong,

187
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,130
Han Baoju, Nan Xiren,

188
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,080
Quan Jinfa and Han Xiaoying

189
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,770
pay respects to Master Huang

190
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,250
of Peach Blossom Island.

191
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,540
We heard the rumor

192
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,870
that the Immortals of Quanzhen
misbelieved what others said

193
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,780
and are going to cause trouble
on Peach Blossom Island.

194
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,090
We know it's a misunderstanding

195
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,250
but our words don't carry much weight.

196
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,730
The Quanzhen School

197
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,090
must mistakenly think

198
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,770
your father killed Tan Chuduan,

199
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,090
so they're coming to seek revenge.

200
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,340
My masters must have

201
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,010
come to mediate with good intentions,

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,960
but your father thought

203
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,450
they were the helpers
of the Quanzhen School,

204
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,250
so he killed them all.

205
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,270
If it was really my father,

206
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,120
why would he

207
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,770
kill our servant too?

208
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,200
At present,

209
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,460
I don't know if my dad's dead or alive.

210
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,370
Why are you sure it's him?

211
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,540
On this island,

212
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,300
apart from your father,

213
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,270
who else has the ability
to trick my masters

214
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,660
into your mother's grave

215
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,370
and kill them all?

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,440
If my father really wanted

217
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,360
to kill your masters,

218
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
why would he bother

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,370
to take them into the grave?

220
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,830
What does it mean?

221
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,460
You are disrespecting my masters.

222
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,300
Let's calm down.

223
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,970
There are still a lot of
questions about this.

224
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,890
Before finding my father,

225
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
let's not jump to conclusions.

226
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,560
Okay?

227
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,990
But my other masters

228
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,830
are all dead.

229
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,220
I haven't found my Fourth Master yet.

230
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,300
Rong.

231
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,060
You are innocent.

232
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,700
But I must avenge

233
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,220
my masters.

234
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,700
From now on,

235
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,610
the only thing I will do

236
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,660
is to seek revenge on Old Heretic Huang.

237
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,140
(Pro-)

238
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,660
(Martial)

239
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,340
(This doesn't belong to my mother.)

240
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,850
Fourth Master.

241
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,830
Fourth Master.

242
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,090
Fourth Master.

243
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,820
Fourth Master.

244
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,230
Fourth Master.

245
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,040
Fourth Master.

246
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,750
Fourth Master.

247
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,510
Fourth Master.

248
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,830
Fourth Master.

249
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,560
It's me, Fourth Master.

250
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,540
I am Guo Jing.

251
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,470
Fourth Master.

252
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,960
Sorry I'm late.

253
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,890
You can kill me with the rock.

254
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,400
Fourth Master.

255
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,510
Fourth Master.

256
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,590
Fourth Master.

257
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,220
I am Guo Jing.

258
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,440
Guo Jing.

259
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,400
You tell me.

260
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,990
Who did this to you?

261
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,830
Tell me.

262
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,830
Who is it?

263
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,850
Tell me.

264
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,470
You want to write?

265
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,510
Master.

266
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,080
Fourth Master.

267
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,250
Fourth Master.

268
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,970
Old Heretic Huang.

269
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,860
(Tomb of Deceased Masters)

270
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,770
(Second Master,)

271
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,270
(Third Master,)

272
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,880
(Fourth Master,)

273
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,030
(Sixth Master,)

274
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,790
(Seventh Master.)

275
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,490
(We made a deal)

276
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,290
(to have a drink
at Drunken Immortal Tower.)

277
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,380
(Huang Yaoshi
made an unforgiven mistake.)

278
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,010
(Rong did nothing wrong.)

279
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,490
(But how can I still be with her?)

280
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,180
(Now she is)

281
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,190
(the daughter)

282
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,220
(of my mortal enemy.)

283
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,340
(Start-Drunk)

284
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,570
My kindness to you

285
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,900
was all sincere.

286
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,860
I will always remember

287
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,570
your kindness to me.

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,430
You don't have to remember it.

289
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,290
It'll only add to the pain.

290
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,100
This wine is called "Start-Drunk".

291
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,960
Drink it

292
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,490
and you'll forget the one you love.

293
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,290
There's still half a jar left.

294
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,900
My father had a few drinks

295
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,570
in order to forget my mother.

296
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,270
Now,

297
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,910
you want to cut ties with me

298
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,100
for your masters.

299
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,570
It's better for us

300
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,420
to completely forget
those beautiful memories

301
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,030
of the past.

302
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,860
If one day I kill your father,

303
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,330
will you resent me?

304
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,070
Okay.

305
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,660
Go find my father for revenge.

306
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,810
Return to your grassland

307
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,770
and marry Huazheng
to be the Gold Knife Prince Consort.

308
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,200
Drink it up.

309
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,220

Jing.

355
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,960
Jing.

356
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,030
Dear fellow Taoists.

357
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,900
What's wrong with you?

358
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,600
How did you

359
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,860
come to Peach Blossom Island alone?

360
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,860
Where are your masters?

361
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,420
My five masters are gone.

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,790

363
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,030
What are you saying?

364
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,140
Except for my First Master,

365
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,620
my other five masters are all gone.

366
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,620
I don't know why.

367
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,730
They died so tragically

368
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,730
on Peach Blossom Island.

369
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,700
On Peach Blossom Island?

370
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,050
It must be Huang Yaoshi.

371
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,140
Old Heretic Huang

372
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,940
always vents his anger on others.

373
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,010
It must be his masters

374
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,860
tried to plead for our Quanzhen School

375
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,730
that's why they got killed.

376
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,050
Is Huang Yaoshi crazy?

377
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,330
When two countries are at war,
the envoys must not be killed.

378
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,330
Not to mention
these six heroes of Jiangnan

379
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,530
are guests on Peach Blossom Island.

380
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,010
I have always regarded my masters

381
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,700
as my parents.

382
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,710
They spared no effort

383
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,180
teaching me martial arts
for over a decade.

384
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,360
Now,

385
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,770
I have learned some skills,

386
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,860
but I haven't had a chance to repay them.

387
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,530
Jing, don't cry.

388
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,680
Let's go.

389
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,660
Let's go to the island to find him.

390
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,400
Taoist Ma.

391
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,620
He is not on the island.

392
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,660
I don't know where he went.

393
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,860
Jing, don't worry,

394
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,140
we have reorganized the Tiangang
Big Dipper Formation.

395
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,950
Now my disciple

396
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,100
will take Tan Chuduan's position.

397
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,460
You go back with us first.

398
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,140
We will help you

399
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,970
avenge your masters.

400
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,550
Get up.

401
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,200
Please come inside.

402
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,400
Come, this way.

403
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,360
Chief.

404
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,470
Junior brother.

405
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,860
How is the arrangement?

406
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,330
Everything has been arranged.

407
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,670
All the disciples of Quanzhen School

408
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,900
have sent out invitations.

409
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,220
All martial artists in Jiangnan now know

410
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,180
we will have a duel
with Huang Yaoshi here.

411
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,180
After all, he is a grandmaster.

412
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,810
He will definitely come
when he hears the news.

413
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,490
Huang Yaoshi is here.

414
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,280
Good.

415
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,120
Jing, stay.

416
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,270
We'll take care of it.

417
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,600
Old Heretic Huang,

418
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,180
today

419
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,390
let's resolve

420
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,530
all our grudges together.

421
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,100
I didn't look for you,

422
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,140
but you're seeking death.

423
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,970
(Holding a post without qualifications.)

424
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,200
This...

425
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,640
Master.

426
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,710
Jing.

427
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,470
Master.

428
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,550
Ke Zhen'e.

429
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,840
- Aren't you on the island?
- It's not my desnity to die.

430
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,490
I'll seek revenge for my brothers
from you.

431
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,120
I know

432
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,380
Old Heretic Huang well.

433
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,010
Although he is a bit eccentric,

434
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,770
when it comes to indiscriminate killing,

435
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,280
he can't bear to do it.

436
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,800
When Old Heretic Huang gets angry,

437
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,280
he can even hurt his own disciple.

438
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,100
So why can't he do it now?

439
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,270
What does it mean?

440
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,910
Where are your skills?

441
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,810
Take a good look at it.

442
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,530
If it weren't for
Old Heretic Huang showing mercy,

443
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,660
those people would have died
several times.

444
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,630
Tiangang Big Dipper Formation
has been broken.

445
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,620
It can't last until now.

446
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,920
And also,

447
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,600
if your five masters

448
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,330
were really killed by Old Heretic Huang,

449
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,520
why didn't he kill

450
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,420
your First Master?

451
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,080
Master must have

452
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,920
fought his way out.

453
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,250
Don't let anger cloud your judgment.

454
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Your other five masters

455
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,010
are young

456
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,380
and have good vision.

457
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,390
How come only your First Master

458
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,250
escaped?

459
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,160
Master.

460
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,960
Master.

461
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
Guo Jing.

462
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,230
Where is Rong?

463
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,510
Fellow Taoists,

464
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,620
I will join you to reinforce
the Big Dipper Formation.

465
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

466
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,230
Set the formation.

467
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,230
I'm asking you, where's Rong?

468
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,070
Give me your life.

469
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,870
(This brat)

470
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,940
(is not that silly.)

471
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,010
(Steady in the North Pole position.)

472
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,660
(Interesting.)

473
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,510
Jing, wait a moment.

474
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,120
I have something to say.

475
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:13,990
Master Huang.

476
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,400
Let me ask you,

477
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,900
the blood debt of
Martial Uncle Zhou and Tan,

478
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,080
and the innocent lives

479
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,700
of the five Freaks of Jiangnan

480
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,620
are all thanks to you.

481
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,700
Yes, and no?

482
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,100
Alright,

483
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,660
if you say so.

484
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,860
Kill me

485
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,290
will enhance the reputation
of your Quanzhen School.

486
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,000
Wouldn't it be better?

487
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,460
We are an authentic sect,

488
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,570
not ruthless bandits
who kill indiscriminately.

489
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,050
We need to clear things out
before we kill.

490
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,330
How many things in this world

491
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,770
can be

492
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,290
explained clearly?

493
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,050
No need to talk more.

494
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,420
Ladies and gentlemen,

495
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,530
- please.
- Wait a moment.

496
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,710
Dear fellow Taoists,

497
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,460
Taoist Tan was killed by Ouyang Feng.

498
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,770
Mr. Zhou did not die.

499
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,070
Jing.

500
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,900
Is this true?

501
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,840
Ouyang Feng sneak attacked Taoist Tan,

502
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,770
I saw it with my own eyes.

503
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,420
Mr. Zhou did not die.

504
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,120
My master and Qigong both can testify it.

505
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,570
Jing is right.

506
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,700
Old Imp is still alive.

507
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
He has been with me these days.

508
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,880
Qigong.

509
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,280
Since Martial Uncle Zhou's death

510
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,180
is a misunderstanding,

511
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,840
your disciple Mei Chaofeng

512
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
and my senior brother Tan

513
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,940
died from a misunderstanding too,

514
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,680
the feud between us

515
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,050
is over.

516
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,320
But the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

517
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,570
are our friends.

518
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,050
They're also righteous people
in the martial world.

519
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,440
Today,

520
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,810
you have to give us an explanation.

521
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,010
What exactly did I do

522
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,570
and why do I have to explain to you?

523
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,710
Fellow Taoists,

524
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,620
since there's a misunderstanding

525
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,900
between you and Old Heretic Huang,

526
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,620
then I'll take

527
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,530
my own revenge.

528
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,100
What grudges

529
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,010
do I have against you, brat?

530
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,510
Zhu Cong.

531
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,530
Han Baoju.

532
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,660
Nan Xiren.

533
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,730
Quan Jinfa.

534
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,620
Han Xiaoying.

535
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,290
All my five masters were killed by you.

536
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,900
You don't have the guts to admit it?

537
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,230
At this moment,

538
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,600
they are on my Peach Blossom Island.

539
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,330
I told my servant to treat them well.

540
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,770
What on earth are you talking about?

541
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,230
I buried my five masters

542
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,250
with my own hands.

543
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,290
Did I wrong you?

544
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,250
If I killed someone,

545
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
would I be afraid

546
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,460
to admit it?

547
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,750
Okay.

548
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,460
Then I will make you pay with your life.

549
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,510
Dad.

550
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,810
You didn't kill them.

551
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,860
Why do you want to
take the blame on yourself?

552
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,010
You have been

553
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,490
in Yuezhou for so long.

554
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,050
Did you get it done?

555
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,010
What took you so long?

556
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,790
This kid,

557
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,100
has he made his decision?

558
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,230
Dad.

559
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,280
Jing's five masters

560
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,330
weren't killed by you, right?

561
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,010
Even if I did kill them,

562
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,860
there's nothing wrong with that.

563
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,910
Your Senior Mei

564
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,280
had grudges

565
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,490
against the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

566
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,670
It wasn't you who killed them, Dad.

567
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,770
I know it wasn't you.

568
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,800
Don't listen to this Old Heretic

569
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,860
and this little witch.

570
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,280
Although I am blind,

571
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
I could still hear that outside the tomb,

572
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,080
your Sixth Master's weighbeam

573
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,460
was broken by someone.

574
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,120
Except for that Old Heretic,

575
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,600
who else has such high skills?

576
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,440
That's right.

577
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,550
Let's do it.

578
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,120
Hold on.

579
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,290
I have something to say.

580
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,460
Everyone in front of me is a master.

581
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,280
But you all act
recklessly and irresponsibly

582
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,700
and talk nonsense.

583
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,800
Please speak clearly, Senior.

584
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,660
Where are the people
who were supposed to fight with you?

585
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,770
Liang Ziweng, Peng Lianhu and the others

586
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,190
are not here yet.

587
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,860
The enemies have not arrived yet.

588
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,870
Why are you fighting

589
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,050
with your own people?

590
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,800
Picking a fight.

591
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,100
If all of you die,

592
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,320
who will fight with the enemies?

593
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,280
Do you want them

594
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,100
to laugh at us?

595
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,140
You're right, Senior.

596
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,710
Old Heretic Huang.

597
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,100
You old thing.

598
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,180
(Wine)

599
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,030
Yaoshi.

600
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,910
Do you know the other name

601
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,330
of the southern lake there?

602
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,920
Yuanyang Lake.

603
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,290
Right.

604
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,420
By the side of the Yuanyang Lake,

605
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,050
the young couple
is having a little fight.

606
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,870
As the father-in-law,
aren't you going to mediate?

607
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,010
He is not my father-in-law.

608
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,220
He killed my five masters,

609
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,180
and I want to kill him now.

610
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,120
Your five masters

611
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,560
were not killed by my father.

612
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,450
I don't want to argue with you.

613
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,880
Dad.

614
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,570
You didn't do it,
why do you admit it?

615
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,180
I just don't understand.

616
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,570
There are so many
good choices in this world.

617
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,600
Why do you have to

618
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,100
choose him?

619
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,140
Good things break easily.

620
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,530
Clouds easily scatters,
and glass easily shatters.

621
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,730
Okay, okay.

622
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,570
Not to mention Rong,

623
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,150
even I don't believe

624
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,990
it was done by you.

625
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,510
Mr. Ke.

626
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,490
Your five brothers died tragically

627
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,910
and you feel anxious.

628
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,710
But don't let the bad guys

629
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,810
take advantage of this.

630
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,070
Jing.

631
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,200
Listen to me.

632
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,630
Let's get to the bottom

633
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,800
of this matter together.

634
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,810
If after the investigation,

635
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,390
you find it was done
by Old Heretic Huang,

636
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,120
I will help you

637
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,080
take revenge.

638
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,600
My master is the most reasonable.

639
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,890
What exactly happened?

640
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,000
Someone went to your island

641
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,710
and killed Jing's

642
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,140
five masters

643
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,410
while you weren't there.

644
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,080
This person must have planned it
for a long time.

645
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,150
Could it be that
there's a bigger conspiracy

646
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,450
at the Drunken Immortal Tower?

647
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,580
(Drunken Immortal Tower)
You traitor.

648
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,410
I thought you had
already turned over a new leaf,

649
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,190
but I didn't expect you
to betray us again

650
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,400
and collaborate with the enemy.

651
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,350
Today, I will help you

652
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,290
kill this traitor.

653
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,100
Master, you have been tired
from the long journey.

654
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,270
I will definitely be

655
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,430
- more filial to you in the future.
- You...

656
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,850
- Senior.
- Junior.

657
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,450
It's true that birds of a feather
flock together.

658
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,600
Wanyan Kang really can't live

659
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,700
without these people.

660
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,700
Guo Jing can live without you.

661
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,980
It shows that
you are not the same kind of people.

662
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,080
I had a falling out with Jing.

663
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,410
Even my dad just learned that.

664
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,670
How did you know?

665
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,500
Old Venomous Creature,

666
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,500
why are you with them?

667
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,550
Guo Jing.

668
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,580
We'll settle Ke's account later.

669
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,840
Yaoshi.

670
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,450
Did those juniors bully you again?

671
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,770
I'll teach them a lesson for you.

672
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,250
They can't form the Big Dipper Formation.

673
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,180
The Quanzhen School is finished.

674
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,270
If Jing is willing to listen to Rong,

675
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,270
there might still be some hope

676
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,620
with his help.

677
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,410
Always talking about seeking revenge.

678
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,270
When it's time to kill the enemy,

679
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,330
you're turning a blind eye.

680
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,410
Okay.

681
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,120
Now I'll kill

682
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,450
this Jin person to avange Father.

683
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,850
And then I'll settle accounts
with Old Heretic Huang.

684
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,710
You fool, do you want the Quanzhen School

685
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,550
to perish with you?

686
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,350
Jing

687
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,730
still listens to Rong.

688
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,990
Stupid.

689
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,500
Thieves.

690
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,670
What are you waiting for?

691
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:47,990
Come on.

692
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,270
Blind man.

693
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,110
You're asking for death.

694
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,350
You're bullying a blind man together.

695
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,190
Does it make you look good?

696
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,290
Little witch.

697
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,450
Who wants you to save me?

698
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,390
Do you think I want to save you?

699
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,310
It's just that the misunderstanding
between you and my dad

700
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,150
hasn't been cleared up yet.

701
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,500
If you die,

702
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,850
my father's reputation will be ruined.

703
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,710
In the past, they were together

704
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,810
doing evil.

705
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,960
Now only one of the seven people

706
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,890
is alive,

707
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,370
and you say we're bullying him?

708
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,020
How did you know

709
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,410
only one of them is alive?

710
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,770
You came at the right time.

711
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,770
Let's settle all the scores together.

712
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,320
Why don't you go down?

713
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,080
It seems you have learned a lot

714
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,180
from Old Venomous Creature.

715
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,960
I guess you made the right choice

716
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,850
being his disciple.

717
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,290
I just feel sorry for Ouyang Ke.

718
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,500
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

719
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,100
Didn't you say you wouldn't meddle?

720
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,920
Retreat first.

721
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,790
Big Brother, you're here.

722
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,190
- Yeah, my brother.
- Are you okay?

723
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,030
I'm fine.

724
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,960
Martial Uncle.

725
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,150
- Martial Uncle Zhou.
- Martial Uncle.

726
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,040
You are really not dead!

727
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,880
Not dead.

728
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,480
What do you mean?

729
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,040
Are you hoping I'm dead?

730
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,880
I dare not.

731
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,110
He's going to die.

732
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,310
Old Venomous Creature.

733
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,710
What kind of grandmaster are you

734
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,440
to bully my younger brother
and my fellow men.

735
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,250
- Let's have a match today.
- Are you okay?

736
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,440
I'm not in the mood today

737
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,370
to play with you.

738
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,880
Your Royal Highness.

739
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,190
What does it mean?

740
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,290
After we part today,
I'll never see you again.

741
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,450
We will meet again.

742
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,960
Not fun, not fun.

743
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,060
Why does he always want to leave?

744
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,320
Guo Jing.

745
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,390
(Drunken Immortal Tower)
Since we were sworn brothers before,

746
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,190
if you hand over the Book of Wumu

747
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,030
now,

748
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,620
I will let you off.

749
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,030
Otherwise,

750
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,770
the Drunken Immortal Tower

751
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,370
will be where you die today.

752
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,980
I'll give you half an hour
to think about it.

753
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,440
The lives of these martial artists

754
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,140
depend on you today.

755
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,410
You must think carefully.

756
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,980
How could there be
so many officials and soldiers?

757
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,560
Wanyan Honglie

758
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,470
is colluding with those

759
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,790
corrupt officials from the Song Dynasty.

760
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,950
They want to take this opportunity

761
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,930
to finish us off.

762
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,990
Taoist Ma.

763
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,250
We can't get them involved.

764
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,790
I will go out
to deal with the Jin people.

765
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,100
Please take my master

766
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,330
and everyone to leave.

767
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,840
Now

768
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,310
I'll entrust this book to your care.

769
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,450
Do you want to destroy everything

770
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,730
and then die

771
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,230
so you'll be a hero?

772
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,070
Is that right?

773
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,890
I'm not trying to be some great hero.

774
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,370
You will die if you go out.

775
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,500
If I can save everyone,

776
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,020
what's there to fear about death?

777
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,540
Then I'll go with you.

778
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,760
No need.

779
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,890
Stupid and stubborn.

780
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,110
Jing.

781
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,920
Yang Kang was a disciple

782
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,930
taught by me.

783
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,810
Even if someone has to sacrifice,

784
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,220
I will help

785
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,700
fight a way out for you.

786
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,920
That's right.

787
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,140
Today our Quanzhen School

788
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,730
will cover for you to leave.

789
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,240
Okay.

790
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,730
Old thing,

791
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,370
let's go out and have some fun.

792
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,440
Alright.

793
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,190
I'll follow

794
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,450
whatever you do.

795
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,360
Hold on.

796
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,290
I have a solution.

797
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,860
(Drunken Immortal Tower)

798
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,360
Kang.

799
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,500
What are you waiting for?

800
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,800
Release the arrows.

801
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,450
I don't believe they won't come out.

802
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,920
Father,

803
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,700
something's fishy.

804
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,470
Over here.

805
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,510
Quick.

806
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,840
Search.

807
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,850
Take a look over there.

808
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,720
Search carefully.

809
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,990
Your Highness.

810
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,290
We've searched and found no one.

811
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,370
We've searched everywhere.
No one is here.

812
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,060
There's no one upstairs, Your Highness.

813
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,230
This place has been surrounded.

814
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,660
- Yes.
- Hard to get out.

815
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,540
This is really strange.

816
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,180
Where did they go?

817
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,320
Yeah.
