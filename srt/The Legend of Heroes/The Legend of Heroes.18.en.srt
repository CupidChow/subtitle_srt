00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,270
Master, Jing and I will go buy groceries.

4
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,500
You have some rest here.

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,400
We'll be right back.

6
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,860
Where are you going for fun?

7
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,700
Ola Imp. Please take care of my master.

8
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,140
Old Beggar is very capable.

9
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,340
He can take care of himself.

10
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,220
I want to go with you.

11
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,260
We're just going to buy groceries.

12
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,180
Me, too.

13
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,020
How about this.

14
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,860
I'll bring back something fun for you later.

15
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,700
What is it?

16
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,860
You'll find out later.

17
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,660
Tell me. What is it?

18
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,340
Take him away.

19
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm just handicapped.

20
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,460
If you leave him here,

21
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,900
he will nag me to death.

22
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,980
No, Master.

23
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,180
Someone must stay to take care of you.

24
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,980
I'll stay. Don't forget it.

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,540
OK. Jing, let's go.

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,420
I'll bring something fun for you.

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Take care of Master.

28
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,990
Boss, how much is this?

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,380
This one is two wens.
[*wen: a unit of currency]

30
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,460
The larger one is three wens.

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,740
This one is five wen.

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,580
Rong.

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
Someone told me

34
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,860
the vegetable market is quite far from here.

35
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,220
We need to hurry.

36
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,380
What's the rush?

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,420
So scary.

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,420
Look at this.

39
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,820
It has a whisker.

40
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,740
- This one looks good.
- It has a whisker?

41
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,500
Rong.

42
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,020
It's fun.

43
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,260
But...

44
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,580
Can we enter the palace wearing it?

45
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,780
Fool! Of course not.

46
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,460
These are for Old Imp.

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,580
- I see.
- Try this one.

48
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,180
Okay.

49
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,580
Jing, it suits you.

50
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,660
Brother Huang.

51
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,620
Sister Mu?

52
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,220
Sister Mu?

53
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,500
Wanyan Honglie is definitely here.

54
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,980
Could something huge happen?

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,380
Jing,

56
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,780
let's go.

57
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,940
We secretly follow her.

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,260
Maybe

59
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,820
we'll find out where Wanyan Honglie is.

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,500
Boss, I'll take them all.

61
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,780
- I'll come back later.
- Okay.

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,780
I'll wrap them up for you.

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,540
See you later.

64
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,820
Sanyuan Restaurant?

65
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,540
Come in. We have private rooms
on the second floor.

66
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,500
(Sanyuan Restauran)

67
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,340
Let's go.

68
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,940
Do you want to have a meal, guests?

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,380
Waiter,

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,060
I need a private room.

71
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,900
Sure.

72
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,260
This way please.

73
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,500
Let's go.

74
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,460
Our Jin

75
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,060
is troubled by the Mongolian army.

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,020
If we can get the Book of Wumu,

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,540
we can definitely repel Temüjin,

78
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,180
turn adversity into prosperity,

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
and win a prosperous era.

80
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,820
With the wise and martial might of Father,

81
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,140
this prosperous era will come soon.

82
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,580
Mr. Ouyang,

83
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,340
please help me enter the palace tonight

84
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,900
and get the Book of Wumu.

85
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,220
When the situation stabilizes,

86
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,140
Mr. Ouyang will be the one to create

87
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,180
a prosperous era.

88
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,980
By then, if Mr. Ouyang wants anything,

89
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,580
I will surely fulfill your request.

90
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,260
That's very kind of you.

91
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,940
My staff was lost when I fell into the sea.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,500
A new one will be made in a few days.

93
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,380
By then,

94
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,300
I'll do my best.

95
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,900
Mr. Ouyang, please have a look.

96
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,060
(Cuihan Bridge)

97
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,300
The Book of Wumu is right here.

98
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,340
(Cuihan Bridge)

99
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,100
Stop! Where are you going?

100
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,820
- Brother Zhou.
- I opened this road.

101
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,820
You should pay me for that.

102
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,660
Pay me. Pay me. Give me the money.

103
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,420
Old Imp, if you don't stop,

104
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,700
I'll take back all these masks.

105
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,460
I'll stop. I'll stop. Don't take them back.

106
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,340
That's okay.

107
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,860
You must protect Master

108
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,380
after we go in later.

109
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,660
If you encounter Ouyang Feng,

110
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,460
use your skills from the Nine Yin Manual.

111
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,340
It's fulfilling your senior's last wish.

112
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,940
No. I can't use those skills.

113
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,540
- No. No. No.
- Is that a refusal?

114
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,660
Fine. Then I won't buy you

115
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,980
these stuff anymore.

116
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,940
Use those skills to Ouyang Feng.

117
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,260
My senior won't blame me.

118
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,380
I'll protect you. Protect you.

119
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,780
Master, you go to the Imperial Kitchen.

120
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Jing and I will meet Wanyan Honglie.

121
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,100
We can't let them

122
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,980
get the Book of Wumu.

123
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,220
I must eat Five Delicacies Sashim

124
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
before Wanyan Honglie

125
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,700
takes action.

126
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,780
Botong, let's go.

127
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,780
Go.

128
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,780
(Cuihan Bridge)

129
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,020
Rong.

130
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,340
The palace is big.

131
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,020
The emperor must live in ease and comfort.

132
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,180
How about you be the emperor?

133
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,020
Would you like that?

134
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,380
No.

135
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,820
I don't like staying here

136
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,020
with walls around.

137
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,540
It's not as free as in the martial world.

138
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,380
Wanyan Honglie said the Book of Wumu

139
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,500
is hidden 10 zhangs north of Cuihan Bridge.
[*zhang: a unit of length]

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,180
But here is only a rockery.

141
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,900
How can a book be hidden

142
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,100
in this rockery waterfall?

143
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,060
Perhaps behind this waterfall,

144
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,980
something is different.

145
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,140
That's not a problem.

146
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,580
I'll go check it out.

147
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,420
Okay.

148
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,540
- Rong!
- Jing!

149
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,500
This is a water curtain cave!

150
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,580
Rong.

151
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,580
Wanyan Honglie is right.

152
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,460
This place is so hidden.

153
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,340
Something valuable must be hidden here.

154
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,180
Let's get in

155
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,020
and have a look.

156
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,180
Wait.

157
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,660
If Wanyan Honglie

158
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,740
is here,

159
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,140
we'll be in a dilemma.

160
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,820
Then we'll stay here

161
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,020
and not let them

162
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,980
get the Book of Wumu.

163
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,300
Anyway,

164
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,180
we can let Wanyan Honglie

165
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,220
get the Book of Wumu.

166
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,260
So you stay here,

167
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,780
I'll draw the Imperial Guards over.

168
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,340
In this way, we'll catch the turtle in a jar.

169
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,980
According to the records,

170
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,100
the book should be hidden

171
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,180
behind this waterfall.

172
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,580
Your Royal Highness.

173
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,100
I'll go in and check it out.

174
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,260
- Someone's inside.
- Who is it?

175
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
I didn't see it clearly.

176
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,540
That one slapped me out.

177
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,500
The Book of Wumu

178
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,380
must be in this cave.

179
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
I'll leave it to you all.

180
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,820
Your Royal Highness, rest assured.

181
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,660
I'll take care of it.

182
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,580
Your Royal Highness.

183
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,620
I see him.

184
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,500
He's Guo Jing!

185
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Guo Jing?

186
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,340
I must absorb his blood today!

187
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,830
Old Demon. Let's go get him.

188
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,740
Let's go.

189
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,100
- How's it going?
- He is so annoying.

190
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,460
He is so annoying!

191
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,220
The four of us go together!

192
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,300
- Go.
- Go.

193
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,380
Mr. Ouyang, please go and get him.

194
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,620
Mr. Ouyang, please go and get him.

195
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,500
How is your martial arts practice going,

196
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,780
Guo Jing?

197
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,820
You can't get the Book of Wumu.

198
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,860
Mr. Ouyang.

199
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,020
Yang Kang,

200
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
our parents were killed by the Jins.

201
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,300
Are you now getting the book

202
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,700
for the Jins

203
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,780
and harming our fellow Songs?

204
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,420
You go get the book.

205
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,620
He won't bother you.

206
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,780
Thank you, Mr. Ouyang.

207
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
Stop!

208
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,900
(Nine Yin manual is really great.)

209
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,780
(He has made great progress)

210
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,460
(in such a short time.)

211
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,540
For the sake of the manual,

212
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,860
I've given you mercy.

213
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,540
You can't beat me.

214
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
Just go.

215
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
I won't go.

216
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,060
Even if I can't win, I'll still fight.

217
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,900
Good.

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,140
Young man

219
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
should endure hardship.

220
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,580
Come here.

221
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,980
Intruders! Be quick!

222
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,020
Be quick! Intruders here!

223
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,780
Your Royal Highness.

224
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,820
Imperial guards are here.

225
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,740
We should go.

226
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,180
Your Royal Highness.

227
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,020
Mr. Ouyang is inside.

228
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,340
His Highness will be fine.

229
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,940
- That's right.
- Right.

230
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,180
We should go!

231
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,860
(Vital Information Against the Jins)

232
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,500
Bells and whistles.

233
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,140
Break!

234
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,780
I told you...

235
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,780
I will never let you

236
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,420
get the Book of Wumu.

237
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,820
(Yang Kang)

238
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,420
Father!

239
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,900
Kang.

240
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,860
Father,

241
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,940
I brought you the Book of Wumu.

242
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,020
(Vital Information Against the Jins)

243
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,260
Good boy.

244
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,940
With this book,

245
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,580
we can unify

246
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,980
the country soon.

247
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,140
Congratulations.

248
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,340
Today, thank you all

249
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,340
for your help.

250
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,100
Mr. Ouyang deserves

251
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,620
the highest praise.

252
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,780
Save the words

253
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,300
of gratitude for later.

254
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,500
If we don't go now,

255
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,140
we'll have no chance.

256
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,020
Mr. Ouyang is right.

257
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,980
Let's leave the palace first

258
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,940
and make plans later.

259
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,580
- Fine, let's go.
- Let's go. Go.

260
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,340
If you get the Book of Wumu,

261
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,540
will you give it to Brother Guo?

262
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,380
Of course.

263
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,940
I, Yang Kang, swear to the heavens.

264
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,540
If I betray you,

265
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,860
I'll die a horrible death.

266
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,540
Jing!

267
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,140
Jing!

268
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,780
Jing!

269
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,060
Jing!

270
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,420
(Yang Kang)

271
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,340
Jing.

272
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,580
- Rong...
- I'm here.

273
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,980
Rong...

274
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,460
The Book of Wumu

275
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,700
was stolen.

276
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,620
Don't worry.

277
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,980
Heaven will never

278
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,380
let that scoundrel succeed.

279
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,100
Rong, don't cry.

280
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,540
Don't cry.

281
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,500
Are you crying because I might die?

282
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,780
Nonsense.

283
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,900
If you dare to die before me,

284
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,780
I'll come after you to settle the score.

285
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Don't worry.

286
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,980
Without your permission,

287
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,980
I don't dare to die.

288
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,460
We...

289
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,460
We can figure it out.

290
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,740
Really?

291
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,820
There are healing methods

292
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,020
in the Nine Yin Manual.

293
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,620
But,

294
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,340
you have to help me

295
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,220
for seven days and nights.

296
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,940
That's nothing.

297
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,860
Even it's 70 years,

298
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,220
700 years,

299
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,700
I'll do it for you.

300
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,620
We will follow the methods in the manual,

301
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,060
each using a palm to balance the other,

302
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,740
and focus on breathing.

303
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,140
During the seven days and nights,

304
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,980
our palms must not part.

305
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,100
Our breaths will be connected.

306
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,540
If someone disturbs us,

307
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,820
at best, it will hurt our hearts;

308
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,060
at worst, our soul will leave the body,

309
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,340
and we'll die on spot.

310
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,020
I prepared extra watermelons for a few days.

311
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,900
If our progress is slow,

312
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,260
that won't be a problem.

313
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,500
Rong.

314
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,660
You're so thoughtful.

315
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,940
Watermelons!

316
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,260
You hid the watermelons

317
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,220
to eat them secretly,

318
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,140
didn't you?

319
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,300
Shagu.

320
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,740
Be quiet.

321
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,540
You be quiet.

322
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,220
Shagu,

323
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,460
bad people will come to steal the watermelons.

324
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,380
No matter who it is, you can't tell them.

325
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,300
And you can't

326
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,500
call for me from the outside.

327
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Do you understand?

328
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,260
Are we playing hide-and-seek?

329
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Great! Great!

330
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,140
Shagu won't tell them.

331
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,420
If you don't tell them,
I'll give you watermelons.

332
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,140
Nianci.

333
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,020
Nianci?

334
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,540
Waiter.

335
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,340
Where is the girl in this room?

336
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,620
She checked out and left early this morning.

337
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,940
How long has she been gone?

338
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,260
Less than an hour.

339
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,980
Anyone here?

340
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,900
Innkeeper?

341
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,940
Innkeeper?

342
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,500
- They're here.
- No one's here.

343
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,020
Stop that.

344
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,020
No one will be here in this shabby place.

345
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,140
Your Royal Highness, you are a Jin,

346
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,780
but you know such a remote village.

347
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,220
You are amazing

348
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,940
and know everything.

349
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,140
I just came here

350
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,180
19 years ago.

351
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,860
Thank you, Mr. Ouyang.

352
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,220
Now, we get out of Lin'an.

353
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,180
The Song soldiers won't come after us.

354
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,540
Why don't you

355
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,740
open the Book of Wumu

356
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
and let us take a look.

357
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,260
We got this treasure book

358
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,620
thanks to everyone's great help.

359
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,500
We should all see it together.

360
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,580
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

361
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,860
Open it and let us have a look.

362
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,900
(Vital Information Against the Jins)

363
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,700
Did we take the wrong one?

364
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,660
There's nothing in here.

365
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,660
Kang is always careful.

366
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,820
He wouldn't be so careless.

367
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,100
Could there be

368
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,620
another layer in the box?

369
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,140
We schemed

370
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,380
and worked all night,

371
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,500
but ended up with nothing.

372
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,940
Your Royal Highness, don't worry.

373
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,300
We can go to the palace

374
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,900
again tonight.

375
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,300
After what we did last night,

376
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,740
the palace will surely

377
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,380
be on high alert.

378
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,580
I'll go to the palace

379
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,820
and turn it upside down.

380
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,460
You four, come with me.

381
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,220
Prince and Ke, stay here.

382
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,740
I appreciate Mr. Ouyang

383
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,260
going again.

384
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,420
I will wait here for good news.

385
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,380
They made such a big scene last night,

386
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,060
but it was all for nothing.

387
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,540
I guess

388
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,340
the Book of Wumu isn't in the palace.

389
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
But they are going there

390
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,620
again tonight.

391
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,500
They will turn the palace upside down.

392
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,420
Our master and Brother Zhou

393
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,060
are still in the Imperial Kitchen.

394
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,980
I'm really afraid

395
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,580
they'll be caught.

396
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,100
Master is with Old Imp.

397
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,660
They'd be better off not bullying others.

398
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,860
Who would dare

399
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,780
to bully them?

400
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm afraid Brother Zhou

401
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,660
will cause some trouble.

402
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,580
I've spent a whole day and night with you,

403
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,420
just eating and sleeping.

404
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,380
You didn't play with me.

405
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,900
So boring. So boring.

406
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,140
So boring!

407
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,580
You should blame Ouyang Feng

408
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,100
for causing such a scene.

409
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,500
They were supposed to make

410
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,820
Five Delicacies Sashim.

411
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,140
Now that's ruined.

412
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,100
Five Delicacies Sashim?

413
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,180
What's fun about it?

414
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,900
Are you not leaving until you eat it?

415
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,740
Years ago, Master and I

416
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
hid in the beams for three months.

417
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,700
Will it also take three months

418
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,860
to get it this time?

419
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,260
What do you mean?

420
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,140
You're not going to make me

421
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,860
stay here with you for three months

422
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,220
to eat Five Delicacies Sashim?

423
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,180
Impossible! Not even three days!

424
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,180
You endured 15 years on Peach Blossom Island.

425
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,060
What's three months now?

426
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,300
Do you have something important to do?

427
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,140
Play!

428
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,460
I can play with so many things
in three months...

429
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,660
Brother Peng.

430
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,460
Did you take the wrong path?

431
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,380
I remember we didn't pass by

432
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,780
the Imperial Kitchen last night.

433
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,420
Just follow me.

434
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,500
Go. Go.

435
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,540
Be quick. Close the door.

436
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,260
Go. Go. Go.

437
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,060
So unlucky.

438
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,140
Lucky me.

439
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,420
I'm bored to death.

440
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,780
I'll play with them.

441
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,020
If you cause trouble again and ruin my plan,

442
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,460
we can't leave in this lifetime.

443
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,340
Got it. No fighting.

444
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,340
Just play.

445
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,380
Listen to me.

446
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,740
Let's see if I make sense.

447
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,940
Mr. Ouyang asked us to split up

448
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,340
and look for the Book of Wumu.

449
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,420
If he finds it,

450
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,180
won't he take all the credit?

451
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,060
Haven't you heard that saying?

452
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,260
It says,

453
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,820
"play both ends

454
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,100
against the middle"?

455
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,620
What's that mean?

456
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,700
I see!

457
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,580
We'll let him look for it.

458
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,100
He'll clear the obstacles for us.

459
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,180
We'll conserve our strength.

460
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,860
When the critial moment comes,

461
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,500
we'll use it.

462
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,340
Then we can easily get

463
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,620
the Book of Wumu.

464
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,900
Brillant!

465
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,940
You are brilliant.

466
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,940
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

467
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,260
Who's there?

468
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,420
- Are you kidding?
- Well...

469
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,900
No one is there.

470
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
A ghost!

471
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,020
What's wrong with you? Fainted?

472
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,340
Master!

473
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Please spare me!

474
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,020
I have a 70-year-old son

475
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,500
and a three-year-old mother.

476
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,060
Please spare me!

477
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,020
(Xiruo.)

478
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,460
(You are stingy.)

479
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,300
(After all this time,)

480
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,380
(you never once)

481
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,180
(came to meet me in my dreams.)

482
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,420
(You care about everything in this world,)

483
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,780
(but you are only so cruel to me.)

484
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,540
Jing!

485
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,380
Stay focused!

486
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,060
Don't disrupt your internal energy.

487
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,540
Wanyan Honglie

488
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,140
is alone now.

489
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,420
He is so close to me.

490
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,420
I'll go out and kill him

491
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,500
to avenge my parents.

492
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,140
Jing.

493
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,420
Calm down.

494
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Once you're healed,

495
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,780
no matter where he runs,

496
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,940
we can find him.

497
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,140
Rong, let me go!

498
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,820
Jing, calm down!

499
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,340
Jing!

500
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,860
Rong.

501
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,180
I'm sorry.

502
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,820
Are you alright?

503
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
Stay focused.

504
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,980
Let's continue.

505
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,540
I told you ghosts exist.

506
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,700
You just don't believe me.

507
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,340
- Your Royal Highness.
- What happened to you?

508
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,580
Did you find the Book of Wumu?

509
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,540
We were unlucky,

510
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
and ran into ghosts in the palace.

511
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,860
You failed but dare to

512
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,660
spout nonsense in front of His Royal Highness.

513
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,980
Aren't you embarrassed enough?

514
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,620
I saw it clearly.

515
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,180
I saw a judge with indigo eyes

516
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,500
and cinnabar whiskers,

517
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,820
just like the statues

518
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,700
in the temple.

519
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,540
That is a ghost!

520
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,580
There were

521
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,860
more than one ghost.

522
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,100
I saw a red-faced Spiritual Officer Wang.

523
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,260
What I saw

524
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,800
was a white-faced, long-tongued Wuchang.
[*Wuchang: a deity in Chinese folk religion]

525
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,340
It even drew a sign on my head,

526
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,660
probably marking me

527
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,580
to claim my life at midnight.

528
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,580
I encountered

529
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,620
a smiling ghost.

530
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
He tried to sneak attack me.

531
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,660
I scared it off.

532
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,380
Not that impressive.

533
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,100
You black-eyed fool.

534
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,460
What's wrong with my eyes?

535
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,740
You're talking big!

536
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,580
Enough.

537
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Where's Mr. Ouyang Feng?

538
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,220
He might have been

539
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,700
taken by the evil ghosts.

540
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,260
Yes. That's right.

541
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,540
Evil ghosts?

542
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,820
Yes.

543
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,100
We must act quickly.

544
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,660
Whether they are people or ghosts,

545
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
we need to find

546
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,060
the Book of Wumu.

547
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,900
Your Royal Highness,

548
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,180
what's your plan?

549
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,260
You stay here

550
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,500
and protect

551
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,860
Mr. Ouyang Ke

552
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,020
and support Mr. Ouyang Feng and Kang.

553
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,860
I'll go to Iron Palm Gang

554
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,620
to ask Master Qiu to assist us.

555
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,940
Our internal energy

556
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,660
has circled microcosmic orbit seven times.

557
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,260
One day has passed.

558
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,580
Jing,

559
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,820
how do you feel?

560
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,340
Much better.

561
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,700
Last night was dangerous.

562
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,620
If it weren't for you stopping me,

563
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,820
I might have lost my temper

564
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,460
and ruined everything.

565
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,100
There are six days and nights left.

566
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,540
Promise me

567
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,740
you'll listen to me.

568
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,740
When have I ever not listened to you?

569
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,140
I'll answer you later.

570
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,780
Big brother.

571
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
Look at this bowl.

572
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,460
Doesn't it seem strange?

573
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,380
Over the years,

574
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,660
dirt has stuck to the bottom of the bowl.

575
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,780
There's a mechanism here.

576
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,180
Brother Hou,

577
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,180
try turning this iron bowl

578
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,900
left and right.

579
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,180
Rong, what should we do?

580
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,700
This shabby inn

581
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,100
has hidden depths!

582
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,420
Big brother.

583
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,660
This place feels oddly deserted.

584
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,380
Now it really is suspicious,

585
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,780
like an illegal shop.

586
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,060
How about...

587
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,660
How about we don't go in?

588
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,460
The innkeeper made this secret room

589
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,540
so well-hidden.

590
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,860
Perhaps

591
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,660
there's treasure

592
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,860
hideen inside.

593
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,500
It's broad daylight.

594
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,420
We just go in.

595
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,540
Even if there are any evil spirits,

596
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,780
they wouldn't dare to act up.

597
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,220
Follow me.

598
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,740
- Who?
- Who?

599
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,140
Ghosts... Ghosts.

600
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,220
The ghosts in the palace

601
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,100
are haunting us!

602
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,380
Who dares to pretend to be a ghost

603
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,220
in front of me?

604
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,060
Come out and get beaten.

605
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,820
Run! Quick!

606
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,700
Run!

607
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,780
Run!

608
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,220
Ghosts!

609
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,100
Rong.

610
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,420
You're clever.

611
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,620
Now they won't come back.

612
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,500
Luckily, Old Imp played tricks

613
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,420
on them yesterday.

614
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,860
Or they wouldn't have fallen for it.

615
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,060
Hello?

616
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,140
Is anyone here?

617
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,260
Is anyone here?

618
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,100
Hello?

619
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,500
Are you the owner of this place?

620
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,060
I'm just passing by.

621
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,180
I'm sorry.

622
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,020
It's nothing serious.

623
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,700
No need for formalities, sir.

624
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,220
I wish to inquire about someone.

625
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,540
Do you know

626
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,940
a man

627
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,460
named Guo Jing?

628
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,260
You're here for him too?

629
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,380
So are you?

630
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm Cheng Yaojia, apprentice of Sun Bu'er,

631
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,940
Qingjing Sanren, from Quanzhen School.

632
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,420
I've come under my master's orders

633
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,140
to find Brother Guo Jing

634
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,180
to deliver an urgent message.

635
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,340
I'm Lu Guanying, young master
of Guiyun Manor in Lake Tai.

636
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,380
I've come under my father's orders

637
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,220
to find Senior Guo Jing,

638
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,580
also with urgent news.

639
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,420
Could it be that we're here

640
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,580
for the same reason?

641
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,020
Maybe we can write it down.

642
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,460
Alright.

643
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,300
Look at them. So frustrating.

644
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,380
Keep the words on the tip of their tongues.

645
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,780
I'm anxious.

646
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,300
Perhaps they have

647
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,300
something important.

648
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,660
Can't say it out.

649
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,740
But what could be so important

650
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,380
to bring both the Quanzhen School

651
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,700
and Guiyun Manor here?

652
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,820
How could I know

653
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,580
if you don't know this?

654
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,780
(Peach Blossom Island)

655
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,180
We are indeed here

656
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,340
for the same reason.

657
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,540
Since that's the case,

658
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,260
let's go find Brother Guo.

659
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,620
Okay.

660
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,340
I'm a monk, not a demon catcher.

661
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,860
Who are you?

662
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,220
When did you arrive here?

663
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,500
Gentlemen,

664
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,620
we just wanted to

665
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,540
ask for some water.

666
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,260
We didn't know

667
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,980
this is your place.

668
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,900
We are sorry

669
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,740
for the interruption.

670
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,540
Alright. Get out of here.

671
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,700
We need to get down to business.

672
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,500
- Let's go.
- Wait.

673
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,140
It's too much of a coincidence

674
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,620
that as soon as we leave,

675
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,900
you're here.

676
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,980
I see.

677
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,740
Do these evil spirits

678
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,900
transform as a man and a woman

679
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,100
to deceive us?

680
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,180
Nonsense.

681
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,500
They're just pretending to be ghosts.

682
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,620
Tell us.

683
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,780
Who are you, demons?

684
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,820
We really don't know

685
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,900
what you're talking about.

686
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
You don't know?

687
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,340
I'll give you a good beating

688
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,180
then you will know.

689
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,420
Miss, run!

690
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,700
Young lady,

691
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,260
if you want a fight, pick me.

692
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,780
Let it go.

693
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,300
Shame on you for bullying a woman!

694
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,180
Come at me!

695
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,780
Catch the man ghost

696
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,860
and the woman ghost!

697
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,980
Let go of me!

698
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,060
Young man,

699
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,020
you want to be a hero and save the beauty?

700
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,340
Know your place!

701
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,100
Young lady,

702
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,260
as long as you behave yourself,

703
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,820
I'll let you go.

704
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,780
If you don't make us feel good,

705
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,260
I'll make sure neither of you feels good.

706
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,580
My master is Taoist Sun from Quanzhen School.

707
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,420
She'll be here soon.

708
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,580
If you harm us,

709
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,980
my master will...

710
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,420
- She will...
- She will do what?

711
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,180
- Do what?
- She will do what?

712
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,780
No bullying!

713
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,460
Bullying is bad.

714
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,780
Hou Tonghai,

715
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,180
you've got quite the luck,

716
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,420
stirring up a nest of female ghosts!

717
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,260
You are bad!

718
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,540
What female ghost nest?

719
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,580
I bet there are more ghosts.

720
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,420
Come out, all of you!

721
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,180
Stop there!

722
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Stop there!

723
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,780
- Stop!
- You are bad! Bad!

724
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,980
You should stop.

725
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,100
Rinpoche Lingzhi,

726
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,060
you haven't said a word for a while,

727
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,980
and now you stop me.

728
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,460
Do you want to

729
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,940
break your vows

730
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
and become a lecherous monk?

731
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

732
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,980
Who's your master?

733
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,020
Who's your master?

734
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,820
What nonsense are you talking about?

735
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,220
Is your master Huang Yaoshi?

736
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,540
Who's Huang Yaoshi?

737
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,660
Is this silly and crazy girl

738
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,980
Huang Yaoshi's apprentice?

739
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,540
Didn't you see

740
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,780
she and that man inside

741
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,860
use Peach Blossom Island's martial arts?

742
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,180
Even if they are not his apprentices,

743
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,420
they must have some connection.

744
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,660
Huang Yaoshi is quite eccentric.

745
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,740
If they tell on us to him,

746
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,700
we'll be in trouble.

747
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,900
What are you afraid of?

748
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,940
Didn't you see a few days ago?

749
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,620
Huang Yaoshi heard his daughter had died,

750
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,820
and he was so scared that he lost his soul.

751
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,780
He probably died of grief.

752
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,860
If he comes here,

753
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,780
we'll gang up on him.

754
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,380
We'll give him

755
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,500
a good beating.

756
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,740
That's right.

757
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,180
That day,

758
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,940
Huang Yaoshi humiliated me.

759
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,620
Today I'll make his apprentices

760
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,340
pay the price.

761
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,300
Come here.

762
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,060
Don't drag Shagu!

763
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,140
Let me go!

764
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,140
The girl eating watermelon! Save me!

765
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,820
There are more of them.

766
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,860
Are they hiding down there?

767
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,020
The girl eating watermelon!

768
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,740
Don't go. Come back here!

769
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,220
Dare to bite me, huh?

770
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,580
What's going on?

771
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,740
Great!

772
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,900
My father is here.

773
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,020
Little girl,

774
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,540
did he

775
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,820
hit you with that hand?

776
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,940
Yes, this hand.

777
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,220
Huang Yaoshi...

778
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,100
Master Huang...

779
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,460
Master Huang.

780
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,900
Grandmaster,

781
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,060
I kowtow to you.

782
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,780
We apologize for offending

783
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,740
the people of Peach Blossom Island.

784
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,900
Master Huang,

785
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,300
please spare my life.

786
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,740
Didn't you say

787
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,660
you wanted to give me a good beating?

788
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,500
No. No. No.

789
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,420
Beat me. Beat me.

790
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,700
Kneel down.

791
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,540
Crawl out.

792
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,740
Old Heretic Huang!

793
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,020
We are renowned heroes

794
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,780
in the martial world.

795
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,660
A man should have dignity.

796
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,300
We can be killed but not humiliated.

797
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,140
Right?

798
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,540
But

799
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
I've admired Master Huang for a long time.

800
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,100
I...

801
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,420
I kowtow to a hero.

802
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,900
I'm not a coward.

803
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,140
Let's go.

804
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,940
Crawl out of here.

805
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,820
Let's go! Go!

806
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,860
Grandmaster,

807
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,860
I apologize for my lack of skill,

808
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,460
which embarrassed you.

809
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,460
Today, you've shown great chivalry.

810
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,220
It's not embarrassing.

811
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,580
Thank you, Grandmaster.

812
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,180
I'm Cheng Yaojia, apprentice of Sun Bu'er,

813
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,860
