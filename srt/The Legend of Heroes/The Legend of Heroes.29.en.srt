00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,350
Enemy attack!

4
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,380
We're under attack!

5
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,760
Charge!

6
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,580
Your Royal Highness!

7
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,580
The Mongols have flown into the city!

8
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,140
Flown into the city?

9
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,420
Ask the King of Khwarazm to send troops.

10
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,580
It's too late!

11
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,980
The Mongol cavalry

12
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,500
is already here in the city.

13
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,580
What?

14
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,220
Your Royal Highness, please leave now.

15
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,780
Or we will be caught!

16
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,820
Your lordship.

17
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,380
East side enemy troops are defeated,

18
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
but they are numerous.

19
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,380
They're flying the Prince of Jin's banner,

20
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,820
trying to rally the remnants to break through.

21
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,380
That's Wanyan Honglie's banner.

22
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,900
We must go

23
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,380
to capture him immediately.

24
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,700
Jing.

25
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,980
We attacked the city from the south.

26
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,060
The defeated troops exited from the north gate.

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,980
The Khwarezm remnants

28
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,260
broke through the west gate.

29
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,860
Now, another group

30
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,940
with the Prince Zhao's flag

31
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,900
is heading east.

32
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,660
Don't you find it odd?

33
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,460
In the Book of Wumu, it says,

34
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,300
"Don't take enemy bait.

35
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,020
Do not block a returning army.

36
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,540
Surrounding an army, leave an exit.

37
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,180
Do not push a desperate foe too far."

38
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,180
You're right, Rong.

39
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,060
Wanyan Honglie is very cunning.

40
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,060
He wouldn't be waving Prince Zhao's banner

41
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,780
after being defeated.

42
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,740
So in your opinion,

43
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,460
where will Wanyan Honglie go?

44
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,700
He'll go to the east

45
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,660
or the west?

46
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,820
I see.

47
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,980
Stop!

48
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,780
Kneel!

49
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,860
Wanyan Honglie,

50
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,860
did you ever think

51
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,380
you'd end up like this

52
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,940
when you were showing off

53
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,020
on my grasslands?

54
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,740
Of course not.

55
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,020
When the Jin army was strong,

56
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,540
I should eliminate you first.

57
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,020
Then it wouldn't have come to this.

58
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,660
No more talking. Kill me.

59
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,780
Alright,

60
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,100
I'll oblige you.

61
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,060
Jing.

62
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,500
Your father's killer is here.

63
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,340
You should be the one to finish him off.

64
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,300
Wanyan Honglie.

65
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,020
Do you remember

66
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,420
the Guo and the Yang from Niujia Village?

67
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
Of course.

68
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,220
My wife Bao Xiruo was from

69
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,260
Niu Jia Village, Lin'an.

70
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,700
Your Guo family lived next door.

71
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
I

72
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,020
killed your father, Guo Xiaotian.

73
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,020
Good.

74
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,060
It's good that you remember.

75
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,020
Now.

76
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,380
You should

77
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,340
settle this grudge yourself.

78
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,300
I, Wanyan Honglie,

79
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,460
have suffered a humiliating defeat.

80
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,180
But I'll die for the Jin.

81
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,620
Guo Jing, you are from the Song,

82
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,660
but you serve under Temüjin.

83
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,100
Your father

84
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,300
must not rest in peace.

85
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,180
Think about it.

86
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,900
After Temüjin destroyed our Jin,

87
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,900
which one will be the next

88
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,180
to suffer massacre?

89
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,620
Guo Jing.

90
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,980
Kang and I will wait for you under the sod.

91
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,340
Jing.

92
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,260
I once said,

93
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,940
the one who captures Wanyan Honglie

94
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,340
will be greatly rewarded.

95
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,700
What do you want?

96
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,980
I'll grant it.

97
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,780
Great Khan,

98
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,140
I have a request.

99
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,540
What's that?

100
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,740
May Huazheng and I...

101
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,380
Who gets the prisoners? You know the answer!

102
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,460
Ögedei.

103
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,700
Don't be unreasonable.

104
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,900
Who's unreasonable? Chagatai!

105
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,060
You know entered the city first!

106
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,900
You...

107
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,180
Great Khan is here!

108
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,220
Greetings, Great Khan.

109
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,660
Greetings, Father.

110
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,540
Why are you two

111
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,620
arguing?

112
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,220
Father,

113
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,060
you said that

114
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,580
after breaking through Samarkand,

115
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,700
soldiers can

116
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,980
seize prisoners

117
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,820
and replenish supplies.

118
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,780
That's true.

119
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,100
That's our

120
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,140
Mongol tradition.

121
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,620
We reward the brave soldiers.

122
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,740
It won't change forever.

123
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,220
But today, when I was

124
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,980
claiming prisoners for my tribe,

125
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,860
Third Brother fought me for them.

126
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,820
I thought it was

127
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,940
something big or serious.

128
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,460
Two brothers shouldn't

129
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,300
argue over prisoners.

130
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,420
Forget it.

131
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,780
Kill all the prisoners

132
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,740
in and outside the city.

133
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,580
Yes.

134
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,500
Kill them! Kill them!

135
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,380
Wait!

136
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,660
Great Khan.

137
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,620
You said

138
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
you'd grant any request

139
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,140
I made.

140
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,100
Does that still hold?

141
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,660
Are you questioning

142
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,980
Genghis Khan's word?

143
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,180
What do you want?

144
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,300
Just tell me.

145
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,380
I beg you.

146
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,340
Please spare all the people

147
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,180
and the prisoners

148
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,300
of Samarkand.

149
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,140
Brother Jing! What are you talking about?

150
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,540
Have you lost your mind in the battlefield?

151
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,700
Guo Jing, how dare you?

152
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,060
Are you trying to

153
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,420
plead for the enemy?

154
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,540
These people are innocent.

155
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,100
I beg you to spare them.

156
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,220
Fine.

157
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,020
Great!

158
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,180
I'll do as you wish.

159
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,100
Father!

160
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
- Father!
- Father!

161
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,140
Father!

162
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,220
Jing has worked hard for so long.

163
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,140
He should eat well.

164
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,380
Rong.

165
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,500
Jing. You're back.

166
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,100
- Guo Jing.
- Huazheng?

167
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,500
Why are you here?

168
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,260
I can't come here?

169
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,060
That's not what I meant.

170
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,340
- Jing.
- I...

171
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,700
Did you go to see Great Khan?

172
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,700
Something needs to be settled eventually.

173
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,660
Tell Huazheng the truth.

174
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
Rong.

175
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,260
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,660
I didn't call off the engagement.

So this is your choice.

You chose to abandon me.

181
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,580
I see.

182
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,380
Enjoy your wealth and prestige!

183
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,220
No, it's not that.

184
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,020

I don't know how to say this.

188
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,780
I only love Rong.

189
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,300
Huazheng.

190
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,820

195
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,820
Guo Jing!

196
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,220
Guo Jing!

197
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,100
Help me!

198
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,460
Old Venomous Creature!

199
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,580
You've done too much evil.

200
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,420
You deserve this.

201
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,300
I'll leave you to your doom.

202
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,060
Don't go, Guo Jing.

203
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,180
You're looking for Huang Rong, right?

204
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,700
Tell me. Where is Rong?

205
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,940
Promise you won't

206
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,700
hurt me today,

207
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
and I'll tell you.

208
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,340
Tell me if you want.

209
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,620
But don't think of lying to me.

210
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,060
I'm not lying.

211
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,700
If you don't save me,

212
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,620
you'll never see Huang Rong again.

213
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
Come on. Come on.

214
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,020
May the deity of Mount White Camel

215
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,900
keep me safe and sound.

216
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,180
Safe and sound.

217
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,860
Tell me.

218
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,900
Where is Rong?

219
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,340
I...

220
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,140
She...

221
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,740
She and I both

222
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,140
fell into quicksand.

223
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,460
She's not that skilled.

224
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,300
Before you arrived,

225
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,900
she had already sunk.

226
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,140
Nonsense!

227
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,340
See for yourself.

228
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,620
Rong.

229
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,420
Rong!

230
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
Brother.

231
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,100
There you are!

232
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,340
Come back with me.

233
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,660
Brother,

234
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,780
what's wrong?

235
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,180
Brother!

236
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,700
(One month later)

237
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,220
Father.

238
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,980
Guo Jing.

239
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,140
How are you feeling now?

240
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,060
Much better. Thank you for your concern.

241
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,780
Do you know

242
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,020
how worried Hua Zheng

243
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,340
has been?

244
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,540
I was just thinking of

245
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,300
choosing an auspicious day

246
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,460
for your wedding.

247
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,700
Great Khan, I can't...

248
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,340
Brother, let me explain.

249
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,020
Father, Brother means that

250
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,980
even though we've captured Samarkand,

251
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,620
our enemies on the grasslands

252
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,740
are not fully defeated.

253
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,460
He still wants to serve you.

254
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,100
As the war isn't over,

255
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,980
he doesn't want to get married.

256
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,220
If that's the case,

257
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,420
I will respect your wishes.

258
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,010
Come here.

259
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,220
Have a look.

260
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,140
The Jin still has an elite force at Tongguan.

261
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,470
Stationed between Lian Mountain and the River,

262
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,460
they are difficult to attack.

263
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,180
Ögedei's strategy

264
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,020
is insightful.

265
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,300
But

266
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,540
a direct attack

267
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,380
would take too long.

268
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,620
Does anyone else

269
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,340
have a good plan?

270
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,220
Now, we are allied with the Song.

271
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,660
After taking Zhongdu from the Jin,

272
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,500
the best strategy

273
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,060
is to pass through the Song's territory.

274
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,260
Advance through Tangzhou and Dengzhou,

275
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,100
and strike the Jin capital,

276
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,340
Daliang.

277
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,820
I totally agree with Fourth Brother.

278
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,900
Jing.

279
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,740
You're skilled in warfare

280
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
and understand my intentions.

281
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,620
I want to ask you.

282
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,780
What should we do

283
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,980
after capturing Daliang?

284
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,980
We don't attack Daliang.

285
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,220
Why?

286
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,460
Neither attack

287
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,060
nor refrain from attacking.

288
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,940
We'll feign an attack but end up

289
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,140
actually attacking.

290
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,700
What a brilliant strategy.

291
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,660
An attack without attacking.

292
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,420
Excellent!

293
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,980
Excellent!

294
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,660
Jing.

295
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,140
Explain this to brothers

296
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,820
and the generals.

297
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,980
Okay.

298
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,300
Now, the emperor of Jin

299
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,140
resides in Daliang.

300
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,260
We just need to feign an attack on Daliang.

301
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,420
When the Jins see

302
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,620
our forces approaching,

303
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,060
they'll send elite troops from Tongguan

304
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,900
to save the capital.

305
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,340
It's a long way

306
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,620
from Tongguan to Daling,

307
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,980
so nine out of ten troops

308
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,540
will be exhausted

309
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,340
and won't be able to fight.

310
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,700
Then,

311
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,620
we'll rest our troops outside Daliang,

312
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,620
waiting in ambush to destroy

313
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,740
the Jin forces.

314
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,740
Their elite troops will be crushed
in this battle,

315
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,700
and we can get Daliang without a fight.

316
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,780
If we attack Daliang directly,

317
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,460
it'll be difficult

318
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,420
and we risk being attacked from both sides.

319
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,260
Great Khan.

320
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,540
Well said.

321
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,060
Issue my order.

322
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,020
Divide the army into three groups.

323
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,100
Jochi, Chagatai,

324
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,260
and Jebe will fight

325
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
on the western front.

326
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,580
Ögedei will

327
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,220
take the lead.

328
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,500
Tolui

329
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
will lead the left wing.

330
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
Guo Jing

331
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
will lead the right wing.

332
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,500
Yes.

333
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,540
Jing.

334
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,980
Do you have any other concerns?

335
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,420
Great Khan.

336
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,300
As we head south,

337
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,340
may I take my mother?

338
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,380
She hasn't been back to hometown for years.

339
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,260
If we'll win,

340
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,660
I wish to take her back to her hometown.

341
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,900
No.

342
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,300
The Jin may be on the decline,

343
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,300
but they are struggling.

344
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,580
They are still dangerous.

345
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,260
Bringing your mother to the battlefield

346
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,140
would be too risky.

347
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,340
What if the situation changes?

348
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,540
Great Khan is right.

349
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,020
I was inconsiderate.

350
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,020
We will defeat the Jin

351
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,940
this time.

352
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,300
I have three pouches here.

353
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,180
Each of you take one.

354
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,340
After you capture Daliang,

355
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,980
you'll meet in the Jin Emperor's hall,

356
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,820
open them together,

357
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,820
and discuss what to do next.

358
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,460
Do not open them

359
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,220
before entering Daliang.

360
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,740
Anyone who disobeys will

361
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,660
be punished by military law.

362
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

363
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,220
You avenged your father.

364
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,340
My greatest wish now

365
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,500
is for you to get married

366
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,980
and

367
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,340
return to hometown soon.

368
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,940
Mother.

369
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,980
Don't worry.

370
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,940
After the war,

371
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,500
I will take you back to Niujia Village.

372
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,860
Okay.

373
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,300
I've been waiting for this.

374
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,100
Great Khan ordered me to attack the Jin.

375
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,420
I asked him

376
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,620
if I could bring you along.

377
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,820
But he feared the dangerous battlefield

378
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,300
and your safety.

379
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
So he refused.

380
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:17,980
Silly boy.

381
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,900
Great Khan isn't worried about me.

382
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
He's worried about you.

383
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,780
Worried about me?

384
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,100
Great Khan

385
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,060
has suddenly been

386
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,980
very generous,

387
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,340
giving us countless treasures.

388
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,900
Although you achieved great merit in the west,

389
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,100
I've lived on the desert for nearly 20 years

390
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,020
and know Great Khan well.

391
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,740
This sudden generosity

392
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,620
must have a hidden motive.

393
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,940
Mother, what do you mean?

394
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,700
Son.

395
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,900
You are from the Song.

396
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,780
What's wrong about that?

397
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,940
What else did Great Khan say

398
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,380
about this time attacking the Jin?

399
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,140
He gave Tolui, Ögedei

400
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,020
and me a pouch each.

401
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,540
We can only open them

402
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,380
after we capture Daliang.

403
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,700
Let me see that pouch.

404
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,700
Here it is.

405
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,940
Mother, no!

406
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,100
Breaking the wax seal

407
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,020
is a capital offense.

408
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,340
We don't have to break the seal.

409
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,620
Just untie the thread

410
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,700
at the top

411
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,380
and then sew it back

412
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,140
without a trace.

413
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,780
Don't you trust me?

414
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,540
See what it says.

415
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,380
Okay.

416
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,260
What does it say?

417
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,380
After capturing Daliang, Khan ordered us

418
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,980
march south to attack Lin'an

419
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,340
and destroy the Song.

420
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,300
I guessed right.

421
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,300
He still wants to use me

422
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,540
as a hostage to pressure you.

423
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,220
We are from the Song.

424
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,780
How can we betray our country?

425
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,060
Mother,

426
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,060
let's go to Lin'an tonight.

427
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,340
To Niujia Village.

428
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,460
Okay.

429
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,620
Great Khan wants to see you.

430
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,700
Guo Jing.

431
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,340
I have treated you well.

432
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,180
I raised you

433
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,100
and betrothed Hua Zheng to you.

434
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,940
But you betray me!

435
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,940
Great Khan,

436
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,900
I appreciate your kindness

437
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,500
and that of the Mongol people.

438
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,700
But I'm from the Song.

439
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,460
How can I fight my fellows?

440
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,060
Those Song officials colluded

441
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,980
with Wanyan Honglie and

442
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,940
massacred Niujia Village.

443
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,500
But you betray the benefactor who raised you

444
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,940
for the sake of those officials' regime.

445
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,020
That's not fair!

446
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,340
Though there are corrupt officials,

447
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,260
it is the common people

448
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,260
of the Song

449
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,540
who suffer when the war begins.

450
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,340
You allied with the Song to fight the Jin,

451
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,860
but now

452
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,060
you broke the promise

453
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,220
and went back on your word.

454
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,060
You are not a hero.

455
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,580
If I defeat the Jin,

456
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,340
the alliance with the Song

457
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,540
will be completed.

458
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,100
Attacking the Song

459
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,260
is not a betrayal.

460
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,220
But you,

461
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,820
disobeying military orders

462
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,940
and opening the pouch,

463
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,980
should be punished by military law!

464
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,260
Father!

465
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,260
Father!

466
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,580
I just don't want Guo Jing
to leave the grasslands

467
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,460
and me.

468
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,660
Please show mercy.

469
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,780
There are many good men on the grasslands.

470
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,500
I will find you

471
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,380
another Prince Consort.

472
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,220
No!

473
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,580
I only want Guo Jing.

474
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,780
- You...
- Father!

475
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,540
Brother Guo Jing achieved great merit

476
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,900
and saved Huazheng and me.

477
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,220
This time, he must have been confused

478
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,540
and made you angry.

479
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,740
Please show mercy.

480
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,020
Alright.

481
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
For Huazheng

482
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,740
and Tolui's sake,

483
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,540
I will give you a chance

484
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,780
to redeem yourself.

485
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,540
Swear loyalty

486
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,060
to the Mongol people,

487
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,180
then I won't hold your mistake

488
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,500
against you anymore.

489
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,900
Great Khan.

490
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,340
I can fight the Jin.

491
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,700
But

492
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,540
I cannot attack the Song.

493
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,620
Great.

494
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,860
Great!

495
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,340
I know you are not afraid to die.

496
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,900
But

497
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,460
what about your mother?

498
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,780
Bring her here!

499
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,300
Mother!

500
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,340
Jing!

501
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,660
Great Khan,

502
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,940
I'll take all the blame.

503
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,700
Please spare my mother.

504
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,340
I will ask you one last time.

505
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,140
Will you be loyal to us?

506
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,100
Brother!

507
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,580
You grew up on the grasslands.

508
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,020
You are a Mongol!

509
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,180
Why do you serve those

510
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,380
you've never lived among?

511
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,740
Great Khan.

512
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,660
I'm afraid my son

513
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,740
may not understand.

514
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,380
Can I talk to him?

515
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,860
Mother.

516
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,980
Are you alright?

517
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,100
18 years ago,

518
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,220
I was pregnant with you

519
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,460
and lived in Niujia Village, Lin'an.

520
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,820
One snowy day,

521
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,260
Taoist Qiu met your father

522
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,060
and gifted two daggers.

523
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,700
One for your father,

524
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,340
and one for your Uncle Yang.

525
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,340
Here it is.

526
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,660
(Guo Jing)

527
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,340
Taoist Qiu named you Guo Jing,

528
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,300
and Uncle Yang's child,

529
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,260
Yang Kang.

530
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,940
Do you know why?

531
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,580
I know that, Mother.

532
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,860
He wanted us

533
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,980
to remember the Jingkang Incident.

534
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,260
Yes.

535
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,860
Yang's child took a Jin as his father

536
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,700
and met a tragic end.

537
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,660
What a pity.

538
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,380
Your Uncle Yang was a hero,

539
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,860
but his son

540
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,260
tarnished his name.

541
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,820
Son.

542
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,180
I raised you with great effort,

543
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,860
not to see you become a traitor

544
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,980
to your fellows.

545
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,340
Then your father would be heartbroken

546
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,300
under the sod.

547
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,300
In the fleeting

548
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,100
years of life,

549
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,860
life

550
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,900
and death

551
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,820
aren't that important.

552
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,060
Living with a clear conscience

553
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
makes our journey

554
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,980
through this world worthwhile.

555
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,540
Remember that.

556
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,180
Do what you believe is right.

557
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,420
Become the person you want to be.

558
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,100
Mother.

559
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,540
Mother?

560
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,700
Mother.

561
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,500
Mother!

562
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,780
(Guo Jing)

563
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
Mother!

564
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,020
No.

565
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,180
No.

566
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,700
No. Mother.

567
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,660
Mother!

568
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,380
Mother!

569
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,220
Mother!

570
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,620
Mother.

571
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,340
I wish I could take you home.

572
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
But...

573
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,940
(Mother Li Ping's Tomb)

574
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,820
I can never do that.

575
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,180
In the desert,

576
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,940
this is a rare oasis

577
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,780
with trees and water.

578
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,540
It somewhat

579
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,820
looks like Jiangnan.

580
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,940
Brother Guo Jing.

581
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,820
I know you are here.

582
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,620
Brother Tolui.

583
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,940
Great Khan sent you to capture me?

584
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,540
I won't go with you.

585
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,420
If we were here to capture you,

586
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,500
would it just be the two of us?

587
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,700
We know we can't keep you.

588
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,460
so we just

589
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,660
come here to say goodbye.

590
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,100
When I overheard that you were leaving,

591
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,780
I wanted to keep you here.

592
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,860
I didn't want to lose you.

593
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,340
I never thought it would kill Aunt Li.

594
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,380
It's my fault.

595
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,700
I'll break off the engagement!

596
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,740
Stand up.

597
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,500
Huazheng.

598
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,620
It's not your fault.

599
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,540
Brother.

600
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,700
Thank you both

601
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,900
for coming to see me off.

602
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
It's good to be your friend.

603
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,780
If you have time,

604
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,940
please burn some paper money for my mother.

605
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,180
I, Guo Jing,

606
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,140
appreciate you.

607
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,340
Everyone! Look!

608
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,900
He serves Temüjin! Now he's in our Song!

609
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,260
- Beat him!
- Beat him!

610
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,220
Beat him!

611
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,060
Beat him!

612
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,020
Beat him!

613
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,580
Beat him!

614
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,420
Stop!

615
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,860
- Stop!
- Stop!

616
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,420
Stop!

617
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,620
- Everyone. Stop!
- Stop!

618
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,500
Listen to me.

619
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,340
This is a mistake.

620
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,020
He is my apprentice.

621
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,700
- He is from Lin'an, Song.
- Jing.

622
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,020
- He is a righteous man.
- Jing.

623
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,700
The local people

624
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,260
have long suffered under the Jin.

625
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,020
At first, they helped the Mongols.

626
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,540
But now,

627
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,020
Temüjin is as cruel as the Jin,

628
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,780
causing great suffering to the people.

629
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,020
They should beat me.

630
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,140
What?

631
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,060
Why?

632
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,500
Why are you being a pushover,

633
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,100
letting them beat you like that?

634
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,860
Master.

635
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,380
I've decided to forget my martial arts.

636
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,460
I won't

637
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,340
fight with others anymore.

638
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,420
What happened, exactly?

639
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,980
Tell me.

640
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,380
Say it!

641
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,980
Mother

642
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,980
and Rong are dead.

643
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,580
It's all my fault.

644
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,980
I have never seen my father.

645
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,020
My mother,

646
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,260
Rong,

647
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,500
and all my masters

648
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,820
are the dearest to me.

649
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,220
Now, aside from you,

650
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,580
they are all gone.

651
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,620
I've learned all these skills,

652
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,860
but I couldn't

653
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,380
protect those I loved most.

654
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,540
Since I was a kid,

655
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,540
I've learned from masters

656
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,940
how to be a righteous

657
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,740
and honorable hero.

658
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,380
My masters

659
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,100
were heroes,

660
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,380
but they died tragic deaths.

661
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,900
Villains like Ouyang Feng

662
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,140
and Qiu Qianren

663
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,220
do a lot of wrong,

664
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,220
but they live well.

665
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,500
So what's the point of learning martial arts?

666
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,420
Is there any value

667
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,340
in upholding heroic spirit?

668
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,260
It's not right for you

669
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,340
to think that way.

670
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,820
My master Taoist Wang said,

671
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,260
"The water that carries the boat
can also swallow it."

672
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,580
Blessing or curse

673
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,100
depends on the person.

674
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,260
Every civil and military skills,

675
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,860
soldiers and weapons

676
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,140
can bring harm

677
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,980
or benefit to the world.

678
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,220
Jing.

679
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,980
As long as you do good,

680
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,500
the more skilled you are, the better.

681
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,180
Why do you want to forget them?

682
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,980
I've made up my mind.

683
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,380
I never want to

684
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,500
fight again.

685
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,660
I wish I could forget

686
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,620
all my martial arts right now.

687
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,180
With your exceptional martial arts

688
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,740
and knowledge of the Book of Wumu,

689
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
you should face the national challenge

690
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,500
and help the Song through the difficult time.

691
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,780
But what can I do?

692
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,620
Jing!

693
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,500
The war will leave

694
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,380
both sides suffering,

695
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,140
with people homeless and devastated.

696
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,060
You!

697
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,260
You have wasted

698
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,900
the teachings of your masters!

699
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,980
Master.

700
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,940
Please don't force me.

701
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,940
I truly want to forget

702
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,820
all my martial arts

703
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
and leave the conflicts
of the martial world behind.

704
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,820
Jing.

705
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,340
You said you want to forget your martial arts.

706
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,380
I recall a man who did the same.

707
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,460
He learned supreme martial arts by chance,

708
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,340
but felt he broke his vows

709
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,660
and promises.

710
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,060
So

711
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,940
he tried to forget his martial arts.

712
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,060
You know him well.

713
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,820
He is my senior, Zhou Botong.

714
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,660
The enemies are almost here!

715
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,100
There is no time to lose!

716
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,620
Hurry! Pack up!

717
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,220
Be quick! Come on!

718
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,140
Tie up the cart! Quickly!

719
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,940
Sister Mu!

720
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,420
Brother Guo.

721
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,300
We haven't heard from you

722
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,540
since we last parted.

723
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,380
We've been worried about you.

724
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,780
Who is this baby?

725
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,940
After severing ties with Yang Kang,

726
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,820
I found out I was pregnant.

727
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,220
But now I want to leave the chaos.

728
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,220
I don't want him to know

729
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,140
where we are.

730
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,700
Gentlemen,

731
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,700
if you see Kang,

732
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,260
please don't tell him

733
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,500
about us.

734
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,580
Brother Kang...

735
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,940
He is dead.

736
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,500
He is dead?

737
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,900
Where?

738
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,380
At the Iron Spear Temple in Jiaxing.

739
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,660
I

740
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,540
buried him myself.

741
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,820
His life

742
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,260
was a mistake from the start.

743
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,700
Taoist Qiu and Brother Guo

744
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,660
gave him many chances to change,

745
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,540
but he kept making mistakes,

746
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,940
ruining his life.

747
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,620
At least he has a child.

748
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,700
I hope this baby

749
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,980
can live honorably and redeem

750
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,980
his father's mistakes.

751
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,420
He will.

752
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,660
I haven't

753
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,860
named the baby yet.

754
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,780
Brother Guo,

755
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,100
you are Kang's sworn brother.

756
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,380
How about

757
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,220
you name the baby

758
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,300
for his father?

759
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,180
Okay.

760
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,460
Kang, though born of loyal heritage,

761
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
strayed and kept making mistakes.

762
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,940
Unable to change,

763
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,580
he ended up in such a tragic state.

764
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,860
I hope as this child grows up,

765
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,820
he learns from his mistakes

766
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
and makes great improvements.

767
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,340
Let's call him

768
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,980
Yang Guo. Okay?

769
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,340
Okay.

770
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,820
Yang Guo it is.

771
00:41:25,698 --> 00:41:28,258
♪I wander in the martial world♪

772
00:41:28,938 --> 00:41:31,688
♪I drink a thousand cups of wine
and sing to the sky♪
