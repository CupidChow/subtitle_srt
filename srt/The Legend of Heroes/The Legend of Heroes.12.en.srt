=Episode 12=

3
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,650
Boatman.

4
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,460
How much to go to Peach Blossom Island?

5
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,910
Peach Blossom Island?

6
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,720
I don't know that place.

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,560
I don't know.

8
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,370
Boatman?

9
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,650
Boatman.

10
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,180
How much to go to Peach Blossom Island?

11
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
Young man,

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
you are not a local?

13
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
Just stay and have some fun

14
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,650
here in Zhoushan.

15
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,910
Why do you go to that freak place?

16
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:22,970
I'm going to find someone

17
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,030
and keep an appointment.

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,440
Boatman,

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,420
I must go to that island.

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,790
I'll pay whatever it takes.

21
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,880
That's all yours.

22
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,210
Fine,

23
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,350
but Peach Blossom Island is very eerie.

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,380
Even water bandits avoid it.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,370
If you can't come back,

26
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,210
it's not my fault.

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
No, I won't.

28
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,260
Alright. Go.

29
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,750
What would you like to eat?

30
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,970
Kang,

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,190
what do you want to eat?

32
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,630
Steamed quail...

33
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,660
Two bowls of light soup noodles, please.

34
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,820
Light soup noodles?

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,140
Two bowls of light soup noodles!

36
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,350
The weather is dry.

37
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,910
Eating light soup noodles will be refreshing.

38
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,030
This journey

39
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,820
has been hard on you.

40
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,310
Don't say that again.

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,140
As long as I'm with you,

42
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,940
I'm content.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,810
We'll need some more days

44
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,030
to return to Niujia Village.

45
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,940
We should save some money.

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,720
What's wrong?

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,230
Are you not feeling well?

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,190
Are we short on money?

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
No.

50
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,650
Father and I used to travel a lot.

51
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,540
I'm used to it.

52
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,030
We can make money along the way.

53
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,420
I'm just worried

54
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,260
you might find it undignified.

55
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,310
Don't worry about me.

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,790
Earning money by our own skills

57
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,260
is the greatest dignity.

58
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,860
Here you are.

59
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,850
Two bowls of light soup noodles.

60
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,690
Please enjoy.

61
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,900
(Peach Blossom Island)

62
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,590
(She's gone.)

63
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,390
(She's gone forever.)

64
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,940
(Feng Heng, Peach Blossom Island's mistress)

65
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,800
(Now,)

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,030
(in the Peach Blossom Garden,)

67
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,950
(it's just me alone.)

68
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,930
(Feng Heng's tomb)

69
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,830
(She once told me)

70
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,180
(that according to)

71
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,910
(her hometown's tradition.)

72
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,030
(Drunken Life, Dreamy Death)
(When a daughter is born,)

73
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,350
(they bury a jar of wine underground.)

74
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,270
(I buried a jar too.)

75
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,180
(The name of the wine is beautiful,)

76
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,950
("Drunken Life, Dreamy Death".)

77
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,910
(If only it could truly
make one forget all worries,)

78
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,830
(it would be great.)

79
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,060
(Days passed.)

80
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,210
(Rong)

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,270
(grew day by day.)

82
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,830
(The peach blossoms on the island)

83
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,660
(bloomed again.)

84
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,500
(To keep Rong)

85
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,950
(from feeling too lonely)

86
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,980
(on this isolated island,)

87
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,420
(I practiced martial arts with her,)

88
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,300
(taught her to read,)

89
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,500
(and watched her grow up.)

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,620
(Since then,)

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,620
(she seemed to have become)

92
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,030
(my only hope.)

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
(Later,)

94
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,030
(she would often)

95
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,790
(come to talk to you)

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,790
(about her thoughts.)

97
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,740
(Then)

98
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,100
(I knew)

99
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,060
(she wouldn't stay)

100
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,980
(in Peach Blossom Island.)

101
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,530
Father.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,230
What's at the end of the sea?

103
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,740
I don't remember.

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,180
Did mother come from across the sea?

105
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,060
Your mother wasn't from here.

106
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,440
Why don't you want to go see

107
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,620
the other side of the sea?

108
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,170
I wants to go out with you

109
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,010
and have a look.

110
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,230
I swore never to leave

111
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,270
Peach Blossom Island.

112
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,650
(Finally,)

113
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,860
(Rong still choose to leave)

114
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,060
(for the other side.)

115
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,570
(And I...)

116
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,270
The flowers on this island are beautiful.

117
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,790
Young man,

118
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,320
when will you go back?

119
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,060
I don't dare to wait here for you.

120
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,130
Boatman!

121
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,390
You go back first.

122
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,810
I probably won't return

123
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,060
this time.

124
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,740
I don't want to drag you into this.

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
Rong!

126
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,650
Rong!

127
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,410
White eagles?

128
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,540
(Qingyin Cave)

129
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,260
Who's there?

130
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,370
I'm Guo Jing,

131
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,710
here to visit Master Huang.

132
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,710
Then

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,380
why aren't you kneeling?

134
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,450
Master Huang,

135
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,640
your voice...

136
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,740
I caught a cold. Mind your own business!

137
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,430
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,590
I'm here

139
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,430
to accept your judgment.

140
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,900
I can't live without Rong.

141
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,070
As long as you let me see her,

142
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,470
you can do whatever you want with me.

143
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,590
Just bury me

144
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,570
on Peach Blossom Island

145
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,470
after I died

146
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
so I can be with her.

147
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,140
If you want to see her so badly,

148
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,680
prove yourself by getting through

149
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,310
this Peach Blossom Formation.

150
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm a slow learner.

151
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,470
But I must

152
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,900
see Rong today.

153
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,310
Out of respect for your sincerity,

154
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,370
I'll tell you once.

155
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,860
Kid, you listen up.

156
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,120
Okay.

157
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,760
At Qingyin Cave,

158
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,470
go 1,000 steps forward from Kun position.

159
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,520
If you see the Peach Blossom Formation change,

160
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,140
go 800 steps

161
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,950
to the southwest to the Zhen position.

162
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,310
If you see white sand in the north,

163
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,250
turn 500 steps to the northeast

164
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,860
to get out this formation.

165
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,500
Rong!

166
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
Silly boy!

167
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,450
I told you how to get out of

168
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,500
the formation.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,490
(Qingyin Cave)
Why can't you do that?

170
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,330
Sir,

171
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,550
I'll try again.

172
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,140
(Qingyin Cave)

173
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Sir!

174
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,970
I've tried dozens of times

175
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,140
but always end up here.

176
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,780
Did I do something wrong?

177
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,330
Sir?

178
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,500
Sir, say something.

179
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,260
Tell me how to get out!

180
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,190
Haven't I told you that?

181
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,100
(Zhou Botong, from Quzhen School)

182
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,370
You're not Master Huang?

183
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,210
Of course not.

184
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,620
I'm me. He's him.

185
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,850
If I were him, I'd be so unlucky.

186
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,950
Bad luck! Bad luck! Bad luck!

187
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,520
Sir, I don't even know you.

188
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,670
Why are you messing with me

189
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,610
if you're not Master Huang?

190
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,670
It's not messing.

191
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,710
It's a game.

192
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,140
Once you're on this island,

193
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,900
unless Old Heretic Huang agrees,

194
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,500
no one leaves the Peach Blossom Forest.

195
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,290
Game?

196
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,210
(Qingyin Cave)

197
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,710
These 15 years weren't a game for me,

198
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,590
but a bet!

199
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,570
I've spent 15 years

200
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,470
with Old Heretic Huang.

201
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,250
I just want to see who lives longer,

202
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,430
him or me.

203
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,850
Have you been trapped here

204
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,690
for 15 years?

205
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,130
Not kidding.

206
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,390
(Qingyin Cave)
When I first came,

207
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,430
Old Heretic Huang's daughter

208
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,210
was a little girl.

209
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,260
About this tall, up to here.

210
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,830
Yes, right here.

211
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,240
Sir,

212
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,570
you know Rong too?

213
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,020
We are old friends.

214
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,900
Little Rong! Little Rong!

215
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,140
Rong! Rong!

216
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,930
Sir,

217
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,830
Rong's friend is my friend.

218
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,500
I'll get you out of here.

219
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,130
You can't even get out

220
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,000
of here yourself.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,040
How will you get me out?

222
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,350
Tell me.

223
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,020
If you help me find Rong,

224
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,760
I'll find a way out.

225
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,860
Old Heretic Huang

226
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,980
loves his daughter more than his own life.

227
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,710
Aren't you afraid he will kill you?

228
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,000
If I die, I'll die here

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,230
and fertilize the peach blossoms.

230
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,140
Rong will be happy to see that.

231
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,590
It would be worth it even if I died.

232
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,980
Love is troublesome.

233
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,410
Listen to me.

234
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,680
You stay here in Qingyin Cave

235
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,830
for 15 years.

236
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,730
You'll definitely forget

237
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,590
about Rong.

238
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,710
I'll be here with you.

239
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,900
But, sir.

240
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,490
Why have you been trapped here

241
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,330
for 15 years?

242
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,980
That should blame

243
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,160
Old Heretic Huang's

244
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,500
that good wife.

245
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,230
She caused my suffering.

246
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,900
Great! Great!

247
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,550
Thank you, everyone.

248
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,130
My husband and I

249
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,250
are new here.

250
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,590
We need travel money to go home.

251
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,970
We're performing

252
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,260
our unique skills.

253
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,730
If you have money, please show support.

254
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,380
If not, just enjoy the show.

255
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,050
Kang.

256
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,000
Take it.

257
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,070
Great! Great!

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,160
Thank you, everyone.

259
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,500
Thank you. Thank you.

260
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,860
May you prosper.

261
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,610
Thank you all.

262
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,800
Please support us.

263
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,680
Good luck to you.

264
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,800
May your wish come true.

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,640
Thank you...

266
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,190
Do you have an official permission

267
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,950
to perform here?

268
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,360
Officer,

269
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,470
we're new here.

270
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
We didn't know we should have

271
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,310
a permit for performing.

272
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,040
I've never heard of

273
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,550
such a law in the Song Dynasty.

274
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
Well, then let me

275
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,590
tell you today.

276
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,400
This land belongs to the emperor.

277
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,260
Is that right?

278
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,290
Yes.

279
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,090
Then don't you need permission

280
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,850
of the owner

281
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,970
to do business

282
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,740
on the emperor's land?

283
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,210
Yes.

284
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,780
You are quite sensible.

285
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,140
Actually,

286
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,310
we don't

287
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,500
need a law

288
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,470
for such a simple thing.

289
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,330
Seems you're simply making things

290
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,230
difficult for us.

291
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,470
- Kang.
- What did you say?

292
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,520
Can you say that again?

293
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,480
Officer. Officer.

294
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,490
Please don't mind

295
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,330
my husband.

296
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,020
He doesn't understand these.

297
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,880
Yes, we are on the emperor's land

298
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,500
so we need a permit.

299
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,350
But we're new here

300
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,070
and we didn't know that.

301
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,310
Could you make an exception?

302
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,410
Hold on.

303
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,740
Look at you, so pretty.

304
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,980
Why do you have to

305
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,160
marry a useless man

306
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,670
like him?

307
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,810
Why not come with me?

308
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,980
I'll give you everything.

309
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,410
I promise,

310
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,500
I'll take good care of you.

311
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,300
Please stop joking, officer.

312
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,650
Girl,

313
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm serious.

314
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,230
You have to come with me.

315
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,010
Kang, just teach him a lesson.

316
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,960
Don't kill him.

317
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,820
That's right.

318
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,260
Spare me, hero!

319
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,320
Spare me!

320
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,020
It's all my fault.

321
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,910
Please let me go.

322
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,430
Please let me go.

323
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,080
Let's go.

324
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,080
Go.

325
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,720
Mother.

326
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,640
I really don't know

327
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,580
what to do.

328
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,950
I thought

329
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,150
Jing was honest and reliable.

330
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,190
So I can marry him.

331
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,580
But he is engaged on the grasslands.

332
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,820
He is Gold Knife Prince Consort
of Genghis Khan.

333
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,980
That Huazheng girl

334
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,540
is pretty

335
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,780
and heroic.

336
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,370
They are a couple of white eagles,

337
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,480
a perfect match in the grasslands.

338
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,850
But

339
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm just a little swallow

340
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,470
from the south.

341
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,110
But I can't

342
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,870
leave him.

343
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,060
Rong!

344
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,150
Rong!

345
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,670
What's that sound?

346
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,230
Don't listen. Cover your ears and run!

347
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,430
Too late. Sit and meditate.

348
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,430
Stayed focused and protect your elixir field.

349
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,480
This melody is nice.

350
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,320
Nonsense.

351
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,540
It's a soul-stealing melody. Do you know that?

352
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
No, I don't.

353
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,400
Just stay focused if you want to live.

354
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,240
Don't talk.

355
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,610
Sir, this melody...

356
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,820
This melody is really nice.

357
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,580
Why aren't you- Why aren't you affected?

358
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,780
Should I be?

359
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,780
This is his Emerging Waves
from the Dark Blue Sea.

360
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,580
You're not affected?

361
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,230
No.

362
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,740
You really aren't affected.

363
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,890
You're not affected?

364
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,370
I'm fine.

365
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,560
You are fine.

366
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,230
Then I'm fine.

367
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,890
Sir,

368
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,080
what's wrong?

369
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,580
Why are you sweating?

370
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,520
Are you okay?

371
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,560
I'm fine.

372
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,480
Sir.

373
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,410
Go back to the cave.

374
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,820
He can't get us there.

375
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,080
Okay.

376
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,210
Let's go.

377
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,430
- Old Imp!
- We're safe. We're safe.

378
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,530
Here. Here. Here.

379
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,300
You meddle too much again.

380
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,200
I've been idle for 15 years.

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,770
Now I have something to do, but you don't

382
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,240
allow it. Yet I must have this fun!

383
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,480
Let's see

384
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
- how long you can
- What's wrong?

385
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
stay here with this bastard!

386
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,910
Until you die!

387
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,110
Why don't you come in?

388
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,020
If you don't come in,

389
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,680
you are not Old Heretic Huang.

390
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,160
You'll be Dog Huang!

391
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,190
Come in! Come in!

392
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,780
- He's gone?
- I think so.

393
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,540
We won! We won!

394
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,410
Sir.

395
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,240
Why don't Master Huang

396
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,710
come into this cave?

397
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,200
Because I have something

398
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,780
he wants the most.

399
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,340
If he comes in,

400
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,740
I'll destroy it!

401
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,300
In these 15 years, he's tried everything,

402
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,230
but he still can't do anything to me!

403
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,820
He can't do anything to me.

404
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,110
What is it?

405
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,630
You're so curious.

406
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,440
Just like me. I'm curious too.

407
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,810
Come, have some.

408
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,650
You must be tired.

409
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,820
Just now,

410
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,950
I saw your inner energy technique.

411
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,400
Which one of the Seven Immortals

412
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
of Quanzhen is your master?

413
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,500
I learned from Seven Heroes of Jiangnan.

414
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,400
Why did Ke Zhen'e teach you martial arts

415
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,530
of Quanzhen School?

416
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,850
Taoist Ma taught me

417
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,340
internal martial arts for two years.

418
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,930
But

419
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,290
I didn't join

420
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,090
the Quanzhen School.

421
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,160
I see. Ma. Okay.

422
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,000
Here you are.

423
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,190
What did you do to make

424
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,820
Old Heretic Huang want to kill you?

425
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,920
I upset Rong

426
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,230
and offended Master Huang.

427
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,200
Man!

428
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,330
Why did you do that?

429
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,150
Old Heretic Huang won't let you go.

430
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,320
Fine. Sit. I'll protect you.

431
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,870
I'll protect you.

432
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,430
Come here.

433
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,890
Have some water.

434
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,280
Have some water.

435
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,370
Honestly,

436
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,290
I'm here to let him kill me.

437
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,230
That's not going to happen.

438
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,740
I didn't expect to

439
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,910
drag you into this

440
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,470
and make you suffer.

441
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,110
No. No.

442
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,390
I don't think Old Heretic Huang

443
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,910
really want to kill you.

444
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,370
Or you wouldn't be alive now

445
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,630
with his advanced skills.

446
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,630
He just wants to see

447
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,820
how close you

448
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,710
and his daughter are.

449
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,390
I'm sorry.

450
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,230
I don't understand.

451
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,160
You really don't get it?

452
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,740
Or are you kidding me?

453
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,720
I...

454
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,670
You fool!

455
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,260
That's Emerging Waves
from the Dark Blue Sea!

456
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,440
Old Heretic Huang

457
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,720
used this melody

458
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,920
because it contains

459
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,340
high-level internal energy.

460
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,610
After listening to it,

461
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,960
anyone who has been intimate with a woman

462
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,680
will be attracted

463
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,850
and affected.

464
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,680
They will be injured

465
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,060
or killed.

466
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,300
But you

467
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,440
weren't affected at all.

468
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,820
Old Heretic Huang can be reassured.

469
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,530
Being intimate.

470
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,370
Do you know that?

471
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,280
Sir,

472
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,300
Rong and I haven't...

473
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Good.

474
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,240
Don't you ever do that.

475
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,580
It hinders martial arts.

476
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,980
Sir, why are you staring at me?

477
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,650
Kid,

478
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,370
I've been here on the island

479
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,500
for 15 years,

480
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,480
hoping for someone

481
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,340
to spar with.

482
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,780
A few months ago,

483
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,770
Old Heretic Huang's daughter

484
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,880
came here

485
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,980
and talked with me.

486
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,910
I wanted to spar,

487
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,880
but she didn't come back

488
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,870
after that day.

489
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,690
Will you

490
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,920
spar with me?

491
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,810
Sir,

492
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,110
I should find Rong first.

493
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,010
Come on.

494
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,050
15 years!

495
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,720
I haven't gotten out of here!

496
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,340
You won't either.

497
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,720
"You can't get out." See?

498
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,130
Your Rong said you can't go.

499
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,580
Here. Let's fight.

500
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,710
Aren't your master Seven Freaks of Jiangnan?

501
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,050
How do you know Hong Qigong's
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms?

502
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,390
Qigong is also my master.

503
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,000
One more fight!

504
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,850
I've never seen

505
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,910
such skills before.

506
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,200
Why did I see

507
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,130
two of you fighting?

508
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,970
That's right.

509
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,670
Feels like there are two of me, right?

510
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,770
I've spent 15 years here,

511
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,330
but I didn't waste my time.

512
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,230
I've practiced so hard.

513
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,340
But no one is here.

514
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,050
So my left and right hands fight each other.

515
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,150
Left and right hands?

516
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,150
How can they fight each other?

517
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,920
I prentend the right hand is Huang,

518
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,540
and the left hand is me.

519
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,340
Right hand strikes.

520
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,770
Left hand deflects,

521
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,960
and then returns a punch.

522
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,200
Thus, the fight began.

523
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,500
I call this martial art

524
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,230
Left-Right Mutual Combat.

525
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,960
Impressive.

526
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,950
I'll teach you.

527
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,480
I don't want to learn, sir.

528
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,470
You will learn.

529
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,870
- I don't want to learn, sir.
- You must learn.

530
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,000
Stay focused.

531
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,540
Square with left. Circle with right.

532
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,050
Then you get a quare and a circle.

533
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,290
Haven't you heard me?

534
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,440
Now I don't want to

535
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,280
learn martial arts.

536
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,300
Can you do it?

537
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,670
How can you do that, sir?

538
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,060
That's talent.

539
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,980
Give it a try. Let's see
if you have the talent.

540
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,050
When I started to practice

541
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,400
drawing this,

542
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,300
it took me a whole month.

543
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,980
You don't have to rush it.

544
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,880
I believe no one

545
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,530
can draw it faster than me

546
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,110
except my senior Wang Chongyang.

547
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,530
Fingers connect to the heart.

548
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,580
One heart can't serve dual roles.

549
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,480
How can one manage to

550
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,470
use two hands for different purposes?

551
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,060
Focus on one task at a time...

552
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,300
Focus on one task at a time?

553
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,740
Miss, what would you like?

554
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,240
Please have a look.

555
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,170
Do you like it?

556
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,360
Guests, see you.

557
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,430
Not that much.

558
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,800
I'll look around a bit more.

559
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,020
Nianci, you go to rest.

560
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,330
I'll go feed the horses.

561
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,170
We'll travel tomorrow.

562
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,260
Alright. Don't be too late.

563
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,150
This is from the prince's mansion.

564
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,390
Exchange it for this hairpin.

565
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,190
- Deal?
- Sure, no problem.

566
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,200
Nianci, look what I got for you...

567
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,060
Kang, run!

568
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,230
Don't mind me.

569
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,440
Just go!

570
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,280
Bastard.

571
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,780
We meet again.

572
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,630
What's that in your hand?

573
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,910
Show it to me.

574
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,000
Officer,

575
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,430
I offended you today.

576
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,430
Please come after me

577
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,190
and spare her.

578
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,670
Come after you?

579
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,780
You wish!

580
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,780
I'll be honest with you.

581
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,130
Today,

582
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,580
I'm here for this girl.

583
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,430
What a pity.

584
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,060
You must be blind

585
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,780
not to recognize me.

586
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,530
But your choice in women

587
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,850
is good.

588
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,060
If you dare to touch her,

589
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,820
I'll make sure you wish

590
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,670
you were dead.

591
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,200
Well said.

592
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,230
Let's do as you say.

593
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,230
But I have to warn you.

594
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,580
If you move,

595
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,340
I'll scar her face!

596
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,430
What are you waiting for?

597
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
Hit him!

598
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,230
Stop!

599
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,740
Don't hit him.

600
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,110
Stop!

601
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,680
Stop!

602
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,610
Hit him hard!

603
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,500
Officer!

604
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,580
I beg you.

605
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,820
- Alright. Stop.
- Stop!

606
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,980
What are you waiting for?

607
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,370
Kill him!

608
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,020
No! No! No!

609
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,240
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

610
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,230
Your Highness?

611
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,130
Your Highness,

612
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,470
I didn't recognize you.

613
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,060
I didn't recognize you.

614
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,390
It's all my fault.

615
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,110
Please have mercy.

616
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,890
Your Highness.

617
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,060
Have mercy, Your Highness.

618
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,230
Kang...

619
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,340
Your Highness.

620
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,540
To speak bluntly,

621
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,090
you didn't suffer like this

622
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,710
in our Jin.

623
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,850
If His Royal Highness hadn't sent us

624
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,740
to follow you,

625
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,290
today could

626
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,060
have been a disaster.

627
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,870
Fate plays tricks on people.

628
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,190
I can't meet him anymore.

629
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,580
Your Highness, that's wrong.

630
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,370
His Royal Highness misses you

631
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,390
and awaits

632
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,630
your return.

633
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,390
But I won't return.

634
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,540
You drew these?

635
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,980
That's talent.

636
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,740
Do it again.

637
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,950
What's wrong, sir?

638
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,300
You slow learner,

639
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,810
I thought it would take you

640
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,670
a long time to learn.

641
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,110
But in one night,

642
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,920
you mastered this skill.

643
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,020
I followed your method,

644
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,630
drawing a circle and a square at the same time.

645
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,470
It has taken me a long time.

646
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,240
Sorry for being slow.

647
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,740
You are slow?

648
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,720
You are even faster than me.

649
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,710
You said you are slow.

650
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,870
What about me?

651
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,060
But I am slow.

652
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,900
Rong!

653
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,740
Rong!

654
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,640
Stop! Stop!

655
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,320
My ears hurt.

656
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,780
Just stop that, okay?

657
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,520
Sir,

658
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,900
Master Huang's flute music

659
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,710
can reach here.

660
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,420
So my voice

661
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,380
must reach Rong, too.

662
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,030
Silly boy.

663
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,710
Old Heretic Huang used his inner energy.

664
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:42,860
So it could reach far.

665
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,050
You're just yelling. It's different.

666
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,340
Then I'll try my inner energy.

667
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,820
I'll go first.

668
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,380
My inner energy is stronger.

669
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,230
If Rong hears, she'll come.

670
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,640
Save your energy

671
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,110
to practice the talent with me.

672
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,520
"Okay."

673
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,450
"I promise you.""Hurry up."

674
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,340
"Don't rush me!"

675
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,900
Rong!

676
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,070
Has a young man been here?

677
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,250
Don't run!

678
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
I haven't had such a good fight

679
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,080
in a long time!

680
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,080
Kid,

681
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,450
here.

682
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,370
Sir,

683
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,070
while sparring with you,

684
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,840
I realized something.

685
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,680
What?

686
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,970
Sir,

687
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,630
your hands use

688
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,770
different techniques,

689
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,970
like two people

690
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,810
fighting at the same time.

691
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,460
If that's the case,

692
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,260
it's like

693
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,590
two people fighting one.

694
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,990
Though the inner energy is the same,

695
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,460
there are more moves.

696
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,150
It's an advantage.

697
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,420
This skill is very useful.

698
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,630
You are talented.

699
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,410
Actually,

700
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,610
I created this skill

701
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,670
out of boredom,

702
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,670
not realizing

703
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,940
this skill

704
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,260
could be so effective in fighting.

705
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:48,930
Sir,

706
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:49,930
what's wrong?

707
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,670
I'm leaving the cave!

708
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:53,770
Leave the cave?

709
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,640
Where is it?

710
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,360
You're not afraid of Master Huang now?

711
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,450
Now I've mastered

712
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,360
peerless martial arts.

713
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,510
I'm not afraid of Old Heretic Huang!

714
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,610
Aren't we being too optimistic?

715
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,450
I used to fear

716
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,990
that he would give me a hard time.

717
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,630
But now I want him to come,

718
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,760
give him a good beating

719
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,280
and vent my anger.

720
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,120
If...

721
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,450
If I weren't aware of

722
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,990
the island's layout,

723
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,780
I would have sought him out long ago.

724
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,590
It's mealtime!

725
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,410
Sir,

726
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,460
can you take me to see Rong?

727
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,380
Don't waste your efforts.

728
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,820
These mute servants

729
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,300
were captured by Old Heretic Huang.

730
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,530
He cut their tongues

731
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,630
and trapped them here for life.

732
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,680
Eat your food.

733
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,450
No wonder the ones

734
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,930
who brought meals these days

735
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,030
could only hum.

736
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,410
Rong's father

737
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,450
is too cruel.

738
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,010
That's why people call him

739
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,490
Old Heretic Huang.

740
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,820
He even prepared a meal for you.

741
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,890
That's kind.

742
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,720
- Eat. Eat.
- Sir.

743
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,570
Aren't you afraid of being poisoned?

744
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,380
Though he is detestable,

745
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,300
he is still a master.

746
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,900
For 15 years,

747
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,360
he's never deprived me of three meals a day.

748
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,070
I respect him for that.

749
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,600
Sir,

750
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,820
Rong made this chicken soup.

751
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,240
Out of ten sentences,

752
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,190
nine of yours are about Rong.

753
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,360
What spell did Huang Rong

754
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,800
cast on you?

755
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,300
This really is Rong's chicken soup.

756
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,760
No one else can make it.

757
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,110
I'll tell you a story.

758
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,160
And you'll stop talking

759
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,510
about Rong. Okay?

760
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,640
Alright.

761
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
Do you know about

762
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,840
the contest on the top of Mount Hua

763
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
among the Five Greats

764
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,670
Eastern Heretic, Western Venom,

765
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,450
Southern Emperor, Northern Beggar,

766
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,940
and Central Divine?

767
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,340
Five of them

768
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,550
were fight for a scripture.

769
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,900
Is that the Nine Yin Manual?

770
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,080
Then do you know

771
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,820
who created the Nine Yin Manual?

772
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,330
No.

773
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,190
Everyone knows

774
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,230
the power of the Nine Yin Manual,

775
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,780
but few know

776
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,570
the mastermind behind it

777
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,710
is more powerful.

778
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,160
This one

779
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,820
is Huang Chang.

780
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,780
Back then,

781
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,840
he was ordered by a Song emperor

782
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,360
to compile Taoist scriptures,

783
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,390
the Wanshou Daozang.
[*Daozang: a large canon of Taoist writings]

784
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,680
He unintentionally

785
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,610
understood the Taoist principles.

786
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,930
Then he became

787
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,070
a martial arts grandmaster without a teacher.

788
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,780
But he made skilled enemies

789
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,160
by helping the emperor

790
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,380
destroy the Manichaeism,

791
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,230
leading to

792
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,940
his family's destruction.

793
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,930
For 40 years,

794
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,280
he pondered revenge

795
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,130
and eventually

796
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,890
found ways to counter

797
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,110
those martial artists' techniques.

798
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,340
But when he emerged,

799
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,280
(Haizhou)

800
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,860
everything had changed,

801
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,710
and his enemies were gone.

802
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,150
Everyone dies eventually.

803
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,150
Huang Chang is no exception.

804
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,680
But he couldn't

805
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,720
let his decades of effort

806
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,530
go to waste.

807
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,370
So

808
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,890
he wrote down everything

809
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,630
into two volumes.

810
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:24,890
If people

811
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,300
fight over this manual,

812
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,800
causing disasters

813
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,780
like family destruction,

814
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,670
this manual

815
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,510
is the most harmful thing.

816
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,900
Kid,

817
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,450
you sound just like

818
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,070
my senior.

819
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,080
If martial arts

820
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,590
are just for killing and fighting,

821
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,450
what's the point of practicing them?

822
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,930
If people even learned a little

823
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,190
from that,

824
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,190
it's beneficial.

825
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,380
If that's the case,

826
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,710
I'd rather not practice.

827
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,040
No!

828
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,330
Practice them!

829
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,370
No, I won't.

830
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,460
Martial arts bring happiness.

831
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,520
No, it isn't.

832
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,990
Being with Rong is the happiest.

833
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,530
Didn't we make a deal?

834
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,160
I tell you a story, and you don't mention Rong.

835
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,670
Why do we talk about Rong again?

836
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,550
You fool! You fool!

837
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,570
I told you!

838
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,530
Rong made this.

839
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,420
She wrote me a letter.

840
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,550
What are you doing?

841
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,420
(Jing)

842
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,090
Kid, I'm saving you.

843
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,930
What do you mean?

844
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,110
Old Heretic Huang is eccentric.

845
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,680
If he finds out

846
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,010
you and Rong are

847
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:31,940
secretly communicating,

848
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,360
you might end up

849
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,240
like the mute servants.

850
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,710
Even if Master Huang wants to kill me,

851
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,780
I'll go find Rong.

852
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,240
Are you sure?

853
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,080
Yes.

854
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,420
Kid, wait.

855
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,860
Isn't Hong Qigong your master?

856
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,720
Ask him to support you.

857
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,670
He is the Northern Beggar.

858
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,240
Old Heretic Huang

859
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,740
will give him some respect.

860
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,780
Why didn't I think of that?

861
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,110
No. No. No.

862
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,050
You're still on this island

863
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:02,890
and can't leave.

864
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,150
How can you tell your master?

865
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:05,730
No. No. No.

866
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,650
That's not a good idea.

867
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,710
But I can handle that.

868
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,460
Kid, you can call eagles?

869
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,640
Sir.

870
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,710
These are two eagles I raised in the desert.

871
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,610
Recently, they followed my old friend

872
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,450
to the Central Plains.

873
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,890
If not for your reminder,

874
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:25,860
I'd have forgotten.

875
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,010
I'll send them to my master,

876
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,900
asking him to come to

877
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,530
Peach Blossom Island

878
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,510
and help me out.

879
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,380
