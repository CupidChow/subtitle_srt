1
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,680
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,180
=Episode 13=

3
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,910
If the house is left
uninhabited for too long,

4
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,100
it'll become dismal.

5
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,860
But we're living here.

6
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,410
In a few days,

7
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,820
it will be spruced up.

8
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,370
Kang.

9
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,910
If you don't like this old house,

10
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,910
we can find another place.

11
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,140
How can that be?

12
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,860
I just feel moved.

13
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,130
The abducted child

14
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,230
has just returned home.

15
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,140
How can I not be emotional

16
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,630
about how fickle the world can be?

17
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,050
Dad.

18
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,770
Have a seat.

19
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,030
It's been so many years.

20
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,510
So many years.

21
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,420
Shouldn I celebrate

22
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,940
your birthday today?

23
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,590
Dad.

24
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,060
It's really hard to forget someone.

25
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,180
Mother has been gone for so many years,

26
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,620
how did you work through that?

27
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,660
Can that jar of Drunken Haze

28
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,830
really make people forget everything?

29
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,100
Forgetting is not hard.

30
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,060
What's terrifying is
not being able to forget.

31
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,100
(After I go to see Jing,)

32
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,180
(I'll let him go back to Mongolia.)

33
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,770
(Dad,)

34
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,150
(you can drink half the jar)

35
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,950
(of Drunken Haze.)

36
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,390
(Leave the rest to me.)

37
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,760
The fifteen years I spent
on Peach Blossom Island

38
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,270
are not wasted.

39
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,880
I created the 72 Vacant Fists

40
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,810
which value nihility and gentleness.

41
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,810
Like the Eight-Diagram tactics
on the stone wall,

42
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,230
it's the most powerful
to combine Yin and Yang.

43
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,960
It's a counter-move against

44
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,470
your Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

45
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,840
Senior.

46
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,250
This fist position you created

47
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,320
is very much like

48
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,390
the Proud Dragon Repents

49
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,490
Qigong told me.

50
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,290
The beggar has good eye

51
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,500
for choosing disciples.

52
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,600
Come.

53
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,860
Let me teach you.

54
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,010
Dad.

55
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,030
I want to see him for the last time.

56
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,740
Then I'll ask him

57
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,950
to return to the grassland.

58
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,540
Impressive, you little brat.

59
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,910
You've learned

60
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,400
most of my Vacant Fist techniques

61
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,980
overnight.

62
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,950
I learnedf from the best.

63
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,440
Remarkable, remarkable.

64
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,540
You have some talent.

65
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,250
If I don't use

66
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,150
internal power

67
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,490
and rely only on the moves,

68
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,950
I can't beat you at all.

69
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,030
So now we are

70
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,240
two Guo Jings

71
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,500
and two Old Imps.

72
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,880
Even if we encounter Old Heretic Huang,

73
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,830
we don't need to fear him.

74
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,420
With your current strength,

75
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,370
you don't need to fear Mr. Huang.

76
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,590
Rest assured.

77
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,420
I won't make things difficult for you.

78
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,730
I won't make you fight with
your father-in-law.

79
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,170
Sir, I didn't mean that.

80
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,740
Don't I understand what you mean?

81
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,350
Boring.

82
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,540
Let's play something interesting.

83
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
Today,

84
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,270
let's escape from
the Peach Blossom Forest.

85
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,880
The formation
of the Peach Blossom Forest

86
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,150
reversed Yin and Yang.

87
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,500
The secret of this formation is

88
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,320
the four doors of Yin

89
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,170
and the four doors of Yang

90
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,420
can change positions constantly.

91
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,230
I can choose the final two doors.

92
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,370
But in the end,

93
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,490
I always can't figure out

94
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,850
which one is the Growth Door

95
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,100
and which one is the Death Door.

96
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,130
Let's split up.

97
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,290
One of us

98
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,060
will reach the Growth Door.

99
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,830
What should we do?

100
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,590
It seems that
since you arrived on the island,

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,470
Old Heretic Huang
has changed the formation again.

102
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,390
But it can't baffle me.

103
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,380
(River Map)

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,350
Go that way, and take it with you.

105
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,760
Okay.

106
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,190
Finally found it!

107
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,550
The last door

108
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,830
is right around here.

109
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,850
Sir, where should we go next?

110
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,140
There are only two ways, left and right.

111
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,210
They're the Growth Door
and the Death Door.

112
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,210
You go that way.

113
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,470
- Go.
- Okay.

114
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,620
Growth Door! Growth Door!

115
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,400
This Old Imp is really fearless.

116
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,590
He actually found this place.

117
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,070
My father's formation
is not this easy to break.

118
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,670
Both the left and right doors
are Death Doors.

119
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,020
This is a dead end.

120
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,410
It seems like

121
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,470
I can only rely on Mr. Zhou.

122
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,900
Jing.

123
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,860
Where are you?

124
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,430
Rong.

125
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,410
Rong.

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
Jing.

127
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,930
Rong.

128
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
Jing.

129
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,240
Rong.

130
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,780
It's so good to find you.

131
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,980
Let me down first.

132
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,810
Put me down.

133
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,020
We can't go on like this anymore.

134
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,100
During these days without you,

135
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,830
I figured it out.

136
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,780
I really like you, that's for sure.

137
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,900
But I won't allow anyone
to share your love.

138
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,810
Rong.

139
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,670
I've told you before

140
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,350
I just treat Huazheng as a sister.

141
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,260
I don't want to be her husband.

142
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,590
I just want to be with you.

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,280
Now is your last chance

144
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,260
to leave Peach Blossom Island.

145
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,980
I got my father drunk.

146
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,470
I will take you to leave here.

147
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,550
Don't come back.

148
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,860
I didn't lie to you.

149
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,810
I came here

150
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,140
with no intention of leaving.

151
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,100
If my father wakes up,

152
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,470
you will be trapped here forever.

153
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,950
Then I'll stay here
for the rest of my life.

154
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,190
Stop talking nonsense.

155
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,670
My father will really kill you.

156
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,670
Then let him kill me.

157
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,600
I will be

158
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,310
wherever you are.

159
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,590
Let go of your hand.

160
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,310
You scoundrel.

161
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,290
Dad.

162
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,900
My daughter

163
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,860
went through all this trouble

164
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,710
to let you go.

165
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,350
Since you want to die,

166
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,430
I will grant your wish.

167
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,380
- Dad.
- Stop!

168
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,970
As a grandmaster,
how can you bully the weak?

169
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,570
Shameless, shameless!

170
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,670
What does this have to do with you?

171
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,450
I'm just trying to help this kid.

172
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,380
It is my business.

173
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,600
If you're unconvinced,

174
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,400
let's have a duel.

175
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,920
Have you forgotten why you've been

176
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,430
on my Peach Blossom Island
for fifteen years?

177
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,470
I forgot!

178
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,680
My martial arts skills
have greatly improved now.

179
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,100
Do you dare to have a match with me?

180
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,900
Snake!

181
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Sir.

182
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,450
You can't beat me,

183
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,470
so you used this evil trick.

184
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,360
Are you okay?

185
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,450
Rong.

186
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,670
Silver-bellied snake.

187
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,520
Snake.

188
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,810
Dad.

189
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,430
Why are there
so many snakes on our island?

190
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,020
I'm most afraid of snakes.

191
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,400
Hurry up, kid.

192
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,330
- Rong.
- Back to the cave.

193
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,090
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

194
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,150
- Sir, let me carry you.
- Hurry and go.

195
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,100
Run fast.

196
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,590
I didn't expect

197
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,310
this time,

198
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,500
I'm going to die

199
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,830
because of the snake.

200
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Don't suck it.

201
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,400
This snake venom is special.

202
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,670
It will kill you.

203
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,710
Jing.

204
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,680
This medicine is specifically
for detoxifying snake venom.

205
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,260
Apply it for three days, and he'll heal.

206
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,980
Comfortable.

207
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,250
Comfortable!

208
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,070
Sir, you're awake.

209
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,470
- How do you feel?
- You little rascal.

210
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,980
You sucked the snake blood.

211
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,760
How come you're fine?

212
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,140
I once sucked the blood

213
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,470
of a Seven-Step Viper,

214
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,140
so I became immune to all poisons.

215
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,350
So powerful.

216
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,950
Thank you for saving me.

217
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,730
Yes, yes, I cannot die.

218
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,160
I haven't defeated
Old Heretic Huang yet.

219
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,000
I can't die.

220
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,260
Mr. Huang is so powerful.

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,850
You should first...

222
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,950
First break his formation.

223
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,210
I can win, kid.

224
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,050
Do you look down on me?

225
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,980
Old Heretic Huang.

226
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,260
I have come up with a brilliant plan.

227
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,610
I have come up with a brilliant plan

228
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,190
to break Old Heretic Huang's formation.

229
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,500
What are you doing?

230
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,610
No, no, please get up.

231
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,900
Since you think I'm not bad,

232
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,570
how about we become

233
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,130
sworn brothers?

234
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,370
I can't do that.

235
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,880
You are Master Ma Yu's martial uncle.

236
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,020
That doesn't matter.

237
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,590
You call him Master,

238
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,070
call me Big Brother.

239
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
Kneel down.

240
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,570
Today,

241
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,490
I must make you

242
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,850
my sworn brother.

243
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,020
Why do you have to

244
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,520
pick me?

245
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,360
First,

246
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,040
this is how I deal with

247
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,380
Old Heretic Huang.

248
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,740
Don't ask

249
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,290
about the specifics.

250
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,800
You will know when the time comes.

251
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,710
In any case,
it's beneficial for you with no harm.

252
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,930
Second,

253
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,380
it's also the most important.

254
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,260
I think highly of you.

255
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,230
You are simple, honest.

256
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,680
And you saved me.

257
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,730
It's okay, sir.

258
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,020
If you don't mind,

259
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,900
let's become sworn brothers.

260
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,470
Since you think so highly of me,

261
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,810
well,

262
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,260
it's better to obey respectfully.

263
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,980
To the white condor above

264
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,210
and the cockroach down,

265
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,860
all living beings are the witnesses.

266
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,430
Today, Guo Jing and I
become sworn brothers.

267
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,830
We'll share wealth and happiness,

268
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,710
eat happily together,

269
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,500
practice together,

270
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,370
and be happy together.

271
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,370
Happy, happy, extremely happy!

272
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,260
Whoever regrets it
will be struck by thunder.

273
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,910
Okay, be happy!

274
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,580
Call me Big Brother.

275
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,080
Big Brother.

276
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,060
Kowtow.

277
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,150
Ceremony completed.

278
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
Big Brother.

279
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,150
My good brother.

280
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,090
I have a little brother now.

281
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,150
I have a big brother now.

282
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
Little rascal.

283
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
My brother.

284
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,390
Go drink water.

285
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,800
Brother.

286
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,470
This is what you used to save me.

287
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,230
No, this is what I use
to wrap my dagger.

288
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,130
Brother.

289
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,020
Where did you get this thing?

290
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,390
My second master gave it to me.

291
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,060
He probably got it from Mei Chaofeng.

292
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,390
Do you know

293
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,500
what is written on it?

294
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,850
What?

295
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,340
I haven't opened it before.

296
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,470
I can't understand it either.

297
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,610
(You little brat.)

298
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,150
(Fortune really favours fools.)

299
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,960
(He actually doesn't know)

300
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,190
(this is the Nine Yin Manual.)

301
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,950
Big Brother, what's wrong with you?

302
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
Nothing.

303
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,320
Brother.

304
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,440
I like this thing.

305
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,340
How about giving it to me?

306
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,320
If you like it, then take it.

307
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,710
I'll find another one.

308
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,950
Thanks.

309
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:10,930
I like it.

310
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,300
Snake!

311
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,910
I fear nothing in the world,

312
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,400
except for snakes and insects.

313
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
I have been on
Peach Blossom Island for fifteen years,

314
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
and I have never seen a snake before.

315
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,540
Why are there so many snakes today?

316
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,190
Hit it, hit it!

317
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,610
That's not right.

318
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,950
Rong said her dad does not keep snakes.

319
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,820
Could it be...

320
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,130
Uncle.

321
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,240
Ke.

322
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,290
Your snake formation can't break

323
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,430
the one on the Island.

324
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,110
Remove it quickly.

325
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,910
Don't lose your manners.

326
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,690
Yes.

327
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,500
Ouyang.

328
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,000
Yaoshi.

329
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,020
How have you been?

330
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,060
This is my nephew.

331
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,910
Just now he was messing around.

332
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,300
Please forgive him.

333
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,910
Ke, pay your respects.

334
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,800
Ke.

335
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,060
You are the junior.

336
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,190
It is only natural

337
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,470
to make a big salute to Mr. Huang.

338
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:17,980
One more.

339
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,970
Uncle.

340
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,060
I'm here to pay my respects.

341
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,340
I am not unfamiliar with you.

342
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,720
Before,

343
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,910
you bullied my disciple.

344
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,110
Then you set up a snake formation
to attack my daughter.

345
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,110
Truly a young hero.

346
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,670
They are just playing around.

347
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,760
It didn't count.

348
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I also didn't discipline him

349
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,300
very well.

350
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,110
I will punish him properly
when we get back.

351
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
Don't blame him.

352
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,760
Don't blame him.

353
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,230
Sorry for not welcoming you earlier.

354
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,210
Please.

355
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,110
If Ouyang Ke really came,

356
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
I wonder how Rong is doing now.

357
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,630
Not to mention Ouyang Ke,

358
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,340
even Ouyang Feng is here,

359
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,850
Old Heretic Huang won't suffer.

360
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
Besides,

361
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,430
where we are now?

362
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,290
The Peach Blossom Island.

363
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,130
Isn't that right?

364
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,640
You're right.

365
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,300
Don't think about finding Rong.

366
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,340
Isn't it asking for trouble for yourself?

367
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,040
Moreover,

368
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,670
can you get out?

369
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,260
You're picking on me again.

370
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,340
If I could go out,
I would have left long ago.

371
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
Okay, okay.

372
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,960
Let's try to figure it out.

373
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,680
We will definitely
break through this formation.

374
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,520
Right?

375
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,780
If you feel bored,

376
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,500
I will teach you some moves.

377
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,470
I've learned

378
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,770
your Vacant Fist

379
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,090
and Technique of Ambidexterity.

380
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,290
What other things can I learn from you?

381
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,960
I didn't teach you

382
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,260
my most powerful moves.

383
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,230
You are just bragging.

384
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,610
No way, no way.

385
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,290
Are you really going
to give the Nine Yin Manual

386
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,390
to this kid?

387
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,850
The second volume

388
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,150
was brought by him in the first place.

389
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,300
It proves that he
has a connection to the manual.

390
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,630
You are going against Senior's promise.

391
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,910
You want to read the manual yourself.

392
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,240
You want to learn the moves on it, right?

393
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,090
Senior just doesn't want me to practice

394
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,920
the martial arts in this manual.

395
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,960
He doesn't forbid others from practicing.

396
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,430
I asked this brat to practice.

397
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,390
It doesn't count as breaking the promise.

398
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,500
And I

399
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,430
just steal a peek

400
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,810
of the manual.

401
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,060
What does it matter?

402
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
Big Brother.

403
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,110
What are you thinking about?

404
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,710
Brother.

405
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,300
I've been keeping this in reserve.

406
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,190
We are sworn brothers now.

407
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,780
I think I can teach it to you.

408
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,970
Do you want to learn?

409
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,950
I'll learn whatever you teach me.

410
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,060
This is something

411
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,470
I created by myself.

412
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,060
It's called the Imp's Manual.

413
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,640
The Imp's Manual

414
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,950
combines the wisdom

415
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,950
I gathered for a lifetime.

416
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,370
If you can integrate it

417
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,630
with my Technique of Ambidexterity,

418
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,130
72 Vacant Fists,

419
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,370
and the old beggar's

420
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,450
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms,

421
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,820
you will be invincible

422
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,370
at the next duel atop Mount Hua.

423
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,610
I have never thought about

424
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,110
becoming invincible.

425
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,670
Little rascal.

426
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
My brother.

427
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,820
If you can become invincible,

428
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,390
Rong will be yours.

429
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,170
Rong?

430
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,410
Sit down quickly.

431
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,800
Okay.

432
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,870
Swing the sword admist peach blossoms,

433
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,050
playing the song on a jade flute.

434
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,870
This statement is true.

435
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,530
The environment here is much better

436
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,640
than Mount White Camel.

437
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,430
The Western Regions are vast.

438
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,710
If there's a chance,

439
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,810
you must show me around

440
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,440
at your Mount White Camel Manor.

441
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,950
Sure, Yaoshi.

442
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,200
I wondered why there are so many snakes

443
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,390
on this Peach Blossom Island.

444
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,400
So you are here.

445
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,260
Rong, don't be rude.

446
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,650
Hurry up.

447
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,020
Pay your respects to Uncle Ouyang.

448
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,630
Greetings, Mr. Ouyang.

449
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,850
Okay.

450
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,520
Dad.

451
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,910
This Ouyang Ke

452
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,780
bullied me many times
on the Central Plains.

453
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,710
Is that so?

454
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,090
I came specifically

455
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,740
to apologize to Rong.

456
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,110
Who knows what are your intentions?

457
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Rong.

458
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,400
No wonder Ke

459
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,670
is so deeply in love with her.

460
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,010
Luckily Rong takes after her mom,

461
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,850
not you.

462
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,650
Rong.

463
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,870
This is a rhinoceros horn pill

464
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,530
obtained from a divine beast
on our Western Regions.

465
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,430
It was carefully cultivated by my uncle.

466
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,110
Carrying it with you,
you are immune to all poisons.

467
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,910
There is only one in the world.

468
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,260
What exactly do you want?

469
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,740
I...

470
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,950
I want to propose a marriage

471
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,020
and ask Rong to be my wife.

472
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,090
With it,
you can marry into the Western Regions

473
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,960
and no longer fear those

474
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,940
venomous snakes and insects.

475
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
Uncle Ouyang.

476
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,390
Our Peach Blossom Island

477
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,230
has neither insects nor poisons.

478
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,580
No need for this treasure.

479
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,340
It'll definitely be useful.

480
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,480
Yaoshi.

481
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,880
Everyone in the world

482
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,000
knows I am skilled in using poison.

483
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,370
I will give this antidote

484
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,210
to Rong.

485
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,330
This is enough to prove

486
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,330
our sincerity.

487
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,260
Yaoshi, you can rest assured.

488
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,080
Rong.

489
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,540
Take it first.

490
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,580
Thank you, Uncle.

491
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,130
You're welcome.

492
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,720
Having accepted this gift,

493
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,640
does it mean you want

494
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,480
to make friends with me?

495
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,740
Are you crazy?

496
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,890
Dad.

497
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,150
I'd rather you beat me to death.

498
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,780
I would rather die

499
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,630
than be with a wicked person like you.

500
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,760
You...

501
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm going to tell my mother

502
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,780
you don't treat me nicely.

503
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,890
Rong.

504
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,540
This girl

505
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,110
was spoiled by me.

506
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,800
My apologies.

507
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,330
It's okay, Rong

508
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,230
just want to test Ke's martial arts.

509
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,400
The feelings between them

510
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,160
can be gradually developed.

511
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,850
Once they start to fight,

512
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,240
they will get closer to each other.

513
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,110
Well...

514
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,130
Ke is very

515
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,470
devoted to Rong.

516
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,260
If you agree to this marriage,

517
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
we will be family

518
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,190
and be doubly related.

519
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,710
If you need my help in the future,

520
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,710
I will go through fire and water for you.

521
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,020
I will take

522
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,650
this anti-poison treasure.

523
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,670
The marriage

524
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,020
is not in a hurry.

525
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,570
It's not easy for you

526
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,410
to come by.

527
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,910
We haven't seen each other
for so many years.

528
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,500
You must stay a few more days.

529
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,150
The two of us

530
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,800
can have a drink.

531
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,610
Sure.

532
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,390
It is the Way of Heaven
to diminish superabundance,

533
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,480
and to supplement deficiency.

534
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,150
It is the Way of Heaven
to diminish superabundance,

535
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,670
and to supplement deficiency.

536
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,670
A man takes away from those
who have not enough

537
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,950
to add to his own superabundance.

538
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,770
A man takes away from those
who have not enough

539
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,060
to add to his own superabundance.

540
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,810
(I finally saw)

541
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,390
(what is the Nine Yin Manual.)

542
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,300
(It's really awesome.)

543
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,260
You fell from the clouds into the mud.

544
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,670
I understand that you feel bitter.

545
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,610
Let's get used to it

546
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,500
when we're in the new place.

547
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,430
I will always be with you.

548
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,740
I know.

549
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,390
My heart is loftier than the sky,

550
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,190
but my life is thinner than paper.

551
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,980
Don't say that.

552
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,960
Let's go buy some seeds,

553
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,150
flower seeds and vegetable seeds.

554
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,680
We'll dress up our house and garden

555
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,110
so beautifully.

556
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,930
Stop!

557
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,850
Where are you running?

558
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,540
The Four Devils of the Yellow River
are chasing the Beggars' Gang.

559
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,370
- Even if we return to Niujia Village,
- Come back!

560
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,210
it'll be the same.

561
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,570
There is no pure land in this world.

562
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,810
Beggar, keep running!

563
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,150
I'm indebted to the Beggars' Gang.

564
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Qigong once taught me martial arts.

565
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,780
- Don't run.
- I must help them.

566
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,580
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

567
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,500
Your Highness.

568
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,850
Get lost.

569
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,710
Don't let me see you again.

570
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,130
Go, go, go.

571
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,910
Thank

572
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,580
the both of you.

573
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Qigong once taught me

574
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,280
some martial arts.

575
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,500
Although he does not take disciples,

576
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,240
in my heart,

577
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,910
he's always been a mentor.

578
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,950
I have always been grateful
to the Beggars' Gang.

579
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,710
You know Qigong?

580
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,110
That's great.

581
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,950
I was afraid of ruining everything.

582
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,820
What is it?

583
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,580
Why do the Four Devils of the Yellow River
want to kill you?

584
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,670
The Book of Wumu.

585
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,470
Do you recognize

586
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,630
the mark of the Beggars' Gang?

587
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,950
Yes, Qigong told me.

588
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,500
On the fifteenth day of next month,

589
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,340
at the gathering in Yuezhou,

590
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,190
pass the message to the gang.

591
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,260
The Book

592
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,020
is in

593
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,740
Cuihan Hall.

594
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,040
Kang.

595
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,240
I need to go deliver the message

596
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,090
to the Beggars' Gang.

597
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,720
Please take care of him.

598
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
I should go instead.

599
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,090
I'm almost part of the gang.

600
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,340
If I go, things will be easier.

601
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,710
I'm leaving first.

602
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,810
Be careful on your way.

603
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,650
Okay.

604
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,710
Do you know what you want?

605
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,440
Do you want to stay here

606
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,430
all your life?

607
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:33,910
The Book of Wumu.

608
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,820
The Book of Wumu. The Book of Wumu.

609
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,060
What are you waiting for?

610
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,060
Take action!

611
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,190
Take action!

612
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,740
Go ahead!

613
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

614
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,950
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

615
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm sorry.

616
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,170
I'm sorry.

617
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,560
Big Brother.

618
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,990
Your Imp's Manual is really good.

619
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,140
These days,

620
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,760
my skills have improved a lot.

621
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,030
What do you think?

622
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,340
But you are still too young.

623
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,780
This Nine...

624
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,970
Your foundation is not stable enough,

625
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,240
and your internal energy not deep,

626
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,930
so you cannot fully
exert your strength yet.

627
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,030
I suggest you practice

628
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,190
the Imp's Manual daily.

629
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,640
Okay, understood.

630
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,150
I will practice diligently.

631
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,410
Jing.

632
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,850
Rong.

633
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,160
Can't watch it.

634
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,530
Can't watch it. Can't watch it.

635
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,380
Rong, you're finally here.

636
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,340
I've missed you so much these days.

637
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,730
Jing.

638
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,380
My father has become confused.

639
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,570
Ouyang Feng came to propose a marriage.

640
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,030
He wants me to marry Ouyang Ke.

641
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,530
Ouyang Feng came to propose marriage?

642
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,940
Old Venomous Creature really came.

643
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,590
I wondered why there are so many snakes.

644
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,230
This is going to be interesting.

645
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,710
Let's leave Peach Blossom Island.

646
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,040
Big Brother.

647
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,740
Do you want to come with us?

648
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,640
I'm not going.

649
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,510
Why do you call Old Imp big brother?

650
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,070
I have become sworn brothers
with Guo Jing.

651
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,190
From now on, you are my sister-in-law.

652
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,200
Old Imp.

653
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,570
You're playing quite big this time.

654
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,150
I'll play even bigger.

655
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,260
Bigger surprises are prepared
for your dad.

656
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:32,990
What surprise?

657
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,590
Can't say now.

658
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:36,970
Big Brother.

659
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,410
You really aren't coming with us?

660
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,780
No, take her to leave first.

661
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,050
I still have an unfulfilled appointment

662
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,890
with Old Heretic Huang.

663
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,110
My words have always been trustworthy.

664
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,600
Well,

665
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,050
I will come to find you

666
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,090
when I settle the score with him.

667
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:52,930
Okay then.

668
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,860
Take care of yourself, Big Brother.

669
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,230
- Go.
- Let's go.

670
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,570
Brat.

671
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,340
You left so quickly.

672
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,630
I asked the mute servant
to arrange a boat for me,

673
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,010
why is there no boat?

674
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,850
Rong.

675
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,410
Want a boat?

676
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,250
Ask me.

677
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,670
I can take you away.

678
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,040
Ouyang Ke.

679
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,670
What are you doing here?

680
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,260
I am here to propose marriage.

681
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,160
You're eloping with

682
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,190
my not-yet-married wife.

683
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,090
Isn't that a bit too much?

684
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,550
Who is your wife?

685
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,710
All you do is
talk nonsense all day long.

686
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
Jing, help me knock out one of his teeth.

687
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,710
Looking for death.

688
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,860
Rong, don't come over.

689
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,850
Master.

690
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,940
- Master.
- Master.

691
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,990
Qigong.

692
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,410
You've aged quite a lot

693
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,720
after we last saw each other
at Mount Hua.

694
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,300
Old Venomous Creature.

695
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,260
Do you think you haven't aged?

696
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,590
Is this your disciple?

697
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,940
Impressive skills.

698
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,160
He

699
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,420
is not good at martial arts.

700
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,340
Doesn't control the force.

701
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,490
Several times,

702
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,190
he beated your nephew so hard
that he coughed blood.

703
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,280
After so many times,

704
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,530
I think your body

705
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,710
should be used to it, right?

706
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,420
Rong, what did you call him

707
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,670
just now?

708
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,480
Dad.

709
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,190
I didn't tell you before.

710
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,530
Jing and I

711
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,570
have already taken Qigong

712
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,410
as our master.

713
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,530
You often say Qigong

714
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,380
is skillful and righteous.

715
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,670
I heard it many times.

716
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,510
I'm sure you must agree to this.

717
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,370
Yaoshi.

718
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:09,810
Qigong.

719
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,300
It's been years.

720
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,610
Actually, I always tell her

721
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,280
to learn whatever
she wants to learn from you.

722
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,190
Why bother looking for me?

723
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,860
I took her as my disciple

724
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,680
because there's fate between us.

725
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,190
Second, I want to eat
the food she makes.

726
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,640
I didn't tell you beforehand.

727
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,490
I am here to apologize to you this time.

728
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,630
Not at all.

729
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,040
Qigong.

730
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,590
My daughter is mischievous.

731
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,360
Being able to be your disciple

732
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,070
is her luck.

733
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,070
Ouyang.

734
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,230
It's windy by the seaside.

735
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,860
Let's go to the Island.

736
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,000
Let's go.

737
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
(Sword Trial Pavilion)

738
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,730
Yaoshi.

739
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,570
This time I come

740
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,070
is because I want to ask for a favor.

741
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,510
I don't know if you can agree to it.

742
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,900
We have been friends for decades.

743
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,200
Qigong.

744
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,550
Please tell me.

745
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,640
I haven't even mentioned what it is yet.

746
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,530
What if it's something
difficult to handle?

747
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,710
You were willing

748
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,450
to come all the way
across the sea in person

749
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,570
to my little island,

750
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,300
this matter is surely not easy.

751
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,800
I haven't seen Qigong personally

752
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,340
ask for help.

753
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,030
Even I'm curious to hear.

754
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,460
What's it to you?

755
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,050
What do you want to meddle?

756
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,380
Be ready to attend the wedding banquet.

757
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,630
Wedding banquet?

758
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,510
How old are you?

759
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,040
Yaoshi.

760
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,110
Rong and Jing are both my disciples.

761
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,160
Everyone can see

762
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,760
that these two young people

763
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,820
have long been a couple.

764
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,360
Today I am here

765
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,630
to help them

766
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,030
propose a marriage to you.

767
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,450
I hope you can agree.

768
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,930
It's just a pity.

769
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,770
Qigong.

770
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,530
I have already helped Ke

771
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,410
give a proposal gift

772
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,050
to Yaoshi.

773
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,450
You're late.

774
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,970
My dad hasn't agreed yet.

775
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,380
But that doesn't mean he disagrees.

776
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,780
You can't say it like that.

777
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,990
Marriage is not something
that first-come, first-served.

778
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,680
Dad.

779
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,810
You are marrying off your daughter,

780
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,930
not selling me.

781
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,090
Rong.

782
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,190
Yes, Rong.

783
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,380
You can't talk to your dad like that.

784
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,120
But Yaoshi,

785
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,200
Rong is right.

786
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,360
This really can't

787
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
be taken as business.

788
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
When I propose, it's business.

789
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,590
When you do, it's not?

790
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,550
You...

791
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,590
Yaoshi is a man of character.

792
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,680
He disregards etiquette
throughout his life,

793
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,590
and does things his own way.

794
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,780
I suppose he doesn't care much
about these rules.

795
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,160
Rules are meant

796
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,450
to be broken.

797
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,340
That's it.

798
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,070
We are all sincere and genuine people.

799
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,610
These two young people
are a perfect match.

800
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,630
No one can separate them.

801
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,320
Furthermore...

802
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,720
Furthermore, this Ouyang Ke

803
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,750
has an extremely bad character.

804
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,230
He has insulted me several times.

805
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,110
If it weren't for Qigong

806
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,640
who helped me

807
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,510
for your sake,

808
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,110
you would've lost me.

809
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,150
Our Ke

810
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,190
is erudite and versatile.

811
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,630
Feeling needs to be cultivated.

812
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,570
The two people

813
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,410
need to spend years

814
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,670
together,

815
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,590
not just a few hours and days.

816
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,130
If she's with

817
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,010
a dunderhead

818
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,010
every day,

819
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,300
can she be happy?

820
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,410
Mr. Ouyang.

821
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,480
Jing.

822
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,330
Ouyang.

823
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,110
Rong is not highly cultured

824
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,110
and steeped in propriety,

825
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,420
but she's very lucky

826
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,890
to gain the favor

827
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,940
of the nephew

828
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,030
of yours

829
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,420
and the disciple

830
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,150
of Qigong's

831
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,460
at the same time.

832
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,230
this matter

833
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,630
It does put me in a dilemma.

834
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,030
I don't think it's a dilemma at all.

835
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,740
Just fulfill their wishes

836
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,490
and let them follow their hearts.

837
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,490
That's where you are wrong,

838
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,330
Beggar.

839
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,240
Yaoshi has to decide

840
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,350
on something as important as this.

841
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,840
How can we allow them to act recklessly

842
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,720
as they please?

843
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,030
You are the one who can make decisions.

844
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:04,720
Your nephew has hurt many girls

845
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,200
as he pleased.

846
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,450
Don't act like you don't know.

847
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,530
Talk nicely.

848
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,610
We're martial arts practitioners.

849
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,790
We can't talk nicely.

850
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,490
- Let's have a fight.
- Alright, bring it on.

851
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,330
Ouyang.

852
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,490
Let's settle this with our fists. Go.

853
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,940
