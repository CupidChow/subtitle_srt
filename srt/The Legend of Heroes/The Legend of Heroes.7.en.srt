00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,980
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,700
You two.

4
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
Let me tell you,

5
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,580
I have never taught anyone

6
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,860
martial arts for more than three days.

7
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,420
This time we have been together
for over thirty days.

8
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,020
It's been holding me up.

9
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,060
I should leave.

10
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,420
- See you.
- Qigong.

11
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,770
Qigong, you haven't instructed Jing

12
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,860
about the three moves.

13
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,100
I still have three signature dishes
that I haven't made for you yet.

14
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,140
If you're keeping three dishes in reserve,

15
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,780
I'll have to keep three moves in reserve,

16
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,620
right?

17
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,020
I should rely on these things
to prevent aging.

18
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,820
- Qigong, then...
- Rong.

19
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,180
Don't call me Master again.

20
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,660
I've made it clear

21
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,860
that I don't take on disciples.

22
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,740
Sir,

23
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,700
you have taught me so much already.

24
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,180
I am already very satisfied.

25
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,700
I dare not be greedy.

26
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,300
Thank you, sir.

27
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,980
Isn't that

28
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,580
the true meaning
of "Haughty Dragon Repents"?

29
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,380
Kid, are you playing dumb

30
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
or you suddenly had your ideas
straightened out?

31
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,980
Jing.

32
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,020
You'd better

33
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,020
make the three dishes now.

34
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,300
On it now.

35
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,700
Rong, I'll help you.

36
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,740
Okay.

37
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,540
Qigong.

38
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,660
Qigong.

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,940
Rong.

40
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,380
I didn't find Qigong.

41
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,020
I'm pissed.

42
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,820
He just left without saying goodbye.

43
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,020
Rong.

44
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,860
Qigong has always been

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,980
quite elusive.

46
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,420
He has been with us for a long time.

47
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,900
If we give him a farewell dinner,

48
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,980
I guess he will stay for a few more days

49
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,420
for the delicious food you make.

50
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,700
I want him to teach you more things,

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,540
Jing.

52
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,860
But you're right.

53
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,420
We've been staying here

54
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,380
for quite a few days.

55
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,580
If we don't leave soon,

56
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,900
we won't make it for the appointment

57
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,600
at the Drunken Immortal Tower
on the 15th of August.

58
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,820
Yes.

59
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,980
Rong,

60
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,580
tidy up and wait for me here.

61
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm going to buy some dry rations

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,000
and exchange some silver coins
in the town.

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,540
Okay.

64
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,620
Be quick about it.

65
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,380
Beauty often comes with thorns.

66
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,500
I can't handle the Soft Hedgehog Armor,

67
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,540
but my uncle

68
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,020
must have a solution.

69
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,660
Rong.

70
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,580
Rong.

71
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,700
Let's go.

72
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,660
(Ouyang Ke.)

73
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,140
Rong.

74
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,980
Rong.

75
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,460
Rong.

76
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,140
Rong.

77
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,260
Rong.

78
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,220
Rong.

79
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,100
What's wrong?

80
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,940
Young master, look over there.

81
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,900
It's the old man again.

82
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,340
Senior.

83
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,460
Here we meet again.

84
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,780
Please allow me to pay respects.

85
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,980
I wonder what

86
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,500
brought you here.

87
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,500
Jing.

88
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,860
Dare to trick me.

89
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,260
You're courting death.

90
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,740
(How did this guy get stronger?)

91
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,260
Jing, I'm here to help you.

92
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,500
You really are fearless.

93
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,100
Ouyang Ke,

94
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,100
let me tell you,

95
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,760
Jing has drunk snake blood
and is immune to all poisons.

96
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,620
Your poison skills

97
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,720
won't work for him.

98
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,360
Haughty Dragon Repents!

99
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,640
(He actually made a dreadful move.)

100
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,660
We shall meet again...

101
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,880
As long as time stands?

102
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,580
What?

103
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,000
We people on the Central Plains
say that when we're losing a fight.

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,100
You people on the Western Regions

105
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,200
can't create something new to say?

106
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,960
Boring.

107
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,700
Jing.

108
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,240
Don't chase him. Let him go.

109
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,340
But he tried to hurt you.

110
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,440
I can't let him go.

111
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,500
Jing.

112
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,600
I have the Soft Hedgehog Armor.

113
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,080
He couldn't do anything to me.

114
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,360
This guy

115
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,240
really gets on my nerves.

116
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,580
Jing.

117
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,900
The snake venom wasn't that strong.

118
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,860
I just felt dizzy for a moment.

119
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,700
It's okay.

120
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,700
Father.

121
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,240
- What's wrong?
- I got the news

122
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,860
that the Mongolian people
have infiltrated the Song territory

123
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,000
and colluded with the Song people.

124
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,380
Then aren't we being attached

125
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,120
front and rear?

126
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,020
(Infinite Learning)

127
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
(Command)
Kang.

128
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,840
Enter the Song territory secretly

129
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,640
(Command)
as the envoy of the Jin Empire.

130
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,860
Yes.

131
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,020
After arriving,

132
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,500
send men disguised as Song people

133
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,240
to kill the Mongolian envoys

134
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,380
and then

135
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,120
blame it on the Song people.

136
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,480
Make the Mongolian-Song Alliance

137
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,960
collapse on its own.

138
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,720
It's a brilliant plan, Father.

139
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,240
I will not disappoint you.

140
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,600
Your Highness.

141
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,220
Congratulations, Master.

142
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,880
With the mental cultivation methods,

143
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,120
you've dredged the meridians

144
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,340
and greatly increased your power.

145
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,960
It's just a pity that this method

146
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,640
could not cure my eyes.

147
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,180
Master.

148
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,560
I am your eyes.

149
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,240
What can I help you with?

150
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,840
I'm about to set off for the Song Empire.

151
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,320
Would you like to accompany me
on the journey south?

152
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,600
I can take care of you along the way.

153
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,360
Don't say these flattering words.

154
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,580
Master.

155
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,980
I just think

156
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,220
you have a vendetta against

157
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,640
the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

158
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,700
They have made an appointment
with the masters of my palace

159
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,900
to meet at the Drunken Immortal Tower

160
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,600
on the 15th of August.

161
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,540
We can take this chance

162
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,240
to kill them all.

163
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,560
I will naturally

164
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,600
settle the score myself.

165
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,220
You may leave.

166
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,640
Yes, Master.

167
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,380
Master.

168
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,440
I'll be waiting for you in Lin'an.

169
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,140
Sugar-coated haws.

170
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,540
Sour and sweet sugar-coated haws.

171
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,480
So lively.

172
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,060
Jing.

173
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,360
Let's walk around in the town together.

174
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,060
Sure.

175
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,600
Have some water first.

176
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,700
Jing.

177
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,000
I suddenly feel like eating sweetmeat.

178
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,480
It should be difficult to buy them
in this town.

179
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,980
It's okay.

180
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
I'll go buy some ingredients

181
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,360
and make them myself.

182
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
Rong, you are really amazing.

183
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Then I'll accompany you.

184
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,120
Don't worry, Jing.

185
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,480
I can go by myself.

186
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,580
No.

187
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,020
What if that Ouyang Ke

188
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,240
comes to cause trouble again?

189
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,660
Last time, you already seriously injured

190
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,720
that lecher.

191
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,600
He won't recover in a short while.

192
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,880
Don't worry.

193
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,350
You go ahead and order the dishes first.

194
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,220
I'll be right back.

195
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,700
Please enjoy your meal, sir.

196
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,580
(This should be)

197
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,600
(the betrothal gift from Jing.)

198
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,220
Miss.

199
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,240
Is there something?

200
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,640
You are so beautiful.

201
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,180
You are...

202
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,740
Is your last name Mu?

203
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,740
How did you know?

204
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,360
Do you know Jing?

205
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,580
Mr. Guo?

206
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,120
Do you know Mr. Guo?

207
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,640
Where he is now?

208
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,720
You really care about Jing, don't you?

209
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,640
Your dagger

210
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,860
is so delicate.

211
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,200
This is a relic left by my foster father.

212
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm afraid it's more than that.

213
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,960
Do you think that

214
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,240
with this dagger,

215
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,240
you could have it your way?

216
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,100
Give it back.

217
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,700
Stop.

218
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,700
Give it back.

219
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,220
Miss.

220
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
This is the heirloom
left to me by my foster father.

221
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,320
Seeing it is like seeing my foster father.

222
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,880
What are you going to do with it?

223
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,180
Don't call me Miss.

224
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
I just want to take it.

225
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,320
- Are you going to give it back?
- No.

226
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,580
Unless you can beat me.

227
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,840
If you want to kill me, then go ahead.

228
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,340
Why do you must tease me?

229
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,020
There is no hatred between us.

230
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,860
Why should I kill you?

231
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,840
You just need to make a vow.

232
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,060
Then I'll set you free.

233
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,200
If you have the guts, kill me.

234
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,840
You're just dreaming

235
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,360
that I'll beg you.

236
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,540
Dreaming?

237
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,600
I think you are the one dreaming.

238
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,560
Jing is sincere to be with me.

239
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,120
He will not marry you.

240
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,920
You better not dream of marrying him.

241
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,800
What are you saying?

242
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,320
Who am I going to marry?

243
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,600
Jing, Guo Jing.

244
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,680
I will not marry Mr. Guo.

245
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,080
Didn't your foster father
ask you to marry him?

246
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,520
That's a promise

247
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,280
my foster father made to Qiu Chuji.

248
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,100
But I don't want to.

249
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,880
Do you have someone else in your heart?

250
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,260
Who is it?

251
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,800
Now you're being polite to me.

252
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,460
(Guo Jing)
These two daggers have been exchanged.

253
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,360
The person you like is Yang...

254
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,440
No, Wanyan Kang.

255
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,640
Sorry.

256
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,820
I misunderstood you.

257
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,440
However,

258
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,740
I'm afraid you have also misunderstood

259
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,020
Wanyan Kang.

260
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,920
His name is Yang Kang.

261
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,540
Since his last name is Yang,

262
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,800
why is he living in Wanyan's Mansion?

263
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,120
And he doesn't even
recognize his own father.

264
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,600
You must not believe him.

265
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,000
You aren't him,

266
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,680
so you don't understand his pain.

267
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
It's not that he doesn't
recognize his own father.

268
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,320
He has never even seen his biological father.

269
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,120
How can he just recognize him?

270
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,760
Anyone would resist

271
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,600
if they had to recognize someone
who they just met.

272
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,620
Could it be

273
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,600
his sweet words deceived you?

274
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,740
Don't worry.

275
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,680
I'm not that easy to deceive.

276
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,040
I can tell

277
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,840
if he's sincere

278
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,560
over time.

279
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,040
Thank you for your concern.

280
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,320
Is Mr. Guo nearby?

281
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,100
Rest assured.

282
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,580
I won't see him.

283
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,020
Besides,

284
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,080
even if I see him,

285
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,780
you're still the only one

286
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,000
he has in the heart.

287
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,160
Let's go back early.

288
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,020
I'm giving this dagger to you.

289
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,860
Thank you.

290
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:26,860
Be careful on your way.

291
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,050
Feed the horse first.

292
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,330
Stuffed buns with thick fillings.

293
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,850
Two coins for one.

294
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,820
(Noodles)

295
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,020
Waiter, a pot of wine.

296
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,880
Coming right up.

297
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,000
Please enjoy your meal, sir.

298
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,420
Here.

299
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,220
How is it?

300
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,560
Have you found the Jin envoy's boat?

301
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,400
Don't worry,
I've checked everything carefully.

302
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,660
Boss said

303
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,880
this envoy

304
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,760
is the prince of the Jin Empire.

305
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,700
This is a big fish.

306
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,540
Yes.

307
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,600
- This way.
- Okay.

308
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,700
(Wharf)

309
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,860
Rong.

310
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,440
I can't believe you look better
in my clothes

311
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,360
than I do on my own.

312
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,540
Guo.

313
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,840
You should call me Mr. Huang.

314
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,800
You are really mischievous, Rong.

315
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,320
Call me Mr. Huang.

316
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,120
Okay, Mr. Huang.

317
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,600
A fisher alone

318
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,900
with mists and waves stretching far.

319
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,040
It's just like an ink painting

320
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,840
♪Sailing a thousand miles
across the waves♪

321
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,280
♪Seeing Wu Mountain
in a brief flash of glance♪

322
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,940
♪Clouds gather near the water house♪

323
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,000
♪The mighty river follows the goddess♪

324
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,760
♪Waters merge into the river
flowing east into the sea♪

325
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,220
It's beautiful.

326
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,060
Rong.

327
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,300
What song is this?

328
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,640
♪Looking back, the enemy soldiers
have not been wiped out♪

329
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,840
♪Where are the heroes who can resist them♪

330
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,800

00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:37,120
♪Looking back, the enemy soldiers

334
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,320
This is "Water Dragon Chant"
composed by Zhu Xizhen.

335
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,080
My dad wrote music for this lyric.

336
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,000
It's about an old man

337
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,040
boating on a river,

338
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,840
thinking that half of his country

339
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,440
were occupied by the enemy,

340
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,120
and feeling grieved.

341
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm surprised he can also sing it.

342
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,080
Meeting distinguished guests
in the lake.

343
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,320
Would you like to come over

344
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,320
and share a drink together?

345
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm afraid we may disturb you.

346
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,500
It's hard to meet a bosom friend.

347
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,680
Meeting you by chance

348
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,740
on this vast lake

349
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,360
is truly refreshing.

350
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,120
Sir.

351
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,500
I have a leg injury,

352
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,560
so please forgive me

353
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,600
for not being able to stand up.

354
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,220
You're too polite.

355
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,520
This is my friend Guo.

356
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,760
My last name is Huang.

357
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,200
I was singing loudly

358
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,320
on a whim.

359
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,640
Sorry for having disturbed you.

360
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,540
Hearing you sing

361
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,440
swept away my earthly worries.

362
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,680
My last name is Lu.

363
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,780
(Lu Chengfeng, Lord of Guiyun House)
Two gentlemen,

364
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,600
is this your first visit to Taihu Lake?

365
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,780
- It is.
- It is.

366
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,180
The Water Dragon Chant

367
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
that he just sung

368
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,460
contains rich emotions.

369
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,120
It's truly a wonderful piece of lyric.

370
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,260
It's a rare thing

371
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,840
for such a young man like you

372
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,940
to understand the profound meaning
behind the words.

373
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,400
After the Song Dynasty shifted to the south,

374
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,160
all the poets and writers

375
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,120
felt sorrowful for their homeland.

376
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,520
Zhang Yuhu wrote in
"Song of the Six States",

377
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,700
"It's said the refugees
in the lost Central Plain

378
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,940

379
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,840
for the northern campaign.

380
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,640
If they come here,

381
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,400
indignant,

382
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,920
they would shed tear on tear."

383
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,280
It depicts the same thing.

384
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,080
Look, it's getting late.

385
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,640
I live by the lake.

386
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,880
I hope you'll excuse me

387
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,920
for inviting the two of you

388
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,560
to stay for a few days.

389
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,620
Guo.

390
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,660
What do you think?

391
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,800
There are also beautiful peaks

392
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,040
near my humble house.

393
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,000
If you two are just sightseeing,

394
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,080
please be my guest.

395
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,380
Mr. Huang.

396
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,280
Then sorry for the trouble, Mr. Lu.

397
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Sorry for waiting.

398
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,700
(Lu Guanying, young master of Guiyun House)
My father is getting changed.

399
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,600
He asked me to entertain you.

400
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,360
May I ask for your name?

401
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,760
My name is Guanying.

402
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,000
You could call me by my name.

403
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,760
Okay, Guanying.

404
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,780
Please follow me.

405
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:41,100
(Guiyun House)

406
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,600
Is there something wrong, Rong?

407
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,800
The layout of this road is unusual.

408
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,800
It's Qi Men Dun Jia.

409
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,160
- Qi Men Dun Jia?
- Yes.

410
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,360
The layout on our Peach Blossom Island
is like this.

411
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm familiar with it.

412
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,020
My father has a leg injury.

413
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,200
He's waiting in the east study room.

414
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,380
Please.

415
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,860
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

416
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,360
There's no need for formalities.

417
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,260
I would like to invite you

418
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,680
to evaluate this ink painting

419
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,880
and give me some comments.

420
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,180
(The autumn crickets
chirped incessantly last night)

421
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,520
Manifold Little Hills by Yue Fei.

422
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,820
(A cripple of the Five Lakes)

423
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,740
I suppose the cripple of the Five Lakes

424
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,800
is you, right?

425
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,560
How is this painting?

426
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,800
It seems you were filled

427
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,120
with passion and indignation

428
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,800
while you were writing and painting.

429
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,840
This is created by firm strokes,

430
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,280
which show no restraint,

431
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,940
like you want a full-blown fight

432
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,200
with the enemy.

433
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,740
I am afraid it's against

434
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,220
Mr. Yue Fei's original meaning

435
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,060
of composing this poem.

436
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,080
Why is that?

437
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,600
I have heard people say

438
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,200
if the brushwork in calligraphy

439
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,440
and painting is too forceful,

440
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,780
then it can't be considered

441
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,840
as a fine work of a high level.

442
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,160
This is just

443
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,540
my humble opinion.

444
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,120
Please forgive me, sir.

445
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,760
You're being too modest.

446
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,840
You're the first one

447
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,600
who's seen through me.

448
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,640
You're really

449
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,800
my first confidant.

450
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,700
As for the vigorous style

451
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,200
in composition,

452
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,180
it's a fault

453
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,520
that I can't get rid of.

454
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,880
Thank you for pointing it out.

455
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,180
You're right.

456
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,780
You're right.

457
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm flattered.

458
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,940
Guanying.

459
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,680
Go prepare a fest.

460
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,320
- Yes
- Sir, there is no need.

461
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,580
Guo and I have been traveling all the way.

462
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,560
We'd like to take a break first.

463
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,540
No need to bother with the feast.

464
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,380
Okay.

465
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,040
Have a good rest tonight.

466
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,360
We'll have the feast tomorrow.

467
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,680
I'll have the servants

468
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,320
send some dishes and wine to you.

469
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

470
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,300
This way, please.

471
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,300
Gentlemen,

472
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,260
this way.

473
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,880
Please come in.

474
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,540
If you need anything,

475
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,500
just ring this bell

476
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,340
and we will come over.

477
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,100
Okay.

478
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,260
The house is too big.

479
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,200
It's easy to get lost at night.

480
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,060
If you don't have someone to guide you,

481
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,260
remember not to go out

482
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,280
lest you can't find your way back.

483
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,420
Noted.

484
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,800
- Thank you.
- I'm leaving.

485
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,900
Why did this servant

486
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,360
specially mentioned that?

487
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,920
We can't go out at night.

488
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,000
This house is too big.

489
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,080
I guess they're afraid we'll get lost.

490
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,120
This house is so weirdly built.

491
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,040
I am curious

492
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,740
about who on earth

493
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,780
Lord Lu is.

494
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,640
He admires Yue Fei.

495
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,200
He should not be a bad person.

496
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,700
He must know martial arts

497
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,840
and he's skilled in it.

498
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,920
Did you see that Bagua map?

499
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,280
This is the art of Qi Men Dun Jia.

500
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,040
My father taught me when I was young.

501
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,440
But I never expected to see it in here.

502
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,780
Jing.

503
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,820
Jing.

504
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,580
Rong.

505
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,360
How come you're up?

506
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,780
Listen.

507
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,740
There's a sound.

508
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,080
Where did that strange sound come from?

509
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,000
The sound of conch shells
is coming and going.

510
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
There must be more than one person.

511
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,840
The conch blowers are far from each other.

512
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,160
Clearly they are responding to each other.

513
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,440
Let's go and take a look.

514
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,020
The servant specifically warned us

515
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,880
not to run around.

516
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,040
Let's not go out and cause trouble.

517
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,020
Rong.

518
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,120
They are all carrying weapons.

519
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,560
What are they doing?

520
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,680
I told you that this place is not simple.

521
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,280
Let's go and take a look.

522
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,860
Wait, Rong.

523
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,840
We've ended up back where we started.

524
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,540
This place is so winding.

525
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,740
Twisty turny,

526
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,680
making me dizzy.

527
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,100
That's right.

528
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,560
It feels like we're just going in circles.

529
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,120
This is a Bagua maze.

530
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,520
Then I'll find a high place to have a look

531
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,780
Wait.

532
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,580
Look.

533
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,000
There are indeed mechanisms on it.

534
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,360
What should we do?

535
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,780
It would be dangerous

536
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,640
for us to rush up there.

537
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,520
Let me think about it.

538
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,640
Qian, Kun.

539
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,740
Jing, I know the way now.

540
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,580
Follow me.

541
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,320
Isn't this just a dead end?

542
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,160
Jing, we can get out from here.

543
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,860
Have you been here before, Rong?

544
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,700
Of course not.

545
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,620
This house

546
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,020
was built according to

547
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,000
Fuxi 64 Hexagrams.

548
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,120
It naturally fits a pattern.

549
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,180
Rong, you are really amazing.

550
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,100
My father taught me the art
of Qi Men Dun Jia when I was young.

551
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,600
It may be hard for others,

552
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,900
but not for me.

553
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,060
Jing, let's go.

554
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,900
Let's go.

555
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,080
Zhang, how did your investigation go?

556
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,520
Young Master Lu,

557
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,100
the Jin envoy

558
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,720
is supposed to cross
the lake overnight tonight.

559
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,240
He'll arrive in about two hours.

560
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

561
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,460
these Jin soldiers

562
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,100
are crossing our Taihu Lake

563
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,240
with ill-gotten money.

564
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,400
If we don't take it,
it's against Heaven's will.

565
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,280
Let's take all the money,

566
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,880
give half of it
to the poor people near the lake

567
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,400
and share the rest.

568
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,520
What do you all think?

569
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,550
We'll follow your order, Young Master.

570
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,400
So

571
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,530
these people are bandits of Taihu Lake.

572
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,260
Lu Guanying

573
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,750
is the leader among them.

574
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,440
They rob the rich to help the poor.

575
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,380
And they're robbing the Jin people?

576
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,240
I don't think they are bad people.

577
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,680
There is honor among thieves.

578
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,800
It still makes them heroes.

579
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,140
My mother said

580
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,420
our ancestor is Mr. Guo Sheng,

581
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,620
one of the 108 Stars of Destiny.

582
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,780
Why don't we go help them out?

583
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,620
Let's go.

584
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,940
It's better not to

585
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,080
get involved in this.

586
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,960
Let's just enjoy the show.

587
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,340
Mr. Duan.

588
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,880
Why are you silent?

589
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,500
Young Master.

590
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,160
The common people cannot
fight with officials.

591
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,800
We have not robbed

592
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,600
government officials.

593
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,600
We people of the Great Song Dynasty

594
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,120
naturally don't go against government.

595
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,720
This time it's the Jin people.

596
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,080
The Jin people

597
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,440
are even harder to offend.

598
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,640
You always take the lead.

599
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,740
What's going on today?

600
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,060
Okay.

601
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,460
If you don't go,

602
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,480
I will take our men there.

603
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,040
Young Master Lu, don't be angry.

604
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,620
It was

605
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,320
just my suggestion.

606
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,720
These days,

607
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,300
I finally found a place to live

608
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,800
because of your care.

609
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,760
As long as it's something you've decided,

610
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,440
even if I have to go through fire and water,

611
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,640
I'll join you.

612
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,180
Okay.

613
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,040
Get on the ship.

614
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,620
(Ten years ago)

615
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,620
Eat it.

616
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,860
Kang.

617
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,220
Your Royal Highness.

618
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,280
(People are born with class distinctions.)

619
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,960
(The noble wield absolute power,)

620
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,680
(and the ignoble are meant to suffer.)

621
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,120
(This is fate.)

622
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,740
Is it sweet?

623
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,540
Kang.

624
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,380
Let me ask you,

625
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,120
do you think everyone

626
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,480
can eat this orange?

627
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,160
But people have different ways

628
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,120
of eating it.

629
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,020
How can one eat

630
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,860
such oranges?

631
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,760
There are too many methods.

632
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,120
Just remember

633
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,600
you are the little prince.

634
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,740
You want more?

635
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,740
Okay.

636
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,120
I'll peel it for you.

637
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,000
(I understood from that day on,)

638
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,080
(as long as I am still the little prince,)

639
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,040
(I can eat oranges in many ways)

640
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,320
(and more importantly,)

641
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,480
(I can also do many other things.)

642
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,120
Mr. Qiu.

643
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,500
Kang.

644
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,240
I got a master for you.

645
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,380
Pay your respects.

646
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,380
Kang.

647
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,960
Enough of this nonsense.

648
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,680
What do you mean by this?

649
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,220
Master, please don't be angry.

650
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,500
You are testing

651
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,340
whether I am

652
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,800
qualified to be your master?

653
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm sincerely convinced.

654
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,960
Master,

655
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,600
please accept my bow.

656
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,350
Martial arts practitioners

657
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,560
should be practical and diligent.

658
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,120
Do not be swayed

659
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,400
by temporary achievements,

660
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,160
and do not covet material gains.

661
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,880
Otherwise, the inner demon will arise,

662
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,700
One wrong step will lead to another.

663
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,720
It'll be hard to turn back again.

664
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,220
Being a human

665
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,680
is like practicing martial arts.

666
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,820
I remembered

667
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,080
what you've taught me, Master.

668
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,080
(I don't like Master Qiu Chuji.)

669
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
(Maybe he never)

670
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,420
(truly respected me,)

671
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,560
(the prince of the Jin Empire.)

672
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,710
(He didn't teach me)

673
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,120
(real skills either.)

674
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,440
(And what I detest the most)

675
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,600
(is that he constantly talk about)

676
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,320
(righteousness and morality.)

677
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,920
(In contrast,)

678
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,400
(I prefer Master Mei)

679
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,720
Master.

680
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,500
Master, you must be tired of the practice.

681
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,600
Have an orange.

682
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,060
I will show you

683
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,400
the martial arts you taught me yesterday.

684
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,400
(So whether I am Wanyan Kang)

685
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,960
(or Yang Kang,)

686
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,720
(what matters is not my name)

687
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,040
(but what I possess.)

688
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,500
Capture the Jin envoy alive

689
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,140
and kill the young prince!

690
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,240
