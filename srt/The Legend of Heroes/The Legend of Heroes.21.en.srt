00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,440
White eagles?

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,360
Jing,

5
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,250
what's wrong?

6
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,490
Not good.

7
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,330
They are in trouble.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,310
Who?

9
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,150
It's Huazheng and Tolui.

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,150
From the cry of the white eagles,

11
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,410
they must be nearby

12
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,260
and in trouble.

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,230
This is

14
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,310
what's going on.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,420
The Song army betrayed,

16
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,540
surrounding and attacking the Mongolian envoys

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,690
causing the Mongolian prince and princess

18
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,140
to go missing.

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,910
The other two fought to the death

20
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,820
and ended up lying dead in the wilderness.

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,950
Do you understand?

22
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,420
Yes.

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,950
Don't understand? No problem.

24
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,820
Ask my sword

25
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,470
if it's willing.

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,790
Go ahead.

27
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,600
Jing.

28
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,850
- Guo Jing. - Master Jebe.

29
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,820
Huazheng, Brother Tolui.

30
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,200
Are you all right?

31
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,250
- We're fine. - We're fine.

32
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,350
Good. Come here.

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,440
Why is it you again?

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,570
Since I'm here,

35
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,820
tuck your tail and get lost

36
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,790
to save yourself some trouble.

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,580
You're young but you talk big

38
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,540
and insult us without directly calling us out.

39
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,160
Today, we will teach you

40
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,370
a lesson.

41
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,210
Great!

42
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,740
Today, I will

43
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,540
shut your foul mouth up.

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,880
Okay!

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
Master Qiu.

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,760
we're counting on you now.

47
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,830
Last time, I went to great lengths

48
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,500
to let you go.

49
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,110
Why don't you cherish it?

50
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,730
You old fraud

51
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,570
is also here.

52
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,800
Little thief!

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,350
Acting big with my snake blood?

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,930
This is

55
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,710
Master Qiu, Iron Palm Water Skimmer.

56
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,010
Fraud Qiu.

57
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,860
Since we parted at Guiyun Manor,

58
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,710
have you come up with any new scams?

59
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,180
Why don't you show it for everyone to laugh at?

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
You...

61
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,030
You don't cherish

62
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,230
your own life.

63
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,060
Then let me hold onto it for now.

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
Okay.

65
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,300
Let's see what you've got.

66
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,600
Brother Tolui.

67
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,680
Jing.

68
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,530
Honestly,

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
I like to deal with

70
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,060
frauds like you in martial world.

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,420
Fraud Qiu

72
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,110
is a source of amusement for me.

73
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,910
I'll go play with him.

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,740
Mr. Qiu,

75
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,350
this move is called Slap in the Face.

76
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,180
Please correct me.

77
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,850
If I won,

78
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,110
that wouldn't be fair.

79
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,200
Because the martial world might say

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,500
I bullied the young.

81
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,860
After much consideration,

82
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,500
I've decided not to fight all of you.

83
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,790
Tell your father Old Heretic Huang
to come find me.

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,920
Mr. Qiu.

85
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,830
You are old but lack strength.

86
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,080
You are not that skilled

87
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,420
but quite good at acting.

88
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,230
And you want my father to come beat you up?

89
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,570
Bah!

90
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,050
You are a young girl

91
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,740
but so arrogant.

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,570
In the deep mountains,

93
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,880
I've cultivated

94
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,810
Striking Skill

95
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,470
That's not to be trifled with!

96
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,180
My inner strength

97
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,180
pervades every inch of my body.

98
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,670
You just offended me

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,940
seeming to slap me.

100
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,490
But in fact, it was deflected

101
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,470
by my internal energy.

102
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,060
To be frank,

103
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,620
you are deeply injured internally.

104
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,180
You just don't know it yet.

105
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,060
There is a skill in the martial world...

106
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,210
- Jing.
- Rong.

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,280
It's nothing.

108
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,980
Don't listen to his nonsense.

109
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,030
Four hours later,

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,880
your meridians will be blocked,

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,910
halting your energy flow.

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,250
10 to 12 hours later,

113
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,980
your whole body will ache

114
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,940
like being chopped with knives and axes.

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,230
One day later,

116
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,570
your tendons will be severed

117
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,500
and you'll die from bleeding.

118
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,420
Your boasting skill is so impressive.

119
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,050
If I can't learn that

120
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,110
from you,

121
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,160
it would be a pity.

122
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,180
This move is "boasting".

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,830
This move is "drums and gongs".

124
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,060
What's going on?

125
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,120
It hurts a little.

126
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,920
Why are you laughing?

127
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,150
Laughing at you dying

128
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,640
and you don't even know it.

129
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,940
As for those struck by my internal energy,

130
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,440
the deeper they wound me,

131
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,980
the sooner they'll die.

132
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,060
I've long been puzzled.

133
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,250
Why don't you realize your errors

134
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,420
and mend your ways?

135
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,710
Losing a young loved one is truly tragic.

136
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,910
You're a good girl.

137
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,100
I agree.

138
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,660
What a pity.

139
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,540
Mr. Qiu is bleeding

140
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,260
but he's so delighted.

141
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,540
He is a great master!

142
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,060
Exactly.

143
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,020
We are too far behind

144
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,820
to catch up with Mr. Qiu.

145
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,100
But I've always practiced righteousness.

146
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,460
If you kowtow and apologize to me,

147
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,300
perhaps

148
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,580
you will get

149
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,100
my last chance to...

150
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,940
To what?

151
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,140
Now, you can't get away with that.

152
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,180
I can't help you.

153
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,090
See you all.

154
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,620
- Hey, Master Qiu!
- Master Qiu!

155
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,540
Leave me alone.

156
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,340
- Master Qiu! Master Qiu!
- Old fraud, stop!

157
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,140
- Go get them!
- Get them!

158
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,420
Finger Flicking Skill?

159
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,460
Old Heretic Huang?

160
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,020
Master Qiu.

161
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,500
Because there are more of you,

162
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,460
you think you can gang up on me?

163
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,620
Father, you haven't left yet.

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,020
Thankfully, I didn't go far.

165
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,260
You trouble maker.

166
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,940
Do you know

167
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,620
Master Qiu shook

168
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,220
the Mount Heng School

169
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,180
with his Iron Palm skills?

170
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,180
You are being too willful.

171
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,660
Father, he's just a fraud.

172
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,900
Master Huang is correct.

173
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,420
Your daughter is delicate.

174
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,580
How could she endure my palm?

175
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,860
Even if I take back

176
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,580
most of my palm strength,

177
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,940
she'll be seriously injured at least.

178
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,420
By then,

179
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,420
how can I explain to Master Huang?

180
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,500
Only heaven would know

181
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,060
that I had thought of her.

182
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,380
So now I'm the one who should apologize?

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,620
It's okay.

184
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,940
- I...
- No more talking.

185
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,540
Today,

186
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,100
show your Iron Palm skills

187
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,340
to me.

188
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,620
That's great.

189
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,460
But unfortunately,

190
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,060
I have some urgent business
to attend to with the gang.

191
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,100
Master Huang, we can meet

192
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,980
at the Iron Palm Mountain another time.

193
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,540
By then,

194
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,940
you and I will drink, talk,

195
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,140
and spar in martial arts.

196
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,140
Wouldn't that be great?

197
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,660
See you.

198
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,180
Hold on.

199
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,100
It's our luck to meet here today.

200
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,900
Don't hesitate.

201
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,060
Weren't you just boasting about

202
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,380
wanting to fight my father?

203
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,860
He is right here.

204
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,220
Why don't you start?

205
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,500
Honestly,

206
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,700
I've long been looking forward to

207
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,500
spar with Master Huang.

208
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,260
But for figures like us,

209
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,420
we can only fight

210
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,140
on the day of Duel atop Mount Hua.

211
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,820
We can't just fight randomly

212
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,980
in this wilderness.

213
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
But

214
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,620
if Master Huang dares not

215
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,940
fight with me openly,

216
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,460
I'll have nothing to say.

217
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,940
Martial arts sparring

218
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,740
is about you and me,

219
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,900
not where we are

220
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,740
right?

221
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,860
Hard to refuse your kindness.

222
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,220
If I refuse again,

223
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,500
I'll come off as haughty.

224
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,020
Since that's the case,

225
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Master Huang,

226
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,340
only you are worthy to see

227
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,260
my Iron Palm skills.

228
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,540
Master Qiu,

229
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,940
please.

230
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,980
Mr. Qiu,

231
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,180
please be quick.

232
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,580
I've been waiting for a long time.

233
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,460
Girl.

234
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,580
People who reveal their faces

235
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,380
aren't genuine.

236
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,940
Did he hide his skills

237
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,740
and play it cool on purpose?

238
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,140
Why's that happening?

239
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,460
What now?

240
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,500
I feel unbearable pain in my stomach.

241
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,700
Maybe I have to

242
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,060
answer the call of nature.

243
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,700
I can't even open my eyes.

244
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,220
Who are you, the fart king?

245
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,740
You even have that kind of skill?

246
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,220
That's the call of nature,

247
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,780
not a skill.

248
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,180
Master Huang.

249
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,940
You won't hit me now, will you?

250
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,940
Hold on.

251
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,460
Here, a tissue.

252
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,700
I really appreciate

253
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,380
your kindness.

254
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,620
Give me a minute.

255
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,060
Father.

256
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,020
What's this?

257
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,380
Token of Iron Palm Gang.

258
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,580
Years ago,

259
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,860
it was mighty in the martial world.

260
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,100
Both sides, good and bad, feared it.

261
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,020
Is this token so powerful?

262
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,980
The former master of Iron Palm Gang

263
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,540
was an old hero.

264
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,220
Both of his martial skills

265
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,380
and character are admirable.

266
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,940
But why is the current master of Iron Palm Gang

267
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,140
so inept.

268
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,940
Peak leads to decline.

269
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
All things in the world

270
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
are like this.

271
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,340
This old fraud has been cheating

272
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,740
with his tricks for decades.

273
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,220
If we were humiliated at Guiyun Manor,

274
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,100
he would continue to deceive us.

275
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,900
Guo Jing, stop!

276
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,860
Shame on you

277
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,180
to take a woman as a hostage.

278
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,020
You are a hero.

279
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,420
You are impressive.

280
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,860
We can't beat you.

281
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,700
But what can you do now?

282
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,340
Don't act rashly.

283
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,420
Hey, you!

284
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
If you date to move again,

285
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,500
this Mongolian princess

286
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,620
will die on the spot!

287
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,820
If you dare to hurt her,

288
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,340
I'll kill you!

289
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,220
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

290
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,340
Hold him down.

291
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,980
I'll drain his blood!

292
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,860
Guo Jing, Tolui,

293
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,820
aren't you powerful?

294
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,420
Come on.

295
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,260
Hit me.

296
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,820
Now you don't dare?

297
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,220
If you dare to come closer,

298
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,460
I'll kill her.

299
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,940
Huazheng.

300
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,700
Are you okay?

301
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,500
He's been gone
for half an incense stick's time.

302
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,620
Is he stalling on purpose?

303
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,700
No. We've been tricked.

304
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,860
That old fraud is gone.

305
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,340
Iron Palm Water Skimmer?

306
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,860
He is just an old fraud!

307
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
Wang Chongyang invited him

308
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,580
to the top of the Mount Hua,

309
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,220
but he kept making excuses and refused.

310
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,850
Now I know the reason.

311
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,300
Brother Guojing,

312
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,460
how did you find us?

313
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,260
I saw the eagles calling,

314
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,860
so you must be nearby

315
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,900
and having trouble.

316
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,580
And I came here with Rong.

317
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,140
Rong again...

318
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,470
Guo Jing!

319
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,710
Who' she?

320
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,340
She's...

321
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,060
Father, she...

322
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,540
- Rong.
- Guo Jing.

323
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,500
My sister risked her life

324
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,300
several times to find you.

325
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,180
Now that she's found you.

326
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,420
Tell us.

327
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,220
When will you return to the grasslands?

328
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,060
Brother Tolui.

329
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,940
I have unfinished business.

330
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,620
I can't return now.

331
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,540
Traveling in the martial world,

332
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,820
you should act decisively.

333
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,540
Even if your affairs

334
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,540
aren't settled,

335
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,660
you owe my sister

336
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
a clear answer!

337
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,140
When will you go back

338
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,980
and marry her?

339
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,060
Brother,

340
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,980
don't push him.

341
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,820
Sister Huazheng...

342
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,380
So you were engaged before coming to

343
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,300
the Peach Blossom Island?

344
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,860
Yes.

345
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,500
Then how dare you

346
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,140
trifle with my daughter?

347
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,740
Father,

348
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,420
Jing and I love each other.

349
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,980
How bold of you!

350
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,960
Father!

351
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,220
I only wish for a lifelong,

352
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,220
exclusive love with Jing.

353
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,820
I can't share him with anyone.

354
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,060
Guo Jing!

355
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,780
Did you change your heart

356
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,700
because of this woman?

357
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,980
Brother Guo Jing...

358
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,380
Sister Huazheng.

359
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,620
Brother Tolui.

360
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,820
You, Huazheng, and I

361
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,940
grew up together.

362
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,420
I've always treated her

363
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,460
as my sister.

364
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,820
Who wants to be your sister?

365
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,980
There are many good men on the grasslands.

366
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,700
You think I can't marry anyone else?

367
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,340
Brother, let's go.

368
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,180
Your Highness!

369
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,820
Guo Jing, think about it!

370
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,500
This Beggars' Gang Assembly is crucial.

371
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,940
It concerns the succession

372
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,860
of the master.

373
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
All apprentices of the gang

374
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,740
will gather in Yuezhou.

375
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,940
Are you blind?

376
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,260
You hit us!

377
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,260
Who are you calling blind?

378
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,300
You!

379
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,060
Since you've joined the Beggars' Gang,

380
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,180
you're now beggars.

381
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,740
You from Clean Clothes Faction

382
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,700
still attached to

383
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,900
your finery?

384
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,740
You know what.

385
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,740
I'll make you

386
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,300
real beggars today.

387
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,420
You'll thank me then.

388
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,260
Am I right, brothers?

389
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,180
- Yes.
- Thank you?

390
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,540
Beggars' Gang's apprentices

391
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,460
should to punish the evil,

392
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,300
promote the good,

393
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,260
and uphold justice.

394
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,540
You Dirty Clothes Faction

395
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,180
only care about appearances.

396
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,260
If you want to fight with dogs for food,

397
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,300
go ahead.

398
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,580
- We won't stop you.
- Who are you insulting?

399
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,340
- Am I right?
- Who are you insulting?

400
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,700
Look at all of you!

401
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,220
You hypocrites!

402
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,500
Hero Yang, don't mind them.

403
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,020
Our Beggars' Gang has

404
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,380
Clean and Dirty Clothes Factions.

405
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,260
They always clash.

406
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,500
We're used to it.

407
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,660
You forsake clean food

408
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,100
for leftovers.

409
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,940
Lowering your stance

410
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,700
makes you apprentices of the Beggars' Gang?

411
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,220
- Do you dare to say that again?
- Go find food.

412
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,100
If you're late,

413
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,460
the dogs will get the food.

414
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,140
Who are you calling a dog?

415
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,620
What are you doing?

416
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,020
Dog Beating Staff?

417
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,140
Brothers!

418
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,300
We're all from the Beggars' Gang.

419
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,900
Please calm down.

420
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,980
Don't harm our unity.

421
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Yes.

422
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,660
I see apprentices of the Beggars' Gang

423
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,060
revere this staff.

424
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,260
So this staff must be

425
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,100
important to them.

426
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,260
When you go out,

427
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,340
you should keep it well

428
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,740
to avoid misunderstandings.

429
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,900
Don't worry.

430
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,180
I know what I'm doing.

431
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,620
You have some rest here.

432
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,020
I'll meet with the elders of the gang

433
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,420
to discuss how to deal with this staff.

434
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,940
I'll be back soon.

435
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,460
Be careful with

436
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,580
your words and actions.

437
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,540
Return the staff to Qigong.

438
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,980
Don't cause trouble.

439
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,460
The Beggars' Gang

440
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,340
has its rules.

441
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll follow them.

442
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,620
Nianci, don't worry.

443
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,620
I'm just returning something.

444
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,100
I won't cause trouble.

445
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,460
You... Be careful.

446
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Got it.

447
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,300
I'm not the person I used to be.

448
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,660
Mr. Yang,

449
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,060
I've informed Elders Jian,

450
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,780
Peng, and Liang.

451
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,620
They're waiting in the City God Temple.

452
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,220
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw?

453
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,580
Two elders,

454
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,780
(Elder Jian, from Beggars' Gang)

455
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
don't be rash.

456
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,460
Even if Master is confused,

457
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,140
he wouldn't pass the position

458
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,300
to this one using such a vile technique.

459
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,340
Three elders,

460
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,740
I'm Yang Kang.

461
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,060
I follow Qigong's last wish,

462
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,940
holding the token of the gang

463
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,060
to attend Beggars' Gang Assembly.

464
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,220
I have no other intentions.

465
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,340
If there's a misunderstanding,

466
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,700
I apologize.

467
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,620
Now that I've delivered the staff,

468
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,380
I've fulfilled Qigong's wish.

469
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,420
If you disdain me,

470
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,580
I'll leave at once.

471
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,980
(Elder Liang, from Beggars' Gang)

472
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,100
(Elder Peng, from Beggars' Gang)
Has Qigong

473
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,820
passed away?

474
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,740
Actually,

475
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,620
I still can't believe

476
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,460
Qigong has passed away.

477
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,780
If he hadn't died

478
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,980
in my arms,

479
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,980
I...

480
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,180
Tell us.

481
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,060
How did

482
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,060
Qigong die?

483
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,540
Half a month ago,

484
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,380
I was heading Yuezhou with Qigong.

485
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,620
When we passed

486
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,020
the Niujia Village near Lin'an City,

487
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,540
we came across Old Heretic Huang,

488
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,100
master of the Peach Blossom Island.

489
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,060
Hong Qigong.

490
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,660
Your apprentice Guo Jing tricked my daughter.

491
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,260
Hand him over,

492
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,540
or I'll kill you.

493
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,260
That's ridiculous.

494
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,460
Your daughter doesn't listen to you,

495
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,660
but you blame me.

496
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,460
Want to fight?

497
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,340
No need for excuses.

498
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,360
Bring it on.

499
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,180
- Kang, step aside.
- Qigong, be careful.

500
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,300
Master and Huang Yaoshi sparred

501
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,340
with internal energy for a while.

502
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,860
Master, let me help you.

503
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
No.

504
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,220
Our Geggars' Gang

505
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,540
always fights honorably.

506
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,740
We don't take advantage of others.

507
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,180
Master acted honorably,

508
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,100
but Huang Yaoshi,

509
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,020
unable to win,

510
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,340
used a dirty trick.

511
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,220
Nonsense!

512
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,220
We've heard

513
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,300
that Guo Jing and Huang Rong

514
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,980
are Master's apprentices.

515
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,820
Why would they betray him?

516
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
Guo Jing wanted to

517
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,540
please Old Heretic Huang

518
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,380
and marry his daughter,

519
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,220
so he attacked Qigong.

520
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,100
You call Qigong Master,

521
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,540
but he can't use a vile technique

522
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,740
like Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

523
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,540
It's shameful to say.

524
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,020
But when I was young,

525
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,740
I saved Mei Chaofeng, that demoness.

526
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,580
She was severely injured

527
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,100
and near death.

528
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,740
She wanted to kill me,

529
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,460
but spared me

530
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,940
to control me.

531
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,500
She forced me to be her apprentice

532
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,060
and taught me Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

533
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,380
Later on,

534
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,940
I roamed the Jiangnan region upholding justice.

535
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,980
I encountered a notorious villain.

536
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,900
But my skills were insufficient

537
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,340
and I was defeated,

538
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,500
gravely injured,

539
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,540
facing death.

540
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,620
Fortunately,

541
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,020
Qigong saved me.

542
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,980
I wanted to be his apprentice,

543
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
but he refused me at that time.

544
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
That's true.

545
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,340
Qigong hates others being verbose

546
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,380
so he doesn't take apprentices.

547
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,260
Later,

548
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,620
we met Huang Yaoshi and his daughter

549
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,540
and Guo Jing at Niujia Village.

550
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,740
They ganged up on us.

551
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,740
I risked my life to save Qigong.

552
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,260
Finally, before his death,

553
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,260
Master took me as an apprentice

554
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,220
and entrusted this token

555
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,820
to me.

556
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,860
Do you know

557
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,620
what it means for Qigong

558
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,700
to pass this token to you?

559
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,420
Master didn't say.

560
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,820
He only told me to take it back

561
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,780
to the Beggars' Gang.

562
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,060
Mr. Yang.

563
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,260
Qigong's intention

564
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,340
couldn't be clearer.

565
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,300
He wanted you to be

566
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,500
the next master of Beggars' Gang.

567
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,260
Three elders,

568
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,140
I'm just an ordinary man.

569
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,860
I am unworthy of

570
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,060
such a heavy responsibility.

571
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,940
Please choose

572
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,140
someone else

573
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,340
to be the new master.

574
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,820
Mr. Yang, no need to decline.

575
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,300
Qigong entrusted this token

576
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,220
to you,

577
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,540
he must have

578
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,580
carefully considered

579
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,220
your character

580
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,180
and talents.

581
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,020
Don't underestimate yourself.

582
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,260
As for your martial arts,

583
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,900
you still have time.

584
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,700
With practice,

585
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,060
you'll be more skilled in the future.

586
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,860
But...

587
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,900
Mr. Yang.

588
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Our earlier attack

589
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,980
was a test.

590
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,460
Please don't

591
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,020
hold a grudge because of this.

592
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,140
Mr. Yang.

593
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,340
Since Qigong passed this token

594
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,180
to you,

595
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,980
he wanted you to be the master.

596
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,140
If you refuse,

597
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,700
must we three old men

598
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,780
beg you on our knees?

599
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,740
Absolutely not.

600
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,740
You are for the gang's good,

601
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,300
how can I blame you?

602
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,300
Since it's

603
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,140
come to this,

604
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,140
I cannot

605
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,300
refuse anymore.

606
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
From now on,

607
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
please help me

608
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,540
lead the Beggars' Gang.

609
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,020
Jing.

610
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,100
Rong.

611
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,060
The fish is almost done.

612
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,180
Be careful!

613
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,780
You almost burned it.

614
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,380
- Is that okay?
- That's okay.

615
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,660
Nothing serious.

616
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,860
You scared me.

617
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,180
Jing.

618
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,900
This painting is weird.

619
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,420
Why?

620
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,660
Book of Wu.

621
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,940
Iron Palm.

622
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,220
Middle Peak.

623
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,100
Second.

624
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,020
The clues to the Book of Wumu

625
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,860
are in this painting.

626
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,540
It seems Wanyan Honglie guessed correctly.

627
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
The Book of Wumu

628
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,060
is hidden in Cuihan Hall in the palace.

629
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,260
But he only got the stone box,

630
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,300
not the book.

631
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,740
That's because

632
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,660
this crucial treasure

633
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,500
was stolen by my senior Qu Lingfeng.

634
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,820
You mean

635
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,060
this painting is the Book of Wumu?

636
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,900
No.

637
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,180
It's a treasure map.

638
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,340
The hidden words in the painting

639
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,700
records the location

640
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,580
of the Book of Wumu.

641
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,180
Middle Peak of Iron Palm Mountain.

642
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,820
Second chapter.

643
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,020
Isn't Qiu Qianren that fraud

644
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,060
the master of Iron Palm Gang?

645
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,900
Does

646
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,020
the Book of Wumu

647
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,260
have something to do with him?

648
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,260
If it does have

649
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,820
something to do with Qiu Qianren,

650
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,060
it might be one of his tricks.

651
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,260
But I think

652
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,260
Qiu Qianren doesn't know about this.

653
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,620
Or Wanyan Honglie would have gotten the book.

654
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,540
Then we must

655
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,100
protect this painting

656
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,140
and keep it from the Jins.

657
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,620
Brother,

658
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,300
this is our place.

659
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,340
You should go over there.

660
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,500
Sure. Sure.

661
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,820
We are all from the Beggars' Gang.

662
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,340
See you at the assembly tomorrow.

663
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,060
Why do these well-dressed people

664
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
also call the people

665
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
from the Beggars' Gang

666
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,620
brothers?

667
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,060
- Rong...
- They just dress differently.

668
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,260
You mean

669
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,700
they are also Beggars' Gang members?

670
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,140
Yes.

671
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,220
The Beggars' Gang has
Clean and Dirty Clothes Factions.

672
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,540
The shabby ones are from

673
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,460
the Dirty Clothes Faction.

674
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,060
The well-dressed ones are from

675
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,020
the Clean Clothes Faction.

676
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,140
So they're completely different?

677
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,980
Yes.

678
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,620
The two factions don't get along.

679
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,260
Qigong once

680
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,140
tried to unite them

681
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,980
to one fraction.

682
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,300
Even though he had tried hard,

683
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,220
he still failed in the end.

684
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,620
It's been a headache

685
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
for every master.

686
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,420
(Steamed Tofu)
Waiter, wine please.

687
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Coming.

688
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,900
Guests. Come on in.

689
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,660
Please have a seat.

690
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,100
Waiter.

691
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,380
Bring us all of

692
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,580
- your specialties.
- Got it.

693
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,740
And warm some good wine.

694
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,180
Very good. Please hold on.

695
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,140
Rong.

696
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,860
Are you cold?

697
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,300
Don't close the window.

698
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
The autumn wind is chilly.

699
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm worried you'll catch cold.

700
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,140
The wind is cold and sharp,

701
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,940
but refreshing.

702
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,620
And drinking warm wine

703
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,900
in the cold wind

704
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,660
is quite chill.

705
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,220
Okay.

706
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,180
I'll follow your lead.

707
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,700
Your food is ready.

708
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,540
Please enjoy.

709
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,540
Here. Have more.

710
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,700
Rong,

711
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,580
seeing this lake,

712
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,780
I think of someone.

713
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,580
Guess who?

714
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,740
I guess,

715
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,620
it's

716
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,460
Qiu Qianren that fraud.

717
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,300
If he fell into the lake

718
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
in this cold weather,

719
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,780
wouldn't he stop deceiving people?

720
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,220
(Lu Youjiao, from Beggars' Gang)

721
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,620
Two kids

722
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,540
talk big.

723
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,780
You look down upon Qiu,

724
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,900
Iron Palm Water Skimmer.

725
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,500
Sir,

726
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,380
please have a seat.

727
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,900
Let's drink together.

728
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,980
Okay.

729
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,580
Since you two

730
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,220
don't mind my untidiness,

731
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,940
I can't refuse.

732
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,780
Waiter, bring us chopsticks and a cup.

733
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,620
No need.

734
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,220
A beggar

735
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,700
must follow a beggar's rules.

736
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,500
A beggar should look the part.

737
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,260
You are kind to give me food.

738
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,620
I can't dirty your utensils.

739
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,620
Please don't be so modest.

740
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,300
Try this warm wine.

741
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,100
Thank you, Miss. Thank you, sir.

742
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,460
Okay. Here.

743
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,340
Cheers.

744
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,220
May I know your name, sir?

745
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,220
You two

746
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,140
are Master Hong's apprentices.

747
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,220
Though you're young,

748
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,660
we're peers.

749
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,580
You can all me brother.

750
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,740
My surname is Lu.

751
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,540
My name is Lu Youjiao.

752
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,060
Brother Lu, you already knew

753
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,140
about us?

754
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,300
Li Sheng

755
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,860
and Yu Zhaoxing from the gang

756
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,740
told me about you.

757
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,700
I heard you talking about

758
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,900
Qiu Qianren and Iron Palm Gang.

759
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,060
Seems you don't know

760
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,220
much about him.

761
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,260
Brother Lu, do you know something?

762
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,860
Qiu Qianren is the master
of the Iron Palm Gang.

763
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,020
The Iron Palm Gang

764
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,300
is notorious in Hunan, Hubei,

765
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,500
and Sichuan.

766
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,140
Its members commit

767
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,980
all sorts of crimes.

768
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,340
They collude with officials

769
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,780
and secretly aid the Jins,

770
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,100
engaging in nefarious activities.

771
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,220
Qiu Qianren

772
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,460
is just a fraud.

773
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,900
How could he stir up such a big mess?

774
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,620
Qiu Qianren is

775
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,260
at the same level as the Five Greats.

776
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,540
Even Master Hong found it hard

777
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,380
to defeat him.

778
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,340
The Iron Palm technique is intricate,

779
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,580
comparable to our
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

780
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,860
Miss, don't underestimate him.

781
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,300
Brother Lu, you've been deceived.

782
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
I've fought Qiu Qianren several times.

783
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,660
That Iron Palm Water Skimmer

784
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,060
is just a trick,

785
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,900
fancy moves

786
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,580
with no real skills.

787
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,780
But I've heard

788
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,020
he lived deep in the mountains,

789
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,180
practicing his Iron Palm skills

790
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,740
for over ten years

791
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,020
without leaving.

792
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,980
That can't be true.

793
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,780
We just saw him a few days ago.

794
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,580
Waiter, find us a quiet spot.

795
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,780
Sure, follow me.

796
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,900
Eat up.

797
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,780
Kang, what's wrong?

798
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,340
I think this place isn't good.

799
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,380
Let's eat elsewhere.

800
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,660
Alright.

801
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,940
I'm full. I'm full.

802
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,780
Stop serving me.

803
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,740
You should eat more.

804
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,460
Brother Lu,

805
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,020
are those three elders

806
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,300
also from Beggars' Gang?

807
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,540
Yes. You're good.

808
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,340
The Beggars' Gang has four elders

809
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,420
below the master.

810
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,100
I am the Law-enforcing Elder.

811
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,500
The other three

812
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,580
are in charge of the Transmission,

813
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,180
Livelihood and Martial Arts.

814
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,020
Rong.

815
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,340
How did you know that?

816
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,580
Beggars' Gang members

817
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,740
show their rank

818
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,580
with cloth sacks.

819
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,100
The more sacks,

820
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,940
the higher the rank.

821
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,620
These three elders

822
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,860
all have nine sacks

823
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,700
like Brother Lu.

824
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,620
I see.

825
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,540
Rong, you are a good observer.

826
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,380
Brother Lu,

827
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,300
you are the leader
of the Dirty Clothes Faction.

828
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,980
And they are

829
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,780
the leaders of the Clean Clothes Faction.

830
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,860
I did notice that.

831
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,340
Their clothes are cleaner.

832
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,340
Brother Lu's clothes are dirtier.

833
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,100
The essence of the gang

834
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,740
is begging in dirty clothes.

835
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,340
If it is just a façade

836
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,300
and putting on an act,

837
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,260
it's better not to be a beggar.

838
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,740
Brother Lu,

839
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
in my opinion,

840
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,380
instead of wearing dirty,

841
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,380
uncomfortable clothes,

842
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,420
why not

843
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,100
have the members clean their clothes?

844
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
It would be more comfortable

845
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,580
and could ease the factional strife.

846
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,820
Isn't that a win-win?

847
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,540
You're a rich lady.

848
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,620
Of course you find us dirty and side with

849
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,260
the Clean Clothes Faction!

850
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,380
We have different goals and paths.

851
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,780
Goodbye for now!

852
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,940
Brother Lu,

853
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,380
Rong didn't mean that.

854
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,740
I spoke wrongly

855
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,180
and angered Elder Lu.

856
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,620
You shouldn't have said that.

857
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,620
But I don't want to wear dirty clothes.

858
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,340
It's okay.

859
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,420
When we meet Brother Lu next time,

860
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,260
we'll apologize to him and treat him with wine.

861
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,380
Okay.

862
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,100
I'm Peng Xu.

863
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,460
Greetings to you.

864
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,020
Greetings, Elder Peng.

865
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,500
Elder Peng, what's that for?

866
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,820
Young hero,

867
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,740
you've been poisoned

868
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,140
by Elder Lu.

869
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,260
We have no grudge with him.

870
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,900
Why did he poison us?

871
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,580
You may not know.

872
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,780
Elder Lu is petty.

873
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,460
I think

874
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,060
you must have

875
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,180
offended him somehow.

876
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,420
But Rong didn't mean that.

877
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,100
That sly beggar

878
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,740
doesn't care

879
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,780
if it was intentional or not.

880
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,420
If it doesn't meet his approval,

881
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,940
he'll strike you down mercilessly.

882
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,500
I can't stand

883
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,060
Elder Lu's ways.

884
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,580
So, you're lucky

885
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,540
to meet me today.

886
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Here is the antidote.

887
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
You should take it now.

888
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,180
Though Elder Lu

889
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,340
is skilled with poison,

890
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,940
I don't think

891
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,980
he's very good at it.

892
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,060
Last month,

893
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,260
Western Venom Ouyang Feng

894
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,100
gave me three poisonous drinks.

895
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,340
Those were something.

896
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,340
You had such an experience?

897
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,740
We appreciate your kindness.

898
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,380
Here,

899
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,180
we toast to you.

900
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,460
That jerk's poison

901
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,540
is strong.

902
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,940
You should take the antidote now.

903
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,900
Or it'll be hard to treat.

904
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,900
If you don't accept,

905
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,060
then we'll not drink

906
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,020
this antidote wine.

907
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,460
Miss, you're skilled.

908
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,540
I'm sincerely helping you.

909
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,780
Please don't waste it.

910
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,980
Rong, watch out!

911
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,740
Mr. Yang.

912
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,380
We

913
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,260
found this painting

914
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,100
in their bundle.

915
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,100
Please have a look.

916
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,100
Is this painting valuable?

917
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,740
It's a bit damaged.

918
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,540
They still carry it

919
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,460
even though it's damaged.

920
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,380
That's weird.

921
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
That makes sense.

922
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,900
Something's wrong.

923
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,820
There are words on it.

924
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,940
Book of Wu.

925
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,820
Middle Peak of Iron Palm Mountain.

926
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,420
Second chapter.

927
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,260
What does this mean?

928
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,300
This painting is interesting.

929
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,740
Good. Good.

930
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,060
So let's consider it

931
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,060
a gift for the future master

932
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,140
from me.

933
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,580
Thank you, Elder Peng.

934
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,020
Jing.

935
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,020
Jing.

936
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,900
I feel dizzy.

937
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,260
Rong?

938
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Is it you?

939
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,540
It's me.

940
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,060
What's wrong with you?

941
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,900
Why are you sweating?

942
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,180
I don't know.

943
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,740
I had a horrible dream.

944
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
What's going on here?

945
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,020
We've been tricked.

946
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,220
Did Brother Lu

947
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,700
really poison our wine?

948
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,940
I think

949
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
it's not Brother Lu,

950
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,500
but that old man

951
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,580
named Peng.

952
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,340
In the martial world,
there's a mind control technique.

953
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,340
A glance can

954
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,420
trap you in illusions

955
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,860
and fall into a deep sleep.

956
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
What you see in your dream

957
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,940
is the fear in your mind.

958
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,340
We fell for that old man's trick.

959
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,740
I didn't expect

960
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,220
such a lowlife in the Beggars' Gang.

961
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,820
Next time I see him,

962
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,820
I'll teach him a lesson.

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,340

oxhide mixed with steel wire.

00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,460
Struggle tightens it.

968
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,540
What should we do?

969
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,460
Now we can't escape.

970
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,300
We have to wait for that Peng

971
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,180
to see what he's up to.

972
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,020
That's our only option.
