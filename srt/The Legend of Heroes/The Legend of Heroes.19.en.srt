00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,680
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,170
Give it to me.

4
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,530
Easy.

5
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,470
(I've always scorned tradition and rituals.)

6
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,640
(But when it comes to Rong,)

7
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,630
(I've become more worldly.)

8
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,700
(How pathetic.)

9
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Grandmaster,

10
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,400
this place is deserted.

11
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,350
We got some food from the nearby village.

12
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,150
Please have a bite.

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Grandmaster,

14
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,070
don't you like these dishes?

15
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,500
Senior, I'll go make some other dishes.

16
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,030
Miss Cheng,

17
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,940
do you want to marry him?

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,430
- Grandmaster...
- Time passes quickly.

19
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,910
If you want to marry him, just do it.

20
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
If you want to marry him,

21
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,870
marry him now.

22
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,870
Tie the knot and head to the bridal chamber!

23
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,630
Tie the knot and head to the bridal chamber!

24
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,100
In times of crisis,

25
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,960
you both are willing to risk your lives

26
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,380
for each other.

27
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,940
In this world,

28
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,010
where can you find

29
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,540
such a good match?

30
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,450
My marriage

31
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,290
should be decided by my father.

32
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,030
That's not necessary.

33
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,220
If you two are in love,

34
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
today,

35
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,350
I'll agree to your marriage.

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,700
Guanying,

37
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,030
what do you think?

38
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,750
Grandmaster,

39
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,310
I'm not worthy of Miss Cheng.

40
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,750
You are an apprentice of Peach Blossom Island.

41
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,540
Not worthy?

42
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm not skilled in martial arts,

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,400
and I'm not talented.

44
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,910
- And I...
- And?

45
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,010
Grandmaster, I know it's my great luck

46
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,120
to meet her here.

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,170
If I can marry her...

48
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,870
You're talking too much.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,380
Do you want to marry me?

50
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,930
I...

51
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,900
I do.

52
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,020
Silly girl.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,260
They'll bow to Heaven and Earth.

54
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,260
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

55
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,890
Shagu loves seeing

56
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,580
people bow to Heaven and Earth!

57
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,230
Bow to Heaven and Earth!

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,750
Miss... Miss Cheng.

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,310
You can consider today's

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,790
wedding ceremony a joke,

61
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,430
just to make

62
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,750
my grandmaster happy.

63
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,460
He always does things like this.

64
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,230
Let's put on

65
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,190
a good show.

66
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,260
Once he's done,

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,190
I'll send you back.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,140
Mr. Lu,

69
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,260
do you really think this is just a joke

70
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,460
to make your grandmaster happy?

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,430
Don't take me wrong, Miss Cheng.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
But...

73
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,630
At this moment,

74
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,900
I hope it's true.

75
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,580
Me... Me too.

76
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,750
Your grandmaster's flute

77
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,310
sounds nice.

78
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,260
Miss Cheng, don't listen to it.

79
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,230
This tune is odd.

80
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,110
Mr. Lu...

81
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,500
I can't believe my father.

82
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,140
He says he doesn't care about rituals.

83
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,970
But when it comes to my marriage,

84
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,630
he sets three challenges.

85
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,320
Jing!

86
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,460
Your breathing is erratic.

87
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,020
Calm down and stay focused.

88
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,370
Rong.

89
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,230
I don't know why.

90
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,340
My heart is racing.

91
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
Jing.

92
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,460
Don't move.

93
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,440
Or you'll lose control of your inner power.

94
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,550
I feel so hot.

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,550
I can't control myself.

96
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,700
Hang in there, Jing.

97
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,190
I'm sorry, Rong.

98
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,200
I don't know why this is happening.

99
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,340
This tune makes me...

100
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,030
It's not your fault, Jing.

101
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,670
Stay calm.

102
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,890
Or you won't withstand

103
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,270
Emerging Waves from the Dark Blue Sea.

104
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,520
I'm hungry.

105
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,100
I'm starving.

106
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,580
I'm starving.

107
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,190
Who are you?

108
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,550
Did you stay here all night last night?

109
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,820
I... I...

110
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,370
I arrived here

111
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,340
before you.

112
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,940
I didn't mean to.

113
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,290
Have you been seeing us all night?

114
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,700
I didn't see anything.

115
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,510
And... And you two

116
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,670
didn't do anything last night.

117
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,200
Why did you stay silent and watch us

118
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,270
all night?

119
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Sir,

120
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,640
Ma'am,

121
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,480
I'm not a local.

122
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm handicapped.

123
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,270
I just wanted to find a tavern

124
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,720
but stumbled upon bandits.

125
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,910
They knocked me out,

126
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,740
and I was unconscious for a few days.

127
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,030
Why were you silent all of last night?

128
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,890
You came in all of a sudden.

129
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,090
I thought you were

130
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,170
with the bandits.

131
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,860
So I didn't dare to speak.

132
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,920
Sir,

133
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,520
Ma'am,

134
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,070
I've been hungry for days.

135
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,620
I'm dizzy and faint.

136
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,620
Please, give me

137
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,980
something to eat.

138
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,400
Guanying...

139
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,980
The young venomous creature
was in the side room.

140
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,100
They were careless.

141
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,370
They didn't find him

142
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,650
all night.

143
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,620
Will the

144
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,600
young venomous creature harm Mr. Lu

145
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,560
and Miss Cheng?

146
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,460
Hard to say.

147
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,550
Don't rush. Take your time.

148
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,820
We have more.

149
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,030
How long have you been not eaten?

150
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,850
What he's doing...

151
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,170
I didn't realize

152
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,570
you were in such dire straits,

153
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,820
yet you are a neat man.

154
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,190
To be honest,

155
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,670
I value cleanliness

156
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,740
and fragrant things

157
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,220
the most.

158
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,190
I've been tortured

159
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,790
in these past few days.

160
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,930
Since you've had

161
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,860
a good meal,

162
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,940
we'll leave.

163
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,730
Wait.

164
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,700
Why the rush?

165
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,910
You saved my life.

166
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,650
So

167
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,220
I must repay you.

168
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,270
This flower is my treasure.

169
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,760
It's beautiful in color.

170
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,320
(This flower looks familiar.)

171
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,530
But it withers shortly

172
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,550
after being picked

173
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,740
like a beauty.

174
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,190
Isn't that right,

175
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,310
Miss Cheng?

176
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,050
How do you know my wife's surname?

177
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,890
Guanying,

178
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,090
he is Ouyang Ke,

179
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:33,930
the lecher.

180
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,860
Let go of my husband!

181
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,580
Miss Cheng,

182
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,390
put down your sword.

183
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,820
Or

184
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,330
I don't know

185
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,700
what I might do.

186
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,600
Let him go!

187
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,740
Drop the sword.

188
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,980
It smells so good.

189
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,100
Shameless.

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,310
I am shameless.

191
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,790
On my worst night,

192
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,410
you let me see

193
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,150
a bridal chamber scene.

194
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,970
Since you gave me

195
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,270
a good show,

196
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,740
I'll return the favor

197
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,530
for Mr. Lu tonight.

198
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,100
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

199
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,100
Please let my husband go.

200
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,820
Miss Cheng, why are you sweating?

201
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,390
Why don't you

202
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,320
take off some clothes

203
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,390
to cool down?

204
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,320
What did you say?

205
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,910
Make me happy,

206
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,910
and I'll let you go immediately.

207
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,070
But if I'm unhappy,

208
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,510
I don't know what I might do.

209
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,580
Take them off.

210
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,030
Take them off!

211
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,940
That lecher!

212
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,440
Let's go out and kill him.

213
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,840
We can't move now.

214
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,290
Aren't we doing nothing?

215
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,480
If we rush out,

216
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,820
we'll waste our efforts

217
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,430
and get injured.

218
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,200
We won't save Miss Cheng,

219
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,800
and we'll lose our lives.

220
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,070
Then what should we do?

221
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,220
I want watermelon!

222
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,530
Shagu wants to wash clothes

223
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,410
for the pretty girl.

224
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,600
Shagu loves washing clothes

225
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,980
and water.

226
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,240
Your clothes are dirtier. Take them off too.

227
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,440
Get away, lunatic.

228
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,960
You're the lunatic.

229
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,800
I won't wash it then.

230
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,460
Men are so mean.

231
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,390
The girl eating watermelon...

232
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,550
The girl eating watermelon!

233
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,980
The girl eating watermelon!

234
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,550
The girl eating watermelon?

235
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,960
The girl eating watermelon,

236
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,890
do you want to wash clothes?

237
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,760
The weather is sunny today,

238
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,030
a good day for washing clothes.

239
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,840
Let's change to using one palm now.

240
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,310
The girl eating watermelon!

241
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,210
Take off your clothes.

242
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,570
I'll wash them.

243
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,670
The girl eating watermelon!

244
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,340
The girl eating watermelon!

245
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,460
The girl eating watermelon!

246
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,050
Say something.

247
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,820
The girl eating watermelon?

248
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,700
Could there be

249
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,420
a girl hiding in here?

250
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,960
Is there another way

251
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,200
to access this secret room?

252
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,180
No.

253
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,070
No?

254
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,420
I won't tell you.

255
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,130
The girl eating watermelon and the big brother

256
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,550
are secretly eating watermelon inside.

257
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,800
Shagu,

258
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,470
listen.

259
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,660
There's no sound inside.

260
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,760
They must have suffocated

261
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,170
in this room.

262
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,930
We need to open it and save them.

263
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,310
Shagu can't say.

264
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,850
Sister Watermelon told me not to say.

265
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,900
Shagu, we should save them.

266
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,370
There are many ways to die,

267
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,340
but suffocating is the worst.

268
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,760
Think about it. We'll open the door

269
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,240
and find that the people inside stink.

270
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,580
Bugs will start to grow.

271
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,000
Wouldn't that be scary?

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,860
Right?

273
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,810
They can't be suffocated.

274
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,480
They'll suffocate inside.

275
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,520
Yes, save them.

276
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,860
- Save them. Save them.
- Save them.

277
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,030
Isn't that my Sister Rong?

278
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,680
The girl eating watermelon

279
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,030
is you.

280
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,340
We really have a deep connection.

281
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
What?

282
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,750
Are you healing Guo Jing?

283
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,030
Rong,

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,420
even if he survives, he'll be crippled.

285
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,310
But you're young.

286
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,130
Why do you have to

287
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,030
marry a cripple?

288
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,230
What do you think?

289
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,370
Rong, you're usually so sharp-tongued.

290
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,990
Why aren't you speaking today?

291
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,130
Can't speak while channeling internal energy?

292
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,380
Then can you move?

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,310
Do you need my help?

294
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,930
Come on.

295
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,790
Let's continue.

296
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,230
I don't believe

297
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,340
you can heal

298
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,140
while I'm staying here.

299
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,850
I'll force you

300
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,380
lose control of your inner power.

301
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,850
Bullying a cripple?

302
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,070
That's all you got?

303
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,030
My uncle will be back soon.

304
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,510
I'll wait for you outside.

305
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,800
Jing!

306
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,580
Let's switch back to using both palms.

307
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,380
A hedgehog.

308
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,030
A hedgehog!

309
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,560
You become a hedgehog.

310
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,550
Stop that!

311
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,550
A hedgehog!

312
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,860
Still smells good.

313
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,380
Haste makes waste.

314
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,240
I'd better

315
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,790
not waste this.

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,950
Is anyone there?

317
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,730
Miss,

318
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,650
you...

319
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,140
Good things come in pairs.

320
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,340
Good things come in pairs!

321
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,030
Miss Mu.

322
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,230
Last time I went back to find you,

323
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,240
you were taken by someone else.

324
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,900
Now we meet again.

325
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,310
This is destined by heaven.

326
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
Brother Ke.

327
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,550
You're quite busy.

328
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,070
Young prince?

329
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,900
Brother Ke, why are you alone?

330
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,860
It's a long story.

331
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,130
I've had bad luck

332
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,660
and ended up alone.

333
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,380
But I didn't expect...

334
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,230
Young prince.

335
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,720
Sorry, I didn't see it.

336
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,950
Is this Miss Mu

337
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,340
your lover?

338
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,310
If she's yours,

339
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,820
I'll give her back to you.

340
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,040
We are friends.

341
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,370
Let's not fight

342
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,100
over a woman.

343
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,380
She was my lover.

344
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,310
But now,

345
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,130
I no longer care

346
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,620
about romance.

347
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,860
You don't

348
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,550
care about romance.

349
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,750
Really?

350
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,340
I was troubled by love recently,

351
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,820
feeling uneasy.

352
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,650
But seeing you

353
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,470
treat women as playthings,

354
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,380
it suddenly enlightened me.

355
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,790
That's great.

356
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,620
Young prince, are you mocking me?

357
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
No.

358
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,550
Working together,

359
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,990
we can achieve greatness.

360
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,420
If you want

361
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,340
this woman,

362
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,950
she's yours.

363
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,720
Consider it a small gift for the Ouyang family

364
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,270
of Mount White Camel.

365
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,760
Their conversation

366
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,720
makes me sick.

367
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,620
I thought

368
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,140
Yang Kang was just greedy for power.

369
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,960
I didn't realize

370
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,230
he was so despicable.

371
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,620
Ke,

372
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,410
your uncle rules the martial world

373
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,030
and my father commands troops.

374
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,860
If we join forces,

375
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,860
not only can we can enjoy ourselves,

376
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,900
but also stir the world

377
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,510
and control the land.

378
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,130
The young prince's enlightenment

379
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,860
puts me to shame.

380
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,270
Though we are not sworn brothers,

381
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,900
we are closer than full brothers.

382
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,070
Full brothers?

383
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,820
Since you

384
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,070
have put it this way,

385
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,950
how about we

386
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,230
use these two women

387
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,580
to seal our brotherhood?

388
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,070
What do you think?

389
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,230
What do you mean?

390
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,100
I'll give you Miss Cheng.

391
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,340
And Miss Mu

392
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,010
is mine.

393
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,680
Let's do something

394
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,610
out of those emotional

395
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,820
and moral constraints.

396
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,470
How about that?

397
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,100
Well said.

398
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,620
Then I'll follow your lead.

399
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,170
Brother Ke,

400
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,320
after you.

401
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,790
You smells so good.

402
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,710
Why do you want to kill me?

403
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,950
I don't care if you ravage others.

404
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,270
But Nianci is my betrothed.

405
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,100
You've repeatedly harassed her.

406
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,470
Today I must kill you

407
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,550
to ease my anger!

408
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,580
Why are you laughing?

409
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,070
I'm laughing at us.

410
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,990
Isn't it ridiculous

411
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,420
that people like us

412
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,280
saying such things?

413
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,710
Nianci is my last dignity.

414
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,950
You...

415
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,900
You don't even acknowledge your own father,

416
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,340
and you talk about dignity?

417
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,030
We are just

418
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,070
two orphans

419
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,900
heading to

420
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,860
the underworld together.

421
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,210
Ke,

422
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,340
come home with mother.

423
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,710
Kang!

424
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,560
It's okay.

425
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,790
I'm here.

426
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,170
I'm here.

427
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,380
We need to clean this up.

428
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,340
If Ouyang Feng returns,

429
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,900
he'll definitely kill us.

430
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,990
You are Lu Guanying of Guiyun Manor?

431
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,490
I'm sorry.

432
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,450
Last time you spared me

433
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,510
out of kindness.

434
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,470
But this time, I can't let you go.

435
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,170
Kang.

436
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,620
Don't kill the innocent.

437
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,580
They saw me kill Ouyang Ke.

438
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,850
I need to silence them.

439
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,710
They were victims of Ouyang Ke.

440
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,950
They won't sell us out.

441
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,510
I doubt that.

442
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,230
If Ouyang Feng captures them,

443
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,710
they'll spill everything

444
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,900
to save themselves.

445
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,030
If we want to be peaceful in the future,

446
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,280
we must silence them.

447
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,230
Kang,

448
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,440
I don't want you to kill anymore.

449
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,580
But if I don't kill them,

450
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,270
others will kill us.

451
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,890
No.

452
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,440
Not everyone in the world

453
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,620
is bad.

454
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,030
I hope you won't let me down.

455
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Are you okay?

456
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,660
Please don't worry.

457
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,140
We won't speak of anything today.

458
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,030
Thank you for saving our lives.

459
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,470
You'd better go before I

460
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,030
change my mind.

461
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,950
- Let's go.
- Okay.

462
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,910
This staff looks familiar.

463
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,300
I think I've seen it somewhere.

464
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,550
Seems to belong to the Beggars' Gang.

465
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,180
Beggars' Gang?

466
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,700
Then why did Ouyang Ke have it?

467
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,410
(This staff must be related to)

468
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,870
(Guo Jing and Huang Rong.)

469
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,290
(If Ouyang Feng)

470
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,390
(comes looking for his nephew,)

471
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,080
(I can use this staff)

472
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,070
(to defend myself.)

473
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,580
We'd better keep it.

474
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,390
Is your injury

475
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,360
healed now?

476
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,830
I'm fine.

477
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,780
Actually,

478
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,660
it was my fault.

479
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,140
You're a grown-up man.

480
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,600
but I've kept you

481
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,510
hidden in the wilderness.

482
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,350
I was too selfish.

483
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,710
Are you

484
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,030
trying to send me away?

485
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,830
No.

486
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,620
I can't live without you now.

487
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,430
It's just

488
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,430
that we can

489
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,620
live in a better way.

490
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,660
You always admired Brother Guo

491
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,740
for having a master like Qigong.

492
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,700
When I was young,

493
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,030
I had connections with Qigong
and the Beggars' Gang.

494
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,810
If you return this staff

495
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,660
to Qigong,

496
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,890
maybe I can ask him

497
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,890
to take you as his apprentice.

498
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,870
Really?

499
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,600
Instead of staying with Ouyang Feng

500
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,260
and the Jins,

501
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,120
I'd rather you

502
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,390
make friends with true heroes

503
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,030
and take the right path.

504
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,780
I want to learn real skills

505
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,510
and make something of myself,

506
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,950
so I can protect you better.

507
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,570
Are you hungry?

508
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,780
I'll cook you some noodles.

509
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,530
Nianci.

I didn't know Sixth Prince was here.

527
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,770
Sorry for not greeting you properly.

528
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,490
Master Qiu.

529
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,690
If it wasn't an emergency,

530
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,170
I wouldn't have come

531
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,690
here to visit you

532
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,850
without a notice.

533
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,570
You are so anxious.

534
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,010
If I'm not mistaken,

535
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,650
the Mongol-Song alliance
must have been formed.

536
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,890
Exactly.

537
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,530
Moreover,

538
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,450
I haven't found

539
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,370
the Book of Wumu.

540
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,850
Both of them

541
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,530
are very unfavorable to our Jin.

542
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,570
Your Royal Highness, isn't this going too far?

543
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,130
You have Ouyang Feng, Western Venom,

544
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,650
by your side.

545
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,490
I can't find

546
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,690
Mr. Ouyang now.

547
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,530
It's...

548
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,810
It's hard to explain.

549
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,010
It's my fault.

550
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,650
It's all my fault.

551
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,850
I...

552
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,570
I made a mistake.

553
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,890
I should have invited...

554
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,890
Whom should you have invited?

555
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,450
Ouyang Feng is renowned among Five Greats

556
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,930
for some diabolic tricks.

557
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,490
But I

558
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,650
have mastered Iron Palm.

559
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,490
But...

560
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,650
Forget it.

561
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,050
Exactly.

562
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,570
I've never doubted

563
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,690
your abilities.

564
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,090
Now I want to

565
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,290
reverse the situation.

566
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,010
Please help me.

567
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,490
Do I have to make the decision?

568
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,290
Fine.

569
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,290
What's your plan?

570
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,770
The urgent priority

571
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,530
is to intercept

572
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,530
the Mongol envoy

573
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,010
on their way back.

574
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,850
Blame the Song,

575
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,290
and nip their alliance plan

576
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,850
in the bud?

577
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,650
Exactly.

578
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,330
Old Venomous Creature,

579
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,170
you've chased me from Lin'an to Jiaxing,

580
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,890
and then back to Lin'an.

581
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,330
Several days and nights,

582
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,770
you haven't caught me.

583
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,650
The contest is over.

584
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,890
What do you want now?

585
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,450
But you haven't gotten rid of me.

586
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,690
If you don't tell me about the manual,

587
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,170
I will chase you

588
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,130
wherever you go.

589
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,930
Fine.

590
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,290
Let's skip eating and sleeping,

591
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,530
and see who can run faster

592
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,050
and longer. Dare?

593
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,290
Why not?

594
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,370
I want to see who tires out first.

595
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,010
I'm not tired at all.

596
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,030
Brother Ouyang!

597
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,090
Yaoshi?

598
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,570
Old Heretic Huang?

599
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:21,970
Didn't you say

600
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,570
he drowned?

601
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,650
Last night,

602
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,730
I heard Old Imp calling out in Niujia Village,

603
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,890
so I chased him here.

604
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,610
Yaoshi, you're mistaken.

605
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,770
Those words weren't from me,

606
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,530
but from those Jins.

607
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,370
Old Heretic Huang.

608
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,050
You want Old Imp

609
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,530
to die?

610
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,850
A leaky boat

611
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,770
couldn't kill me,

612
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,290
so you

613
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,810
come after me now?

614
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,370
You're fine,

615
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,610
but my daughter Rong was...

616
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,890
Where is Guo Jing?

617
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,330
Where is he?

618
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,090
Tell me.

619
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,130
I'll kill him!

620
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,890
Old Heretic Huang

621
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,090
heard a wild story!

622
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,450
Don't laugh.

623
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,130
Explain to him.

624
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,130
What's there to explain?

625
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,410
Let him stew a bit longer.

626
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,890
It's fun. It's fun.

627
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:17,730
Stop that.

628
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,090
You went too far.

629
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,650
Jing and Rong

630
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,170
will be mad.

631
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,170
No, they won't!

632
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,130
Old Heretic Huang locked us up for 15 years,

633
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,010
and we didn't get mad.

634
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,970
Can't we play a joke on him

635
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,810
and have fun?

636
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,210
You have a point.

637
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,730
Since that's the case,

638
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:36,890
we can play with him.

639
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,930
What do you want to play?

640
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,690
Tell me!

641
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,690
You startled me, Old Heretic Huang.

642
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,250
You want to kill Brother Guo.

643
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,530
Are you trying to trick me now?

644
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,850
That's not fair.

645
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,690
Right?

646
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,170
You gave me no chice.

647
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,450
Wait.

648
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,730
Old Heretic Huang,

649
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,050
let's play a game.

650
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,330
If you can catch me, I'll tell you.

651
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,210
Zhou Botong!

652
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,090
Wait. Wait. Wait.

653
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,610
No. No. No.

654
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,250
I wanted to go out

655
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,130
for a stroll.

656
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,570
I forgot...

657
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,050
I...

658
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,170
I left Old Beggar

659
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,050
in the palace.

660
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,050
I forgot about him.

661
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,930
No. No. I need to find him.

662
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,770
Listen.

663
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,130
You go to the Niujia Village first.

664
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,370
I'll find Old Beggar

665
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,770
and then meet you there.

666
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,170
We can play later.

667
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,250
See you!

668
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,370
Old Imp!

669
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,210
Yaoshi.

670
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,770
We can catch him.

671
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,690
You can ask your questions, and I'll ask mine.

672
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,450
I locked him up for 15 years,

673
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,250
but he didn't say a word.

674
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,410
Forget it.

675
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,850
Let's go to the Niujia Village now.

676
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,330
