2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 30=

3
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,940
Mr. Qiu.

4
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,460
Quickly kill that Song general.

5
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,320
Don't let him run away!

6
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,420
I can't.

7
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,220
I still need his head

8
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,520
to collect the reward.

9
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,520
Zhou Botong.

10
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,780
What exactly do you want?

11
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,900
I haven't had enough fun yet.

12
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,140
You always run away.

13
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,360
Wait until I kill that person,

14
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,820
then I'll play with you.

15
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,220
- Is it okay?
- Martial Uncle Zhou.

16
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,720
Don't trust Qiu Qianren.

17
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,920
That general is the guard
of my Xiangyang City.

18
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,300
If something happens to him,

19
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,140
the city will be without a leader.

20
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,400
By then, it will collapse itself.

21
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,740
Shut up!

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,300
When is it your turn

23
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,140
to teach me what to do?

24
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,580
Why must we resort to martial arts

25
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,920
to solve problems?

26
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,980
Guo Jing.

27
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,580
What's wrong with you?

28
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,880
In this world,

29
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,020
is there really

30
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,320
no other way?

31
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,460
Yes.

32
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,160
Yes, there is.

33
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,840
Very easy.

34
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,080
I can help you.

35
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,960
My snake blood.

36
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,200
I have killed people again.

37
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,200
Hurry up and use the inner force.

38
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,020
Snake!

39
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,140
Snake!

40
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,060
Snake, please don't come over.

41
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,980
Please don't come over.

42
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,240
Please, please, please.

43
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,020
Brother, come up quickly.

44
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,440
Help me get rid of these two snakes.

45
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,920
I can't use martial arts
to harm people anymore.

46
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,400
- Hurry up!
- That kid has gone crazy.

47
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,580
No, no, no.

48
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,600
No one can help you right now.

49
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,660
Mr. Qiu.

50
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,180
Snake!

51
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,360
Don't come over, don't come over.

52
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,060
Don't come over.
I beg you, don't come over.

53
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,360
I'm afraid of snakes.

54
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,800
Old Imp.

55
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,400
You don't have to see me.

56
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,440
But if you don't kill him now,

57
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,200
I won't let you go even if I'm dead.

58
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,560
You really are persistent.

59
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,000
Qiu.

60
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,400
Prepare to die!

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,600
Guo Jing.

62
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,360
You have been practicing martial arts
for over ten years.

63
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,260
You can't kill the murderer

64
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,440
who killed your five masters,

65
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,120
and can't save Rong,

66
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,080
and your mother.

67
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,080
Not to mention

68
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,600
saving the Songs from misery.

69
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,240
Instead, you helped the enemy

70
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,920
and caused the death of many people.

71
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,520
It's better to end your life early.

72
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,200
Amitabha.

73
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,460
Jing.

74
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,560
Don't let obsession cloud your judgment.

75
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,040
Killing is wrong,

76
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,480
saving is impossible,

77
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,740
and I can't even kill myself?

78
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,160
Tell me what to do.

79
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,800
Every top expert

80
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,800
will face this problem

81
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,000
when run into the bottleneck.

82
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,440
It's not about martial arts moves,

83
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,400
but about the state of mind
of the martial artist.

84
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,840
Most people are trapped by their minds

85
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,320
just like you

86
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,440
at this moment.

87
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,280
I just feel

88
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,160
very painful.

89
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,040
As long as you can
get through this difficulty,

90
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,080
you can become a grandmaster

91
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,960
like Wang Chongyang

92
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,520
and Huang Chang.

93
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,920
I'm no longer obsessed with martial arts.

94
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,980
So what if I can

95
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,000
conquer the demon inside?

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,400
If you can't,

97
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,560
you will be blinded

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,080
like Qiu Qianren

99
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,000
and Ouyang Feng

100
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,840
and care nothing about the common people.

101
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,000
In that case,

102
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,760
martial arts is a harmful thing.

103
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,960
I should abandon it.

104
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,040
In the beginning,

105
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,280
why did you learn martial arts?

106
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,080
Naturally

107
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,240
to act chivalrously.

108
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,840
What is chivalry?

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,940
Chivalry means

110
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,320
to do things that are righteous

111
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,120
and be not afraid of death.

112
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,060
Jing.

113
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,640
We practice martial arts

114
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,440
to act chivalrously

115
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,080
and save people from danger.

116
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,840
We can't stand by and do nothing

117
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,720
for our own benefits.

118
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,440
If we care too much

119
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,120
about success or failure,

120
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,680
profits or losses,

121
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,360
then that's doing business,

122
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,000
not acting chivalrously.

123
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,460
Jing.

124
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,580
Mother.

125
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,400
You have grown up.

126
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,200
You should act like your father.

127
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,060
When you see someone killing innocent,

128
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,160
loyal and righteous people,

129
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,560
you should rescue them
with all your might,

130
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,680
protecting the country and the people

131
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,440
and fighting bravely against the enemy.

132
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,020
Mother.

133
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,580
Mother.

134
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,920
Master.

135
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,660
Master.

136
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,500
Jing.

137
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,680
Do you think

138
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,280
I've ever killed anyone?

139
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,700
Master.

140
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,320
I don't know.

141
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,800
Of course I've killed people.

142
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,300
I have killed

143
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,760
231 people.

144
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,720
Master, have you ever killed
the wrong person?

145
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,040
I am human.

146
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,760
Right or wrong,
it's not for me to decide.

147
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,940
I only know I did

148
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,560
what should be done.

149
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,320
The 231 people I killed

150
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,640
were all villains and evildoers.

151
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,880
If I don't kill them,

152
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,220
more innocent people

153
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,520
will die because of them.

154
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,600
So, do you think the karma

155
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,520
should be left to you

156
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,600
or to your martial arts skills?

157
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,680
Is this right

158
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,280
or wrong?

159
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,380
Reverend,

160
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,720
if I have the ability

161
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,240
but choose to ignore,

162
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,560
is it also a kind of sin?

163
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,100
Jing.

164
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,520
What kind of person will you become

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,440
is not decided
by your martial arts skills

166
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,080
but by yourself.

167
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,480
Thank you for enlightening me.

168
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,320
I understood.

169
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,960
Good.

170
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,260
Good.

171
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,380
- Go.
- Go.

172
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,660
Impossible.

173
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,000
Impossible!

174
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,720
My brother was enlightened
by Emperor Duan.

175
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,400
This time,

176
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,900
his martial arts are not inferior to

177
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,160
the Five Greats of Mount Hua.

178
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,800
Why not kill me?

179
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,800
You are a grandmaster.

180
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,060
If you are willing to benefit the people

181
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,900
with your own power,

182
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,240
it is more meaningful than killing you.

183
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,480
Nonsense.

184
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,400
The Iron Palm Gang is originally loyal.

185
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,400
But now facing great difficulties,

186
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,600
if we can get Master Qiu

187
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,640
back to the right path
to resist enemies,

188
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,000
it's kind of

189
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,360
the atonement for the sins
you have committed.

190
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,280
Forgive one person,

191
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
and we can save millions of people.

192
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,200
Back to the right path

193
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,680
to resist enemies.

194
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,400
The Jins attacked our Great Song,

195
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,340
and Master stepped up

196
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,940
for the country unflinchingly.

197
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,780
In the end,

198
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,600
he died tragically
at the hands of the Great Song.

199
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,400
The evil governors are ruling the state.

200
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,600
The people are living in misery.

201
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,220
Why should I save

202
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,140
such a corrupted

203
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,600
and hopeless country?

204
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,220
Your master Shangguan Jiannan

205
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,640
was a great hero.

206
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,640
He was loyal and brave
throughout his life.

207
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,200
He was a tough hero
with a strong will.

208
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,200
But after you became the chief,

209
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,240
you colluded with the enemy
and betrayed the country.

210
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,940
After death, how will you have the face

211
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,960
to see your master?

212
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,700
Master.

213
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,260
Master.

214
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,400
I practiced martial arts hard
all my life.

215
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,480
My Iron Palm skill
has reached perfection.

216
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,740
I wanted to become
the number one in the world,

217
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,690
and revive the Iron Palm Gang

218
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,220
to be the largest gang in the world

219
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,320
to honor your spirit in heaven.

220
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,480
Who would have thought

221
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,920
that today I lost to

222
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,700
a young man

223
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,160
who just joined the martial world.

224
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,520
I have a lofty ideal,

225
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,720
but I'll be buried under the ground.

226
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,920
Forget it.

227
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,340
Let go.

228
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,460
Your master

229
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,880
was a general under Han Shizhong,

230
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,960
loyal and fearless.

231
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,840
After General Han
was stripped of his military power,

232
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,520
your master led his men

233
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,800
to join the Iron Palm Gang.

234
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,520
Although he is in the martial world,

235
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,560
he never forgets to defend
against external enemies

236
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,880
and to reclaim the homeland.

237
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,860
Do you really think your master really
wants the Iron Palm Gang

238
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,520
to become the largest gang in the world

239
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,160
and wants you

240
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,160
to be misled by the obsession
of being the best in the world?

241
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,480
Let go.

242
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,780
Reverend.

243
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,300
It's okay.

244
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,920
Why didn't you fight back?

245
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,920
Why didn't you fight back?

246
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,480
Reverend is sacrificing himself
to save you.

247
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,840
He just hopes

248
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,040
you can understand his intentions

249
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,640
and mend your ways.

250
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,040
If you won't kill him, I will.

251
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,840
Why do you want to save me?

252
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,360
Why do you want to save me?

253
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,800
Duan Zhixing,

254
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,680
why do you always stand in my way?

255
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,000
Although you weren't harmed by me,

256
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,440
it started because of me.

257
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,620
I've owed you

258
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,760
this for a long time.

259
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
If you kill Master Qiu now,

260
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,720
the Iron Palm Gang will never let you go.

261
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,040
And the martial world

262
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,900
will have another bloody storm.

263
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,600
I don't care about the Iron Palm Gang.

264
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,440
If they come, I'll kill them

265
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,360
one by one.

266
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,020
He ruined my life.

267
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,200
How do you account for this?

268
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,820
Zhou Botong.

269
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,560
You can't let him go.

270
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,640
Zhou Botong.

271
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,860
My stomach hurts.

272
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,410
I need to defecate.

273
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,260
Defecate.

274
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,000
You can't get rid of me again.

275
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,080
Their story can resume.

276
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,000
This is their fate.

277
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,680
Master Qiu.

278
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,460
As the poem goes,
"I have no home to say goodbye.

279
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,800
What can poor people do but sigh!"

280
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,100
Your master said

281
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,220
he was trying to save the Great Song

282
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,080
and the imperial court.

283
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,740
Actually

284
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,920
he was trying to save the common people.

285
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,400
It's truly admirable to have

286
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,880
such a loyal and righteous man
in the Great Song.

287
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,440
Save the common people.

288
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,060
Master.

289
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,500
Master wanted to save

290
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,800
the common people.

291
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,280
Good, good.

292
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,960
The sea of bitterness has no bounds,
and the shore is at hand.

293
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,220
If you rectify your errors

294
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,240
and turn over a new leaf,

295
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,240
it's not too late.

296
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
I am willing to follow you

297
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,700
to atone for my sins.

298
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,520
I hope you'll accept me.

299
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,140
Come.

300
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,280
From today,

301
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,400
your dharma name is Ci'en.

302
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,660
Follow me

303
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,080
to learn the Buddha's teachings.

304
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,060
This time, I came

305
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,120
to settle a grudge that has lasted
for more than twenty years.

306
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,460
Now that the grudge has been settled,

307
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,520
and my task is complete,

308
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,000
then

309
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,320
it's time for me to leave.

310
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,300
Take care, Reverend.

311
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,140
Take care.

312
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,960
(The Mongol troops
are about to attack the city.)

313
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,800
(To protect Xiangyang)

314
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,640
(and prevent the people from suffering,)

315
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,400
(I have to take a risk.)

316
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,260
(Ouyang Feng,)

317
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,320
(how did he end up in the Mongol camp?)

318
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,860
It's not right.

319
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,900
I'm going to ask again.

320
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,040
I practiced what you told me.

321
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,860
Why my Ren and Yangwei meridians

322
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,720
cannot be reversed?

323
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,000
Quickly translate all the texts for me.

324
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,040
If the time is not right,

325
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,600
it's useless to force it.

326
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,120
I teach you a sentence a day,

327
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,800
but you find it difficult to understand.

328
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,140
Even if I translate

329
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,980
all the texts to you,

330
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,640
what can you do?

331
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,880
The Nine Yin Manual is obscure
and difficult to understand.

332
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,200
If you don't have the patience,

333
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,360
you might as well kill me.

334
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,200
Do you want to provoke me again?

335
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,260
Mr. Ouyang.

336
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,220
Second Prince wants to see you.

337
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,060
Okay.

338
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,240
I got it.

339
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,420
Stinky girl.

340
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,720
I'll come back
and settle the score with you.

341
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,060
Rong.

342
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,420
Jing.

343
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,730
♪I step into the battlefield♪

344
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,720

♪Drinking alone in front of the window♪

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,560
Ouyang Feng told me

Genghis Khan beheaded you.

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,360
♪Seeing the world's various aspects♪

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,400

♪I may soar high, but I wander aimlessly♪

351
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,950
♪Perhaps this life is difficult♪

352
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,320
It's all my fault, Rong.

353
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,840
Starting from today,

354
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,240
I won't lose you again.

355
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,160
There's something wrong with me too.

356
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,320
I shouldn't have left in anger that day.

357
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,310
♪The mundane world
stirred up countless waves♪

358
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:39,300
♪No solace left to find♪

359
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,140
Rong, by the way,

360
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,540
how did Ouyang Feng

361
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,380
bring you here?

362
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,360
After I left angrily that day,

363
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,240
I heard from the general

364
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,420
that you did not propose

365
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,900
the reason for
breaking off the engagement,

366
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,640
so I regreted it.

367
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,190
I was originally thinking of
coming back to find you,

368
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,660
but I encountered Ouyang Feng

369
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,600
halfway here.

370
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,640
I could only try to shake him off.

371
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,360
I encountered quicksand on the way,

372
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,040
and then took off the mink coat,

373
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,400
and held it up with branches,

374
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,640
setting a trap in the quicksand.

375
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
But unexpectedly Ouyang Feng

376
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,920
managed to escape.

377
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,320
In the end, I was caught by him again.

378
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,840
It's all my fault.

379
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,200
He even lied to me,
saying he knew your whereabouts.

380
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,580
It was me

381
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,400
who rescued him from the quicksand.

382
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,720
I never thought I'd harm you.

383
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,680
Ouyang Feng is too cunning.

384
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,900
Did Old Venomous Creature

385
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,920
make things difficult for you?

386
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,480
He is only thinking about
obtaining the Nine Yin Manual.

387
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,760
So he served me
delicious food and drinks.

388
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,160
He was afraid that I might kill myself.

389
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,260
Do you still remember?

390
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,100
You wrote the words
of the Nine Yin Manual

391
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,200
backward for him,

392
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,440
so I went with it,

393
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,800
and had him practice it upside down.

394
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,200
Fortunately, you're clever.

395
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,900
Jing.

396
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,400
How come you are here?

397
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,460
Actually,

398
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,360
I am here to assassinate Great Khan.

399
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,800
Assassinate Great Khan?

400
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,640
If I kill him,

401
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,580
I can save a hundred thousand

402
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,560
people in Xiangyang City.

403
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,120
But even if our martial arts are high,

404
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,820
we cannot resist

405
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,080
a hundred thousand elite soldiers.

406
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,900
Not to mention

407
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,440
Ouyang Feng is still after us.

408
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,240
But they invaded the Central Plains

409
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,320
and killed our people.

410
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,680
As a Song person,

411
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,200
I will not sit by and do nothing.

412
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,580
Okay.

413
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,040
You can go if you want.

414
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,540
I'll accompany you.

415
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,060
But Rong,

416
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,740
this trip

417
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,700
will be extremely dangerous.

418
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,960
Even if you die, I won't live alone.

419
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,000
Mr. Ouyang.

420
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,080
Great Khan is indeed seriously ill.

421
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,640
At present,

422
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,080
he doesn't have much time left.

423
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,960
Before Great Khan fainted,

424
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,520
he ordered to abandon Xiangyang

425
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,200
and withdraw the troops.

426
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,540
He even asked Ögedei

427
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,520
and Tolui to come here.

428
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,800
The two of them should have arrived.

429
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,060
In that case,

430
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,680
you need to plan ahead, Your Highness.

431
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,000
Tonight,

432
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,040
I will admonish Father by force,

433
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,860
using the reason that the army
does not want to retreat,

434
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,600
and the Mongol soldiers
all hope to fight to the death

435
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,400
in Xiangyang.

436
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,000
Do you want to take such a risk?

437
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,000
There's no more time to wait.

438
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,940
Ögedei and Tolui

439
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,240
will definitely stop me.

440
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,920
Once a conflict arises,

441
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,440
I'll ask Mr. Ouyang to make a move

442
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,800
and kill

443
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,440
the two of them.

444
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,360
Okay.

445
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,960
Father is still resting.

446
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,960
What do you mean

447
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,940
by bringing so many people here?

448
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,500
We Mongol warriors

449
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,140
exchanged our lives on the battlefield

450
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,180
to get the upper hand in the war.

451
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,640
Why Father

452
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,300
wants Ögedei to turn back?

453
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,140
Ögedei.

454
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Do you have the right

455
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,920
to criticize Father's decision?

456
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,520
It is not Father's will,

457
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,400
but your intention, right?

458
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,020
Chagatai.

459
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,960
Father is seriously ill.

460
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,440
Are you planning a mutiny?

461
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,280
The war is imminent.

462
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,460
I have come to discuss with Father

463
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,360
about attacking Xiangyang.

464
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,580
And you

465
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,280
repeatedly tried to stop me.

466
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,820
Could it be that you

467
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,980
have colluded with the Songs

468
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,900
to poison Father?

469
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,080
Stop talking nonsense.

470
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,880
Without Father's order,

471
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,880
if you dare to take one step forward,

472
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,560
don't blame me for disregarding
our brotherhood.

473
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,740
Brothers,

474
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,560
did you hear it?

475
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,040
Father's life is uncertain,

476
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,000
but Tolui

477
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,160
delivered a false message of Father

478
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,300
and recalled the warriors

479
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,940
when the battle is around the corner,

480
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,120
disregarding the lives
of millions of warriors,

481
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,740
and abandoning the lands

482
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,160
that the Mongol warriors have conquered.

483
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,180
What do you think we should do?

484
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,020
Kill!

485
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,560
(How did this kid progress so rapidly?)

486
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,300
Old Venomous Creature.

487
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,080
If you want to learn the true essence
of the Nine Yin Manual,

488
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,460
just follow me.

489
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,420
Impossible.

490
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,640
Impossible.

491
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,540
I have immersed myself in martial arts

492
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,400
for decades,

493
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,120
how could I lose to you?

494
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,040
Isn't it just the Nine Yin Manual?

495
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,520
I know it too.

496
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,280
I finally mastered it.

497
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,160
I am the number one in the world!

498
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,160
I am the number one in the world now!

499
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,540
Ke.

500
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,980
Don't be afraid.

501
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,800
I've mastered the Nine Yin Manual.

502
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,200
I'm now the number one in the world!

503
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,800
No one will dare
to bully you in the future.

504
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,880
Who is your Ke?

505
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,600
You are not Ke.

506
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,420
Who are you?

507
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,700
Rong.

508
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,640
He is Hong Qigong.

509
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,280
Hong Qigong?

510
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,320
You promised to meet here for a duel.

511
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,140
Hong Qigong's
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms

512
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,980
have lost to you.

513
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,880
Now you are the second best in the world.

514
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,140
Second?

515
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,560
Then who is the best?

516
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,040
The number one in the world

517
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,240
is Ouyang Feng.

518
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,160
Ouyang Feng?

519
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,280
Ouyang Feng?

520
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,160
Not me.

521
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,320
Then who am I?

522
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,700
Where is he?

523
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,240
I want to fight him.

524
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,600
He is behind you.

525
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,480
Good skills.

526
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,820
Again.

527
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,520
I didn't expect Old Venomous Creature

528
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,680
reserved all his meridians

529
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,620
but finally mastered

530
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,800
the Nine Yin Manual.

531
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,060
It's a pity

532
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,160
that he's lost his mind
because his blood is running backward.

533
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,560
Must be crazy.

534
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,980
Ouyang Feng was once

535
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,960
a martial arts genius.

536
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,360
If the Duel atop Mount Hua is held now,

537
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,480
perhaps no one could defeat him

538
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,040
and he could become
the number one in the world.

539
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,880
But what's the point

540
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,080
of getting it now?

541
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,580
Tolui.

542
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,780
Guo Jing.

543
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,700
Are you okay?

544
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,580
Guo Jing.

545
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,320
This is a matter between us brothers.

546
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,660
Stay out of it.

547
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,100
I won't interfere

548
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,560
in your family affairs.

549
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,120
I just want to make sure

550
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,760
if it's true that Great Khan
wants to withdraw

551
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,780
the troops from Xiangyang.

552
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,200
You have betrayed the grassland.

553
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,120
Father is not someone
you can meet at will.

554
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,040
Let Guo Jing in.

555
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,600
Father, you woke up.

556
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,000
Great Khan woke up.

557
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,080
Father, don't.

558
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,640
Guo Jing is no longer one of us.

559
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,120
If he harbors any ill intentions,

560
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,360
it will be difficult for me
to protect you.

561
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,400
Who dares to defy my order?

562
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,040
Yes, Great Khan.

563
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,920
Yes, Great Khan.

564
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,320
Leave us.

565
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,000
Do you still hate me

566
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,480
for killing your mother?

567
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,820
Jing.

568
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,400
I watched you grow up

569
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,280
and treated you as my own child.

570
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,080
I have always thought,

571
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,200
if I had married Huazheng to you,

572
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,960
we would have been a real family.

573
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,180
Come over.

574
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,640
Come to me.

575
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,380
Later,

576
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,840
I figured it out.

577
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,200
You are one of the Hans.

578
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,600
If you can't become a Mongolian,

579
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,400
you will naturally be loyal
to Great Song.

580
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,080
I can't force you over it.

581
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,040
Since I

582
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,440
treat you as my son,

583
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,200
I don't need to care if you are a Han

584
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,040
or a Mongolian.

585
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,880
Our relationship

586
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,560
has been deeply rooted.

587
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,040
I know the purpose of your visit.

588
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,840
Actually, it doesn't matter

589
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,160
if you act or not.

590
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,220
Great Khan.

591
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,400
So about the troops in Xiangyang,

592
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,100
should you...

593
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,140
If

594
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,560
we Mongols

595
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,360
are determined to attack Xiangyang,

596
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,960
how will you choose?

597
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,420
Then I

598
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,640
will live or die with Xiangyang.

599
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,240
Jing.

600
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,380
I really don't want to see

601
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,940
you meet with Tolui

602
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,080
on the battlefield.

603
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,560
Today,

604
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,560
it's the struggle between them.

605
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,920
Actually, you can

606
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,040
watch them fight

607
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,720
or await an opportunity

608
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,200
to kill them.

609
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,440
But you did not do so.

610
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,640
A gentleman

611
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,840
only seeks to be upright and honest

612
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,420
and have a clear conscience.

613
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,760
Whether it is in the Great Song

614
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,920
or on the grassland,

615
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,040
you are still so righteous

616
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,320
as you were before.

617
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,920
I was right about you.

618
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,840
You've been fighting for years.

619
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,460
Great Khan.

620
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,600
Have you ever thought

621
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,040
your great achievements

622
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,840
were exchanged by those dead people

623
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,300
and the tears of many orphans

624
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,140
and widows?

625
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,960
One general achieves renown over
the dead bodies of ten thousand soldiers.

626
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,200
It's true to all the heroes.

627
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,720
The heroes of the world

628
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,500
who are admired by both the past

629
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,400
and the future generations

630
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,360
must be the ones who benefit the people

631
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,640
and love the people.

632
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,200
In my opinion,

633
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,920
those who've killed many people

634
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,720
are not necessarily heroes.

635
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,480
I have dominated the world

636
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,000
and killed countless enemies,

637
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,200
but I'm not considered a hero.

638
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,240
Then you tell me,

639
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,160
what does it take to be a hero?

640
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,100
Jing.

641
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,420
Is it true that
the Mongol troops withdrew?

642
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,440
Only temporarily.

643
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,960
Great Khan died,

644
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,880
and there will be a new Khan.

645
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,520
This time we resisted
the southern invasion of the Mongols,

646
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,120
but can we resist the next one?

647
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,040
I don't know if we can.

648
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,860
But

649
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,600
someone has to do this.

650
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,420
Okay.

651
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,680
I will definitely accompany you then.

652
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,800
But now you have to come with me.

653
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,660
Where to?

654
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,360
To Mount Hua, of course.

655
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,140
It's time to honor the 25-year agreement

656
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,980
of the duel.

657
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,040
Let's go see the fun.

658
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,180

Why is no one here?

666
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,080
Could it be that we got the date wrong?

667
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,240
How could I possibly get the date wrong?

The date is not wrong.

671
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,360
Your father left earlier than me

672
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,840
but still hasn't arrived yet.

673
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,100
Tell me,

674
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,480
why is he in such a hurry?

675
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,120
Speaking ill behind my back.

676
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,020
Old Beggar.

677
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,220
Aren't you ashamed?

678
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,980
Dad.

679
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,620
Master Huang.

680
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,980
Dad.

681
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,520
Jing has been looking for me all the way

682
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,840
and suffered a lot.

No.

687
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,860
Zhixing became a monk.

688
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,960
I shouldn't have come today.

689
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,350
Old Venomous Creature is obsessed

690
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,100
with being the number one
martial artist in the world.

691
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,140
He still hasn't shown up.

692
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,160
This shouldn't be.

693
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,640
I'm afraid he won't come.

694
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,100
Why?

695
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,560
Do you admit defeat?

696
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,640
We've been fighting
for three days and three nights.

697
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,760
You're not that good as I think.

698
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,840
Didn't gain any advantage.

699
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,120
If you don't admit it,

700
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,960
let's try again.

701
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,600
You are Ouyang Feng.

702
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,960
Then who am I?

703
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,000
Old Venomous Creature was a grandmaster.

704
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,760
But he ended up like this.

705
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,580
What a pity.

706
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,680
He deserved it.

707
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,160
What's there to be pitiful?

708
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,680
Southern Emperor has retired,

709
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,520
Western Venom has not arrived,

710
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,760
so at this duel,

711
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,160
only the two of us old guys are here.

712
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,360
Feeling a bit lonely.

713
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,760
What's your plan, Qigong?

714
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,400
Isn't Jing also here?

715
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,660
Rong.

716
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,660
No.

717
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,360
I still lack experience,

718
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,960
how dare I compete with the two seniors?

719
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,120
Heroes always come out of early youth.

720
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,520
What do you have to fear?

721
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,600
Rong is right.

722
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,520
This is getting interesting.

723
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,060
Jing.

724
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,060
Let's do it.

725
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,540
We are comparing martial arts skills,

726
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,560
not age.

727
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,000
Let me see

728
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,280
whether I can beat you now.

729
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,540
Master.

730
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,240
Since your master has said so,

731
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,540
Jing,

732
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,480
you shouldn't refuse anymore.

733
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,040
Okay, Master Huang.

734
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,700
Still calling him Master Huang?

735
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,540
Silly boy.

736
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,620
Call him Father-in-law.

737
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,020
Father-in-law.

738
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,120
There are only three of us.

739
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,400
After much consideration,

740
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,680
one of us will have
to fight continuously.

741
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,400
It's not fair.

742
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,980
Dad.

743
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,820
Master.

744
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,240
Jing is young and strong.

745
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,540
He's fighting the two of you

746
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,480
and he won't take any advantage.

747
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,620
Jing.

748
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,740
Is that possible?

749
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,880
- I...
- Dad.

750
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,040
There is one more thing
I need to make clear.

751
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,460
If the two of you

752
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,980
can't defeat Jing

753
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,920
within 300 moves,

754
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,220
what should we do then?

755
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,760
Your daughter hasn't married him yet,

756
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,440
but she's already taking his side.

757
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,800
She only wants Jing

758
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,520
to become the number one
martial artist in the world.

759
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,800
If the two of us old guys

760
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,240
can't defeat

761
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,900
this kid

762
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,960
within three hundred moves,

763
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,800
we don't need to

764
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,120
come to the top of Mount Hua again.

765
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,080
Okay, come on.

766
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,220
Please.

767
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,100
Are you ready?

768
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,500
Start.

769
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,180
In the end,

770
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,340
Huang Rong and Guo Jing

771
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,720
got together after all

772
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,920
(Eight years later)
and helped the Song army defend the city.

773
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,980
This is the story of Guo Jing,

774
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,220
the hero of Xiangyang.

775
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,540
The legend of heroes

776
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,080
has just begun.

777
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,100
Keep going.

778
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,220
I want to hear more.

779
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,240
- Me too.
- Me too.

780
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,280
Where did Huang Rong and Guo Jing go?

781
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,900
Did they go to Peach Blossom Island?

782
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,260
When I grow up,
I want to become a hero like Guo Jing.

783
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,460
You are a wild child without a father.

784
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,300
You want to become a hero?

785
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,860
Doesn't Guo Jing also have no father?

786
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,880
Why can't I become a hero?

787
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,480
But he has a good mother.

788
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,740
Guo Jing's mother

789
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,920
is not just a widow from a village.

790
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,720
Do you know who your father is?

791
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,180
He doesn't even know who his father is.

792
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,660
You definitely can't answer that.

793
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,720
- So silly.
- Guo.

794
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,360
Go home for dinner.

795
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,260
