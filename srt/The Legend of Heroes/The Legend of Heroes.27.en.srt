1
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,680
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 27=

3
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm from Jiaxing.

4
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,620
I was quite familiar with the owner

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,780
of Zuixian Restaurant.

6
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,700
He inadvertently revealed

7
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,800
that due to frequent interactions

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
with martial artists,

9
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,930
the clientele was quite mixed.

10
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,780
To prevent any incidents,

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,350
he dug a secret passage

12
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,820
from the kitchen to the outside.

13
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,180
Master, what's wrong?

14
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,260
Since everyone has escaped safely,

15
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,060
you may all go your own way.

16
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,030
Brother Ke,

17
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,260
our Quanzhen School

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,770
is deeply grateful for your kindness.

19
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,190
My fellows

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,570
and I will go visit you

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,140
to express our thanks.

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,590
Senior Zhou.

23
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm so glad

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,100
to see

25
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,670
you're still alive.

26
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,510
Senior,

27
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,610
please come back with us.

28
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,260
If you don't want to go back,

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,730
please take care.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,240
You should be careful.

31
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,350
If you don't go,

32
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,040
the soldiers will catch up.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,260
Go. Go. Go.

34
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,910
See you.

35
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,440
No need for formalities.

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,450
- Chief Hong, see you.
- Go. Go. Go.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
Take care.

38
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,030
Let's go.

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,700
Go. Go. Go.

40
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,350
Ke Zhen'e.

41
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,980
Back on Peach Blossom Island...

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
Never mind.

43
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,790
In the martial world,

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,170
nothing is ever resolved.

45
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,140
Just let them be.

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,560
Qigong.

47
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,380
Come with me

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,660
to recuperate.

49
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,630
Okay.

50
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,720
Rong.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,880
Are you coming?

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,730
Rong. Jing.

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,400
I'll be with Old Heretic Huang.

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,290
Don't worry.

55
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,420
No one will trouble me.

56
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,000
- Don't worry.
- Go.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
Take care, Master.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,140
- Okay. You find a safe place to stay.
- Go. Go. Go.

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,170
Let's go, Master.

60
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,750
Brother Guo.

61
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,570
Please wait.

62
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,830
Yang Kang?

63
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,860
I'll ask you one last time.

64
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,260
Can't you give me

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,620
the Book of Wumu?

66
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Absolutely not.

67
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,620
Do we really have to

68
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,890
fight each other, brother?

69
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,260
You take the book and go.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,450
No. Master.

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,530
I can't leave you behind.

72
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,090
Both of you will die.

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,330
Let's make it simple.

74
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,770
Qiu Qianren?

75
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,380
Don't be courteous to Hero Ke.

76
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,830
Stop!

77
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Don't hurt my master!

78
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,680
Stop!

79
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,510
Brother Guo.

80
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,860
I only want the Book of Wumu.

81
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Jing.

82
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,180
Don't mind me. I'm just an old blind.

83
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,990
You can't give them

84
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,890
the Book of Wumu.

85
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,970
Master.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,010
Then don't blame me.

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,650
Yang Kang, stop!

88
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,700
I'll give it to you.

89
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,310
Jing.

90
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,700
Jing, you can't give it...

91
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,150
Master,

92
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,940
you are the only one alive

93
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,500
among Seven Heroes of Jiangnan.

94
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,570
I should protect you.

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,860
(Vital Information Against the Jins)

96
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,770
Let him go.

97
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,620
How dare you rob my brother!

98
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,510
Rong.

99
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,190
Master!

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
Old Imp.

101
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,430
He is the one bullied Yinggu

102
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,270
and...

103
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,890
And he made Yinggu turn into this.

104
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,490
How dare you bully Yinggu!

105
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,520
How dare you bully Yinggu!

106
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,380
I'll kill you!

107
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,200
Again! Again!

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,740
(Duel atop Mount Hua is around the corner.)

109
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,110
(I should stop to save my energy.)

110
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,970
Come here. Let's fight. Again. Again.

111
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't run!

112
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,510
Go get him!

113
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,820
(Iron Spear Temple)

114
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,450
It weighs about 30 catties.

115
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
You can use this iron spear

116
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,820
as your iron staff.

117
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,400
This is Sanchi Shark Gall Powder

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
made by my father.

119
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,890
It's good for your wounds.

120
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,570
I know you hate us.

121
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,940
It's your call.

122
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,930
Today,

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,500
you helped me walk so far.

124
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,500
Rest early.

125
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,740
You finally talk nice.

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,410
On war-torn land streams flow
and mountains stand;

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,290
In vernal town grass and weeds are o'ergrown.

128
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,170
Grieved o'er the years,
flowers make us shed tears;

129
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,460
Hating to part, hearing birds breaks our heat.

130
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,590
Who can lift this iron spear

131
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,220
will be our big brother!

132
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,290
Big brother! Big brother!

133
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,040
(This demoness)

134
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,740
(repeatedly saved my life.)

135
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,190
(But my brothers)

136
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,810
(were indeed killed by her father.)

137
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,100
(I will kill her)

138
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,040
(and let Old Heretic Huang feel)

139
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,770
(the pain of losing a loved one.)

140
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,010
(Then I'll kill myself by her side)

141
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,100
(to repay today's debt.)

142
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
Your Royal Highness.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,050
Watch your step.

144
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,600
It's the Jins.

145
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,050
Let's hide first.

146
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,790
Father.

147
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,430
This is the only place

148
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,740
we can have a rest nearby.

149
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,270
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,290
We've all had a hard day.

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,340
Let's rest here tonight.

152
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,580
We'll look for Guo Jing tomorrow.

153
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,530
It's my fault for not being skilled enough

154
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,170
to catch him.

155
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,500
You've done your best.

156
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,040
Shagu is hungry.

157
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,910
Grandpa Beard,

158
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
didn't you say you'd take me

159
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,530
to eat something good?

160
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,290
Call me uncle.

161
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,430
- Uncle.
- It's yours.

162
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,670
Greetings, Master.

163
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,620
Mr. Ouyang,

164
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,100
you left at a critical moment

165
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,890
to find this silly girl.

166
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,470
Didn't you put the cart before the horse?

167
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,710
Fighting them at Zuixian Restaurant

168
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,050
is like catching turtles in a jar.

169
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,170
But you didn't catch any of them.

170
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,050
How dare you talk to me like that.

171
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,530
Without her,

172
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,480
we wouldn't lose

173
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
our leverage.

174
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
I don't understand.

175
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,050
Please be direct.

176
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
This girl

177
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,310
is the orphan of Qu Lingfeng,

178
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,530
Huang Yaoshi's favorite apprentice.

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,830
Huang Yaoshi has transferred all his guilt

180
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,830
towards Qu Lingfeng

181
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,620
onto this girl.

182
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,690
In this world, besides Huang Rong,

183
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,010
Huang Yaoshi cares this girl the most.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,140
But keeping her,

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,790
I'm worried she might...

186
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,630
With her,

187
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,010
we can control Huang Yaoshi.

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,280
Then it will be easier to deal with

189
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,460
Hong Qigong and Guo Jing.

190
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,290
Master, you're so wise.

191
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,580
I've been short-sighted.

192
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,430
I don't want to stay here.

193
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,530
There is a ghost.

194
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,310
We have so many people around.

195
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,220
How can there be a ghost?

196
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,690
It's the ghost from Peach Blossom Island.

197
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,640
Come to claim your life.

198
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,000
If you don't behave,

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,860
I'll have Huang Yaoshi take you back!

200
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,380
No calligraphy.

201
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,140
I don't want to practise calligraphy.

202
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,150
Come out.

203
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,690
No calligraphy.

204
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,690
Uncle Ouyang,

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
hello.

206
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,410
Niece Rong?

207
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,340
What are you doing here?

208
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,190
My father sent me here

209
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,810
to wait for you.

210
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,790
I've waited so long

211
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,650
so I fell asleep.

212
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,140
If it weren't for Shagu's noise,

213
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,860
I would've made a big mistake.

214
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,340
Your father sent you for me?

215
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,650
Why?

216
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,480
He's trapped at Xiaopenglai

217
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,930
in Xincheng Town by the Taoists

218
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,080
from Quanzhen School.

219
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,340
If you don't go to save him,

220
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,690
he won't get over this.

221
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
I still have a score

222
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,100
to settle with him.

223
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,710
He's been trapped.

224
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,770
What does this have to do with me?

225
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,030
Uncle Ouyang.

226
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,640
That's not fair

227
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,770
of you to say that.

228
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,710
You killed Tan Chuduan

229
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,550
from Quanzhen School.

230
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,000
Now those Taoists are

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,170
messing with my father.

232
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,670
My father never likes

233
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,580
to explain himself.

234
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,690
Shouldn't you go help him?

235
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,790
Your father is skilled.

236
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,260
Those Quanzhen Taoists

237
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,770
won't be a problem.

238
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,670
But Old Imp is there

239
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,010
causing trouble.

240
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,690
My father can't handle him.

241
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
But he expected

242
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,240
you wouldn't go,

243
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,170
so he wanted to tell you

244
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,380
that he had figured out the weird characters

245
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,070
in the Nine Yin Manual

246
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,100
after seven days and nights of thinking.

247
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,080
Niece Rong.

248
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,890
You can't lie to me.

249
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,410
Sometimes you feel cold and feverish.

250
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,500
Sometimes you feel joyful and restless.

251
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,930
Sometimes it feels like
something evil is touching you,

252
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,890
and your hair stands on end.

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,690
Sometimes you feel drunk with great joy.

254
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,890
For all these conditions,

255
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,290
you must follow this method
to guide the power.

256
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,790
Master.

257
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,650
She always talk nonsense.

258
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,120
You must be cautious.

259
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,650
What does it say next?

260
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,640
As for the next,

261
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,830
it depends on whether Uncle Ouyang

262
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,640
wants the 5,000 characters

263
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,170
of the scripture or just 3,000.

264
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,360
What do you mean?

265
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,220
If you save my father,

266
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,310
I'll recite the complete 5,000 characters

267
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,980
of the scripture for you.

268
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,500
What if I don't?

269
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,620
Then you should avenge my father.

270
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,280
After you kill Zhou Botong

271
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,340
and Six Immortals of Quanzhen,

272
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,340
I'll recite 3,000 characters for you.

273
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,530
Your father think too highly of me.

274
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,740
Uncle Ouyang, with your wisdom,

275
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,380
how can you not see that?

276
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,050
Your nephew

277
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,290
was killed by

278
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,220
a direct apprentice of Quanzhen School.

279
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,580
Shouldn't you avenge him?

280
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,980
What else did your father say?

281
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,400
My father said

282
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,980
that you and he hit it off.

283
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,010
And you once wanted your nephew to marry me.

284
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,650
Firstly, he wants to give you this favor.

285
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,880
And secondly, he wishes

286
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,590
that after you master

287
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,690
this divine skill,

288
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,140
you can teach me.

289
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,950
Once I master it,

290
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,290
I'll teach you?

291
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,740
Yaoshi is shrewd.

292
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,100
So, I have to go to save him anyway.

293
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,740
Now I want to have a rest.

294
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,810
And I will go to save him tomorrow.

295
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,170
Saving people is like fighting a fire.

296
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,460
We can't go to save him tomorrow.

297
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,650
Avenging him doesn't have to be rushed either.

298
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,410
I'm afraid I'll be killed

299
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,290
by these villains before tomorrow.

300
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,150
Will she?

301
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,580
We'll follow your lead.

302
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,690
Can you rest assured now?

303
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,510
Yes, I can.

304
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,790
Right.

305
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,880
Where is Shagu?

306
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,340
Shagu?

307
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,880
Aunt Rong!

308
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,200
Grandpa Huang took you back

309
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,040
to Peach Blossom Island.

310
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,250
What are you doing here?

311
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,920
I don't want to stay with Grandpa Huang.

312
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,970
I want to go to my home.

313
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,970
These bad people said

314
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,580
they would take me to eat something delicious.

315
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
But they haven't given me

316
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,930
anything to eat along the way.

317
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,280
Did they take you off

318
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,120
the Peach Blossom Island?

319
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,730
This good brother did.

320
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,790
He told me that if I behaved,

321
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,340
he would take me home.

322
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,120
Yes.

323
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,190
Shagu.

324
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,580
You should be good,

325
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,170
or Grandpa Huang will come and hit you.

326
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,520
Ouch! Ouch!

327
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,820
Aunt Rong, save me!

328
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,730
Aunt Rong, save me!

329
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,910
Shagu, don't be afraid.

330
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,390
I'm here with you.

331
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,930
These bad people won't hurt you.

332
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
Let me ask you.

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,070
Did Grandpa Huang know

334
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,910
that you left the island?

335
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,920
Don't tell Grandpa.

336
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,780
Alright, I won't tell.

337
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,650
I didn't practise calligraphy well

338
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,210
and I wanted to go home.

339
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,580
Grandpa got more angry.

340
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,580
Later...

341
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,830
Later, the mute handed over

342
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,820
a note.

343
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,000
Grandpa said I could stop

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,780
and asked me greet the guest.

345
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,380
Greet them?

346
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,830
No. No.

347
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,300
It was a short, fat man.

348
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,990
Huang Rong,

349
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,650
do you want to save your father?

350
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,680
Shouldn't you rest early

351
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,780
to leave tomorrow?

352
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,910
What?

353
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,040
Is it bothering you

354
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,070
for my niece and me

355
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,060
to chat about family matters?

356
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,620
If you can't stand that,

357
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,970
come and hit me.

358
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,690
Will I be afraid of you?

359
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,860
Let them continue.

360
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,360
Master,

361
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,780
if they continue,

362
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,890
- I'm afraid...
- Afraid of what?

363
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,450
I want to hear that.

364
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,430
Niece Rong,

365
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,630
you can ask

366
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,450
whatever you want.

367
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,120
See?

368
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,320
Shagu,

369
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,730
what happened after you greeted the guests?

370
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,100
After greeted the guests...

371
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,140
Right.

372
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,210
That person had a bigger temper than Grandpa.

373
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,890
We brothers

374
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,680
came all the way here

375
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
with good intentions

376
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,690
to be peacemakers.

377
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,410
But good for you.

378
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,300
We've looked for you everywhere.

379
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,020
I really appreciate that.

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,890
But it would

381
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,620
have been better if you didn't come.

382
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,210
I had no intention

383
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,350
to make you waste your efforts

384
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,410
with those Taoists.

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,250
But Brother Zhu's letter

386
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,300
was sincere.

387
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,620
And Guo Jing

388
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,780
is a fool.

389
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,860
If someone maliciously

390
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,830
tried to sow discord between him

391
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,210
and my silly daughter,

392
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,890
I'm worried

393
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,970
that my silly daughter

394
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,930
would cry and seek death again.

395
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,060
So, Master Huang,

396
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,540
you agree with us?

397
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,380
Since you're here,

398
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,340
please stay.

399
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,040
I'll go.

400
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,730
I'll go to

401
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,490
find my silly daughter.

402
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,820
Please stay on Peach Blossom Island.

403
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,540
And someone will serve you well.

404
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
Shagu.

405
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,020
When those Taoists arrive,

406
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,970
you bring them all up.

407
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,410
Got it.

408
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,780
When did Grandpa come back?

409
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,350
After Grandpa went out,

410
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,620
he didn't come back.

411
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,690
But Grandpa was not there,

412
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,310
how could you bring these people

413
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,300
to Peach Blossom Island

414
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,300
without his consent?

415
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,110
If he finds out,

416
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,170
he'll spank you.

417
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,100
I had his consent.

418
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,890
That day,

419
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,970
after Grandpa went out on the boat,

420
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,300
I saw them coming up.

421
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,250
I followed them all the way secretly.

422
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,450
That wouldn't be wrong.

423
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,280
Master,

424
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,720
how about I try again?

425
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,560
Okay.

426
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,040
Master.

427
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,020
Yaoshi's map is useless!

428
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,880
Who is it?

429
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,280
Come out.

430
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,170
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

431
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,410
I'll practise calligraphy.

432
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,490
Don't play the fool.

433
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,300
Or I won't be merciful.

434
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,820
I think

435
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,860
I saw you.

436
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,450
Where did you see me?

437
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,890
At Qu San's Tavern?

438
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,650
I remember.

439
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,860
I saw you there too.

440
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,560
Good Shagu.

441
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,620
Since you remember me,

442
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,060
then be good

443
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,250
and take us to find Grandpa Huang, okay?

444
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,170
Grandpa Huang went out.

445
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,970
He left a few...

446
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,470
A few...

447
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,690
A few...

448
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,860
Three, four, five...

449
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,480
He left six weirdos here

450
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,320
as guests.

451
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,630
I see.

452
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,310
Are you the Taoists

453
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,060
Grandpa mentioned?

454
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,620
You must be them.

455
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,140
Follow me.

456
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,450
The guests are waiting for you.

457
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,280
Aunt Rong, taking them up

458
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,890
is Grandpa's intention, right?

459
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,210
So did

460
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,340
these people make you bring

461
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,580
the guests to Grandma's tomb?

462
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,950
Aunt Rong,

463
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,520
how did you know?

464
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,360
Exactly.

465
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,300
How did you know?

466
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,540
When I first saw it,

467
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,240
I almost believe that my father

468
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,650
had killed Five Freaks of Jiangnan.

469
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,380
But I remembered one thing

470
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,970
that made me realize it wasn't true.

471
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,630
My father

472
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,920
wouldn't leave

473
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,210
those men's bodies

474
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,060
in my mother's tomb.

475
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,760
That makes sense.

476
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,860
Keep going.

477
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,390
So,

478
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,760
that day,

479
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,240
it was you who asked Shagu

480
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,730
to bring the Six Freaks of Jiangnan

481
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,300
to my mother's tomb

482
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,020
and switched things around, right?

483
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,450
Seven Immortals of Quanzhen
want to meet us here.

484
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,730
That's odd.

485
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,020
Old Heretic Huang loves his wife dearly.

486
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,200
How could he allow outsiders

487
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,890
to have a meeting here?

488
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,690
I'm not sure about that.

489
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Big brother.

490
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,480
That silly girl wouldn't
play tricks on us, right?

491
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,820
Don't be paranoid.

492
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,110
You know why people call Huang Yaoshi

493
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,950
Old Heretic Huang?

494
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,720
It's just because his thinking

495
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,560
is unconventional.

496
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,440
So this

497
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,540
must be his arrangement.

498
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,190
Master Huang.

499
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,580
You didn't leave the island?

500
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,450
You evil man! I'll beat you to death!

501
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,710
Master.

502
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,300
Only one blind survivor here.

503
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,860
We can use him to spread the word.

504
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,170
Huang Yaoshi will never clear his name.

505
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,690
You knew you couldn't defeat my father,

506
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,450
so you killed the five of them,

507
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,540
making Ke Zhen'e mistakenly believe

508
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,580
that the killer was my father.

509
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,730
You let him spread the word

510
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,580
so that heroes of the martial world

511
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,490
will unite against my father.

512
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,250
In this way, you avenged Ouyang Ke

513
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,860
and eliminated a rival.

514
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,060
What a brilliant strategy,

515
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,410
achieving two goals at once.

516
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,540
You're almost correct.

517
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,340
But it wasn't my idea.

518
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,730
It was his.

519
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,390
Impressive.

520
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,490
So impressive.

521
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,000
Only a truly malicious person

522
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,250
could think of this.

523
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,020
However, you didn't expect

524
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,960
both of Second Master

525
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,480
and Fourth Master

526
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,650
to leave clues before they died.

527
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,540
They left clues?

528
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,380
A horizontal and a vertical stroke.

529
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,280
Jing initially thought

530
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,890
it was the character "Huang",

531
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,140
but now it seems

532
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,780
it could also be

533
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,340
the character "Yang".

534
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,380
What a wild guess.

535
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,760
Have you been

536
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,730
(Spouse)
looking for this?

537
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,310
I knew every single piece

538
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,410
of the treasures in Mother's tomb.

539
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,830
But I've never seen

540
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,020
this jade shoe pendant.

541
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,930
And Second Master

542
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,930
clutched it tightly before dying.

543
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,300
So there must be a reason.

544
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,690
I just didn't unerstand

545
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,860
(Duel/ Spouse)
what's the meaning of "duel" and "spouse".

546
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,020
Then I remembered.

547
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,380
When I first met Sister Mu,

548
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,490
she was a living as a performer in Zhongdu.

549
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,170
And there was a flag saying
"Martial Duel for a Spouse".

550
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,650
Then I realized

551
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,100
this is a token of love.

552
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,620
Jade shoes

553
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,730
comes in pairs.

554
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,830
This one has

555
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,780
"duel" and "spouse" on it.

556
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,440
The other one

557
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,060
must have the other words.

558
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,890
Young prince,

559
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,820
am I right?

560
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,450
I told you to let go of her.

561
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,210
Now you are caught with evidence.

562
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,490
I now realize my mistake.

563
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,550
You has never

564
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,970
realized your mistake.

565
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,490
Although Second Master
wasn't as skilled as you,

566
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,590
his title of Marvellous-Handed Scholar

567
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,730
was well-deserved.

568
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,780
Before dying, he used his marvellous hand

569
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,780
to take this token from you.

570
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,890
That can be considered

571
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,300
the last word he left.

572
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,860
Yaoshi has a good daughter.

573
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,580
Though the events

574
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,380
are complicated,

575
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,490
you guessed them all correctly

576
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,780
as if you saw them all.

577
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,150
Niece Rong.

578
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,140
You are truly clever.

579
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,990
What's that?

580
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,150
Ghosts!

581
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,860
Shagu, why do you want to go home?

582
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,480
People died in your home. It's haunted.

583
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,320
Remember?

584
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,250
Someone killed a limping ghost at home.

585
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,250
Aunt Rong, save me.

586
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,300
Aunt Rong, save me.

587
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,540
Young Prince, why are you excited?

588
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,520
Right.

589
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,170
Your master is Qiu Chuji.

590
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,830
So you are a direct apprentice

591
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,690
of Quanzhen School.

592
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,390
Uncle Ouyang.

593
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,140
Don't mistake the person

594
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,730
who killed your nephew.

595
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,430
Master.

596
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,340
Huang Rong is in our hands.

597
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,540
There's no need to keep this troublemaker!

598
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,800
Your Highness!

599
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,380
Tell me.

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,140
Who killed that limping ghost?

601
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,760
Shagu.

602
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,550
When you met Grandpa Ouyang that day,

603
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,760
you said a good brother

604
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,690
killed someone at your home.

605
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,170
Who did he kill?

606
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,650
Don't be afraid.

607
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,360
Say it.

608
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,760
Could it be that you killed

609
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,300
that limping young master?

610
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,960
Now he comes to take your life?

611
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,350
Not me, not me.

612
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,210
That limping ghost... Not me.

613
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,620
Good brother killed him with an iron spear.

614
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,560
Shagu!

615
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,060
You can't talk nonsense!

616
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,960
Did Huang Rong tell you to say this?

617
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,450
No. Good brother.

618
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,650
I saw that clearly.

619
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,230
Mr. Ouyang!

620
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,490
This girl is insane and silly.

621
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,340
How can you believe her?

622
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,150
Mr. Ouyang Ke is a rare talent.

623
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,690
Kang and I value him.

624
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,480
How could Kang kill him

625
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,550
for no reason?

626
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,650
Did you kill Ke?

627
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,430
Shagu,

628
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,040
that young master

629
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,450
was holding a girl that day.

630
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,410
Do you remember who the girl was?

631
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,310
Yes. I remember.

632
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,380
She's... She's good brother's wife!

633
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,930
Huang Rong!

634
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,170
You made these things up!

635
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,430
Master.

636
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,620
We can't fall for her divisive scheme!

637
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,540
I don't know why.

638
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,550
But when I was in Niujia Village,

639
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,280
I overheard a man and a woman next door

640
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,300
say something

641
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,860
that I didn't understand.

642
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,590
Young Prince, how about

643
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,540
I tell you word for word?

644
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,890
Say it!

645
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,140
I only heard the man say...

646
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,250
They saw me kill Ouyang Ke.

647
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,170
I need to silence them.

648
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,300
They are victims of Ouyang Ke.

649
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,760
They won't sell us out.

650
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,970
I doubt that.

651
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,550
If Ouyang Feng

652
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,820
captures them,

653
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,540
they'll spill everything

654
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,410
to save themselves.

655
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,780
If we want to be peaceful in the future,

656
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,110
we must silence them.

657
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,950
Kang.

658
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,040
I don't want you to kill anymore.

659
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,100
But if I don't kill them,

660
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,650
others will kill us.

661
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,280
Not everyone in the world

662
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,340
is bad.

663
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,950
Young Prince,

664
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,690
do you remember these words?

665
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,710
I know

666
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,380
you love Sister Mu the most.

667
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,380
To protect her chastity,

668
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,410
you killed the young venomous creature.

669
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,490
I indeed admire that.

670
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,930
But what a pity.

671
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,650
You made such a big decision,

672
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,820
so you must have had a motive.

673
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,790
Guo Jing, Huang Yaoshi and you

674
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,300
killed Mr. Ouyang Ke!

675
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,450
Now you are here to slander me!

676
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,340
Why would I slander you?

677
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,170
Let's think about it.

678
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,300
Who benefits most from killing Ouyang Ke?

679
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,360
Everyone knows,

680
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,100
Mount White Camel has a rule

681
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,060
that one can only have one apprentice.

682
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,820
After Ouyang Ke died,

683
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,170
whom will you take on as your apprentice?

684
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,590
- Kang?
- Your Highness!

685
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,600
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

686
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,170
Why are you so excited?

687
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,720
Do you forget I have the Soft Hedgehog Armor?

688
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,650
You demoness!

689
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,310
If you lie to me,

690
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,960
I'll make you wish you were dead.

691
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,250
If I lie even a bit,

692
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,200
may I die from

693
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,250
Mr. Ouyang's poison.

694
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,110
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

695
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,230
Your Highness, what's wrong?

696
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,170
Your Highness.

697
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,320
Your Highness?

698
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,590
What's wrong?

699
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,160
Master.

700
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,140
You poisoned me?

701
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,810
Master, don't believe her.

702
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,200
Master.

703
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,200
Give me the antidote.

704
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,590
Save me...

705
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,640
I see.

706
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,720
This is your retribution.

707
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,330
You killed Five Freaks of Jiangnan,

708
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,690
and now you've been poisoned
by Nan Xiren's blood.

709
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,250
Don't you deserve this?

710
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,330
You indeed got my snake poison.

711
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,360
I wanted you to

712
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,330
feel this yourself.

713
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,810
- Kang!
- Your Highness!

714
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,020
Stay away from him!

715
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,880
Kang!

716
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,240
Kang!

717
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,900
My snake poison

718
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,270
spreads tenfold,

719
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,330
and a hundredfold.

720
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,540
If scratched by a poisoned person,

721
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,170
you'll be infected.

722
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,850
It spreads endlessly.

723
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,160
Mr. Ouyang!

724
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,730
Mr. Ouyang!

725
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,630
I know Kang has committed

726
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,620
a great sin.

727
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,070
But I beg you. Save him.

728
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,230
If you save him,

729
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,710
our entire Jin

730
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,070
will be grateful for your great kindness!

731
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,500
Your son's life is precious.

732
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,580
Does my nephew deserve to die in vain?

733
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,720
Get lost!

734
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,020
Miss Huang!

735
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Miss Huang!

736
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,330
You are incredibly smart.

737
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,590
Please save Kang.

738
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,810
Save him!

739
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,110
Even if it's for Miss Mu's sake,

740
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,060
please spare Kang!

741
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,020
Old Venomous Creature's poison is incurable.

742
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,770
Unless he gives the antidote,

743
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,620
no one can save him.

744
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,140
I'm the Prince of the Jin.

745
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,290
I can do whatever I want!

746
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,620
You all have to listen to me!

747
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,500
Kang!

748
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,510
Kang!

749
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,880
- Father.
- Kang!

750
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,720
Father.

751
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,750
Kang!

752
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,520
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

753
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,360
Your Royal Highness!

754
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,460
- Father.
- Kang!

755
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,980
Kang!

756
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,920
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

757
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,210
It's all Father's fault!

758
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,670
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

759
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,620
Let's go, Your Royal Highness!

760
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,210
- Your Royal Highness!
- Let's go, Your Royal Highness!

761
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,290
Kang!

762

763
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,430
Let's go!

764
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,580
Kang!

765
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,730
- Let's go!
- Go! Go!

766
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,590
Kang!

767
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,510
Ke.

768
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,370
Did you see that?

769
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,170
I avenged you.

You are back.

783

Come in. Give it to me.

784
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,240
Thank you. Father.

785
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,550
I was this tall back then.

786
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,230
Look at me now.

787
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,070
Here. Let's see.

(Iron Spear Temple)

795
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,070
Last night you were determined

796
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,370
to kill him.

797
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,710
What are you acting

798
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,580
like this now?

799
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,620
He ended up like this.

800
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,330
That's exactly what he deserved.

801
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,620
Look at him.

802
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,170
He lived in luxury when alive.

803
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,770
But now, he is wrapped only in a straw mat.

804
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,730
What a life of ups and downs.

805
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,590
I feel sorry for Sister Mu.

806
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,210
She loves him so much.

807
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,170
Now the morning came.

808
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,370
Let's go see your father.

809
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,540
My father should have returned to the Island.

810
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,540
We don't need to go see him.

811
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,270
You are really full of nonsense,

812
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,420
Niece Rong.

813
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,100
If I didn't say that,

814
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,940
would you let me ask Shagu like that?

815
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,040
Then you would miss the real killer

816
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,210
and waste your efforts.

817
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,360
Old Venomous Creature,

818
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,900
I helped you this time.

819
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,020
So rude.

820
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,650
But you must remember the Nine Yin Manual.

821
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,460
That's a long night.

822
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,540
I don't remember it well.

823
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,500
Let me help you with that.

824
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:38,950
Let him go!

825
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,540
How about now? Do you remember?

826
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,330
Rong. Go.

827
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,800
Leave me alone.

828
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,910
I'll go with you

829
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,940
and recite the Nine Yin Manual for you.

830
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,500
Niece Rong.

831
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,020
You can't joke around this time.

832
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,390
Okay.

833
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,140
But you are a grandmaster.

834
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,500
You should keep your word.

835
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,210
Of course.

836
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,500
Rong. No...

837
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,520
Now, Jing doesn't listen

838
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,360
to me.

839
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,810
Only you can explain everything.

840
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,170
Please take care of yourself.

841
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,460
(Resounding Success)

842
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,690
Jing!

843
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,690
Jing!

844
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,650
Jing!

845
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,810
Jing!

846
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,420
Jing!

847
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,690
Master! Master!

848
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,620
If I hadn't

849
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,850
made that bet

850
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,420
with Seven Heroes of Jiangnan,

851
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,730
Yang Kang might not

852
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,250
have ended up like this.

853
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,500
Even though I was his master,

854
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,940
I failed as his master.

855
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,060
He ended up like this.

856
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,070
I should

857
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,100
take the blame.

858
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,370
Taoist Qiu.

859
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,420
We really messed up.

860
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,620
We always thought we were righteous

861
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,460
and heroic.

862
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,730
But in the end,

863
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,020
we harmed these young people.
