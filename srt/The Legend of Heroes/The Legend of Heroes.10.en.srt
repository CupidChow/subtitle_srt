2
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,660
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,740
Brother Guo,

4
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,720
let's find a place to rest and eat.

5
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,980
I feel so sad last night.

6
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,200
I had no appetite this morning.

7
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,260
But now that you're here with me,

8
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,460
I feel hungry.

9
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,300
Okay.

10
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,280
Are you Mr. Guo and Mr. Yang?

11
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,580
Yes.

12
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,920
The food is ready.

13
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,380
My inn is one of the best

14
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,460
in Liyang City.

15
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,360
You'll be satisfied.

16
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,700
How do you know us?

17
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,800
Someone told us this morning.

18
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,540
Described your appearance

19
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,640
and estimated your arrival time.

20
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,140
They ordered us to prepare

21
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,030
top-quality dishes and wine.

22
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,480
Come. Lead their horses.

23
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,080
Okay. Thank you.

24
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,940
Let's go.

25
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,160
The dishes are here. Please enjoy.

26
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,380
Brother Guo,

27
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,800
this must be Master Lu from Guiyun Manor.

28
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,580
He feels guilty

29
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,580
for neglecting me

30
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,640
and imprisoning me

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
which offended his senior sister.

32
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,700
Now he's generously

33
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,540
apologizing to me

34
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,640
to win her over.

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,640
Since that's the case,

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,320
Master Lu is indeed thoughtful.

37
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,380
Brother Guo,

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,320
I toast to you.

39
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,900
Let's dig in.

40
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,880
Jing, eat more.

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,200
Thank you, Rong.

42
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,660
Is it good?

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,400
You must eat the mushrooms too.

44
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,460
Shopkeeper, the bill.

45
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,040
Sir, the bill is already settled.

46
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,060
I have lived in luxury

47
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,040
for years. I don't fancy his meal.

48
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,800
This is ridiculous.

49
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,060
I refuse to give the Lu

50
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,960
a chance to apologize.

51
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,540
Sir, you can't pay twice.

52
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,380
Keep it.

53
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,280
If the Lu comes,

54
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,960
give the money back to them.

55
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,500
Alright, I'll return the money

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,340
when he comes.

57
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,540
For now,

58
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,940
I'll keep it for you.

59
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,040
I'll fetch your horses.

60
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,460
Brother Guo,

61
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,620
don't be fooled by

62
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,720
Master Lu's generosity.

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,040
I can see through him.

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,040
He's not a good person.

65
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,180
He only uses

66
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,380
these petty favors

67
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,720
to win over heroes of the martial world.

68
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,520
and become the leader of the Lake Tai Heroes.

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,820
Isn't he your master's junior?

70
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,380
Why don't you like him?

71
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,300
Because he kidnapped you?

72
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,140
No.

73
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,600
He kidnapped Wanyan Honglie's son,

74
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,960
not Yang Tiexin's son.

75
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,520
Now my surname is Yang.

76
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,040
So we don't have a prolem.

77
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,780
But

78
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,200
he doesn't deserve to be

79
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,520
my senior.

80
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,100
Mei Chaofeng is your master,

81
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,400
so he is indeed your senior.

82
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,600
Mei Chaofeng taught me martial arts,

83
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,800
but she's not truly my master.

84
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,060
She taught you martial arts,

85
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,720
so she's definitely your master.

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,260
But

87
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,060
why did you learn

88
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,400
her sinister skills

89
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,960
like Nine Yin Skeleton Claw?

90
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,860
I wanted to learn
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms

91
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,800
from Hong Qigong.

92
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,720
But I don't have your luck.

93
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,600
Although you don't know Hong Qigong,

94
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,420
your master is Qiu Chuji,

95
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,720
the True Man of Eternal Spring.

96
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,600
He is righteous,

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,720
and just.

98
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,780
He upholds justice,

99
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,100
and he's skilled.

100
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,180
He's also a Taoist master....

101
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,960
But Qiu Chuji doesn't like me.

102
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,740
I'm not as likeable

103
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,600
as you, Brother Guo.

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,980
Hong Qigong likes you.

105
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,280
Huang Yaoshi's daughter

106
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,540
likes you too.

107
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,200
Taoist Qiu is kind.

108
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,480
He must like you.

109
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,600
He had a prejudice against you

110
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,630
because he misunderstood you

111
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,580
as seeing a Jin as your father.

112
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,160
You just need to explain it to your master.

113
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,400
He will forgive you.

114
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,720
So what if he forgives me?

115
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,400
If I follow him,

116
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,520
I'd just be a Taoist priest.

117
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,700
Kang,

118
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,480
don't aim too high.

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,060
Quanzhen School's martial arts

120
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,720
are profound with a long history.

121
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,160
With dedicated practice,

122
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,040
you can become a great master.

123
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,520
(Just a month ago,)

124
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,380
(I rode south under orders,)

125
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,600
(surrounded by luxuries and guards,)

126
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,840
(full of prestige.)

127
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,160
(Now, heading north quietly,)

128
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,040
(riches and honors were but a fleeting dream.)

129
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,640
(And now,)

130
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,600
(I'm even worse off than Guo Jing,)

131
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,720
(laughed at by others.)

132
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,400
(Life is truly unpredictable.)

133
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,780
Let's speed up.

134
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,220
(23 years ago)

135
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,540
(Mount White Camel Manor)

136
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,380
(I heard that)

137
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,820
(the Manichaeism followers)

138
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,360
(set fire to the Mount White Camel Manor.)

139
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,280
(The Ouyang family wandered for years.)

140
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,700
(Finally,)

141
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,600
(my uncle rebuilt the manor.)

142
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,480
(But he returned the manor's leadership)

143
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,160
(to my deceased father,)

144
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,080
(with my mother managing temporarily.)

145
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,520
(In memoriam)
(He didn't stay in the Mount White Camel)

146
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,620
(until the day my mother died.)

147
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,740
(The Main God of the Ouyang family)

148
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,540
Now,

149
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,480
Madam passed away too.

150
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,040
Our Mount White Camel Manor

151
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,640
can't be leaderless for a day.

152
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,980
- Right.
- We should have a leader!

153
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,820
That's right.

154
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,040
The martial world is survival of the fittest.

155
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,640
We need a new master

156
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,960
to lead us to wealth.

157
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,720
Wealth! Yes, that's right!

158
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,740
Are you all bullying my Ouyang family

159
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,600
because we have no one left?

160
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,620
(Ouyang Feng, Western Venom)

161
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,960
(Many years later, I met my uncle again.)

162
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,640
(He's Ouyang Feng, Western Venom.)

163
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,160
(Young Ouyang Ke)
(Everyone was afraid of him.)

164
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,040
(But I felt a close connection)

165
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,020
(when I saw him.)

166
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,200
Ke, don't be scared.

167
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,800
Uncle is back.

168
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,280
Second Master, when did you return?

169
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,960
Well...

170
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,480
The manor should still be led by you.

171
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,720
Yes, of course.

172
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,280
From today,

173
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,640
Ke is the master of the Mount White Camel.

174
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,240
Greetings, young master.

175
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,280
Is this my mother?

176
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,020
Yes.

177
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,580
I will never see

178
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,040
my mother again, will I?

179
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,380
Uncle,

180
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,640
please don't leave.

181
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,240
Uncle has many things to do.

182
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,400
Ke must learn martial arts diligently.

183
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,580
Uncle will come back

184
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,440
every year.

185
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,540
Okay?

186
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,860
(I could see)

187
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,640
(his deep feelings for my mother.)

188
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,560
(Everyone knows I'm his nephew.)

189
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,240
(Many years later,)

190
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,760
(I guessed I'm his son.)

191
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,240
(Perhaps I hoped I am.)

192
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,240
(Uncle traveled often.)

193
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,800
(Fearing no one would care for me,)

194
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,280
(he arranged many girls)

195
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,700
(in the manor)

196
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,540
(to look after me.)

197
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,920
(I want to find a woman
who looks like my mother.)

198
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,120
(But some of them have similar side profiles,)

199
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,320
(some have similar backs,)

200
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,700
(some have similar lips,)

201
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,760
(and some have similar scents.)

202
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,400
(So I let them all stay)

203
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,060
(to piece together)

204
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,240
(my mother's complete image.)

205
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,560
Why are you leaving?

206
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,140
Master!

207
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
I've taken care of you

208
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,640
since you were a kid.

209
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,860
I beg you.

210
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,120
Please let us go.

211
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,640
Now that he's dead,

212
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,400
do you still want to go?

213
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,440
You're pathetic.

214
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,820
You know nothing!

215
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,660
Know what?

216
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,440
(She looked most like my mother.)

217
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,240
(But she left with a scholar.)

218
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,240
(Later I realized,)

219
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,760
(I don't need to capture one's heart,)

220
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,800
(just her presence.)

221
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,620
Young master.

222
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,140
You vile scoundrel,

223
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,320
release my acupoints!

224
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,620
I'll be honest with you.

225
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,180
Yang Kang and I

226
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,400
are already married privately.

227
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,040
Why do you, a young master,

228
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,520
need someone else's wife?

229
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,760
I don't care.

230
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,880
I'll be honest too.

231
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,040
I just like your neck

232
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,560
and chin.

233
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,800
Come back to Mount White Camel with me.

234
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,940
I will provide for you endlessly

235
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,070
and make sure you live the high life.

236
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,300
Dream on!

237
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,120
Even if you cut my neck and chin,

238
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,020
I will never go with you.

239
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,660
Alright.

240
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,520
Then I'll lock you up.

241
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,040
Let's see how long you can stay

242
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,420
in this stone coffin

243
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,640
dug up from

244
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,160
a desolate grave.

245
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,260
Despicable...

246
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,820
You should thank your neck

247
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,660
and chin.

248
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,240
For their sake,

249
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,880
I'll leave a gap in the coffin.

250
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,520
When you change your mind,

251
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,880
I'll take you back to Mount White Camel.

252
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,940
Buns!

253
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,280
Hurry up. Go get prepared.

254
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,520
Are you Mr. Guo and Mr. Yang?

255
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,890
- Yes.
- Yes.

256
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,540
The food and drink are prepared.

257
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,920
Please come in and enjoy.

258
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,660
We are one of the best inns

259
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,940
in Jintan City.

260
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,400
You can eat, drink, and stay here.

261
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,060
What about the bill?

262
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,420
The bill has been paid.

263
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,820
Please enjoy yourself and don't worry

264
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,660
about that.

265
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,300
Guiyun Manor sent us off

266
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,560
all the way to Jintan.

267
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,300
It seems that cripple

268
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,640
fears me and Mei Chaofeng greatly.

269
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,440
And he fears

270
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,920
we might seek revenge for our imprisonment.

271
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,540
Kang,

272
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,800
you just said you don't hold grudges.

273
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,880
I don't hold grudges,

274
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,560
but that cripple remembers.

275
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,640
Gentlemen, your dishes are all here.

276
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,400
This Beggar's Chicken

277
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,940
was made by your friend

278
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,340
who paid the bill.

279
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,180
Please, enjoy.

280
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,160
Okay, thank you.

281
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,780
- Let's go.
- Please.

282
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,920
These are delicious.

283
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,300
Even in the prince's mansion,

284
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,540
I rarely see these dishes.

285
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,380
Eat more then.

286
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,900
Kang!

287
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
I know

288
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,520
who's arranging our meals.

289
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,540
It's not Master Lu.

290
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,380
It's Rong!

291
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,520
Rong must have escaped from her father.

292
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,800
I can tell from the Beggar's Chicken.

293
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,140
And the stewed chicken

294
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,640
with mushrooms we had last meal.

295
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,040
They are my favorites.

296
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,620
I envy you.

297
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,240
The daughter of the Master
of Peach Blossom Island

298
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,880
treats you so well.

299
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
Here, Kang.

300
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,540
Cheers.

301
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,620
Then I'll go ahead.

302
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,740
Brother Guo, where are you going?

303
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,880
Since Rong knows our route

304
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,520
and prepares meals for us,

305
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,440
I want to reach the next stop ahead of time.

306
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,520
The next stop is Baoying.

307
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,040
Maybe I can see her there.

308
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,320
You stay and eat.

309
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,000
Please enjoy.

310
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,780
Execuse me.

311
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,900
Can you tell me

312
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,220
which one is the best inn

313
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,060
in Baoying?

314
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
Go ahead, you can see Dehe Inn.

315
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,520
That's the best one here.

316
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,980
Thank you.

317
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,300
Take care.

318
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,380
(Liu's Bun Shop)

319
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,140
(Dehe Inn)

320
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,980
Shopkeeper.

321
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,060
Sir, a meal or a room?

322
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,900
A room.

323
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,340
Please arrange a room

324
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,280
close to the main road and near the counter.

325
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,800
Okay, please come in.

326
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,740
(Rong,)

327
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,880
(how did you escape?)

328
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,120
(Senior Huang's skills are great.)

329
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,280
(How can you run away from him?)

330
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,320
(You're really clever.)

331
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,160
Dry weather, be careful of fire!

332
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,640
(Am I wrong?)

333
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,300
(Could it really be)

334
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,140
(Master Lu's arrangement?)

335
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,400
(No, that's impossible.)

336
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,320
(That taste, only you can make it.)

337
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,900
Prepare the best food and wine

338
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,640
for these two tomorrow morning.

339
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,580
Here are the menus

340
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,560
and the portraits.

341
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,900
Oh,

342
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,900
I'll cook a few dishes myself.

343
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,760
Take good care of them.

344
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,900
Otherwise,

345
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,040
I can give you this silver,

346
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,640
but I can also take it back.

347
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,000
This one is for Jing.

348
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,660
This one

349
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,920
is for me.

350
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,160
Jing,

351
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,980
is it good?

352
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,160
Good. Very good.

353
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,640

I knew it was you.

360
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,280

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,480
We've found some new girls.

383
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,740
Here are their portraits.

384
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,940
This one...

385
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,220
She's the shopkeeper

386
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,840
of Tongren Pawnshop.

387
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,220
Her surname is Cheng.

388
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,580
Bring her here.

389
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,500
Vegetables for sale!

390
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,520
Are your vegetables fresh today?

391
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
They're all quite fresh.

392
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,840
Please pick what you like.

393
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,440
Sugar-coated haws!

394
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,780
Big and sweet sugar-coated haws!

395
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,620
Jing.

396
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,020
Are you sure to take Yang Kang

397
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,000
to kill Wanyan Honglie?

398
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,260
What about it?

399
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
Aren't you afraid of Yang Kang

400
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,780
might see his Jin prince father

401
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,480
and get emotional,
reverting back to being a prince?

402
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,060
Yang Kang and I

403
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,320
swore brotherhood
before the heavens and the gods.

404
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,420
I trust him.

405
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,800
- But that can't...
- Rong.

406
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,600
Yang Kang made mistakes before,

407
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,200
but he has repented.

408
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,260
If even I, his sworn brother,

409
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,120
don't trust him,

410
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,520
who in this world will?

411
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,440
- You always win.
- Waiter!

412
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,360
A pot of wine, two steamers of buns.

413
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,860
Coming up!

414
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,740
Sir,

415
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,840
your wine. Buns will be here soon.

416
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,220
Okay.

417
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,200
Have you heard?

418
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,500
Around Baoying County,

419
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,440
things have been

420
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,120
quite unsettled lately.

421
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,760
Many young girls

422
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,220
- have suddenly disappeared.
- Here are your buns.

423
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,520
They are not just disappeared.

424
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,840
The scariest part is

425
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
some of the missing girls

426
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,040
suddenly come back.

427
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,940
In the dead of night,

428
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,260
they just lie motionless

429
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,100
on the street.

430
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,960
Their eyes wide open, not moving.

431
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,460
It's terrifying.

432
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,520
Indeed.

433
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,380
But I heard it's the ghost of a womanizer

434
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,360
roaming the world,

435
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,660
selecting brides for ghost marriages.

436
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,180
If they pick a girl,

437
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,440
she will be taken away.

438
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,360
If not,

439
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,180
she will be sent back.

440
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,080
That's nonsense.

441
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,300
I heard

442
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,280
it's those beggars from Beggars' Gang.

443
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,470
- Jing.
- Some of the beggars

444
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,040
act righteous.

445
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,340
But some of them

446
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,280
are just thieves.

447
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,520
True. Eat up.

448
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,740
Let's dig in.

449
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,040
Those gossipers!

450
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,240
Qigong leads the Beggar's Gang.

451
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,860
How could they do

452
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,800
such vile deeds?

453
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,700
Jing.

454
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,520
Qigong told me about this mark.

455
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,020
The Beggars' Gang

456
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,280
uses this mark for emergency.

457
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,560
Could it be

458
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,040
that Qigong is nearby?

459
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,960
The chopstick

460
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,960
points to the next spot.

461
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,280
Miss Cheng is known for her beauty,

462
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,900
one of the best in Baoying County.

463
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,720
The lecher is around.

464
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,420
If we're late,

465
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,320
Miss Cheng might be taken by others.

466
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,840
Let's do it tonight!

467
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,720
Seize the initiative and strike first.

468
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,040
Alright, tonight it is.

469
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,560
See you at the Tongren Pawnshop.

470
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,780
Let's go now.

471
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,980
It was indeed the traitors

472
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,320
within the Beggars' Gang.

473
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,700
These scoundrels are causing trouble,

474
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,880
bringing shame to Qigong.

475
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,660
Let's help Qigong

476
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,200
teach these scoundrels a lesson.

477
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,700
I agree.

478
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,180
Quickly!

479
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,780
Who's there?

480
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,880
A Heroine!

481
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,040
A woman?

482
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,300
What?

483
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,040
You were expecting a man?

484
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,740
Have the heroes of the Beggars' Gang

485
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,580
arrived?

486
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,540
Yes.

487
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,460
- Mr. Li.
- Miss Cheng.

488
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,100
Are these two your friends?

489
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,240
Are you Miss Cheng?

490
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,460
Yes, I am.

491
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,560
Who are you?

492
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm Guo Jing.

493
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm Huang Rong.

494
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,660
We knew Senior Hong

495
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,040
of your gang.

496
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,180
We heard Miss Cheng was in trouble,

497
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,980
so we came to help.

498
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,040
I'm Li sheng.

499
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,260
And this is

500
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,670
(Yu Zhaoxing, Li Sheng from Beggars' Gang)
Yu Zhaoxing, my junior's apprentice.

501
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,840
Miss Cheng

502
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,460
(Cheng Yaojia)
is an apprentice of Taoist Sun Bu'er,

503
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,520
Qingjing Sanren.

504
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,840
We also heard

505
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,040
that

506
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,500
the womanizer

507
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,980
was coming to cause trouble.

508
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,660
So we are here

509
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,720
to help Miss Cheng.

510
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,860
That was really

511
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,280
just a misunderstanding.

512
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,280
Heroes, thank you for your assistance.

513
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,280
I'm deeply grateful.

514
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,620
Recently, in Baoying,

515
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,040
young girls have gone missing

516
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,520
with tales of ghost brides and ghost marriages.

517
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,960
Our gang searched everywhere

518
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,120
for the mastermind.

519
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,520
We found no clues.

520
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,460
But at each missing girl's doorstep,

521
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,000
we found

522
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,580
these flowers

523
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,600
from the Western Regions.

524
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,520
We suspect

525
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,500
it's the womanizer's way

526
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,840
of marking targets.

527
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,040
The latest one was found

528
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,560
at the door of Miss Cheng's pawnshop.

529
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,720
If I'm right,

530
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,180
that womanizer

531
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,220
must be Ouyang Ke.

532
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,000
Nephew of Western Venom Ouyang Feng?

533
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,040
Indeed, it's that lecher.

534
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,320
We've fought Ouyang Ke several times.

535
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,480
Qigong once

536
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,560
warned him in person.

537
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,740
But he remains stubborn

538
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,580
and unrepentant.

539
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,260
Mr. Li,

540
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,280
what's your plan?

541
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,800
How can we help?

542
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,720
Here is our plan.

543
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,520
I'll dress up

544
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,560
like Miss Cheng

545
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,840
and sleep in her room.

546
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,600
If the thief comes tonight,

547
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,680
he will take me.

548
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,240
Once inside their lair,

549
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,360
we'll coordinate from the inside and outside.

550
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,040
Isn't this great?

551
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,100
Great!

552
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,260
Great!

553
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,180
Senior,

554
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,620
Ouyang Ke's men are bad,

555
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,460
but not stupid.

556
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,900
If they really

557
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,940
kidnap you,

558
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,840
they'd say

559
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,520
that Miss Cheng has gained

560
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,360
quite a bit of weight.

561
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,940
Well...

562
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,520
This is indeed a problem.

563
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,020
I'm usually

564
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,000
a big eater,

565
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,580
so I might be a tad heavier

566
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,940
than Miss Cheng.

567
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,420
So, I'll be Miss Cheng.

568
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,500
That would be best.

569
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,340
No.

570
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,280
Why not?

571
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,220
Jing,

572
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,980
we'll work together.

573
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,580
We fought Ouyang Ke to a standstill

574
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,460
last time.

575
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,520
Now we're with seniors from Beggars' Gang.

576
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,900
The four of us

577
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,180
will definitely beat that lecher.

578
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,120
Still, no.

579
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,700
Jing,

580
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,600
don't forget,

581
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,600
I have needles in my sleeves.

582
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,280
When Ouyang Ke realizes

583
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,080
he's kidnapped the wrong person,

584
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,620
my needles

585
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,240
will already be in his face.

586
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,340
Rong, you're younger than me,

587
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,520
but risking yourself to save me.

588
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,280
How can I accept that?

589
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,840
No need to be so formal.

590
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,720
If we keep this up,

591
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,520
the lecher might be embarrassed and not come.

592
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,240
Great!

593
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,780
They're here.

594
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,700
(Tongren Pawnshop)

595
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,100
It's two of them,

596
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,760
both women.

597
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,600
Ouyang Ke isn't there.

598
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,780
Miss Cheng,

599
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,340
do you know how long

600
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,600
I've searched for a face like yours?

601
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,140
You have no idea

602
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,520
what I'm feeling right now.

603
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,720
We fell into his trap!

604
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,840
How did you find out?

605
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,440
I used mandrake flowers

606
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,960
as a marker at the door.

607
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,720
Even if there's only pollen left,

608
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,800
I can tell those stinky beggars are around.

609
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,980
Ouyang Ke,

610
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,340
give them the antidote

611
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,180
and release everyone!

612
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,960
You really think you can beat me?

613
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,860
Rong.

614
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,580
I never thought

615
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,960
you'd come looking for me.

616
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,740
What a beautiful night

617
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,800
in such a romantic atmosphere.

618
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,720
After dealing with these beggars,

619
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,280
I'll come back to you.

620
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,020
Take this!

621
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,860
Qigong taught this kid

622
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,340
so many moves.

623
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,440
Could he have

624
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,520
some connection with our Beggars' Gang?

625
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,340
You keep using

626
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,800
the same 15 moves.

627
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,240
I'm bored to death.

628
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,600
Got anything new?

629
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,680
These moves are enough to deal with you.

630
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,600
The Beggars' Gang has a big reputation.

631
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,980
But seeing it today,

632
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,800
it's laughable.

633
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,200
Beggar's Snake-catching Palm is not good.

634
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,360
Qigong's skills

635
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,760
aren't impressive.

636
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,680
Who ambushed me? Show yourself!

637
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,980
Qigong!

638
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,520
Chief! Chief!

639
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,540
Senior.

640
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,700
Are you alright?

641
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,940
Senior,

642
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,100
we meet again.

643
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,580
I pay my respects.

644
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,240
You don't go back to the Western Regions,

645
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,200
but keep causing trouble here.

646
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,500
Are you going to die

647
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,480
in Central Plains?

648
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,520
Senior, you're invincible
in the Central Plains.

649
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,600
If you spare my life,

650
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,100
I won't die here

651
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,940
in Central Plains.

652
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,560
Who taught you to say that?

653
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,000
Before my travel,

654
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,560
my uncle told me

655
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,280
to treat you

656
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,000
with utmost respect.

657
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,040
Senior, you value your identity.

658
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,800
You won't attack me

659
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,280
nor bully the weak

660
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,720
to preserve your reputation.

661
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,360
That's not from your uncle.

662
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,280
Old Venomous Creature knows well,

663
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,280
if I want to do something,

664
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,660
no one can stop me.

665
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,260
From your words,

666
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,420
you seem dissatisfied with

667
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,480
my Beggar's Snake-catching Palm.

668
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,520
Senior, that's not true.

669
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,040
I was talking nonsense.

670
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,520
But Senior, you and my uncle are equals.

671
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,840
For a fair fight,

672
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,900
it should be between

673
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,800
your apprentices and I.

674
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,480
We're the same generation.

675
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,760
I have no apprentice.

676
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,500
If Qigong can chose

677
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,340
a true apprentice

678
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,520
and teach him diligently,

679
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,140
he can easily

680
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,240
defeat you.

681
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,880
Only a true apprentice

682
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,660
can represent

683
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,720
Qigong's martial arts.

684
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,040
Qigong is willing to teach,

685
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,840
but someone must be able to learn.

686
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,060
That's the key.

687
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
Qigong,

688
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,040
did you hear that?

689
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,040
This lecher is mocking you.

690
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,560
You've taught thousands of people.

691
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,260
But you only keep your great skills

692
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,360
to yourself,

693
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,800
not to your apprentices.

694
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,580
And always

695
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,280
a few scattered moves,

696
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,720
- not teaching the whole set.
- Rong.

697
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,280
I got that.

698
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,300
That's true.

699
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
If you are

700
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,840
not here today,

701
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,040
how could Jing's 15 moves

702
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,680
have protected us all?

703
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,940
Can the vast Central Plains

704
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,840
with its countless people,

705
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,360
rely only on Qigong?

706
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,280
If you take a nap,

707
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,000
who knows how many girls

708
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,280
this lecher would kidnap?

709
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,700
Leaving aside

710
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,080
such grand ambitions,

711
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,800
suddenly today,

712
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,560
I want to take an apprentice

713
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,280
to play with Old Venomous Creature.

714
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,780
What's wrong?

715
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,480
Jing, kowtow to your master.

716
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,200
Master,

717
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,200
please accept my kowtow.

718
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,020
Congratulations, Qigong.

719
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,520
you have a true apprentice now.

720
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,460
Silly boy,

721
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,440
I'm willing to teach you martial arts.

722
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,360
Can you learn?

723
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,760
I don't know, Qigong.

724
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,500
Master.

725
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,480
I'll teach you the final three moves.

726
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,280
You will use them

727
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,040
to defeat him.

728
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,720
If you can't win,

729
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,840
you're not my apprentice.

730
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,840
Watch this.

731
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,620
Qigong,

732
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,320
you can't teach in front of this lecher.

733
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,240
Shouldn't we be fair?

734
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,760
I'll teach right here.

735
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,800
Who learns it, gets it.

736
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,200
So fast.

737
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,420
I'm done.

738
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,280
Go fight him.

739
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,580
I want to see.

740
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,660
Qigong...

741
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,980
It's so fast.

742
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,100
I'm afraid this silly boy

743
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,480
didn't even understand.

744
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,280
(The sixteenth move,)

745
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,200
(Treading on Ice.)

746
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,080
(The seventeenth move,)

747
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,680
(The Ram Charges into the Fence.)

748
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,840
(The eighteenth move,)

749
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,240
(The Divine Dragon Swishes its Tail.)

750
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,740
(These three moves are actually)

751
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,240
(a combination of the first fifteen.)

752
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,220
(Without mastering)

753
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,120
(the first fifteen moves,)

754
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,000
(I can't learn these three moves at all.)

755
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,560
(Now I know Qigong's kind intention.)

756
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,600
Silly boy,

757
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,300
fall asleep?

758
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,020
Qigong,

759
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,440
I think we should stop.

760
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,560
If I accidentally kill him,

761
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,200
it would disgrace you.

762
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,800
If my uncle found out,

763
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,280
he'd scold me.

764
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,020
Jing doesn't want to kill you,

765
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,880
young venomous creature,

766
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,260
so Old Venomous Creature
still has someone to bury him!

767
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,100
Rong,

768
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,160
you are beautiful.

769
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,200
so I like listening to you scold me.

770
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,680
But tonight, I'll show you

771
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,760
who can be your lover.

772
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,180
He made it.

773
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,280
That's the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

774
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,620
Ouyang Ke,

775
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,380
give us the antidote now.

776
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,800
Don't get too big.

777
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,540
I'm only giving it

778
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,380
for Qigong's sake.

779
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,580
Qigong,

780
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,800
let Jing finish off this lecher.

781
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,620
Or what if he'll

782
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,460
grow into another

783
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,500
Old Venomous Creature?

784
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,820
No.

785
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,800
I should save face for Old Venomous Creature.

786
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,400
Last time, when I was alone,

787
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,860
I was poisoned by him,

788
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,800
almost falling into his trap.

789
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,760
Really?

790
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,200
Of course.

791
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,360
Qigong, you don't care about Rong.

792
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,160
What if the young venomous creature

793
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,260
takes advantage of your absence

794
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,280
and comes after me again?

795
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,320
Then I will...

796
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,720
What do you want now?

797
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,740
I've taken Jing as my apprentice.

798
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,860
What more do you want?

799
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,120
Go find your father, Old Heretic Huang.

800
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,300
Qigong treats me

801
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,400
better than my father does.

802
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,020
Besides,

803
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,320
I look down on my father's martial arts.

804
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,700
I only admire

805
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,000
your skills.

806
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,680
You insist on following me?

807
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,860
You think I can't deal with you,

808
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,700
right?

809
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,980
Since that's the case,

810
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,000
take me as your apprentice too.

811
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,860
So today, Qigong,

812
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,840
you'll have a male apprentice

813
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,920
and a female apprentice.

814
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,080
That's a double happiness.

815
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,700
Alright,

816
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,640
today I'll take both of you as my apprentices.

817
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,440
I'll tell Old Heretic Huang next time.

818
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,400
Prepare some delicious dishes for your master.

819
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,440
I need to work on the bang's matter later.

820
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,840
Very good, Master.

821
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,700
Huazheng,

822
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,120
you've had a long and tiring journey.

823
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,220
Eat more.

824
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,160
Fourth Brother,

825
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,220
(Huazheng, Mongol Princess)

826
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,500
We’ve been away from the grasslands

827
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,340
for so long.

828
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,560
In this vast world,

829
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,060
where can I find

830
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,960
Guo Jing?

831
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,180
The world is big,

832
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,280
but not as big as your heart.

833
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
In these troubled times,

834
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,280
all you think about

835
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,320
is your dear Guo Jing.

836
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,500
Of course.

837
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,560
Even in life's worst moments,

838
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,000
with families torn apart,

839
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,680
a couple should die together.

840
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,080
Please help me.

841
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,600
Where could Guo Jing be?

842
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Once we reach Song territory

843
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,740
and finish our tasks,

844
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,100
(Tolui, Mongol Prince)
Master Jebe and I

845
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,020
will help you

846
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,900
turn the world upside down

847
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,620
to find your husband

848
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,460
and marry you to him.

849
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,560
Stop! Don't tease me!

850
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,300
White eagles!

851
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,020
White eagles!

852
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,960
You fly high and see far.

853
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,860
Please help me

854
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,960
find Guo Jing!

855
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,460
Fourth Brother,

856
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,760
they can get me.

857
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,820
Silly girl.

858
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,240
Jin soldiers!

859
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,120
- Huazheng!
- Quickly!

860
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,460
Quickly!

861
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,500
It's Wanyan Honglie.

862
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,020
Go!

863
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,560
Kill them!

864
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,380
Kang!

865
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,900
Brother Guo?

866
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,700
- Brother Guo.
- Kang.

867
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,680
You found Miss Huang.

868
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,460
Sorry.

869
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,100
Rong and I want to

870
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
go back to Jintan to find you

871
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,940
this morning.

872
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,340
But we met

873
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,380
Ouyang Ke that lecher

874
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,560
causing trouble and harming girls.

875
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,780
I couldn't resist helping,

876
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,680
and it delayed us.

877
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,740
It's okay.

878
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,800
Is Miss Huang coming with us to Zhongdu?

879
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,960
We'll head north from here,

880
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,840
past Chuzhou, crossing the Huai River,

881
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,120
and we'll into Jin territory.

882
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,920
It's Saren and Naren,

883
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,360
my white eagles.

884
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,960
How did they get here?

885
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,780
They seem to want to

886
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,800
take me somewhere.

887
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,880
- Let's go, Kang.
- Let's go.

888
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,280
- Huazheng?
- Guo Jing.

889
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,300
Huazheng!

890
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,380
- Huazheng! Huazheng!
- Master Jebe!

891
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,220
Brother Tolui!

892
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,100
Huazheng.

893
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,540
- Huazheng.
- Huazheng.

894
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,100
Is she okay?

895
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,680
She's fine, just fainted.

896
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,160
Why is Huazheng here?

897
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,960
She insisted on coming to find you.

898
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,060
Who knew

899
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,700
we'd run into these Jin soldiers?

900
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,140
Who leads their troops?

901
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,180
It's Wanyan Honglie.

902
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,020
Wanyan Honglie?

903
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,180
Where is he now?

904
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,280
He should be nearby.

905
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,080
Brother Guo, I'll go kill this traitor first.

906
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,540
Brother Tolui,

907
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,060
you take Huazheng

908
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,740
to the Jintan post station for treatment.

909
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,660
- Okay.
- I'll come find you later

910
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,620
after I deal with the Jin.

911
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,120
Okay. Be careful, Brother Guo.

912
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,640
- Rong!
- Jing!

913
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,560
Wanyan Honglie is ahead.

914
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,840
Let's go after him.

915
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,900
Where is Yang Lang?

916
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,840
He went first.

917
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,140
How could you let him go alone

918
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,240
to chase Wanyan Honglie?

919
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,860
If he's a spy,

920
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,800
it will ruin everything.

921
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,780
No, he just helped me kill

922
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,740
several Jin soldiers.

923
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,840
We should go now

924
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,160
and get ahead of Yang Kang.

925
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,420
