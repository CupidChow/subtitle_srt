=Episode 17=

3
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,530
A few days ago,

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,160
I received

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,180
a message from Ouyang Ke's pigeon.

6
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,020
I hurried here

7
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,100
but I was still too late.

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,410
I am truly ashamed.

9
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,530
Ke told me about your great talents.

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
But now, my only concern

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,440
is finding a famous doctor to cure Ke,

12
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
nothing else.

13
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,800
As for the Book of Wumu,

14
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,360
I really can't help you.

15
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,480
Mr. Ouyang, that's not right.

16
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
What I want

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,440
is what you want.

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
Mr. Ouyang,

19
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,520
do you know about the Book of Wumu?

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,640
Yue Fei was not only a military genius,

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
but also a martial arts master.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
The Yue Palm he passed down

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
is also extraordinary.

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
It is said

25
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
the book includes martial arts

26
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,840
and military tactics.

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,200
You are indeed knowledgeable.

28
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,800
The Song and Mongol people

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,080
have repeatedly attacked our Jin

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,480
from the south and the north.

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,600
We have suffered greatly.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,480
If our Jin

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,880
can get the Book of Wumu,

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
we could defend ourselves

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,640
and protect our people

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
from the slaughter by the Song and Mongol,

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
bringing peace to the world.

38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,440
Now,

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,080
we have confirmed

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,920
the location of the Book of Wumu.

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,200
If

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
you can join us,

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
we can definitely make it.

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,160
I will report to the Emperor

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
and reward you.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,200
When our Jin unites the country,

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,240
Mr. Ouyang,

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
whether you want the Nine Yin Manual,

49
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,120
the title of the world's greatest,

50
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,720
or to find famous doctors,

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,280
you won't need to

52
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
struggle personally.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,200
With your help,

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,680
it's a great fortune for our Jin.

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
Master.

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
Why did Ouyang Feng

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,320
rescue us?

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
He wouldn't save me without a reason.

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,280
He must have ulterior motives.

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,580
He's not that kind.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,880
Jing.

62
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,960
Since Ouyang Feng kept us here,

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,480
he'll come to us soon.

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Old Venomous Creature,

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,440
you're staring at me.

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm not feeling well.

67
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,200
No wonder Ouyang Ke

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,360
always looks dazed.

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,240
It runs in the family!

70
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,720
That's an appreciative look.

71
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
Qigong,

72
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,760
it's all my bad.

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
My competitive nature

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,720
nearly cost you

75
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,080
your life.

76
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
But seeing you

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
recover quickly

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,480
puts my mind at ease.

80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,800
Do you know what's that for?

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
The Nine Yin Manual.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,080
You guessed right.

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
Fortunately, the Nine Yin Manual

84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,840
is profound.

85
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,960
Thanks to Jing teaching me,

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
I can still

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
enjoy my life here.

88
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
Qigong,

89
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,560
teach me a bit,

90
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
so Ke

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,080
can recover too.

92
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,040
You already have

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,960
the Nine Yin Manual.

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
Why do you need us?

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
The scriptures Nephew Guo gave me

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,640
are too obscure.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,960
I understand barely

98
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,080
one or two lines out of ten.

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,920
I don't know...

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,400
Is this the real scriptures?

101
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
What do you mean?

102
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,840
Of course it's real.

103
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,680
Qigong,

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
explain it to me.

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
Nephew Guo,

106
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,880
recite it to me,

107
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
line by line.

108
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
Old Venomous Creature,

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,080
the Nine Yin Manual

110
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,200
isn't as simple as a child's book.

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,160
We can just recite it.

112
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,960
There are many martial artists on this ship.

113
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,240
You dare let Jing recite it.

114
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,720
What about the eavesdroppers?

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,800
You finally got the Nine Yin Manual.

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,480
Do you want

117
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,160
even children to recite it?

118
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,840
I've never figured one thing out.

119
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,960
Qigong,

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,240
you and he know

121
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
the Nine Yin Manual.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Why can't Ke, I and others

123
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,640
know it?

124
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,280
I didn't say you can't.

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,280
You have the manual.

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
Practice it yourself.

127
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,320
Then explain it to me!

128
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
Even if Jing recites it,

129
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
you won't understand.

130
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,680
Why?

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Many parts aren't
in the Central Plains dialect.

132
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,280
Can you understand that?

133
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,400
Can you?

134
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
For example,

135
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,960
Mahabolo,

136
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,200
Jadi Guro,

137
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Mohanskol,

138
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,080
Kinchehus

139
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,480
and Koshannek,

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,800
these are in Tocharian.

141
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,640
In Central Plains language,

142
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,240
it is the section on internal healing

143
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,520
and bone strengthening in the Nine Yin Manual.

144
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,880
If you practice it,

145
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,800
you might save your Ke.

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,040
You know Tocharian?

147
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,800
What's strange about that?

148
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,920
Ten years ago,

149
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,720
a Tocharian merchant

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
passed by Peach Blossom Island

151
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,200
and sold my father many curiosities.

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,560
My father invited him to the island

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
for half a year,

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
during which he taught my father

155
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
Tocharian.

156
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,680
I listened by their side

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,640
and learned a bit.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,880
Yaoshi is clever.

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,280
So,

160
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,480
if you want to translate

161
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,440
the strange text,

162
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,400
you can ask my father.

163
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,880
No need.

164
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,730
Niece Rong,

165
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,170
you can help me.

166
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
I can do that.

167
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
But now,

168
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,840
we're on someone else's ship.

169
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,680
I'm afraid they'll harm us.

170
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
Old Venomous Creature,

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,160
you can take care of us.

172
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,480
You bring us our meals three times a day.

173
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,840
One meal for one page of the manual.

174
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,680
What do you think?

175
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,480
Great!

176
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080
You eat now.

177
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
I'll prepare another meal.

178
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Thank you.

179
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,320
These are salty.

180
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,720
Less salt next time.

181
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,400
Rong,

182
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
you even know Tocharian?

183
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
I don't.

184
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,840
I lied to him.

185
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,190
But a lie

186
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,560
won't last forever.

187
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
This doesn't sound good.

188
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,560
Could it be Ouyang Feng

189
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,600
found out Rong lied

190
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
and is here to kill us?

191
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
That could happen.

192
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,560
Let's go.

193
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,680
Take the small boat

194
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,720
and row north for two days,

195
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,560
you'll reach the shore.

196
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,360
Aren't you coming with us?

197
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,280
Don't worry about me.

198
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
You should go.

199
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Okay.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
Take care.

201
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,400
Thank you.

202
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,160
You're leaving without a word?

203
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,000
So rude.

204
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,240
Release the arrows!

205
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,120
- Father, watch out.
- Losers! Losers!

206
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,360
Not fun. Not fun.

207
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Brother Zhou?

208
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,880
Brother Guo!

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,640
Without you, I'm not happy.

210
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm not happy. I'm not happy.

211
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,880
What are you doing here?

212
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,840
I'm looking for you.

213
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,320
Luckily,

214
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,040
my senior blessed me

215
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
with heavenly protection.

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
I finally found you. I found you.

217
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,240
- That's great.
- Old Imp.

218
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,000
Where have you been?

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,600
I've been on the sea,

220
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,560
never left.

221
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,840
And couldn't leave.

222
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
Look over there.

223
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
You found my ship!

224
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,920
Your ship brought me luck.

225
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
It saved me.

226
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,920
Otherwise, I'd be

227
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,520
sun-dried fish by now.

228
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,360
Alright, enough talking.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,880
We're in a fight now.

230
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,560
Right, a fight.

231
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,120
How can a fight be without me?

232
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,080
Come on.

233
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,760
Who will fight me first?

234
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
Who's this old man?

235
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,720
Show us your skills

236
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,680
if you have any.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,520
Let us see and learn.

238
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,440
Old man?

239
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,480
Bald head, sink in. Sink in.

240
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,520
Bald head, sink in.

241
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Who's next?

242
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,400
Who's next?

243
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Your Royal Highness,

244
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,480
he's just an old man.

245
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,200
We have more people. We don't fear them.

246
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,960
He's the Old Imp from the Quanzhen School,

247
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
Zhou Botong.

248
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,480
He is Wang Chongyang's junior.

249
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,280
You four, don't disgrace yourselves.

250
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,440
Old Venomous Creature,

251
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,560
why are you everywhere?

252
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,240
Everyone wants to be safe.

253
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
No need for a deadly fight.

254
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,160
No!

255
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,320
You'll die,

256
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
and we'll live.

257
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,280
You're here.

258
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,360
I'll fight you.

259
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,320
Fight me?

260
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,880
If the ship sinks,

261
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,120
neither of us can go.

262
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,240
Wouldn't that be great?

263
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,760
We can all play here.

264
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,280
- Come here!
- If you insist on fighting,

265
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,560
I'll see you at Mount Hua next year.

266
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,640
Today,

267
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,680
the Prince will spare you.

268
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,440
Leave now

269
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,640
and don't cause trouble.

270
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,760
Your Royal Highness,

271
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
you're letting them go?

272
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,960
Everything follows

273
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,240
Mr. Ouyang's arrangement.

274
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,120
You are done?

275
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,360
Let's fight!

276
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
Alright,

277
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
that's it.

278
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
We'll go.

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,840
What do you mean?

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,880
Trust me. I'll show you something fun.

281
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,960
What's fun?

282
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,640
Don't talk and follow me.

283
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,160
That will be fun.

284
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,520
Revenge is a dish that could be eaten cold.

285
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,600
Master hasn't recovered yet.

286
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,480
We'll find another chance.

287
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Okay.

288
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,720
Sharks!

289
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm here!

290
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,520
Come here!

291
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Let's go.

292
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
- Catch sharks.
- Jing.

293
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,880
I know what's on your mind.

294
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
You're wondering

295
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,840
if Yang Kang has reasons

296
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,720
for siding with Wanyan Honglie.

297
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,280
You're worrying

298
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,480
that will Wanyan Honglie be angry

299
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,280
with Sister Mu for helping us.

300
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,840
Rong,

301
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
I can't hide anything

302
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
from you.

303
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,040
I don't believe Yang Kang has reasons.

304
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,320
But I believe

305
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,400
he loves Sister Mu.

306
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,480
As long as he is a prince,

307
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,440
Sister Mu will be fine.

308
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,960
Jing,

309
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,480
you must be tired.

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Have some rest.

311
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,520
Okay.

312
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,320
Rong!

313
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,200
Master!

314
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
Master.

315
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Do you remember

316
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
what Master told you to do?

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,840
I remember.

318
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,560
Before July 15th,

319
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,120
I'll take the Dog Beating Staff

320
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,080
and go to Yuezhou as the new master
of the Beggars' Gang.

321
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,640
But Master.

322
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,840
We were in an emergency on that island.

323
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,680
So I had to take on this responsibility.

324
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Now everyone is safe.

325
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,080
I'm not fit for this position.

326
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,880
Master, please take charge

327
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,160
of the Beggars' Gang again.

328
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,120
Child,

329
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,640
do you really think

330
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,640
I passed the position to you

331
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,200
just because of the emergency

332
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,760
and my near-death?

333
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Didn't you think

334
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,560
I could have asked you

335
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,640
to pass the Dog Beating Staff

336
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,520
to any elder of the Gang?

337
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
Rong.

338
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,200
You're the smartest,

339
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,520
and the most

340
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,720
unselfish person I've met.

341
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,320
You're calm in crises,

342
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
a wise person.

343
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,200
Regardless of

344
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
my survival,

345
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,520
even in a different time and place,

346
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,120
I would still pass

347
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,640
the leadership to you.

348
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,320
Besides,

349
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,920
in front of the grand master,

350
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,560
I passed the position to you.

351
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
This can't be taken back.

352
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,360
You know what.

353
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,560
To my mind,

354
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
you take the position

355
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,560
temporarily.

356
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,640
If you're unhappy,

357
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,440
pass it to someone else.

358
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,280
Anyway, I can't control

359
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,920
what happens next.

360
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,240
What do you think,

361
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
Master Huang?

362
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,920
Master,

363
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,760
- I...
- Great.

364
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,640
Rise up.

365
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
Stick with me from now on.

366
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,000
Old Imp!

367
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,040
Give me back Dog Beating Staff!

368
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,400
We're ashore!

369
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,120
Old Imp is finally back!

370
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,840
Despite those punks,

371
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,200
with Mr. Ouyang here,

372
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,840
I feel at ease.

373
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,560
Your Royal Highness,

374
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,640
please allow me to say a few words.

375
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,800
I thought Mr. Ouyang

376
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,560
would teach those thieves a lesson.

377
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,960
But he didn't

378
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,720
dare to make a move.

379
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,840
It seems he fears Old Imp.

380
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,280
Blah, blah, blah.

381
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,120
You haven't had enough of

382
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,480
Zhou Botong's beatings.

383
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,680
Alright. Alright.

384
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
You are all Jin's

385
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,000
heroes and guest.

386
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,440
We should get along peacefully.

387
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,760
Mr. Ouyang,

388
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,720
I have a small favor

389
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,000
to ask of you today.

390
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,440
Hope you can agree.

391
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,960
Please tell me.

392
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Kang,

393
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,400
kneel down.

394
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,480
Mr. Ouyang.

395
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
I've admired you for a long time.

396
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,760
I wish to be your apprentice

397
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,640
and learn martial arts.

398
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
My son has practiced

399
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
martial arts since childhood.

400
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,000
But he hasn't had a good teacher.

401
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,760
If you don't mind

402
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,880
and can teach him,

403
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,680
both of us will be

404
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
very grateful.

405
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,840
But Mount White Camel has a rule.

406
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
I can only teach one apprentice.

407
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,440
I've already taught Ke.

408
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I can't teach you.

409
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,960
Stop!

410
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,040
Who are you?

411
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
Guards!

412
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
Who's that?

413
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,360
Yaoshi?

414
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,640
Brother Ouyang?

415
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,000
What are you doing here?

416
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,040
I'm looking for my daughter.

417
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,920
Looking for your daughter?

418
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Haven't you seen her?

419
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,640
I haven't either.

420
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,720
Have you seen her?

421
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,040
Who's this?

422
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,280
This is my friend,

423
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,720
Master Huang of Peach Blossom Island.

424
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
So you are

425
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,320
the famous

426
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,920
Master Huang of Peach Blossom Island,

427
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,800
Huang Yaoshi.

428
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,160
It's my great honor

429
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,480
to meet you here.

430
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,400
I'll go find my daughter.

431
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,960
Excuse me.

432
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,240
Please wait.

433
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,760
Master Huang,

434
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,680
Are you looking for

435
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,160
a teenage girl?

436
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,320
Have you seen her?

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,360
Three days ago,

438
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,720
I saw a floating body in the sea

439
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,680
wearing white

440
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,400
with a gold ring in her hair.

441
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,560
She looked beautiful,

442
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
but...

443
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,880
But what?

444
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
But she was swollen

445
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,680
from the sea.

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,640
Beside her body

447
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,000
were three dead men.

448
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,160
One was a young man

449
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,200
with thick eyebrows and big eyes.

450
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,880
One was an old beggar

451
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,080
with a red gourd tied to his waist.

452
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
And an old man

453
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,920
with long beard and hair.

454
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,280
Didn't you say you hadn't seen her?

455
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,520
Yaoshi,

456
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,560
you got me wrong.

457
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,800
I just got on the ship

458
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,600
and know as much as you do.

459
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,880
So they are Nephew Guo,

460
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,160
Qigong,

461
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,320
and Botong?

462
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,120
Life and death are a natural part of life.

463
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,400
I'm sorry for your loss.

464
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,560
Yaoshi,

465
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
I'm sorry!

466
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,840
What a monk.

467
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,240
Time to eat!

468
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,600
- I'll eat.
- Master goes first.

469
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,200
- No, I'll go first.
- Here, Master.

470
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,040
Here.

471
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,920
Old Imp, just wait a minute.

472
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
We also have the grilled fish.

473
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,440
Rong, make it quick. I'm starving.

474
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Master.

475
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
Take your time. There's more here.

476
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,680
Master,

477
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
are you tired of my Beggar's Chicken?

478
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,200
Of course not.

479
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,520
How could I get tired

480
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
of your cooking?

481
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,280
But

482
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,720
I just remembered something.

483
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,200
Rong,

484
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,680
do you know

485
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,520
Five Delicacies Sashimi?

486
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,800
I know it.

487
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,920
But I've never tasted it.

488
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,360
It's a famous dish, only prepared
by imperial chefs

489
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,760
for important diplomatic meetings.

490
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,640
That's right. Exactly.

491
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,800
That's easy.

492
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,920
We'll go catch

493
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,920
an imperial chef

494
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,280
and have him cook it for us.

495
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,000
You know nothing.

496
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,160
Do you think I haven't tried that?

497
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,960
Without the palace's pot, stove,

498
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,320
utensils, and ingredients,

499
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,600
it just doesn't

500
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,440
taste the same.

501
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,400
It's awful.

502
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,720
That's magical.

503
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,840
When I was young,

504
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,520
I hid in the palace for three months

505
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,880
just to eat this dish.

506
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,520
But the emperor didn't meet anyone

507
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,720
during those months.

508
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,160
So I never got to taste it.

509
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,840
It's the biggest regret

510
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,080
in my life.

511
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,560
If I could eat it once,

512
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,440
my life would be complete.

513
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,280
Aren't the Mongols and Song

514
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,120
about to form an alliance?

515
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,440
There will be a diplomatic meeting.

516
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,680
Won't they prepare this dish?

517
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,480
Jing,

518
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,560
you're getting smarter.

519
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,400
Yes,

520
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,080
it's a rare chance.

521
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,480
We can go to Lin'an,

522
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,920
sneak into the palace,

523
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,560
and have a taste of it.

524
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,720
You're right.

525
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,720
- Let's go!
- Good.

526
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
- Good.
- Brother Zhou.

527
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,840
Where is Brother Zhou?

528
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,040
Brother Zhou!

529
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,760
Where is my Dog Beating Staff?

530
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Rong! What a coincidence.

531
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,360
Old Imp,

532
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
did you

533
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,040
forget something?

534
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,360
No.

535
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,520
Old Imp always

536
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,640
travels light.

537
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,000
I didn't forget something.

538
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,160
But thank you.

539
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,600
I mean,

540
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,200
did you forget to

541
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,160
return something to me?

542
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Rong,

543
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,280
don't wrongly accuse me.

544
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,720
When did I take your stuff?

545
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
You want me to search you?

546
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,280
Search me!

547
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
Search me. Go ahead.

548
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,120
When did I take your stuff?

549
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,920
Dog Beating Staff?

550
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,200
When did you put it on me?

551
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,080
I didn't even know.

552
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,280
Take it back.

553
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,080
I've been away from home for 15 years.

554
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,480
I'll go back to Zhongnan Mountain.

555
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,840
Are you going now?

556
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,240
You have the Dog Beating Staff.

557
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
What do you want from me?

558
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,200
I want to settle accounts with you.

559
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Fine, let's settle them.

560
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,000
Did you frame Jing,

561
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,960
so my father didn't agree to our marriage?

562
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,120
Yes.

563
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
But it's not all my fault.

564
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,840
Not your fault?

565
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,400
Let's continue.

566
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Did you insist on boarding

567
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
my father's flower boat,

568
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,160
causing Qigong and Jing

569
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,720
to be in danger with you?

570
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,200
They wanted to board.

571
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Not all my fault.

572
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,280
It's your fault!

573
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,480
Everything you did

574
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,040
put us in danger.

575
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,240
And,

576
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,160
did you take

577
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,040
my Dog Beating Staff?

578
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,000
Luckily, I got it back in time.

579
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,400
I just

580
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,320
borrowed it for fun.

581
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,360
Now it's with you.

582
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm leaving.

583
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,880
Go ahead.

584
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,160
I'll spread the word

585
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,200
in the martial world,

586
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,520
saying Zhou Botong of Quanzhen School

587
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
is a rogue.

588
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,480
Then everyone will

589
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,600
despise you.

590
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,920
Sister Rong,

591
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
I'm not a rogue.

592
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,840
Don't slander me

593
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,200
in the martial world.

594
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,680
Dog Beating Staff is with you.

595
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,040
What more do you want?

596
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
Master is still injured.

597
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,760
If you come with us

598
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,600
to the palace,

599
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,440
protect us,

600
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
and let Master eat Five Delicacies Sashimi,

601
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,960
we'll call it even.

602
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,800
Deal?

603
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
No.

604
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,880
Not a deal!

605
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,000
I've suffered too much!

606
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
I was trapped

607
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,640
on Peach Blossom Island for 15 years.

608
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,720
I finally

609
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,840
got out of Old Heretic Huang.

610
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,800
Now you want to

611
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,240
trap me again?

612
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,080
No way.

613
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,800
I won't go! I won't go!

614
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
No matter what you say,

615
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,760
I won't go. I won't go!

616
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,800
I'll go.

617
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,320
Don't spread the word.

618
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,680
Deal.

619
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,000
(Niujia Village)

620
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,520
Old beggar, I'll get you the delicacy!

621
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,480
Master, it's late today.

622
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,520
We probably can't

623
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,400
enter Lin'an.

624
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,400
This place looks nice.

625
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,480
Shall we stay in this village for the night?

626
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,320
Okay.

627
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,760
(Niujia Village)

628
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,800
Jing.

629
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
What's wrong?

630
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,240
Rong.

631
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,120
This is the Niujia Village,

632
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,600
which my mother always talked about.

633
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,960
Jing,

634
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
do you remember

635
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,080
where is your home?

636
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,560
We can find it.

637
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
My mother

638
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,480
spoke of it briefly.

639
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,040
We probably can't find

640
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,880
my parents' old house now.

641
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,120
But we can

642
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,680
bring your mother here,

643
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,600
rebuild the old house,

644
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,160
and live here.

645
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,520
That would be nice.

646
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,040
Okay.

647
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,920
There's a tavern!

648
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,960
Let's check it out.

649
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,120
Grab some food

650
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,000
and have fun.

651
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,920
Come on. Old beggar. Let's go.

652
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,240
- Coming.
- Come on!

653
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

654
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,120
(Niujia Village)

655
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,560
Father,

656
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,440
what did Grand Master say?

657
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,560
Sister Huang...

658
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,800
She's dead.

659
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,920
Who killed her?

660
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,520
She drowned herself

661
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,200
in the sea for Guo Jing.

662
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,720
Her body wasn't found.

663
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,360
Your grand master believes

664
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,680
it's the fault

665
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,880
of Seven Heroes of Jiangnan.

666
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,280
He orders Guiyun Manor

667
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,880
to kill any of them.

668
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,160
If we have to follow his order

669
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,720
and blame Seven Heroes of Jiangnan.

670
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,560
I'm afraid...

671
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,880
Our reputation

672
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,760
will be ruined

673
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,480
in martial world.

674
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,680
I know.

675
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,800
I bet Master

676
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,160
decided this in anger.

677
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,960
If we listen to him

678
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,000
and follow through,

679
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,920
he will

680
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
definitely regret it.

681
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,240
Father, what should we do?

682
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,240
You go find Seven Heroes of Jiangnan

683
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,560
and tell them everything.

684
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,440
Firstly,

685
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,240
offer them condolences.

686
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,840
Secondly,

687
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,240
tell them go to the desert

688
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,640
and lay low for a while

689
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
until Master calms down.

690
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,560
Anyone here?

691
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,040
Nobody here?

692
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,800
Nobody?

693
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,680
Botong?

694
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Is this the place?

695
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,840
Yes.

696
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
But it's eerie

697
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,760
and empty.

698
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,640
Could there be ghosts?

699
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,800
Let's find another place.

700
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,080
It's so late. Where can we go?

701
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,940
Let's stay here.

702
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,840
But don't blame me

703
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,080
if there are female ghosts.

704
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,400
You are an elder Taoist from Zhongnan Mountain.

705
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,960
Shouldn't female ghosts fear you?

706
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,800
My senior only taught me martial arts,

707
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,720
but he didn't teach

708
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,680
how to exorcise ghosts.

709
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,000
And female ghosts consume men's essence.

710
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,360
When you become one, you'll know.

711
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,200
Brother Zhou,

712
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,240
Rong won't become a female ghost.

713
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

714
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,640
I'm a fairy from Peach Blossom Island.

715
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,400
- You scared me, fairy.
- Enough.

716
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,600
It's just an empty tavern.

717
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,320
You freaked me out.

718
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,040
Wait for me!

719
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,600
Brother Zhou,

720
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,760
Master,

721
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,480
sorry for making you

722
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,800
sleep here tonight.

723
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,840
In the martial world,

724
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,840
we can sleep anywhere.

725
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,560
It's dry and windproof here.

726
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,960
We should be grateful.

727
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,840
I'll find a place to sleep.

728
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,760
Yes, Master.

729
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,600
Old beggar,

730
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,360
can you sleep here?

731
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,320
Someone is

732
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,280
watching us.

733
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,440
Definitely a female ghost.

734
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,600
We can't stay here.

735
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,480
We can't. We can't.

736
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,320
Old Imp!

737
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,520
Stop scaring us

738
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,480
or I'll let the ghost drain your essence.

739
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
Sister Rong, believe me.

740
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,560
There's a female ghost.

741
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,120
A female ghost!

742
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,960
Where? I can't see it.

743
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,560
Right there.

744
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,640
A female ghost!

745
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,760
Brother Zhou.

746
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,680
We've traveled all day.

747
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,560
You should stop.

748
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,480
I'm not staying.

749
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,640
Female ghost haunt people.

750
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,880
I can't practice my martial arts.

751
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,160
I'm leaving.

752
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,960
Rong, Jing, I'm leaving.

753
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,760
The door closed by itself.

754
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
I told you, there is...

755
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,960
A ghost!

756
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,080
It's a person.

757
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,360
Who is that?

758
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,760
Who are you?

759
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,320
That's Jade Waves Palm
of Peach Blossom Island?

760
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,520
Don't tell me?

761
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,640
Then I'll let you see

762
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,720
the real Jade Waves Palm.

763
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
Ouch!

764
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
My butt...

765
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,520
I just took a tumble.

766
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,200
She's a silly girl.

767
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,120
(Shagu)

768
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,240
Stop playing the fool.

769
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,640
Who taught you martial arts?

770
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,280
If you don't tell me, I'll kill you.

771
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,480
Who taught you martial arts?

772
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,600
If you don't tell me,

773
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,560
I'll kill you.

774
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,160
I really will.

775
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,880
If you kill me,

776
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,200
I'll kill you.

777
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,600
What a silly girl.

778
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,080
That's right.

779
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
I'm Shagu.
[*Shagu: a silly girl in Chinese]

780
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,240
Rong.

781
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,280
I've checked.

782
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
This tavern

783
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,680
is stand-alone.

784
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,680
It's spacious all around,

785
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
no place to hide.

786
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,200
No place to hide.

787
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,360
Shagu is not silly.

788
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,400
Shagu knows that

789
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,280
you are bad people for stealing.

790
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,200
Shagu,

791
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,080
let's play a game.

792
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,240
Game?

793
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,200
Great!

794
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,040
I'll blow out the light.

795
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,600
Everyone will find a place and hide.

796
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,440
Who hides the longest

797
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,280
wins.

798
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,560
And the award for the winner

799
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,040
is noodles.

800
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,880
What do you say?

801
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,360
Great!

802
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,640
Yay! That's great!

803
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,080
Hide and seek is my specialty.

804
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,840
Brother Zhou, stop.

805
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,520
Sha Gu loves that.

806
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,640
That's my specialty.

807
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,000
Then let's have a competition

808
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,120
to see who's the best!

809
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,320
Jing, don't worry.

810
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,480
- I can win.
- Brother Zhou.

811
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,160
Don't move.

812
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,720
What now?

813
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,000
Say something.

814
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,640
- Be quiet.
- What are you doing?

815
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,040
You stay. Don't move.

816
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,560
Don't move.

817
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,440
I'll be right back.

818
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
Rong.

819
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,360
She's in there!

820
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,480
What are you doing here?

821
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,800
Old Imp.

822
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
Go watch over Master.

823
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,000
Jing and I will go check.

824
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,320
No.

825
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
I'll go with you. Go.

826
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,360
Aren't you afraid of female ghosts?

827
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,840
What if one comes out?

828
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,360
You can't practice martial arts.

829
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,200
You go.

830
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,680
I'll stay with the old beggar.

831
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,240
Go.

832
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,720
Easy.

833
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,200
Shagu?

834
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,160
Shagu?

835
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,720
Shagu?

836
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,880
Miss?

837
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,760
Shagu,

838
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,960
here you are.

839
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,400
You peeked!

840
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,040
That doesn't count.

841
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,640
We need to hide again.

842
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,320
Rong.

843
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Look.

844
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,160
So many skeletons.

845
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,400
Miss,

846
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,480
do you know who they were?

847
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,760
You found me again.

848
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
Who were they?

849
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,520
Who were they?

850
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,600
She is silly.

851
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,680
There's no point asking her.

852
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
These look like Song soldier uniforms.

853
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,200
Shagu,

854
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,920
we're here to steal.

855
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,480
No stealing!

856
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,240
What shouldn't we steal?

857
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,600
There are many things here.

858
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
You can't steal them.

859
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,200
You can't go inside.

860
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,640
A lot of good stuff here.

861
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,200
You can't steal them.

862
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,720
You can't.

863
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,400
Be careful.

864
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,920
Look.

865
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,880
He was a high-ranking official.

866
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,880
(Qu)

867
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,680
This is Master Lu's Iron Eight Trigrams

868
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,960
from Guiyun Manor.

869
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,240
This is Iron Eight Trigrams.

870
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,160
But it might not belong to Master Lu.

871
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,190
His leg bone is broken.

872
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,200
This is my senior,

873
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
Qu Lingfeng.

874
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,960
Qu Lingfeng?

875
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,560
Lu said

876
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,360
Qu was alive.

877
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,160
Didn't expect he died here.

878
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,680
But why did he die

879
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,680
with a Song soldier?

880
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,440
And why did Qu

881
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,080
hide so many treasures

882
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,680
here in Niujia Village?

883
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Father said

884
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,040
of the six apprentices,

885
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,920
Qu had the strongest martial arts

886
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,760
and pleased him most.

887
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,280
Most treasures here

888
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,120
are Father's favorites.

889
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,640
I bet Qu

890
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,400
wanted to please Father

891
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,440
when he would return to Peach Blossom Island.

892
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,720
But a corrupt official

893
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,760
coveted them.

894
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,920
Go.

895
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,280
Go.

896
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,640
Miss.

897
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,360
Is your surname Qu?

898
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,680
You're silly.

899
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Sha Gu's surname is Sha.

900
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,080
Do you know what this is?

901
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,440
Shagu?

902
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,840
I don't know.

903
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,840
I don't know.

904
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,400
I don't know.

905
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,720
