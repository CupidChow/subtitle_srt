00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,980
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
Jing!

4
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,210
Silly boy.

5
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,090
All brawn and no brain.

6
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,610
You've kicked the ball to pieces.

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,370
So,

8
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,890
I win.

9
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
You lose, so get lost.

10
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,210
Why did you say we lost?

11
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,720
None of us hit the pole.

12
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,300
Let's continue.

13
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,420
We don't have a ball now.

14
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,380
How can we continue?

15
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,580
How about this?

16
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,420
Let's compete in sleeping.

17
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,020
Find yourself a branch.

18
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,460
Who wakes up first

19
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
loses.

20
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,700
I can't sleep without a bed.

21
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,580
Then we can't do it.

22
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,540
Jing,

23
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,460
you go compete with him.

24
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,740
Rong,

25
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,020
I'm not sleepy yet.

26
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,100
Don't worry.

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,900
I have ways to make him lose.

28
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,580
(Rong is amazing.)

29
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,860
(She bought so much delicious food so soon.)

30
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,820
Smells so good.

31
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,820
My father says my Beggar's Chicken

32
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,100
is the best in the world.

33
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,860
Sir, I originally wanted you

34
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,740
to taste it.

35
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,940
What a pity, Jing can't beat you.

36
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,940
So sleep well.

37
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,420
This chicken is only

38
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,020
for Jing and me.

39
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,340
Thief!

40
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,620
Finally, I found you.

41
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,300
Where is Guo Jing?

42
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
Where is he?

43
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,580
Guo Jing?

44
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,260
That's enough.

45
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,380
We've so far from Zhongdu.

46
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,500
Why did you follow us?

47
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,940
Why wouldn't I?

48
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Unless that little thief

49
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,420
gives my snake blood back!

50
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,100
Guo Jing!

51
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,620
Come out!

52
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,980
What are you doing here?

53
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,860
I want your blood.

54
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Maybe after you digest it,

55
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,700
your blood will be better.

56
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,900
Who?

57
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,420
Show yourself!

58
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,180
Mercy! Mercy!

59
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,940
Rong, are you okay?

60
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,260
Mercy! Mercy! I...

61
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,060
I really didn't know

62
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,500
it was you, sir.

63
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,820
Mercy! Please!

64
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,340
I...

65
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,620
I really didn't know

66
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,180
it was you.

67
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,740
They kindly invited me

68
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,140
to eat Beggar's Chicken.

69
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,060
What are you blabbering about?

70
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,620
I really didn't know

71
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,500
the two young heroes

72
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,940
are your friends.

73
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,940
Or how could I dare to be rude?

74
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,460
Boy,

75
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,380
Go hit him to vent your anger

76
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,620
and teach him a lesson.

77
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,380
I did drink his snake blood.

78
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,300
It's okay for him to trouble me.

79
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,700
We can forgive him.

80
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,580
He bullied you

81
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,420
but you couldn't beat him.

82
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,300
Now I help you, but you forgive him.

83
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,180
Seems like I'm the bad guy.

84
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,700
I'll do it.

85
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,140
Rong.

86
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,900
Heroine.

87
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,860
- Spare me.
- Rong.

88
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,140
Heroine.

89
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,820
- Rong.
- Spare me.

90
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,700
Rong.

91
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,940
Mercy! Please!

92
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,220
You can go.

93
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,900
Go.

94
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,020
This Beggar's Chicken

95
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,300
smells so good.

96
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
Sir, thank you for your help.

97
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,260
Sir, would you

98
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,180
like to join us?

99
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,740
That would be great.

100
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,180
But who won

101
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,300
the earlier match?

102
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,740
I jumped down first.

103
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,020
- So I lost.
- I lost. I lost.

104
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,140
I was already craving it,

105
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,620
no longer sleepy.

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,860
Divide it into three.

107
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,980
Give me the chicken butt.

108
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,340
Okay.

109
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,500
Here, sir.

110
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,100
Rong.

111
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,380
Thank you, Jing.

112
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,740
Even a beggar can't make

113
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,500
such a delicious Beggar's Chicken.

114
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,020
I was once a little beggar,

115
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,140
so I learned this skill.

116
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,980
You were a beggar?

117
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,740
I can't tell that.

118
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,020
You look fair and clean.

119
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
What do I look like then?

120
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,620
The chicken butt.

121
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,500
Here.

122
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,460
Sir, eat slowly.

123
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,380
No rush. You can have mine.

124
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,980
I can't accept that.

125
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,740
You haven't eaten yet.

126
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,860
- I...
- Yes, Rong.

127
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,740
You haven't eaten yet.

128
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,220
You can have mine.

129
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,100
Sir,

130
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
you can have mine too.

131
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,260
You're generous.

132
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,770
Alright.

133
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,860
I'm Guo Jing.

134
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,220
May I ask your name, sir?

135
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,100
My family name is Hong,

136
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,660
given name Qi.

137
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,000
You kids

138
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,360
can call me Qigong.
[*Gong: an adult male in Chinese]

139
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,900
This girl guessed me right.

140
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,740
So, I'm right.

141
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,540
You are Senior Qigong.

142
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,860
The other day,

143
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,620
I saw bad guys fighting.

144
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,140
The dart they dropped may be worth a penny.

145
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,340
You can take them

146
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,140
for the chicken.

147
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,980
We treat Qigong as a friend.

148
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,740
Friends don't need

149
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,180
money for food.

150
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,940
Well...

151
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,940
Well...

152
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,460
I- I...

153
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,500
I usually don't need to

154
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,620
pay for scraps. But...

155
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,140
But you gave me

156
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,020
such a good chicken.

157
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,980
I...

158
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,260
That's nothing.

159
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,260
I can make many better dishes.

160
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,860
Much better than that Chicken.

161
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,860
Really?

162
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,200
- Yes.
- Like what?

163
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,780
We can't cook here.

164
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,660
There's a deserted tavern nearby.

165
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,220
Tomorrow, we can get some food

166
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,340
and supplies.

167
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,540
Then I'll prepare more dishes for you.

168
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,500
Is that okay?

169
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,260
Good, good.

170
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,860
But

171
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,900
we have to make it clear.

172
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,620
If you two are

173
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,660
up to something,

174
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,340
tell me now.

175
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,620
Otherwise, I won't eat.

176
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,260
Qigong is perceptive.

177
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,580
But

178
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,380
how can we two kids

179
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,260
be up to no good?

180
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,100
You are a martial arts master.

181
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,020
We just want to learn some moves

182
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,300
from you.

183
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,260
Your father is skilled.

184
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,380
Why do you ask me?

185
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,860
Qigong, you know my father?

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,860
He is the Eastern Heretic.

187
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm the Northern Beggar.

188
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,380
We had already fought

189
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,260
countless times

190
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,380
before you were born.

191
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,460
When I first saw you,

192
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,780
you looked familiar.

193
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,020
But I can't recall who you are.

194
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,860
Then I saw your moves.

195
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,620
They are from the Peach Blossom Island.

196
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,740
And your expression now,

197
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,900
your eyebrows, your eyes,

198
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,860
look exactly the same

199
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,380
as that old monster.

200
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,100
Rong is not a monster.

201
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,860
No monster is this pretty.

202
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,700
Yes. Yes. Yes.

203
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,900
Yes, yes, not a monster.

204
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,780
You silly boy.

205
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,460
Your martial arts is a mess.

206
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,500
And You're clumsy.

207
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,860
How can your father-in-law like you?

208
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,020
He hasn't met my father yet.

209
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
But if you can teach him one move or two,

210
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,260
my father will like him

211
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,260
for your sake.

212
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,260
And if you take Jing as an apprentice,

213
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,300
it...

214
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,540
Honestly,

215
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
I hate flattery

216
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,260
and never take apprentices.

217
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,220
I don't want teach

218
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,060
a clumsy boy.

219
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,140
Jing isn't clumsy.

220
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,660
Don't you say that.

221
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
Fine, not clumsy.

222
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,380
But only you treasure

223
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,660
this silly boy.

224
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,860
I won't be tricked into teaching.

225
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,860
See you.

226
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,620
No way will I teach him

227
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,540
and let him marry

228
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Old Heretic Huang's daughter.

229
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,460
Rong, it's okay.

230
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,740
Jing, it smells so good.

231
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,100
Rong,

232
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,980
why do you

233
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
prepare so many dishes today?

234
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,740
If we can't eat them all,

235
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,140
that would be wasteful.

236
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,500
These dishes

237
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,660
were for Qigong.

238
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,820
But he didn't want them.

239
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,500
So these are for you now.

240
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,380
Jing, you can't let me down.

241
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,980
You must eat them all.

242
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,700
Okay.

243
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,260
I'll eat them all.

244
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,020
Though Senior Qigong

245
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,380
is a bit odd,

246
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,740
he is a nice person.

247
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,620
Great skills come with temper.

248
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,540
How does Qigong compare to your father?

249
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,860
My father said,

250
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,900
after Wang Chongyang, the Central Divine, died,

251
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,860
only Hong Qigong,

252
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,220
the Nine Fingered Divine Beggar

253
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,020
could rival him

254
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
in the world.

255
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,860
He also said

256
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,260
Senior Hong has a set of martial arts

257
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,260
that is unmatched

258
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,100
in the world.

259
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,900
It's a top-notch martial arts set.

260
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,980
Old Heretic Huang,

261
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,860
you think

262
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,380
you are the top one

263
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,500
after Wang's death.

264
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,500
I didn't expect

265
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,140
you still respect me.

266
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,540
What's that martial art?

267
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,500
My father mentioned it.

268
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,460
It's...

269
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,340
I can't remember.

270
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,220
Anyway, I hope Hong teaches you

271
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,260
that martial art.

272
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
What's it called?

273
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
It's...

274
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,100
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms!

275
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,340
I hate flattery

276
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,620
in my life,

277
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,340
but this isn't flattery.

278
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,780
He just accidentally

279
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,740
spoke the truth

280
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,020
to his daughter.

281
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,140
Qigong,

282
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,620
you're a well-known master.

283
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,380
Why did you eavesdrop on us?

284
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,740
Jing, bring the dishes.

285
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,340
Sure.

286
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,220
Let me join you!

287
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,020
I'm bad-tempered but can't resist

288
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,900
good food.

289
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,780
When I see good food, I'll forget everything.

290
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,020
No wonder ancient people say

291
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,380
fingers won't stay still with good food.

292
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,340
When I see good dishes,

293
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,740
my index finger

294
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
twitches nonstop.

295
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,140
I missed an important thing

296
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,020
for my gluttony.

297
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,260
I was so mad

298
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,260
and cut off my forefinger.

299
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,620
You can cut off your finger,

300
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,100
but can't cut off your gluttony.

301
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,500
I can never change that.

302
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,260
People should enjoy food.

303
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,380
Or what's the meaning of life?

304
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,460
What do you think?

305
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,100
Lamb rump,

306
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,620
pig ears,

307
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,140
calf kidney,

308
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
what's the last one?

309
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,380
I can't tell.

310
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,260
Can you make a guess?

311
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,980
Venison and rabbit mixed.

312
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,740
Impressive!

313
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,380
There are five types of meat.

314
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,340
but mixing pork and lamb is one variation,

315
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,980
while combining venison and beef is another.

316
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
Some of the variations

317
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,100
are hard to tell.

318
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,500
Normally, the five differnet meats

319
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
blend into 25 variations,

320
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,500
a multiple of plum blossom petals.

321
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,020
And it resembles a flute,

322
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,300
so this dish is called

323
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,460
Whose Jade Flute Lures Falling Plum Blossoms.

324
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,420
Whose means to test someone.

325
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,580
Congratulations, Qigong. You're right.

326
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,180
You're a diner champion.

327
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,300
Good!

328
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,020
This lotus leaf bamboo shoot soup with cherries

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,460
looks beautiful.

330
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,100
Almost too pretty to eat.

331
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,260
The lotus leaf is pure, bamboo shoots fresh,

332
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,020
and cherries sweet. I can tell.

333
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,260
But what's inside the cherry?

334
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,180
It's not the pit.

335
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,580
Give it another try.

336
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,900
Turtledove.

337
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,020
This lotus petals bamboo shoot cherries soup

338
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,860
with turtledove,

339
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,220
is there anything special in it?

340
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,580
You missed one thing.

341
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,420
What?

342
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,580
A few petals?

343
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,100
Correct.

344
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,180
The specialty of this dish

345
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
lies in these five ingredients.

346
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,180
What is it?

347
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,780
Come on. Cough it up.

348
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,700
I'll give you a hint.

349
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,660
Think of Classic of Poetry.

350
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,100
That's even worse.

351
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,580
I'm a beggar.

352
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,980
I don't read.

353
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,820
Come on, just tell me.

354
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,780
Look at the cherry lips and floral beauty,

355
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,580
isn't that about a beauty?

356
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,900
Beauty soup?

357
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,970
Bamboo shoot eliminate inner weakness

358
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,820
which signifies nobility,

359
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,500
and lotus is the flower of nobility.

360
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,700
So the bamboo shoot and lotus leaf

361
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,220
signify a true gentleman.

362
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,660
So, Beauty and Gentleman Soup?

363
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,940
What about the turtledove?

364
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,660
It must come with

365
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,820
the beauty and the gentleman.

366
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,660
The first poem in the Classic of Poetry,

367
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,260
"Merrily the ospreys cry,
on the islet in the stream.

368
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,660
Gentle and graceful is the girl,
a fit wife for the gentleman."

369
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,660
So this is called

370
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Love-matching Soup.

371
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,460
Only your father

372
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,420
could have such a clever daughter

373
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,300
who can come up with those ideas.

374
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,900
I don't know about the love-matching part,

375
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,060
but the soup is great.

376
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,100
Boy,

377
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,700
is this girl

378
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,260
your wife?

379
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,500
Great!

380
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,580
You are in for a treat.

381
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Most importantly,

382
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,740
she cares a lot about your future.

383
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,740
Rong is a very good girl.

384
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,660
Good. Very good.

385
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,980
Since I've eaten

386
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,100
your excellent dishes,

387
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,100
I should repay you

388
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,980
by teaching you a few moves.

389
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,180
Jing,

390
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,260
bow to your master.

391
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,340
As always,

392
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
I don't take apprentices.

393
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,500
Teaching you martial arts

394
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,540
is just to pay for

395
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,380
these dishes.

396
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,820
Little girl, you prepare meals for me,

397
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,820
and I'll teach him martial arts in return.

398
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,900
How about it? Fair, right?

399
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,300
It's a deal.

400
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,860
Great!

401
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,700
Go hit the tree.

402
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,660
You boy

403
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
have got good fundamentals

404
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,180
and strength,

405
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,060
but your skills are lacking.

406
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,660
What should I teach you?

407
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,020
That's a tough one.

408
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,580
Alright.

409
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,580
For your good character,

410
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,500
I'll teach you.

411
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,220
I don't care whether you can learn it.

412
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,740
Maybe you can't even learn it.

413
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,740
If you can't learn it,

414
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,900
don't blame me.

415
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,460
Or your wife will

416
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,020
tell her father that I'm snorty.

417
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,820
Qigong,

418
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,780
Ronger isn't my wife yet.

419
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,020
I'm not talking about your wife.

420
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,940
I'm talking about moves.

421
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,020
Here.

422
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,780
Watch this.

423
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,340
This move is The Proud Dragon Repents.

424
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,660
The focus is on

425
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,780
repenting,

426
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,100
not on pride.

427
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,540
What's behind the pride?

428
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,100
Powerful,

429
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,060
and imposing.

430
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Think about a dragon flying high.

431
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,580
You use all your strength,

432
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,580
thinking you've won,

433
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,740
but you've lost.

434
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,020
The Proud Dragon Repents,
but one should not be too proud.

435
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,180
Strike with one part of your strength,

436
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,220
leaving ten parts

437
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,060
in reserve.

438
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,260
That's the way to remain undefeated.

439
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,260
As for repenting,

440
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,420
it reminds us that

441
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,900
after strength

442
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,460
comes decline.

443
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,020
In life, it would be better

444
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,940
to leave some leeway.

445
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,660
Give it a try.

446
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,900
That is not The Proud Dragon Repents.

447
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,180
That is The Bug Repents.

448
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,940
Try again.

449
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,900
Why did I want that food?

450
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,740
Why did I promise

451
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,660
to teach you martial arts?

452
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,740
This one is not bad.

453
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,740
Keep going.

454
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,740
Okay.

455
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,780
Qigong,

456
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,100
what do you think of Jing?

457
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,660
A bit clumsy,

458
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,020
but teachable.

459
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,420
Please teach him well.

460
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,500
I'll prepare different dishes for you
every day,

461
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,020
so you can taste all the delicious food.

462
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,380
Qigong,

463
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,540
you've taught Jing

464
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,460
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

465
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,260
Shouldn't you teach me too?

466
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,540
If he gets stronger

467
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,540
and bullies me, what should I do?

468
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,740
Qigong, you are the best.

469
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,100
Jing,

470
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,340
you've been practicing for so long.

471
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,340
Take a break.

472
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,540
Have some water.

473
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,500
Thanks, Rong.

474
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,900
But I want to practice a bit more.

475
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,460
You've learned a whole set

476
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,340
from Qigong.

477
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,180
I've just mastered one move.

478
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,740
Why are there so many snakes?

479
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,700
Rong, be careful.

480
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,180
So, you drank

481
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,060
Liang Ziweng's viper blood,

482
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,820
immune to all poison.

483
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,460
No wonder my precious snakes

484
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,300
all fear you.

485
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,500
Ouyang Ke,

486
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,940
what are you doing here?

487
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,780
Liang Ziweng told me you are here.

488
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,340
So I'm here.

489
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,180
You came here for me?

490
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,340
Of course.

491
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,020
Ever since we met in Zhongdu,

492
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,340
you've been on my mind.

493
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,620
Rong,

494
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,260
come back to Mount White Camel with me.

495
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,500
Rong won't go with you.

496
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,980
Rong won't go with me

497
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,300
all because of you.

498
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,020
I'll kill you today.

499
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,220
Jing, watch out!

500
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,660
(In just a few days,)

501
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,260
(this brat has improved so much.)

502
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,820
Why do you keep using

503
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,700
the same move?

504
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,140
This move

505
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,220
is enough to beat you.

506
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,580
Ridiculous!

507
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,860
Rong,

508
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,980
come with me.

509
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,580
Jing!

510
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,660
Are you alright?

511
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,340
I'm fine.

512
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,420
A master is here.

513
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,020
Guo Jing can resist snake poison,

514
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,660
but can you?

515
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,420
That's Old Venomous Creature's

516
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,660
leftover tricks from ten years ago.

517
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,340
Now you bring them out to show off.

518
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,460
Who are you, sir?

519
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,020
We can't tell you

520
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,260
his name.

521
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,660
If you know that, you must be scared.

522
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,540
You're Ouyang Feng's son?

523
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,260
You know my uncle?

524
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,180
I haven't seen

525
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,540
Old Venomous Creature in 20 years.

526
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,100
He's still alive?

527
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,740
My uncle always says,

528
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,180
his friends aren't all dead yet,

529
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
so he wouldn't

530
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,220
dare to die first.

531
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,260
You talk well.

532
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,700
What are you doing here

533
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,700
with your precious snakes?

534
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,500
I've always been in the Western Regions.

535
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,940
I felt lonely on the journey

536
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
to the Central Plains,

537
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,420
so I raised some snakes for fun.

538
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,540
I'm sorry to offend you, sir.

539
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,780
Pah!

540
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,940
With so many women accompanying you,

541
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,940
how can you still be lonely?

542
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,740
But none of them

543
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,300
is as good as you, Rong.

544
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,580
- Shame on you!
- Shame on you!

545
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,540
You mess around in the Western Regions,

546
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,820
no problem.

547
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,180
But you mess around in the Central Plains.

548
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,740
That's a problem.

549
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,780
For your uncle's sake,

550
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,980
I'll spare you today.

551
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,380
You can go now.

552
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,100
Silly boy,

553
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,220
come here.

554
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,900
Help me pick them up.

555
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,860
Good stuff,

556
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,780
very nutritious.

557
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,940
I'll make a whole snake banquet for you!

558
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,460
You know what?

559
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,820
Snakes are dangerous alive,

560
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
but they taste delicious.

561
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,740
Jing.

562
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,180
Thanks, Rong.

563
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,180
Qigong,

564
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,260
who is Ouyang Ke's uncle?

565
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,340
Sounds like quite a person.

566
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,260
Eastern Heretic, Western Venom,
Southern Emperor, Northern Beggar

567
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,140
and Central Divine.

568
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,850
Her father is Eastern Heretic.

569
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,020
Western Venom

570
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,020
is Ouyang Feng.

571
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,420
20 years ago at the Duel atop Mount Huashan,

572
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,260
Central Divine won in martial arts.

573
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
But he passed away early.

574
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,740
So now, the four of us old folks...

575
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,470
We are about the same level,

576
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,420
evenly matched.

577
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
I think Ouyang Ke

578
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,180
isn't that great,

579
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,500
so how skilled can his uncle be?

580
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,060
Your father is skilled, right?

581
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,980
And I'm not bad, huh?

582
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Of course not.

583
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,660
There you go.

584
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,100
As for Western Venom, Ouyang Feng,

585
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,260
his character

586
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,460
and martial arts skills

587
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,500
are quite unique.

588
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,180
He uses deadly poisons

589
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,220
that no one can counter.

590
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,460
He likes snakes.

591
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,340
Snakes?

592
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,060
Like today's snake formation?

593
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
What was technique you used to break it,

594
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,100
Qigong?

595
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,260
It's a technique I devised

596
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
to counter

597
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,940
Old Venomous Creature's snake formation

598
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,100
called Rain of Petals.

599
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,900
Ouyang Ke's martial arts

600
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,820
are not up to par,

601
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,620
but he's good with the snake formation.

602
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,340
But we're not afraid of him.

603
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,940
Qigong, you are not afraid

604
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,940
of Old Venomous Creature.

605
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,300
But that young venomous creature

606
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,700
kept bothering Jing and me.

607
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,220
Is Ouyang Feng's nephew

608
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,500
bothering you?

609
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,500
That's a bit tricky.

610
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,340
What do you mean?

611
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
The Proud Dragon Repents

612
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,380
is not enough for Jing.

613
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,900
Teach him more moves.

614
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,020
He's clumsy. He won't learn.

615
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,860
I'll add one more dish every day.

616
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,420
For your dishes,

617
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,700
I'll teach him anyway.

618
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,020
Here, Qigong.

619
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,620
Have some more.

620
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,180
You need strength to teach him,

621
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,060
right?

622
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,060
Jing,

623
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,580
now I'll teach you

624
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,820
the first 15th palms
of Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

625
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,940
I always say you're clumsy,

626
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,980
but practicing martial arts

627
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,380
requires this

628
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,980
to build a solid foundation.

629
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,300
The Proud Dragon Repents.

630
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,540
The Dragon Soars in the Sky.

631
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,460
The Dragon is Seen in the Fields.

632
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,020
The Swan Descends Gracefully.

633
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,780
Use Not the Submerged Dragon.

634
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,900
Crossing Great Rivers.

635
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,100
A Sudden Advent.

636
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,900
Tremors that Shook the Land.

637
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,340
Diving into the Abyss.

638
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,180
The Twin Dragons Fetch Water.

639
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,620
The Fish Frolics in the Depths.

640
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,460
Timely Riding the Six Dragons.

641
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,220
Dark Clouds but No Rain.

642
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,300
With a Loss comes Confidence.

643
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,380
The Dragon Fights in the Wilderness.

644
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,700
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

645
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,980
Get out!

646
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,180
I told you I don't want to be disturbed.

647
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,900
Kang?

648
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,420
You're finally back.

649
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,180
I've been worried about you.

650
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,140
Father.

651
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,380
Father,

652
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,340
I'm here to say goodbye.

653
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,980
Where are you going?

654
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,060
To Mother's hometown,

655
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,540
Niujia Village, Lin'an,

656
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,980
to atone for my sins to Mother.

657
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,700
I won't come back.

658
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,220
Don't leave me.

659
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,940
Kang,

660
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,300
you...

661
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,340
you are not my biological son,

662
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,100
but these years,

663
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,660
I've treated you as my own.

664
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,020
This hasn't changed.

665
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,900
I'm as sad as you are.

666
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,220
I wanted to

667
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,500
burn this house down

668
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,460
to forget your mother

669
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,180
and you.

670
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,060
But I couldn't do it.

671
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,860
Kang!

672
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,460
You're my only son!

673
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,300
I've given you everything

674
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,180
since you were a kid.

675
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,100
If you will,

676
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,700
you can still take the Wanyan name.

677
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,500
After my death,

678
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,940
you can inherit my title

679
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,900
and become a prince.

680
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,580
Please stay,

681
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,140
okay?

682
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,180
Kang.

683
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,740
Nianci.

684
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,020
I can't go to Niujia Village with you for now.

685
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,260
Why?

686
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,860
I must stay.

687
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,900
Stay with Wanyan Honglie.

688
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,620
You still can't give up

689
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,580
wealth and honor.

690
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,820
That's true.

691
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,860
You have to work on the farmland

692
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,140
going back to the countryside.

693
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,220
That is much worse

694
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,340
than the easy life here.

695
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,380
It's up to you.

696
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,060
I won't force you.

697
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,540
Nianci,

698
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,460
you got me wrong.

699
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,860
Just thinking about

700
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,700
living a simple life

701
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,940
with you is wonderful.

702
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,300
But now,

703
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,340
Wanyan Honglie is after

704
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,900
General Yue Fei's Book of Wumu.

705
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,460
If he gets it,

706
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,180
- Our Song will...
- No need to explain.

707
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,540
Stay if you want.

708
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,180
I'll assume you have your reasons.

709
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,780
If you want to go back someday,

710
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,540
just tell me.

711
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,940
Nianci,

712
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,780
you trust me,

713
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,460
don't you?

714
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,140
It's not about

715
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,500
what you say now,

716
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,020
but what you will do

717
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,980
in the future.

718
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,620
I worry if we go back now,

719
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,900
the villagers will gossip about you

720
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,780
marrying a Wanyan.

721
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,140
How could I bear to see you treated like that?

722
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,460
If I get the Book of Wumu for our Song,

723
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,860
no one will look down on us.

724
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,940
Then we'll return to Niujia Village

725
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,620
and stay forever.

726
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,500
Well,

727
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,060
you must keep in mind

728
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,500
