00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,680
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 11=

3
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,130
Kang?

4
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
It's you!

5
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,120
I heard you were captured at Lake Tai.

6
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
I was worried sick

7
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,780
and couldn't sleep.

8
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,490
So I sent troops overnight.

9
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,590
Thank heavens.

10
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,460
Father finally found you.

11
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Kang?

12
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,780
Wanyan Honglie,

13
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
Today, I will

14
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,660
settle this.

15
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,110
You must know

16
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,620
this dagger better than I do.

17
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,590
Niujia Village in Lin'an, Song Dynasty.

18
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,290
You must also

19
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,620
remember it better than I do.

20
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,660
Of course.

21
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,830
You've never been there.

22
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,430
But Father has been once or twice.

23
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,520
You incited Duan Tiande

24
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,830
to kill my father!

25
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,500
Kang, what lies have you heard now?

26
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,170
Father is standing here,

27
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,080
perfectly fine.

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,430
My father is Yang Tiexin!

29
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,500
My name is Yang Kang!

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,580
(Yang Kang)

31
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,150
You despicable scoundrel

32
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,870
killed my whole family

33
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,710
and pretended to save my mother.

34
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,740
Poor mother, kind and innocent,

35
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,240
tricked by you, her husband's killer,

36
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,660
for most of her life.

37
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,110
You're so ruthless.

38
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
Fine.

39
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,340
A real man takes responsibility.

40
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,660
Yes, Kang.

41
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,610
When I first saw your mother

42
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,660
in Niujia Village,

43
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,710
I never forgot her.

44
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,460
I loved her.

45
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,970
To have her,

46
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,200
I had Duan Tiande create

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,950
the Niujia Village incident.

48
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,490
Kang,

49
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,830
I wronged your father Yang Tiexin

50
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,830
and your mother.

51
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,390
But I've never wronged you.

52
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,540
You're not my biological son,

53
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,590
but I've always treated you

54
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,220
as my own in these years!

55
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,750
I fought on the battlefield

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,490
to conquer the world,

57
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,530
So you could rule it

58
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,150
one day!

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,510
Kang, think about it.

60
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,300
You said I'm a ruthless person.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
But have I ever

62
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,660
hit or scolded you

63
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,900
all these years?

64
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,000
If you really don't want me

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,150
as your father,

66
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,900
then be a man

67
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,420
and make it quick!

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,300
Kill me.

69
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,710
And from now on,

70
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,750
you can live as Yang Kang.

71
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,500
(Yang Kang)

72
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,590
Life is short,

73
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,220
but you must make choices.

74
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,030
In Niujia Village,

75
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,300
I abandoned my conscience.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,540
But I married your mother

77
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,590
and became your father.

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,540
I have no regrets.

79
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,140
(Yang Kang)

80
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,780
You should run.

81
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,970
Guo Xiaotian's son

82
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,300
will be here to kill you soon.

83
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,710
Kang,

84
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,850
- you...
- Before I change my mind,

85
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,750
just go!

86
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,070
Not that way.

87
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
(Yang Kang)

88
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,490
Kang!

89
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
Kang!

90
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Brother Guo.

91
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,390
- Kang.
- Miss Huang.

92
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,640
Where is Wanyan Honglie?

93
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,510
Haven't found him yet.

94
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,070
Is that Wanyan Honglie's horse at the door?

95
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,810
Yes.

96
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,780
I saw the horse and came in.

97
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,420
It seems

98
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,030
he rested and then fled.

99
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,130
Fled?

100
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,900
I don't think so.

101
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,190
He could still be hiding here.

102
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,810
Jing,

103
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,510
we should search thoroughly.

104
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,110
Wanyan Honglie!

105
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,630
Where are you hiding?

106
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,110
Show yourself!

107
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,060
Stop that.

108
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,370
He probably

109
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,870
heard us talking.

110
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,890
Miss Huang,

111
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,630
are you kidding me?

112
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,850
Kang,

113
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,510
given your special status,

114
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,630
it's no surprise Rong is suspicious.

115
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,230
Miss Huang, don't worry.

116
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,320
I also want to

117
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,990
kill Wanyan Honglie now.

118
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,060
Since Wanyan Honglie was here,

119
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,660
he can't be far.

120
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,390
We should go chase him.

121
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,250
Let's go.

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,800
Go.

123
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,470
Sister Mu? Why are you here?

124
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
Brother Yang,

125
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,390
why do you frown

126
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,780
and sweat

127
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,390
seeing Sister Mu?

128
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,800
I just chased Wanyan Honglie,

129
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,660
still catching my breath.

130
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,290
Now I see Nianci

131
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,130
locked in a coffin.

132
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,580
How can I be at ease?

133
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,540
Nianci, why don't you speak?

134
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,030
Why didn't you call for help when you heard us?

135
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,840
Isn't it obvious?

136
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,180
She was acupoint blocked,

137
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,420
and couldn't move.

138
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,060
But most importantly,

139
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,990
who locked her here?

140
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,180
Ouyang Ke.

141
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,300
Did that lecher harm you?

142
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,660
I resisted to the death.

143
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,390
That wretched Ouyang Ke again.

144
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,680
Qigong should've killed him last time.

145
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,150
Next time I see that lecher,

146
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,390
I'll teach him a lesson.

147
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,560
Sister Mu,

148
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,700
you were locked in the stone coffin.

149
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,130
But Wanyan Honglie

150
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,030
was here just now.

151
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,900
Did you hear something?

152
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:18,970
Rong,

153
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,150
Sister Mu isn't feeling well.

154
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,510
We'll talk about it later.

155
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,920
Alright.

156
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,680
But Wanyan Honglie

157
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,750
must be nearby.

158
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,130
Let's go get him.

159
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,090
Kang.

160
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,290
You take care of Sister Mu.

161
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,820
We'll chase Wanyan Honglie.

162
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,280
Okay.

163
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,150
Brother Guo, you should go.

164
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,680
That scoundrel came south alone

165
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,520
with limited troops.

166
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,820
It's a rare chance.

167
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,540
Don't let him escape north.

168
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,510
You wait here for us.

169
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,840
Whether we find

170
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,750
Wanyan Honglie or not,

171
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,630
we'll come back for you.

172
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,030
Sister Mu, rest well.

173
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,030
We'll go chase that scoundrel.

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
Let's go.

175
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,520
Well done.

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,300
Nianci, it's my fault.

177
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,870
I didn't protect you.

178
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,840
You know how much I miss you.

179
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,680
Miss me? Or miss

180
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,750
being a Jin prince?

181
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,270
I can't believe that.

182
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,800
Won't you avenge

183
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,820
your parents?

184
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,660
I was blind

185
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,700
to love such a heartless person!

186
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,560
It's good that you still love me.

187
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,470
Yang Kang!

188
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,900
Why did you let him go?

189
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,090
You heard it?

190
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,470
I heard everything.

191
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,230
You released him.

192
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,060
You also told him which way to escape.

193
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,580
How couldn't you tell right from wrong?

194
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,300
I don't want to talk about that now.

195
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,990
I just care about your injury.

196
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,610
Are you cold?

197
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,630
Being locked in this desolate place,

198
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,900
you must be freezing.

199
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,280
Don't touch me!

200
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,390
And stop pretending to care about me.

201
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,820
I don't need it!

202
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,580
If you didn't need it,

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,060
you would have exposed me.

204
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,230
Since you heard everything,

205
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,300
you didn't tell Huang Rong and Guo Jing.

206
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,940
So you understand my predicament,

207
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,440
right?

208
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,800
I didn't want you

209
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,050
to be enemies with

210
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,300
Brother Guo and Sister Huang.

211
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,060
If they knew you let

212
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,370
your father's killer go

213
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,750
for the wealth,

214
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,060
would they spare you?

215
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,780
I have my reasons.

216
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,630
I should be grateful for his upbringing.

217
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,160
I can't kill him,

218
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,300
but they can.

219
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,480
If they want revenge,

220
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,410
I won't stop them!

221
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,470
Then why did you lie to them?

222
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,560
He killed your father!

223
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,400
Yes,

224
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,940
he's the enemy.

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,130
But to kill the one

226
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,480
who raised me for 18 years,

227
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,060
I just can't do it!

228
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,130
Nianci,

229
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,780
if I were that ruthless,

230
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,470
would you dare to stay with me?

231
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,180
All of you stand apart.

232
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,230
You are all filial children.

233
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,510
You act righteous.

234
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,530
So am I the only one

235
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,150
acting against moral value?

236
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,250
Do you think I chose

237
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,780
him to be my father?

238
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,110
I didn't choose any of this.

239
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
If you don't like it,

240
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,110
you can cut off the past

241
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,990
and start anew.

242
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,420
Is it that easy to cut off the past?

243
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,170
Every detail in the past

244
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,150
haunts me.

245
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,060
Wanyan Honglie raised me up.

246
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,890
He taught me to read,

247
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,770
ride and shoot.

248
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,820
He gave me everything I had!

249
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,660
Tell me.

250
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,180
If Brother Guo and Sister Huang

251
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,870
kill Wanyan Honglie,

252
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,420
will you hate them?

253
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
Yes,

254
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,110
I will hate them.

255
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,990
I also hate Wanyan Honglie.

256
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,420
In fact, I hate myself more.

257
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,030
My life

258
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,270
is destined to be in a dilemma.

259
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,010
I accept the life

260
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,150
and live on,

261
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,680
because heaven

262
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,820
left you for me.

263
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,920
Nianci,

264
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,110
you are my only hope.

265
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,300
Stop crying.

266
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,870
How can a grown man

267
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,900
cry like this?

268
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,580
It's shameful.

269
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,970
Rong,

270
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,300
we've searched for two hours

271
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,630
but not a trace.

272
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,110
Did we take the wrong path?

273
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,080
The route Yang Kang told us

274
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,990
must be wrong.

275
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,840
He let Wanyan Honglie go,

276
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,300
and told him we were after him.

277
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,900
That's why he's so cautious.

278
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,390
If Kang wanted wealth and power

279
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,390
by aligning with the Jins,

280
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,800
he would have gone

281
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,150
with Wanyan Honglie.

282
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,390
Maybe he has another plan.

283
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,680
Rong,

284
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,710
you're too biased against Kang.

285
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,680
Starting over alone

286
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,620
is hard.

287
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,170
Since

288
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,340
Kang's determined to change,

289
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,850
we should trust

290
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,690
and help him.

291
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,320
Alright.

292
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,340
I'll follow your lead.

293
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,410
But we'd better stop.

294
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,330
Let's go back

295
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,170
to Sister Mu.

296
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,360
Why?

297
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,890
We'll miss the chance

298
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,060
to kill that scoundrel.

299
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,380
We've already missed it.

300
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,010
Besides,

301
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,620
if Yang Kang and Sister Mu

302
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,810
encounter Ouyang Ke,

303
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,510
or a Jin ambush,

304
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,190
I'm worried they can't handle it.

305
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,210
Right,

306
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,580
I didn't think of that.

307
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,230
Let's go back.

308
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,430
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Brother Guo,

310
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,430
did you kill that scoundrel?

311
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,190
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,710
We lost him.

313
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,010
Justice prevails.

314
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,430
One day we'll kill him.

315
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,520
Jing,

316
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,610
shall we find an inn

317
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,470
to rest?

318
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,450
Rong's right.

319
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,910
Sister Mu

320
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,430
needs some rest now.

321
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,040
Sister Mu.

322
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,300
Miss Huang, let me do it.

323
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,950
Right, it's my bad.

324
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,910
I should let you get closer.

325
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,240
Rong, let's go.

326
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Let's go.

327
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,650
Let's go too.

328
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,470
(Yang Kang doesn't leave Sister Mu's side.)

329
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,130
(He must be guilty)

330
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,270
(fearing I'll get her to talk.)

331
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,450
Jing.

332
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,860
Since we're lodging

333
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,280
near the Southern Hill,

334
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,780
Let's go to a hot spring.

335
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,040
Hot spring?

336
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,100
Rong, what's that?

337
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,760
You grew up in the frontier,

338
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,600
so you don't know that.

339
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,130
Hot springs originated in the Six Dynasties.

340
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,820
They are the most elegant way to relax.

341
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,810
The hot springs inn on Southern Hill

342
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,910
is famous in Jiangnan.

343
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,120
But Miss Huang,

344
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,820
Nianci is not feeling well.

345
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,280
Sister Nianci has stayed in this damp place

346
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,330
for too long.

347
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,910
She needs a bath to ward off bad luck.

348
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,580
Is that right, Jing?

349
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,610
We've been on the road for so long.

350
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,450
Smell yourself.

351
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,240
No wonder your master is Qigong,

352
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,080
huh?

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,840
Let's go.

354
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,330
Guests, this way to the women's bath,

355
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,270
and this way to the men's bath.

356
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,120
Jing.

357
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,620
Let's stay in this inn tonight.

358
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,200
So Sister Mu

359
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,380
can rest well.

360
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,330
See you later.

361
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,170
Okay.

362
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,250
Let's go.

363
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,080
Let's get inside, Kang.

364
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,120
After you.

365
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,120
Sister Mu,

366
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,440
did you hear something

367
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,540
in the stone coffin?

368
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,970
No.

369
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,060
I heard nothing.

370
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,990
Sister Mu, you are not a good liar.

371
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,680
Your expression

372
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,910
told me everything.

373
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,140
(Huang Rong arranged it this way.)

374
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,670
(She must want to talk to Nianci.)

375
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,780
(Nianci is naive.)

376
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,670
(She can't handle Huang Rong.)

377
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,770
Brother Guo,

378
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,710
I've done something wrong.

379
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,060
Please punish me.

380
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,860
Kang, what do you mean?

381
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,230
I'm sorry

382
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,340
I lied to you.

383
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,860
I released Wanyan Honglie.

384
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,480
Yang Kang stabbed

385
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,470
Wanyan Honglie.

386
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,190
He really did.

387
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,380
But that scoundrel

388
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,330
used 18 years of upbringing

389
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,270
to manipulate him.

390
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,100
So he hesitated.

391
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,670
That's understandable.

392
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,910
After all, he raised him for 18 years.

393
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,820
That's true.

394
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,190
If I were Yang Kang,

395
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,030
I couldn't do it either.

396
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,470
It's totally my fault forcing you

397
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,030
to kill your foster father.

398
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,780
Brother Guo, don't mention that.

399
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,510
I'd rather you can kill him.

400
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,230
Then we can drink together

401
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,710
and forget the past.

402
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,750
That would be great.

403
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:09,770
Yes.

404
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,280
Today,

405
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,860
you told me you released Wanyan Honglie,

406
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,230
which shows

407
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,750
your sincerity towards me.

408
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,230
Brothers should support each other,

409
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,750
not coerce each other.

410
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,140
I'll handle the revenge.

411
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,010
Thank you, Brother Guo.

412
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,620
What do you plan to do in the future?

413
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,430
After all that happened at Guiyun Manor,

414
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,950
I feel like I died and came back.

415
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,860
I've made up my mind.

416
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
Tomorrow, I'll go with Nianci

417
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,040
to Niujia Village.

418
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,770
Kang,

419
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,380
if you truly think that way,

420
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,580
it's wonderful.

421
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
When I kill

422
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,540
Wanyan Honglie,

423
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,030
I'll go to the Niujia Village with Rong

424
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,620
to find you and Sister Mu.

425
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,200
Let's live a life that we work at sunrise

426
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,540
and rest at sunset.

427
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,560
Great.

428
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,540
Have some chicken soup.

429
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,470
I asked the innkeeper to prepare it.

430
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,650
You...

431
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,200
You really want to

432
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,510
go to the Niujia Village with me?

433
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,270
It's my idea.

434
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,580
So I really want to go.

435
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,190
What about the Book of Wumu?

436
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,340
- And the Song...
- I don't care if the world changes

437
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,580
or the land is shattered.

438
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,380
If you don't understand,

439
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,270
it means nothing even if I become

440
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,450
a great hero.

441
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,620
With you by my side,

442
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,710
the fall of the Song will be nothing.

443
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,620
If the Jins come,

444
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,170
we'll still have a piece of land

445
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,010
to live out our days.

446
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,300
It's nothing different.

447
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
What?

448
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,880
Isn't that good?

449
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,230
I don't want you to give up

450
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,710
your ambitions for me.

451
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,100
Please don't think so.

452
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,190
Wanyan Honglie was right.

453
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,910
Life is about choices.

454
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,470
Since I chose to be with you,

455
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,430
I'll forget about being a prince.

456
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,750
But...

457
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,930
But what?

458
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,580
But,

459
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,240
go take some soup

460
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,300
to Sister Rong.

461
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:56,930
Okay.

462
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,470
Here, Rong. Have some water.

463
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,410
I was careless.

464
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,470
I pushed him too hard.

465
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,610
I shouldn't have forced Kang

466
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,620
to seek revenge with me.

467
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,960
Both your master and I told you

468
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,860
not to involve him.

469
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,230
But you wouldn't listen.

470
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,380
Repaying evil with good

471
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,990
was his choice.

472
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,780
It's not wrong.

473
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
If he repays evil with good,

474
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,510
I wouldn't be worried.

475
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,130
But he can't let go

476
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,540
of being a prince.

477
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,410
Wanyan Honglie promised him

478
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,340
a bright future.

479
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,230
He couldn't bear to seek revenge.

480
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,090
Rong, there you go again.

481
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,030
You'll see.

482
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,810
He won't easily go back

483
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,140
to Niujia Village with Sister Mu.

484
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,570
He'll have various ways

485
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,430
to deceive Sister Mu.

486
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,020
(Refreshing Serenity)

487
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,750
Kang and Sister Mu are left.

488
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,620
Without saying goodbye,

489
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,850
He must be feeling guilty

490
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,750
and avoiding us.

491
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,430
Maybe he's eager to go home.

492
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,090
We should go to Zhongdu now.

493
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,580
We need to get there ahead of Yang Kang.

494
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

495
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,240
Two guests.

496
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,410
This is a letter from Mr. Yang

497
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,380
(To Guo Jing)
to Mr. Guo.

498
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,930
Brother Guo, Sister Rong,

499
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,650
Nianci and I are eager to return.

500
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,620
We'll go to Niujia Village.

501
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,750
Brother Guo, please avenge our parents,

502
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,300
kill Wanyan Honglie,

503
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,620
protect the Song Dynasty

504
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,140
and keep our promise.

505
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,250
Look, Rong.

506
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,970
Kang went home

507
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,230
and reminded us of our mission.

508
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,060
Alright,

509
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,540
I trust him.

510
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,710
But we still have to go now

511
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,300
to avoid unexpected delays.

512
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,520
Okay.

513
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,410
Go.

514
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,440
Let's go check on

515
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,710
my friends in Jintan first.

516
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,730
Guests.

517
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,600
We'll take your horses.

518
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,650
Thank you.

519
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,960
Tolui and Huazheng have been

520
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,270
staying here for a few days.

521
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,850
I wonder how Huazheng

522
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,690
is doing now.

523
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,470
Huazheng is

524
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,610
the Mongolian princess

525
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,820
you're betrothed to, right?

526
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,100
We grew up together.

527
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,910
But Huazheng is like

528
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,060
a sister to me.

529
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,470
Now that we've met again,

530
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,060
I must explain to her clearly.

531
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
But,

532
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,190
Huazheng is injured now.

533
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,440
Telling her about the broken engagement

534
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,820
will only make her feel worse.

535
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,410
How about

536
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,060
telling her when she recovers?

537
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,880
Okay.

538
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,540
You're thoughtful, Rong.

539
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,100
- Guo Jing!
- Brother Tolui.

540
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,100
(Jebe, a Mongolian general)

541
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,770
Master Jebe.

542
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,140
How is Huazheng's injury?

543
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,280
The weather is cold these days.

544
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,190
She caught a chill.

545
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,280
And her previous wound

546
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,120
is not fully healed.

547
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,710
She is very weak.

548
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,470
Let her rest a few more days,

549
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,000
and recover well.

550
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,840
No.

551
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,780
We must march overnight to Lin'an,

552
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,120
or

553
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,990
we'll delay the alliance
between Mongolia and Song.

554
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,950
Can you take care of Huazheng?

555
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,910
She's too weak.

556
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,620
We worry she can't

557
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,130
endure the journey.

558
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:52,970
Of course.

559
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,510
I'll take care of Huazheng.

560
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,950
Before we left,

561
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,370
everyone opposed the princess

562
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,210
coming with us.

563
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,140
The Khan couldn't refuse her.

564
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,950
She has endured

565
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,710
countless hardships

566
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,060
along the journey.

567
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,030
She's done this

568
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,580
just for you.

569
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,320
But

570
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,670
she met you.

571
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,430
Finally,

572
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,380
she fulfilled her wish.

573
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,040
Who's this?

574
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,300
I'm his sister.

575
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,120
Brother Tolui,

576
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,040
Master Jebe,

577
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,340
rest assured.

578
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,650
We'll take care of Huazheng.

579
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

580
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,280
The agreed time with

581
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,190
the Song is almost here.

582
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,580
We must depart now.

583
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,780
Guo Jing, please take care of her.

584
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,650
Guo Jing.

585
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,030
Guo Jing.

586
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,780
Do you remember that white eagle?

587
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,280
I saw it.

588
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,990
Guo Jing.

589
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,470
Guo Jing.

590
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,300
Go back to the grasslands.

591
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,190
Go back to the grasslands.

592
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,450
Rong.

593
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,060
How's Huazheng?

594
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,360
Does she wake up?

595
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,780
Her injuries are fine.

596
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,430
But she still has a fever.

597
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,670
And she keeps muttering

598
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,470
about going back with you.

599
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,540
The grasslands are so far away.

600
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,510
She's suffered so much.

601
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,370
You stay with her.

602
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,210
I'll decoct the herbs.

603
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,010
Rong.

604
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,230
She kept calling your name just now.

605
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,270
You're quite close.

606
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,820
We are like family.

607
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,990
Huazheng, Tolui

608
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,470
and I

609
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,270
grew up together

610
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,340
on the grasslands.

611
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,650
Brother Tolui,

612
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,130
I won the horse race again.

613
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:57,970
Brother Guo,

614
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,240
your horse is

615
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,620
indeed the fastest on the grasslands.

616
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,890
In the future,

617
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,000
you will be the bravest man

618
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,950
on our grasslands

619
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,320
You too.

620
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,250
Guo Jing!

621
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,340
- Guo Jing!
- Huazheng?

622
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,380
Look! What's that?

623
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,030
Looks like many eagles are fighting.

624
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,230
- Khan.
- Brother Tolui.

625
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,230
Although the white eagle is fierce,

626
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,580
(Temüjin, Genghis Khan)
the black eagles

627
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,230
attack with unity

628
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,650
and strategy.

629
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,000
They are more suited to survive

630
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,840
on our grasslands.

631
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,840
I don't care.

632
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,250
Father,

633
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,890
the white eagle is dying.

634
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,990
Please shoot the black eagle.

635
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,910
Who will shoot this arrow?

636
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,750
The one who hits the target
will be highly rewarded.

637
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,670
Jing,

638
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,730
you go shoot.

639
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,820
- Me?
- Guo Jing,

640
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,100
an ordinary man

641
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,230
can't draw my bow.

642
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,730
Take it.

643
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,250
Brother Guo.

644
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,540
Show them what you got.

645
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,860
I envy you.

646
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,750
You have the childhood friendship.

647
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,650
Didn't you have friends

648
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,780
you grew up with?

649
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:52,930
No.

650
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,300
Since I was born,

651
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,540
my father and I have lived
on Peach Blossom Island.

652
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,340
No wonder you escaped
from Peach Blossom Island.

653
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,800
Yes.

654
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,340
So I envy Huazheng.

655
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,680
She can openly

656
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,520
love you,

657
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,820
and love you straightforwardly.

658
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,610
Rong,

659
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,260
I'll tell Huazheng everything

660
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,100
once she gets better.

661
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,920
Alright,

662
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,280
I know that.

663
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,540
I'll check on the herbs.

664
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:30,770
Are you alright?

665
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,700
I'm fine.

666
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:45,870
Guo Jing.

667
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,990
You've had a hard journey.

668
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,100
Why did you have to come south?

669
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,330
You are my fiancé.

670
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,170
Huazheng, you... Let me go.

671
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,030
I must find you.

672
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,180
You should have some rest.

673
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,250
I don't care how far apart we are,

674
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,180
even if wildfires burn through the grasslands,

675
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,390
Jing, I miss you so much.

676
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,870
She is... I...

677
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,690
I'm Huang Rong.

678
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,540
In our Central Plains, there's a saying,

679
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,540
"Men and women should not
have intimate contact."

680
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,960
Now you are not

681
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
feeling well.

682
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,030
I'll take care of you.

683
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,600
Men are clumsy.

684
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,440
They only get in the way.

685
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,260
Do you know who I am?

686
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,430
You are the Mongolian princess,

687
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,790
betrothed to Jing.

688
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,320
Take a sip.

689
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,160
- Rong.
- Jing.

690
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,030
- Huazheng.
- Guo Jing.

691
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:58,690
Guo Jing.

692
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,690
Where did you go?

693
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,470
I went to get herbs for you.

694
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,580
How are you feeling?

695
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,690
Much better.

696
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,610
Here, Huazheng.

697
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,060
Is it still too hot?

698
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,320
Here.

699
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,510
Still too hot?

700
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,400
So clumsy.

701
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,690
I'll do it.

702
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,770
No need.

703
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,870
Guo Jing's doing great.

704
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,480
Jing.

705
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,060
- A little to the right.
- It's flying so high.

706
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
To the right.

707
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,100
- Huazheng.
- I want to play too.

708
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,960
Here.

709
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,040
Hold it steady.

710
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,880
Give it to me.

711
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:19,570
Rong!

712
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,480
Rong!

713
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,690
Where are you going?

714
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,930
Where can I go?

715
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,350
I'm going back to Peach Blossom Island.

716
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,260
Staying here, I feel out of place.

717
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,400
Rong,

718
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,510
you're confusing me.

719
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,600
You didn't let me tell Huazheng

720
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,510
about us,

721
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,790
but now you're angry.

722
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,060
Yes, it's my own fault.

723
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,120
I didn't want to put you

724
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,100
in a difficult position.

725
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,870
But now I'm just being superfluous.

726
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,960
Rong,

727
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,320
listen to me...

728
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,430
Don't say anything.

729
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Go back to the grasslands

730
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,390
and be the Prince Consort.

731
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,660
Don't come to find me.

732
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,260
Or my father will kill you.

733
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,730
Rong,

734
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,530
I'm not smart.

735
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,830
Don't be angry.

736
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,400
I'll go

737
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,870
explain everything to Huazheng now.

738
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,610
Guo Jing.

739
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,800
Do you like her?

740
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,430
Do you like me?

741
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,570
Huezheng,

742
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,350
I've treated you like a sister

743
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,620
since childhood,

744
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,840
just like Brother Tolui.

745
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,620
- Rong!
- Sister?

746
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,310
Since you've treated me like a sister,

747
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,390
why did you take that golden knife?

748
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,920
Take it.

749
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,880
Khan...

750
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,170
What's wrong?

751
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,140
You don't like this golden knife?

752
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,320
Brother Guo.

753
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,360
Thank the Khan.

754
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,250
This is the highest honor on the grasslands.

755
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,060
It's not that I don't want this golden knife,

756
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,400
but

757
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,100
I want to ask the Khan for something.

758
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,050
Tell me.

759
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,370
I heard you want to betroth Huazheng

760
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,060
to Dushi, Wang Khan's grandson.

761
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,310
I beg the Khan not to marry Huazheng

762
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,770
to him.

763
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,990
Because Dushi is very bad.

764
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,440
He always bullies our tribe's people.

765
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,280
He hits us.

766
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,140
If you marry him,

767
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,510
he will bully you.

768
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,260
If you don't like me,

769
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,810
why do you care

770
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,650
if I get bullied?

771
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,120
Because you are my sister.

772
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,220
I asked Father to allow me to come south

773
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,390
to know your true feelings.

774
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,700
Now that I know that,

775
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,220
I have to go.

776
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,840
Huazheng,

777
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,910
you are not recovered yet.

778
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,960
You should stay

779
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,190
and wait for Tolui

780
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,320
and Master Jebe.

781
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,440
No need.

782
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,050
Guo Jing.

783
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,180
No matter what will happen,

784
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,060
our engagement still stands.

785
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,790
As long as you return to the grasslands,

786
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,100
I'll wait for you.
