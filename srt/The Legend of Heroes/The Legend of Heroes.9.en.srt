00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,980
=Hot Blooded=

2
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,180
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,790
Junior sister.

4
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,590
I will go find
the Seven Immortals of Quanzhen

5
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,300
to avenge Master.

6
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,140
Lu Chengfeng.

7
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,580
Let's go now.

8
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,540
We won't come back

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,780
until we avenge him.

10
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,940
Please wait!

11
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,300
Do you want me to kill you now?

12
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,660
- Come on!
- Zhen'e!

13
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,900
We are ready to fight at any time.

14
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,660
Your skills are indeed impressive.

15
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,580
I happened

16
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,540
to steal it.

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,580
Please forgive me.

18
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,820
Jing.

19
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,580
I'll tell you now

20
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,140
the mystery behind this.

21
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,740
There is a diamond on this ring.

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,340
When you attack,

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,620
you use the diamond

24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,940
to break the wine glass.

25
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,460
What a master.

26
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,980
Really knows how to play.

27
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,900
Mr. Qiu.

28
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,780
It turns out that you

29
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,980
are just bluffing.

30
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,460
Here you go.

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,100
Little girl.

32
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,420
Mr. Qiu loves to deceive people.

33
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,300
What he says may not be true.

34
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,060
Mr. Huang is a master of martial arts.

35
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,260
Furthermore,

36
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,500
the Seven Immortals of Quanzhen

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,540
are all decent men.

38
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,580
There is no grudge
between them and your father.

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,940
How could they get into a fight?

40
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,420
Apart from this diamond,

41
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,060
he has many other things

42
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,300
on him.

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,740
Take a look.

44
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,100
What are these for?

45
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,700
It's fossil powder.

46
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,380
He just lit this up first

47
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,780
and hid it in the sleeves,

48
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,180
sucked it into the mouth

49
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,300
and spitted it out.

50
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,020
You scammer.

51
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,260
Did my father really die?

52
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,980
If you curse him,

53
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,820
I'll kill you.

54
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,740
If I say he's dead,

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,340
you will kill me.

56
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,460
I guess he's not dead.

57
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,900
It's not sure.

58
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,180
Qiu Qianren.

59
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,900
You said

60
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,220
Seven Immortals of Quanzhen killed my master.

61
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,220
You saw it with your own eyes

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,100
or it's just a rumor?

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,340
A month ago,

64
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,900
I fought Hong Qigong

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,460
at the peak of Mount Tai.

66
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,340
When he lost to me,

67
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,260
he accidentally mentioned this.

68
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,980
With your skills,

69
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,020
how could you defeat Hong Qigong?

70
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,260
A month ago, Qigong

71
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,540
was with me and Jing.

72
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,140
- Really?
- Yes.

73
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,460
Then it was two months ago.

74
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm not sure.

75
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,540
Vengeance has a way of rebounding upon oneself.

76
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,300
We should be lenient wherever it is possible.

77
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,340
Since none of you believe me,

78
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,980
I have nothing more to say.

79
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,100
I'll say! I'll say! I'll say!

80
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,940
Actually,

81
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,780
it's very interesting.

82
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,940
For example,

83
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,780
the big vat that I was lifting

84
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,340
was made of tin.

85
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,580
Seal the opening of the vat

86
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,020
and fill it with water three inches deep,

87
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,740
then it becomes very light

88
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,140
but appears that

89
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,740
I have innate divine power.

90
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
And my ability to walk on water.

91
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,580
In fact, I had put

92
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,020
wooden stakes in the water,

93
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,660
which are six inches
away from the water surface.

94
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,220
That way, I can be able to

95
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,540
walk on the water.

96
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,500
To tell you the truth,

97
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,420
I am still savoring the pleasure of it.

98
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,780
If you are interested,

99
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
you can give it a try.

100
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
It's quite fun.

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,380
(Ninghui Pavilion)

102
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,420
Why bother?

103
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,860
So how is my father?

104
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,420
Your father is blessed.

105
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,060
It must have been a false alarm.

106
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,540
Congratulations!

107
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,380
That's great, Rong.

108
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,500
Your father is fine.

109
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,420
Stop.

110
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,700
Jing.

111
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,820
Don't chase.

112
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,780
Why bother

113
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
with a scammer?

114
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,700
Yes.

115
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,300
As long as Master is fine,

116
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,540
I'm relieved.

117
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,380
Lu Chengfeng.

118
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,340
Since Master is fine,

119
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,020
let's talk about our own matter.

120
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,580
I came this time

121
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,480
to save my disciple Wanyan Kang.

122
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,390
If you let him go,

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,980
I will forget about the past.

124
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,820
No.

125
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,540
Yang Kang acknowledged the enemy as his father.

126
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,980
Unless he cleans up his act,

127
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,020
otherwise,

128
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,190
he'll be imprisoned in Guiyun House forever.

129
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,620
Senior Mei.

130
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,420
Huang's words make sense.

131
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,220
If we let Yang Kang go,

132
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,020
it's like releasing a tiger
back to the mountain.

133
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,460
Our Song Empire will be in danger.

134
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,100
Since he is your disciple,

135
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,780
I will leave him here

136
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,860
to reflect on his mistakes.

137
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,850
I won't make things difficult for him.

138
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,260
Furthermore,

139
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,460
Mr. Qiu just now

140
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,380
talked full of nonsense,

141
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,140
making me worry about Master all the time.

142
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,420
I want to visit Master

143
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,700
on Peach Blossom Island tomorrow.

144
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,900
Are you going with me?

145
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,220
I have been longing to return day and night,

146
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,820
but Master

147
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,180
won't let a sinful disciple like me

148
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,220
to return to Peach Blossom Island.

149
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,140
This is easy.

150
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,660
Do you want to go back and see my father?

151
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,020
I'll plead for mercy on your behalf.

152
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,340
Master thought I was lonely,

153
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,860
so he taught me and raised me.

154
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,660
But I have ambitious plans

155
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,260
and betrayed him.

156
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,060
Now I'm ashamed

157
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,900
to face him.

158
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,020
Wait until I avenge Xuanfeng,

159
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,620
I will kill myself

160
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,420
to atone for my sins.

161
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,460
Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

162
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,740
Today,

163
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,140
let's just end things here.

164
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,500
Mei Chaofeng.

165
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,620
On the night we fought,

166
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,460
your husband died.

167
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,180
But Zhang Asheng

168
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,780
was also killed by you.

169
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
Since we have a grudge against each other,

170
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,380
let's settle it today.

171
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Masters.

172
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,380
Mei Chaofeng.

173
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,500
I killed your husband.

174
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,220
I accept the consequences of my doing.

175
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,740
You just come at me.

176
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,020
Looking for death.

177
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,380
Wait a moment.

178
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,060
Jing was only six years old back then.

179
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,500
Mei Chaofeng.

180
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,220
If you have a grudge,

181
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,700
take it out on us.

182
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,580
Even if I was young,

183
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,420
Chen Xuanfeng was killed by me.

184
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,980
Today, you can do whatever you want with me.

185
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,380
I will not escape.

186
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180
But from now on,

187
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,100
leave my masters alone.

188
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,380
Okay.

189
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,780
A life for a life.

190
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,860
I hereby settle the score
with the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

191
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,380
I will kill you to take revenge.

192
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,860
Senior Mei.

193
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,660
He is a hero.

194
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,780
But you

195
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,900
have become a laughing stock.

196
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,500
What do you mean?

197
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,260
The Six Freaks

198
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,700
have improved their skills drastically.

199
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,900
They can easily

200
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,860
take your life.

201
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,460
Now letting their disciple

202
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,500
fight with you

203
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,460
means they've been lenient,

204
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,900
but you don't appreciate it.

205
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,060
I'm afraid in the end,

206
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
you can't even outmatch

207
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,940
their disciple.

208
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,460
Junior sister.

209
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,060
Within three moves,

210
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
I can kill him.

211
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,740
Okay.

212
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,380
Everyone present is a witness.

213
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,260
Three moves are not enough.

214
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,900
Ten moves.

215
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,740
Are you asking Jing to go to his death?

216
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,700
This little witch.

217
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,020
Jing.

218
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,100
Don't listen to her.

219
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,980
I'll fight fifteen moves

220
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,460
with Senior Mei.

221
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,860
Jing.

222
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,260
Okay.

223
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,340
Then I'll let you die a worthy death.

224
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,660
(Ninghui Pavilion)

225
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,020
Senior Mei, please.

226
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,940
Will Jing be all right?

227
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,260
He's fine.

228
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,780
But where did he learn

229
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,740
such high martial arts skills?

230
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,500
Could it be that this little girl

231
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,660
taught Jing the martial arts
of Peach Blossom Island?

232
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,180
This set of palm techniques
is extremely powerful

233
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,020
and forcible.

234
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,700
It's not from the Peach Blossom Island.

235
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,780
It seems that Jing

236
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,300
has had some adventure.

237
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,540
If Senior Mei fights me this time,

238
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,540
I would have been dead

239
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,900
within ten moves.

240
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,300
Just didn't expect

241
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Mr. Guo is so young

242
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,700
with such profound martial arts skills.

243
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,940
It's really rare.

244
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,860
Senior Mei.

245
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,820
It's been over eighty moves.

246
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,740
Still not admitting defeat?

247
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,300
Senior Mei.

248
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,020
It's been over a hundred moves,
almost two hundred.

249
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,900
Still not admitting defeat?

250
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,900
If it's a competition,

251
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,340
I should have admitted defeat

252
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,790
if I couldn't defeat you within three moves.

253
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,780
But today is not a competition.

254
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,740
I'm seeking revenge.

255
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,620
I must kill you.

256
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,660
Jing.

257
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,700
Use the Silent Palms quickly!

258
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,300
Exert fifty percent of strength
for your right hand.

259
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,260
Silent Palms.

260
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,180
Who is it?

261
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,540
Mei Chaofeng has a helper?

262
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,780
This person's not simple.

263
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,940
Thank you

264
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,220
for saving me twice.

265
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,980
Mei Chaofeng.

266
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,300
You've really embarrassed your master.

267
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,660
You know my master?

268
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,860
Now,

269
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,500
you even can't handle a kid

270
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,460
who was taught

271
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,300
by the old beggar.

272
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,220
How dare you call yourself

273
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,820
a disciple of Peach Blossom Island?

274
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,900
If I hadn't been blind,

275
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,260
how could I have ended up like this?

276
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,020
It's all my fault for being obsessed

277
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,980
with practice.

278
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,820
I betrayed Master,

279
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,340
disappointed him and Mrs. Huang,

280
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,020
and got myself

281
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,580
into this

282
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,100
miserable situation.

283
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,100
In the future,

284
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,060
people in the martial world will say

285
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,540
Eastern Heretic is no match
for the Northern Beggar.

286
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,740
It's all thanks to you.

287
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,420
You're right.

288
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,980
I'm going to kill him.

289
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,940
Even if I have to die with him,

290
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,700
I can't let my master's reputation
go down the drain.

291
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
Wait.

292
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,540
Thank you for healing me.

293
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,900
Go ahead.

294
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,740
Kill him.

295
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,020
Master.

296
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,100
Have some tea.

297
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,500
Second Master.

298
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,780
Drink tea.

299
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,220
Jing.

300
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,060
This dagger

301
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,820
was left to you by your father.

302
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,020
Now it has returned to its original owner.

303
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,980
Please take good care of it.

304
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,700
(Yang Kang)

305
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,220
Thank you, Second Master.

306
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,700
Greetings, Masters.

307
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,900
I made some

308
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
medicinal soup for you.

309
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,820
It has withered grass,
fermented soybeans inside,

310
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,100
and polygonin, C. sichuanensis.

311
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,980
They are all good medicines
for healing internal injuries.

312
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,260
Thank you.

313
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,660
Second Master.

314
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Thank you. Let me.

315
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,620
Master.

316
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,100
I dare not trouble you.

317
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,380
Master.

318
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,060
This was carefully prepared by Rong.

319
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,180
Just take a sip.

320
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,380
I have to drink it just because she made it?

321
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,620
Are you my disciple
or Peach Blossom Island's?

322
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,980
Master.

323
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,020
Just now Rong asked me
to use Silent Palms.

324
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,820
That's how I survived.

325
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,740
We've been

326
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,900
teaching you for twelve years.

327
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,980
But this little witch saved your life.

328
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,060
Good.

329
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,820
Master, that's not what I meant.

330
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,660
What do you mean?

331
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,620
Rong.

332
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,540
Master.

333
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,100
Rong.

334
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,340
Rong.

335
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,900
Zhen'e.

336
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,260
They will be fine in a while.

337
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,860
Zhen'e.

338
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,140
You said you don't want to drink.

339
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,980
It's none of your business.

340
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
I'll drink if I want to.

341
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,100
I won't drink if I don't want to.

342
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,420
Don't you know

343
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,540
Zhen'e's temper?

344
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,220
Seniors, bad news.

345
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,940
Mei Chaofeng came back.

346
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
Why are you back?

347
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,620
If I hadn't been blind,

348
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,860
I would have torn you to pieces.

349
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,220
You're right.

350
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,620
I admit defeat.

351
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,580
I don't care who will win.

352
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,180
It's just that if people hear

353
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,260
I can't defeat

354
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,140
the disciple of the old beggar,

355
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,620
it'll tarnish my master's reputation.

356
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,380
Senior, you cannot see.

357
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,820
And I have already admitted defeat.

358
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,460
Let's stop fighting.

359
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,940
To fight or not to fight

360
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,340
is not up to you to decide.

361
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,300
You still owe my husband a blood debt.

362
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,300
Use Silent Palms.

363
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,060
Or you are no match for me.

364
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,020
Master Zhen'e also cannot see.

365
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,580
If someone

366
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,540
fights him with Silent Palms,

367
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
I will hate him to the core.

368
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,500
Therefore,

369
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,180
I don't want to take advantage of you either.

370
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,900
So you didn't use

371
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,940
Silent Palms just now?

372
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,500
Just now, my masters

373
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,620
were all poisoned by you.

374
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,660
At the critical moment,

375
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,100
I had to use Silent Palms.

376
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,500
I don't want

377
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,780
a duel

378
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,340
to be devious.

379
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,700
You are tough.

380
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,700
But now I

381
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,460
want you to use Silent Palms again.

382
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,780
I have found a way to crack it.

383
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,100
Okay.

384
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,780
Then I will fight another fifteen moves
with you.

385
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,500
Strange.

386
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,860
Jing's Silent Palms didn't work.

387
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,340
Did you hear any sound?

388
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,940
(How could she think of a way)

389
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,340
(to deal with Silent Palms so quickly?)

390
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,500
Jing, be careful.

391
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,740
It's this.

392
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,060
Someone is throwing rocks into the field

393
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,060
to guide Mei Chaofeng.

394
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,100
Over there.

395
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,380
So he is flicking rocks

396
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,220
to show directions.

397
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,260
But how could he know

398
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,380
where would Jing strike?

399
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,900
This strange person

400
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,140
must be an expert.

401
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,740
No.

402
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,060
The rocks flicked by that person

403
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,740
are full of strength.

404
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,940
The noise of tiles

405
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,180
can't disturb her at all.

406
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,220
With just the strength of his fingers,

407
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,740
he could flicked rocks so fiercely.

408
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,740
If someone gets hit by a shot,

409
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,620
the brains will be blown out.

410
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,100
Dad, just let her kill me.

411
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,580
Who's your dad?

412
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,260
Even if you wear a mask

413
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,100
and changed your voice,

414
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,420
I know you are my dad.

415
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,420
(Huang Yaoshi, Eastern Heretic)

416
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,260
Dad, why are you here?

417
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,700
Master.

418
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,620
Old Heretic Huang.

419
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,300
(Eighteen years ago)

420
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,580
My mother told me

421
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,220
due to the war between the Mongols
and the Jins,

422
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,700
she was abandoned by Duan Tiande

423
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,820
to sink or swim.

424
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,700
She gave birth to me in the snow,

425
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,180
and was later saved
by the people living on the grassland.

426
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
My mother said

427
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,020
I was born in the snowfield,

428
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,460
so I would be pure and clean

429
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,220
just like snow.

430
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,420
(Yang Kang)

431
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,300
Egiyn.

432
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,500
Torre asked someone

433
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,820
to send a bucket of goat milk to us.

434
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Egiyn.

435
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,860
What's wrong with you?

436
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,460
Are you thinking about Abu again?

437
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,820
Jing.

438
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,900
I do not object to you speaking Mongolian,

439
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,780
but you must remember,

440
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,380
even though the grassland saved you

441
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,620
and raised you,

442
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,380
you're from the Central Plains.

443
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,940
And your father is Guo Xiaotian.

444
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,820
Mother.

445
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,940
I remember.

446
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,100
Our hometown is Niujia Village
in Lin'an of the Great Song Dynasty.

447
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,020
One day,

448
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,140
I will return to the Central Plains

449
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,580
and kill the enemy with my own hands

450
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,860
to avenge my father.

451
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,940
The enemy of our family

452
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,620
is Duan Tiande.

453
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,220
He has triangular eyes

454
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,460
with a blue birthmark near the left eye.

455
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,540
Such bad luck.

456
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Who's cursing me?

457
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,140
Duan, you're here.

458
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,980
Of course I came.

459
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,860
I just want to play

460
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,060
the dice with you two.

461
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,540
This doesn't seem right.

462
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,220
Young Master asked us

463
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,400
to watch the little prince of the Jin Empire.

464
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,860
In case of any mishap...

465
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,260
What's the big deal?

466
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,700
Just a couple of rounds.

467
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,780
He won't be able to escape.

468
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,380
- Yes. Yeah.
- Yeah.

469
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,860
I, Duan Tiande,

470
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,430
greet you, Your Highness.

471
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,260
You're a river pirate on Taihu Lake?

472
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,140
It's my disguise.

473
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,380
Trying to harm me?

474
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,660
How is that possible?

475
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,260
I'm here to save you.

476
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,900
Do you have a way to get out?

477
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,100
Although I am a river pirate,

478
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,860
I am caring about

479
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,100
the Jin Empire.

480
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,620
You are quite clever.

481
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,580
If you can really help me get out today,

482
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
I will put in a good word for you

483
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,460
when I get back.

484
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

485
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,140
Well,

486
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,780
there is some history between us.

487
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,980
Back then,

488
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,740
I worked with your father

489
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,140
in Niujia Village

490
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,220
to crack a big case,

491
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,220
arresting a large number of

492
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,860
anti-Jin bandits.

493
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,500
Niujia Village.

494
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,540
Is it the capital of Lin'an

495
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,420
in Great Song?

496
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,060
Your Highness.

497
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,100
What's wrong?

498
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,380
I am guilty.

499
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,300
Please punish me, Master.

500
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,980
Where's the Nine Yin Manual?

501
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,580
Master.

502
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,460
I have been carrying this with me all the time.

503
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,020
I have always wanted to return it to you.

504
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,180
But now it's gone.

505
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,900
Still dare to deceive me?

506
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,740
I dare not.

507
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,180
I'm afraid it was just stolen
by the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan.

508
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,700
It must be Zhu Cong,

509
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,660
the Marvellous-Handed Scholar.

510
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,580
You're slandering me.

511
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,300
We Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

512
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,260
have been honest and upright all our lives.

513
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,260
I have no idea what manual
you are talking about.

514
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,780
You are a repeat offender,

515
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,420
with deft hands.

516
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,340
Do you dare to take an oath?

517
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,220
Why not?

518
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,220
If someone stole your manual,

519
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,460
he will die a tragic death.

520
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,180
I lost the manual.

521
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,900
I accept any punishment.

522
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,500
You do need to be punished.

523
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,060
Go do three things.

524
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,500
Find the Nine Yin Manual

525
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,300
and kill

526
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,500
anyone who has read it.

527
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,580
Find your other fellow disciples,

528
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,460
and take their descendants

529
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,700
back to the Island.

530
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,940
I will remove the skills you practiced

531
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,020
from the Nine Yin Manual.

532
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,140
Yes, Master.

533
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,180
You only stole half of the manual.

534
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,020
And learned

535
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,580
only the moves

536
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,220
but not internal skills
and mental cultivation methods.

537
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,540
I was greedy

538
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,580
and went astray.

539
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,820
Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.

540
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,820
Heart breaker Palm.

541
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
White Python Whip.

542
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,580
What's the use of practicing them?

543
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Xuanfeng

544
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,940
was still killed by a child.

545
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,940
Alright, Dad.

546
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,620
You've just arrived here,

547
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,100
- and you're already lecturing others?
- Shut up.

548
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,020
What are you still standing there for?

549
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,940
Yes.

550
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,300
Chengfeng.

551
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,340
Guanying.

552
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,260
Kowtow to your great-master.

553
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,780
Please accept my respects, Great-master.

554
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,300
Master.

555
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,860
Please show mercy.

556
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,340
I have only one son.

557
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,340
You are very good.

558
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,820
You didn't pass on the martial arts of our sect

559
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,140
to him.

560
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,500
I

561
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,900
have always adhered to

562
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,540
the rules of Peach Blossom Island.

563
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,140
From now on,

564
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,340
teach what you know

565
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,620
to him.

566
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,140
Thank you, Great-master.

567
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,700
Practice

568
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,420
this leg technique daily.

569
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,260
(Leaf-sweeping Kick)
And meditate to strengthen your Qi.

570
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,260
If you practice diligently,

571
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,540
you will be able to move freely

572
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,340
within five or six years.

573
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,820
Master.

574
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,020
Where are your other fellow disciples?

575
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,860
In these past few years,

576
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,060
I have been looking for them all along,

577
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,700
but

578
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,500
we lost contact.

579
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,020
Find them.

580
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,220
Pass on this technique

581
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,420
to them.

582
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,420
Please accept my appreciation,

583
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,220
Master.

584
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,220
Rong.

585
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,860
Go home now.

586
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,300
But I don't want to go home yet.

587
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,260
Let's go home.

588
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,060
Senior.

589
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,180
Senior, please stay.

590
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,260
I am Guo Jing.

591
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,580
Greetings, Mr. Huang.

592
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,140
Rong doesn't want to go with you.

593
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,540
Please don't force her.

594
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,420
Guo Jing, right?

595
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,060
How did you kill my disciple

596
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,540
Chen Xuanfeng?

597
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,100
Dad.

598
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Chen Xuanfeng captured Jing at that time.

599
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,500
He was still young

600
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,100
and accidentally killed him in panic.

601
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,340
- Oh?
- Yes.

602
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,460
Dad, it's really not Jing's fault.

603
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,300
Rong.

604
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,340
Get out of the way.

605
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,780
Old Heretic Huang.

606
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,980
If you dare to touch Guo Jing,

607
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,420
you'll have to kill us first.

608
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,260
Senior.

609
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,580
Masters, wait!

610
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,300
It was me who killed Chen Xuanfeng.

611
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,660
It has nothing to do with my masters.

612
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,820
Every debt has its debtor.

613
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,700
Please do not involve the innocent.

614
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,900
Let me pay for his life

615
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,620
with my life.

616
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,780
Dad.

617
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,820
If you kill Jing,

618
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,420
I will never forgive you.

619
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,940
Don't you just want me

620
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,100
to go back to Peach Blossom Island with you?

621
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,140
I'll listen to you.

622
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,980
Dad, let's go.

623
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,820
Rong.

624
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,380
You must not come over.

625
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,580
My father will really kill you.

626
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,100
Dad, let's go.

627
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,140
Jing, I will go back to Peach Blossom Island
with my father first.

628
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,300
Once I have the chance,

629
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,340
I will come out to find you.

630
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,260
Rong.

631
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,220
Rong, okay.

632
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,940
Even if you don't come to me,

633
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
I will go find you

634
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,180
once I handle everything.

635
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,420
Okay.

636
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,420
Dad.

637
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,300
Dad.

638
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,940
Seniors, bad news.

639
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,820
How dare you come here!

640
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,660
There is a misunderstanding.

641
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,580
I couldn't explain it before.

642
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,420
Since all of you are heroes

643
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,900
devoted to the Great Song,

644
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
I won't hide it anymore.

645
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,180
I pretended to stay with Wanyan Honglie

646
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,100
to win his trust,

647
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,660
and my purpose

648
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,180
is to reclaim the Book of Wumu
for our Great Song.

649
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,580
Please help me.

650
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,660
This is just your side of the story.

651
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,220
What evidence do you have?

652
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,820
Do any of you recognize this person?

653
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,020
(Triangular eyes.)

654
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,500
(Blue birthmark.)

655
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,380
What is your name?

656
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,300
He is the one who killed your father,

657
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,340
Duan Tiande.

658
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,180
You are indeed Duan Tiande.

659
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,020
No.

660
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,860
I am not Duan Tiande.

661
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,580
I lied

662
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
with His Highness.

663
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,780
Duan Tiande.

664
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,500
We finally found you.

665
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,660
Thank Heaven

666
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,700
to have sent you to us.

667
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,700
It's a misunderstanding.

668
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,380
It's just a misunderstanding.

669
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,060
Mr. Guo died tragically back then.

670
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,700
It did have a little

671
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,260
to do with me.

672
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,940
But I had no choice.

673
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,540
I was under an order

674
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,100
and couldn't help it.

675
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,140
If I dared to disobey the order,

676
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,020
I would lose my life.

677
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,580
Who gave you the order?

678
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,940
Who?

679
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,900
Who sent you to kill my father?

680
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,020
Say it!

681
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,140
It was

682
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,340
the sixth prince of the Jin Empire,

683
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,220
Wanyan Honglie!

684
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,340
Wanyan Honglie?

685
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,980
Guo.

686
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,220
I just found out

687
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,060
in the prison

688
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,620
that my foster father

689
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,220
bribed this treacherous guy

690
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,660
to kill my biological father,

691
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,020
and then pretended to be a hero

692
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,060
to save my mother.

693
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,700
My poor mother sacrificed herself

694
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,300
to the Jin people for me.

695
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,260
I have been the enemy's son

696
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,820
for so many years.

697
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,140
It's such a great shame!

698
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,140
Listen to me!

699
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,660
Mr. Guo

700
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,580
was so heroic

701
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,180
and imposing.

702
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,980
I could tell he was an upright man.

703
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,100
I decided right away

704
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,380
that I'd show mercy

705
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,300
just to make friends

706
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,380
with Mr. Guo.

707
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,060
But...

708
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,620
- But...
- But what?

709
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,460
But

710
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,140
I was just

711
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,380
a minor official

712
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,220
who couldn't make any decisions.

713
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,660
In order to save my life,

714
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,820
I only showed my admiration

715
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,260
and respects for him.

716
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,260
What a bunch of nonsense!

717
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,660
Jing, don't listen to him.

718
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,500
The one...

719
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,140
The one who killed Mr. Guo

720
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,220
was Wanyan Honglie.

721
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,340
I was as insignificant as an ant

722
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,940
and used by others as a pawn.

723
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,340
Please spare my life!

724
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,380
You're still trying to argue!

725
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,380
Guo.

726
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,020
I just found out today

727
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,460
that Wanyan Honglie is actually our archenemy.

728
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,260
I didn't know before

729
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,100
and acted contrary to everything.

730
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,620
I've made a terrible mistake.

731
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,620
When I think of
the suffering my mother endured,

732
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,700
I really hate myself.

733
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,500
At least you've seen your father.

734
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,300
I...

735
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,620
I haven't even seen my biological father.

736
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,220
The heroic deeds of my father

737
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,260
were all told to me by my mother.

738
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,860
I didn't know until today

739
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,940
it was Wanyan Honglie

740
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,900
who killed our fathers.

741
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,700
I'm going north to kill him

742
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,540
to avenge Father's death.

743
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,900
Are you going with me?

744
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,860
Of course.

745
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,260
I will follow you

746
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,260
to go to Zhongdu for revenge.

747
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,100
Okay.

748
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
We can also

749
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,420
inherit the styles of our fathers' generation

750
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,460
and fight side by side now.

751
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,300
I'll take you to Zhongdu
to find that scoundrel.

752
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,820
With me there,

753
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,260
you can get close to him.

754
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,100
Okay.

755
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,540
Also,

756
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,260
your deceased father and my mother

757
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,420
once told me

758
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,820
my late father once had an agreement
with your father

759
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,460
to make the two of us

760
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,660
sworn brothers.

761
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,100
What do you think?

762
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,100
Of course, that would be great.

763
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,500
Okay.

764
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,420
I'm older than you.

765
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,860
Then I'll be the big brother.

766
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,300
You are my younger brother.

767
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,340
Brother.

768
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,300
This dagger

769
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,700
is finally returning to its rightful owner,

770
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,140
fulfilling the long-cherished wish
of both our families.

771
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,340
I am Guo Jing.

772
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,380
I am Yang Kang.

773
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,700
With the witness of the heavens and the earth,

774
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,540
the mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas,

775
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,660
we become

776
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,380
sworn brothers today.

777
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,340
We'll entrust life and death to each other,

778
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,620
and rise and fall together.

779
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,060
We'll share joys and sorrows,

780
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,340
weal and woe,

781
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,420
swearing to kill Wanyan Honglie

782
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,780
to avenge my father's death.

783
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,860
Joining hands to uphold justice

784
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,260
and guard the Great Song.

785
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,140
- Kang.
- Jing.

786
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,420
Thank you, Lord and Young Master Lu.

787
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,420
Even my personal affairs with Kang

788
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,220
are settled here in your house.

789
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,580
We have brought trouble

790
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,780
for both of you.

791
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,180
Mr. Guo, you are too polite.

792
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,940
If it weren't for you and Miss Huang,

793
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,620
and the other heroes,

794
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
I wouldn't even have a chance

795
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,980
to reunite with Master and Senior Mei.

796
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,180
Everything is fate.

797
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,100
Fellow heroes,

798
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,260
I will not see you off.

799
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,300
Farewell.

800
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,980
Masters.

801
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,020
Yang Kang and I

802
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,860
are going north to kill Wanyan Honglie

803
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,700
to avenge my father's death.

804
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,980
It's too early for the appointment
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

805
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,540
We have nothing to do anyway.

806
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,060
Why don't we just take you

807
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,580
to do this big thing together?

808
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,580
Master.

809
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,740
Wanyan Honglie's martial arts are mediocre.

810
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,940
Now with Kang's help,

811
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,420
I'm sure it won't be difficult to kill him.

812
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,940
Masters,

813
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,620
you haven't returned home for decades for me.

814
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,380
Now,

815
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,460
it's near your home.

816
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,140
I won't trouble you

817
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,980
to come with me.

818
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,020
That's fine.

819
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,300
We will

820
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,700
stay in Jiangnan

821
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,540
for a couple of days.

822
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,660
We're relieved to see

823
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,180
you've improved so much.

824
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,940
We are not worried that

825
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,900
you're going to kill Wanyan Honglie.

826
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,780
But for the appointment
on Peach Blossom Island...

827
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,100
Jing, you don't have to go.

828
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,180
Old Heretic Huang is eccentric by nature.

829
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,500
His own disciple
had their legs crippled for no reason.

830
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,380
If you go to the appointment,

831
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,820
it will bode ill rather than well.

832
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,980
You often teach me

833
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,820
that in the martial world,

834
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,740
a man should keep his words.

835
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,940
If I don't go to the appointment,

836
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,100
won't I break my promise to him?

837
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,340
I can't fail to keep faith.

838
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,220
Or I don't deserve to be a human.

839
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,660
Jing.

840
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,380
There's no integrity to speak of

841
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,700
with these indecent people.

842
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,660
If everyone

843
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,540
is as light-hearted as you,

844
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,420
there won't be so much conflict.

845
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,660
Jing.

846
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,700
You can chat with your masters.

847
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,540
I'll go prepare the horse.

848
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,500
Okay.

849
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,380
Jing.

850
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,620
Us chivalrous people

851
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,020
should keep our word.

852
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,700
Today is the fifth day of the sixth month.

853
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,260
On the first day of July,

854
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,540
we will meet at the
Drunken Immortal Tower in Jiaxing

855
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,340
to go together to Peach Blossom Island.

856
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,500
There is less than a month left.

857
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,580
Now you ride the red horse

858
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,620
to Zhongdu to seek revenge.

859
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,660
You're going to Peach Blossom Island

860
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,100
together with me?

861
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,940
Also,

862
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,020
after careful thought,

863
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,260
I think you should go alone

864
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,260
to kill Wanyan Honglie

865
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,740
without your sworn brother.

866
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,300
He may not be trustworthy.

867
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,020
Master.

868
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,140
I understand that you want what's best for me.

869
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,260
But rest assured.

870
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,260
Me and Yang Kang

871
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,330
have become sworn brothers yesterday.

872
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,260
Just like the seven of you,

873
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,100
we are in it together.

874
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,980
From now on, we are of one heart and one mind.

875
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,540
We should support each other

876
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,820
wholeheartedly.

877
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,420
It's not appropriate to doubt each other.

878
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,740
I'm just afraid that you will suffer losses.

879
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,180
(Year of Bumper Harvest)

880
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,020
Jing.

881
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,220
If this time

882
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,220
you can kill Wanyan Honglie,

883
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,180
and fulfill your wish,

884
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,020
that would be great.

885
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,460
If things don't go smoothly,

886
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,300
remember

887
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,860
revenge is never too late.

888
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,700
Let's wait for the future to take revenge.

889
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,580
I understand.

890
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,980
Your sworn brother

891
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,060
comes from a wealthy family.

892
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,660
But I always feel that he

893
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,420
is not as honest and simple as you.

894
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,860
Is he a true gentleman?

895
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
You need to observe more

896
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,980
and pay attention.

897
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,460
Okay, Sixth Master.

898
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,700
Jing.

899
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:03,980
The martial world is perilous.

900
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,300
Be extra careful.

901
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,620
Sure, Fourth Master.

902
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,660
Dear masters,

903
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,900
