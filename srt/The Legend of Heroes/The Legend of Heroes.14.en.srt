2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,160
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,480
We are all in the martial world.

4
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,540
Who wants to talk nicely to you?

5
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,450
- Qi...
- Let's fight.

6
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,370
- Fight then, I'm not afraid of you.
- Ouyang...

7
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,400
Let's settle this with fists. Come on.

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,950
I've had enough of you. Let's go fight.

9
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Jing.

10
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,790
Don't worry.

11
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,250
Qigong and Old Venomous Creature

12
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,150
are martial grandmasters.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,540
They know where they stand.

14
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,690
Okay.

15
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,510
You stupid one don't understand this.

16
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,100
(After Wang Chongyang dead,)

17
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,900
(I thought my martial arts were the best
in the world.)

18
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,620
(Since we parted at Mount Hua,)

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,220
(it's just been a few years.)

20
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,530
(Both of them)

21
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,550
- (have reached such a high level.)
- Go on!

22
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,710
Jing.

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,320
What is he doing?

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,500
Mr. Zhou once told me.

25
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,600
His senior Wang Chongyang

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,610
once broke Ouyang Feng's

27
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,780
Toad Skill

28
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,670
with First Heaven Skill.

29
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,620
He really looks like a toad.

30
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,010
He's a toad wants to eat swan meat,

31
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,900
that kind of toad.

32
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,810
Rong,

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
you're always spot-on with descriptions.

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,500
You punk ask for trouble!

35
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,690
Rong,

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,720
are you okay?

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm fine.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,640
Ouyang Ke.

39
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,390
What kind of hero resorts to sneak attacks?

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
You know what.

41
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,060
We hadn't settled who's the winner yet.

42
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,290
Come on.

43
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,740
I'm not afraid of you!

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Jing!

45
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,570
Jing!

46
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,600
Jing!

47
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,330
Jing.

48
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,380
Do you think you've become a bit arrogant?

49
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,410
Although under my guidance

50
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,910
your skills have improved a bit.

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,890
But to take on the attack of

52
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,730
Old Venomous Creature

53
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,140
is still too much for you.

54
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,310
Master.

55
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,910
At that time

56
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,700
I only wanted to protect Rong.

57
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,620
Sorry for making you worried.

58
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,700
But your training wasn't in vain.

59
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,210
At least our

60
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,960
The Dragon is Seen in the Fields

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,350
could block his Toad Skill.

62
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,180
It's all thanks to your excellent teachings.

63
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,500
This hawthorn is sour.

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,940
So sour!

65
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,370
Master,

66
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,000
if Jing hadn't risked

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,310
his life to protect me,

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,060
I would have been hurt.

69
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,380
I'm here.

70
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,870
You don't need others' protection.

71
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,370
Qigong.

72
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,170
Master Huang's Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pills.

73
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,040
He takes you under his wing,

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,880
Jing.

75
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,210
You should thank my father.

76
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,140
- Master Huang...
- No need. Sit still.

77
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,820
Focus on your breathing.

78
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,690
Rong.

79
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,280
Come here.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,470
Nephew Jing has a robust physique.

81
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,580
He's doing well.

82
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,490
Yaoshi,

83
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,760
Qigong,

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,500
I just wanted to protect Ke.

85
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,730
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,990
Luckily I restrained most of my strength.

87
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,850
But still hurt Nephew Jing

88
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,230
and almost hurt Rong.

89
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,810
I apologize.

90
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,000
You wanted to protect your nephew

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,350
or maybe even intended to kill someone.

92
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,030
Who can say for sure?

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
Don't be rude.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,910
The elders are talking.

95
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,050
Stay out of this.

96
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,060
Then I'll say something.

97
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,380
You wicked toad.

98
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,250
Yaoshi spared you.

99
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,520
But you hit my apprentice.

100
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,600
I can't let you go.

101
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,730
Then how do you say

102
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,000
we settle this?

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,140
You hit my apprentice.

104
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,530
Let your nephew take a hit from me.

105
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,700
Nonsense!

106
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
Didn't you see he came at me himself?

107
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,770
Then make him come at me himself.

108
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,610
Gentlemen.

109
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,700
I think we should stop.

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,730
Tomorrow morning,

111
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,430
I'll provide a solution for everyone.

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
Speak it!

113
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,060
Speak it!

114
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,940
Little girl,

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,940
tell me.

116
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,470
What message did the Beggar's Gang
ask you to bring out?

117
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,310
Where is the Book of Wumu?

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,700
What a stubborn girl.

119
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,260
We're all rough people.

120
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,140
If you keep holding back,

121
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,530
perhaps

122
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,310
we'll do something else to you.

123
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,640
Get lost!

124
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,490
Kang.

125
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,130
Your Highness.

126
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:54,930
Your Highness.

127
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,790
She is a prisoner personally
overseen by the prince.

128
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,930
His Royal Highness ordered us

129
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,240
to get results from her.

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,180
I'll explain

131
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,140
to His Royal Highness myself.

132
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,810
- Well...
- Well...

133
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,260
Kang...

134
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,370
Nianci.

135
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,930
Nianci.

136
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,690
Don't be afraid.

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm here.

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,580
How did you find me?

139
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,880
I always

140
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,470
have a way to find you.

141
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,820
Are the ones who captured me

142
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,010
the Jins

143
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,060
that you know?

144
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,330
Yes.

145
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,730
To save you,

146
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,860
I asked Wanyan Honglie for help.

147
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,310
You did that again!

148
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,340
We've made so much effort.

149
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,100
Why did you come back?

150
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
For you,

151
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,150
I would go to hell if I had to.

152
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,670
I'd rather die

153
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,220
than see you as Wanyan Kang again!

154
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,940
Besides saving you,

155
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,630
I came back

156
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,960
because the Jins want to

157
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,270
obtain the Book of Wumu.

158
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,720
I'll take the book

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,700
and give it to Brother Guo.

160
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,810
So I won't break the oath

161
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,220
we made when we swore to be brothers.

162
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,860
I don't believe it.

163
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,220
Believe it or not

164
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,330
doesn't matter.

165
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,700
I just want you to be safe.

166
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Kang,

167
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,250
what's going on?

168
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,580
I broke into the prison

169
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,750
to rescue Nianci.

170
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,670
I'm here to apologize.

171
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,980
You're my son.

172
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,860
Your words are mine.

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,530
If you want to save your lover

174
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,460
and they stop you,

175
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,310
they're asking for trouble.

176
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,220
You didn't do anything wrong.

177
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,550
Here. Get up.

178
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,460
I have one more request.

179
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,080
You are my son.

180
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,340
Feel free to speak your mind.

181
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,100
Please let Nianci stay with me

182
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,270
and don't harm her.

183
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,750
I've devoted myself to the Jin.

184
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,720
I believe one day,

185
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,560
she'll do the same

186
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,180
and work for the Jin.

187
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,510
That's what I thought

188
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,510
about your mother.

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
But...

190
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,520
Never mind.

191
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,060
Just as you wish.

192
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,460
Whatever you want is fine.

193
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,330
Here.

194
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,930
As long as you come back,

195
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,980
it's good.

196
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,670
Come. Have a sit.

197
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
Father,

198
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,770
we've found something

199
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,100
about the Book of Wumu.

200
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,550
When shall we start?

201
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,670
Cuihan Hall is off-limits

202
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,700
and heavily guarded.

203
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,210
Many Song martial artists

204
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,390
will intervene.

205
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,820
We need to wait for someone.

206
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,460
We have many skilled people in our mansion.

207
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,180
Which remarkable person are we waiting for?

208
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,460
Ouyang Feng, Western Venom.

209
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,010
Uncle,

210
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,720
I've been investigating everywhere.

211
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,980
Peach Blossom Island is surrounded
by strange formations.

212
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,220
A slight mishap could trap people inside.

213
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,960
I've been searching for days

214
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,180
but found no way out.

215
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,880
The Nine Yin Manual

216
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,310
must be with Yaoshi.

217
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,760
Seems the old beggar is after

218
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,430
more than just a marriage proposal.

219
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,060
Let's wait and see.

220
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,490
Yes.

221
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,630
I'll follow your lead.

222
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
Ke,

223
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,060
tell Uncle the truth.

224
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,860
Do you want to

225
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,700
marry Huang Rong?

226
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,160
Uncle,

227
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,130
I'm here with you to find

228
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,010
the Nine Yin Manual.

229
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,750
I haven't thought about romance.

230
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,340
Tell me the truth.

231
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,580
Huang Rong

232
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,670
has captured my heart.

233
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,220
I do like her.

234
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,860
So I want to marry her.

235
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,880
Okay.

236
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,800
Qigong,

237
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,860
Ouyang,

238
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,940
you're both proposing marriage.

239
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,820
I'm honored.

240
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,670
But I can't let this

241
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
damage

242
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,580
our brotherhood.

243
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,820
I have an idea.

244
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,490
Tell us.

245
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,750
Tell us, Yaoshi.

246
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,630
I'll give three questions

247
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,980
to test their talent and learning.

248
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,090
The winner

249
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,390
will be my son-in-law.

250
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,720
The loser

251
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
can choose a skill

252
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,370
of our Peach Blossom Island,

253
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,210
and...

254
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,310
I'll teach him with my best.

255
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,370
- Test their talent and learning?
- Test their talent and learning?

256
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,670
That's good, Yaoshi.

257
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,450
Qigong,

258
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,930
Yaoshi agreed for Ke

259
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,370
to marry Rong.

260
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,980
He did it for your own good.

261
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,370
Let these two youngsters compete.

262
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,340
It doesn't hurt.

263
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
Ke,

264
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,810
if you can't win

265
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,820
your Brother Guo,

266
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,320
it's your own fault.

267
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,580
You can't blame others.

268
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,820
Don't worry, Uncle.

269
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,460
I'll do my best.

270
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,030
You toad!

271
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,700
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

272
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,170
Are you afraid we'll back out if we lose?

273
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,410
You're giving up

274
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,270
before we even start?

275
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
We are both grandmasters.

276
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,340
If we lose, we should accept defeat gracefully.

277
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,340
No need to speak it out on purpose.

278
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,880
Yaoshi,

279
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,270
we can compete,

280
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,460
but it must be fair.

281
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,750
We're martial artists.

282
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,750
Martial skills matter most.

283
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,320
Don't get into those literary things.

284
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,160
Don't worry.

285
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,460
Fairness is the most important.

286
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,030
The first test

287
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,030
is about martial arts.

288
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,330
Great.

289
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,490
Young venomous creature,

290
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,460
you'll be beaten up later.

291
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,180
Jing, go!

292
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,520
Hold on.

293
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
That's about two children.

294
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,440
What's your problem?

295
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,430
Haven't you heard Yaoshi?

296
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,220
Be fair! Be fair!

297
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,340
Yesterday I accidentally hurt Guo Jing.

298
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,310
If he fights Ke injured,

299
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,820
it's not a fair win for us.

300
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Right, Nephew Guo?

301
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,880
Mr. Ouyang.

302
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,940
I've almost healed

303
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,580
from yesterday's injury.

304
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,700
I can fight Ouyang Ke now.

305
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,310
I don't want to take advantage.

306
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,490
Seriously?

307
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,440
You just don't dare to fight Jing.

308
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,820
Sit down.

309
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,760
We're afraid you'll find excuses

310
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,890
if you lose.

311
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,770
Find excuses? Old Venomous Creature,

312
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,810
your words

313
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,860
sound unpleasant.

314
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,290
Come. Let's fight.

315
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,130
Great.

316
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,170
I've been displeased with you today.

317
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,180
- Let's fight!
- Calm down.

318
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,630
I have another idea.

319
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,250
(Sword Trial Pavilion)

320
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,090
Feng,

321
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,130
Qigong,

322
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,220
your skills are unparalleled.

323
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,750
Fighting each other is pointless.

324
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,570
How about Feng

325
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,370
fight against Qigong's apprentice,

326
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,040
and Qigong fight against

327
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,220
Nephew Ouyang?

328
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,410
Yaoshi, you mean I and the Old Beggar

329
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,610
compete who beat the youngster first?

330
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,450
No.

331
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,390
This competition

332
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,060
is about techniques,

333
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,390
not internal energy.

334
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,800
Neither of you

335
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,460
can use internal energy.

336
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,510
The apprentice who falls from the tree first

337
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,220
loses.

338
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
Just knock him off the tree?

339
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,700
Just knock him off the tree.

340
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,460
If either of you

341
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,670
uses internal energy

342
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,670
and injuries the apprentice,

343
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,550
you lose.

344
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,460
A fight without injuries?

345
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,930
Only you, Old Heretic Huang,

346
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,910
could think of this.

347
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,520
Mr. Ouyang,

348
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,820
I'll defer to your guidance.

349
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,100
Then get down,

350
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,170
Nephew Guo.

351
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,010
Qigong,

352
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,770
please be merciful.

353
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,820
Don't be so stressed.

354
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,790
I won't hurt you.

355
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,370
Want to run?

356
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,960
Are you fighting

357
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,040
or playing hide and seek?

358
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,510
Qigong, you're too strong.

359
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,390
I dare not face you head-on.

360
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,040
But if Guo Jing wants to win,

361
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,550
you must hurry.

362
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
Don't run.

363
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,900
37.

364
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,120
38.

365
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,280
39.

366
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,690
40.

367
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,800
Father,

368
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,960
Jing lasted 40 moves against

369
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
Old Venomous Creature.

370
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,380
You want to run?

371
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,760
Got you.

372
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,080
Ke!

373
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,280
Jing, well done.

374
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,450
You even used

375
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,420
Mongolian wrestling.

376
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,450
Let's go down.

377
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,030
Jing, you are amazing!

378
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,750
Father, did you see?

379
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,060
Guo Jing wins

380
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,950
this round.

381
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,230
Yaoshi, next challenge please.

382
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,800
Yaoshi,

383
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,230
what's this for?

384
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,510
That's my wife's zither.

385
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,030
We used to play music together

386
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,790
on Peach Blossom Island.

387
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,470
Now she's gone,

388
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,030
I'm alone.

389
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,620
For the second challenge,

390
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,990
we test music.

391
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,280
Didn't we agree on martial arts?

392
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,810
Why music now?

393
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,790
Are you deaf?

394
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,680
He said to test their talent and learning.

395
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
Father,

396
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,950
you're favoring Ouyang Ke.

397
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,340
Jing grew up on the grasslands.

398
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,060
It's unfair to test him

399
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,420
on music.

400
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,320
I don't mean to favor

401
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,310
either of them.

402
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,860
I just think about

403
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,710
your mother.

404
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,270
Yaoshi is fair,

405
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,090
sentimental and unbiased.

406
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,510
Since that's the case,

407
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,620
let's get started. Bring it on.

408
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,270
Since everyone agrees,

409
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,270
let's start after

410
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,030
an incense stick burns.

411
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,610
Each of you has two sticks

412
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,140
on your table.

413
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,660
Follow my zither rhythm and tap the sticks.

414
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,660
Who does it best

415
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,580
wins the second round.

416
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,140
That's Emerging Waves from the Dark Blue Sea.

417
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,930
Old Heretic Huang is testing

418
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,190
more than music.

419
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,860
See?

420
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,550
Our Jing taps randomly,

421
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,170
conflicting with

422
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,660
Old Heretic Huang's rhythm.

423
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,340
See?

424
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,270
They're accompanying Ke.

425
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,280
Ke!

426
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,760
Guo Jing.

427
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,060
Since we've met at Guiyun Manor,

428
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,710
you've made great progress.

429
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,580
Thank you, Master Huang.

430
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
No need for formalitie,

431
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,120
Jing.

432
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,580
You've won two rounds.

433
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,690
What are you waiting for?

434
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,250
Master Huang.

435
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,420
Why are you kneeling?

436
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,270
The result is clear.

437
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,800
Shouldn't Jing propose

438
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,950
and call you Father now?

439
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,010
This round,

440
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,710
Guo Jing's composure and internal energy

441
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,660
are superior.

442
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,750
But Ke's musical talent

443
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,060
surpasses Guo Jing.

444
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,620
This round is a draw.

445
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
Father, you're cheating.

446
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,510
Yaoshi, you are fair!

447
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,470
Let's have one more round to decide the winner.

448
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,730
Old Heretic Huang,

449
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,050
if this is a draw,

450
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,710
you're totally biased.

451
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,890
What now?

452
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,240
Master of the Beggars' Gang

453
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,190
can't be okay with losing?

454
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
Ouyang Feng!

455
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,320
Qigong.

456
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,190
Shall we continue?

457
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,320
Qigong.

458
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,760
Qigong!

459
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,490
Well...

460
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,510
Let's continue.

461
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,420
Great, Yaoshi.

462
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,710
This booklet

463
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,860
was handwritten

464
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,660
by my wife.

465
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,310
It's her life's work.

466
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,370
Both of you

467
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,100
will have one incense stick's time

468
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,330
to read it through.

469
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,170
Then

470
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,900
recite it.

471
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,550
The one recites the most

472
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,950
and the most accurately

473
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,800
wins.

474
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,510
It's like

475
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,060
her mother's spirit

476
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,310
personally choosing her son-in-law.

477
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,340
Old Heretic Huang,

478
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,120
you did this on purpose.

479
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,610
You know Jing is not good at literature,

480
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,100
and you test him on recitation!

481
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,190
It's about my daughter.

482
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,470
So I can test them whatever I want.

483
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,650
Right.

484
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,660
You are right.

485
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
She's your daughter.

486
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,810
You can marry her to

487
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,900
any rogue you want.

488
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,330
But now Rong and Jing

489
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,230
are my apprentices.

490
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,370
I can endure this.

491
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,000
But my apprentices can't.

492
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,310
Can't you talk nicely?

493
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,750
Now you are asking me to talk nicely?

494
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,790
Since it's so unfair,

495
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,100
we quit.

496
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,280
Rong, Jing,

497
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,890
if you don't want to be separated,

498
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,850
let's go now.

499
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,690
Qigong.

500
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,920
- Master.
- Didn't we have a deal?

501
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,130
If you don't compete,

502
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,890
accept defeat gracefully.

503
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,140
Why should I accept defeat?

504
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,710
We didn't lose.

505
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm taking my apprentices

506
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,920
away now.

507
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,620
- Who dares to stop me?
- I do!

508
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,520
You...

509
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,280
Master,

510
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,030
don't let Jing and me

511
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,510
ruin your peace.

512
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,140
- Master.
- Well...

513
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,790
I really want to marry Rong,

514
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,510
but I don't want to defy her father.

515
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,490
Fine!

516
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,820
You go compete.

517
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,330
You're really stupid.

518
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,240
Can't you see he's giving you

519
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,090
a hard time?

520
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,810
He doesn't want to marry off
his daughter to you.

521
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,480
You'll only embarrass yourself.

522
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,320
Go ahead.

523
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,650
Guo Jing,

524
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,930
will you compete?

525
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Master Huang,

526
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,510
let's begin.

527
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,840
(The way of heaven reduces surplus
and replenishes deficit.)

528
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,660
The way of heaven

529
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,060
reduces surplus and replenishes deficit.

530
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,790
Thus, the empty overcomes the full,

531
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,140
and the deficient overcomes the surplus.

532
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,620
Why does Master Huang

533
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,660
have a copy of Mr. Zhou's book?

534
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,990
Who will go first?

535
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,320
I'll go first.

536
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,650
The way of heaven

537
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,710
reduces surplus and replenishes deficit.

538
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,860
Thus, the empty overcomes the full;

539
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,580
the deficient overcomes the surplus.

540
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Its meaning is vast,

541
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,320
its principle profound,

542
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,410
its interest deep.

543
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,230
The signs of heaven and earth are divided.

544
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,660
Cycles of yin and yang are arranged.

545
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,000
(Sword Trial Pavilion)

546
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,310
The essence of the five viscera...

547
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,970
And...

548
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,490
Guo Jing,

549
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,320
your turn.

550
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,900
The way of heaven

551
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,190
reduces surplus and replenishes deficit.

552
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,270
Thus, the empty overcomes the full,

553
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,190
and the deficient overcomes the surplus.

554
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,720
Its meaning is vast,

555
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,890
its principle profound,

556
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,730
its interest deep.

557
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,710
It can be called the origin
of the ultimate way,

558
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,960
the beginning of all life...

559
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,800
Enough!

560
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,320
Master Huang, I can continue...

561
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,170
Do you have

562
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,650
the Nine Yin Manual

563
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,550
that my apprentice Mei Chaofeng lost?

564
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,140
Hand over the Nine Yin Manual!

565
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,760
What Nine Yin Manual?

566
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,680
Speak!

567
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,690
Do you think his master

568
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,950
is just a bystander?

569
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,520
Eastern Heretic and Western Venom

570
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,570
ganging up on a junior,

571
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,240
aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

572
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,080
Brother Zhou!

573
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,170
- Brother Guo!
- Brother Zhou!

574
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,380
- Brother Guo!
- You're here!

575
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
Watch this.

576
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,760
Old Heretic Huang!

577
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,170
Haven't you always wanted

578
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,100
the Nine Yin Manual?

579
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,620
I'm bored staying here.

580
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,800
I want to go out and play!

581
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,850
The Nine Yin Manual

582
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,890
is useless to me.

583
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,900
So I'll give it to you.

584
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,720
Both volumes are here.

585
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,790
You already had the first volume.

586
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,440
But where did you get

587
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,920
the second volume?

588
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,200
You should thank Guo Jing

589
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,310
for reuniting both volumes.

590
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,470
Just as I expected.

591
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,330
Master Huang, it's not true.

592
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,240
Come on, Brother Zhou.

593
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Explain to Master Huang.

594
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,570
I'm here to help you.

595
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,410
Stop talking.

596
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,380
Old Heretic Huang, do you want the manual?

597
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,440
Yes.

598
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,860
I promised to give it to you,

599
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,090
but I didn't specify

600
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,340
how I will give it to you.

601
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,410
Look!

602
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,280
It's fun! It's fun!

603
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,950
The world's only Nine Yin Manual

604
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,030
is in my Brother Guo's mind.

605
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,230
You want it?

606
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,310
Then marry your daughter to him.

607
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,130
I've taught him

608
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,710
the entire Nine Yin Manual,

609
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,920
so giving it to him is like giving it to you.

610
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,760
Brother Zhou,

611
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,090
that Imp Scripture you taught me

612
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,130
is the Nine Yin Manual?

613
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,240
Of course it's true.

614
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,080
Don't worry about it.

615
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,820
How could you deceive me?

616
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,170
This is a big problem.

617
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,100
That's nonsense.

618
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,410
The Nine Yin Manual is in your mind now.

619
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,510
You are his son-in-law.

620
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,520
I gave you the manual,

621
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,370
and a son-in-law.

622
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,620
Why did you hit me?

623
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,380
Come and get me.

624
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,570
What do you think? Is that good?

625
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,550
Try it yourself.

626
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,340
Why did you only use one hand?

627
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,760
No. No.

628
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,710
I want to have a real fight with you.

629
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,470
But I promised my senior

630
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,470
not to use Nine Yin techniques.

631
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,040
Brother Zhou!

632
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,320
Brother Zhou!

633
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,190
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

634
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,690
Old Heretic Huang,

635
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,850
you take advantage

636
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,470
of my promise to my senior.

637
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,030
If I use both hands,

638
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,810
you wouldn't win.

639
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,820
What do you suggest

640
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,900
to resolve this?

641
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,920
You let me

642
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,270
forget the Nine Yin techniques,

643
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,610
then I'll challenge you again.

644
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,450
How about that?

645
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,990
You are crazy. Really.

646
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,200
You are crazy!

647
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,310
Do you dare or not?

648
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,310
These are Nine-Flower Jade Dew Pills.

649
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,420
Take one every seven days.

650
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,900
You'll be healed

651
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,580
in a month.

652
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,140
I can't take these pills

653
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,620
for free.

654
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,420
I promised you the manual.

655
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,920
Brother Guo is a living manual.

656
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,820
Just take him.

657
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,660
Because of the Nine Yin Manual,

658
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,950
I lost my wife.

659
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,660
I asked the Nine Yin Manual from you

660
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,450
just for

661
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,030
burning it

662
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,470
to honor

663
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,790
her mother.

664
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,100
What's the use of taking him?

665
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,190
Let's end

666
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,790
all of this here.

667
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,750
If it can't be kept,

668
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,990
why not forget it?

669
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,340
Old Imp,

670
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,820
I'm sorry for trapping you here

671
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,060
for 15 years.

672
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,620
You can go.

673
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,120
Take him

674
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,550
and go.

675
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,030
We're free to go?

676
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,170
Yes.

677
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,340
You two better go.

678
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,970
Yaoshi,

679
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,650
since Guo Jing deceived you,

680
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,620
does Ke

681
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,580
win this round?

682
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,610
Nonsense.

683
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,760
Can't you talk nicely?

684
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,310
What? Still want to fight?

685
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,380
- Jing is...
- Gentlemen.

686
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,990
We will no longer discuss

687
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,990
my daughter's marriage.

688
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,760
- Father!
- Yaoshi!

689
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,600
I said.

690
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,270
We will no longer discuss

691
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,820
my daughter's marriage!

692
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,060
I think it's time to say goodbye.

693
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,820
I said you don't need to send us off.

694
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,750
Let's part here.

695
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,990
Since the marriage is off,

696
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,320
please

697
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,730
take this gift.

698
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,590
I'll keep my word.

699
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,630
Think it over.

700
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,050
There's no reason

701
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,230
to take back a gift.

702
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,680
Take it.

703
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,240
You can pick any skill

704
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,310
from Peach Blossom Island.

705
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,150
If you don't mind,

706
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,190
I'll teach you everything.

707
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,150
Pick one.

708
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:40,770
Thank you, Master Huang.

709
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,010
I've always admired

710
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,020
the Complex Five Turns from the island.

711
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,150
Could you please teach me?

712
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,110
Complex Five Turns cover many areas.

713
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,790
Which one do you want to learn?

714
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,630
The birth and transformation techniques

715
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,310
of Peach Blossom Island.

716
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,320
That's Yaoshi's treasured technique.

717
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,650
Can he teach you?

718
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,490
So rude.

719
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,600
That's okay.

720
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,010
I'll lend you all the diagrams

721
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,610
of Peach Blossom Island's

722
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,150
Complex Five Turns.

723
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:15,970
Without its formations,

724
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,230
Peach Blossom Island

725
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,880
isn't a place

726
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,900
anyone can enter easily.

727
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,420
You're right.

728
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,160
Thank you, Master Huang.

729
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,490
Why does Ouyang Feng

730
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,900
have such a grand boat?

731
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,010
It's his own boat.

732
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,240
Old Heretic Huang didn't come to

733
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,080
see us off. That's fine.

734
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,570
But this boat is so shabby.

735
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,970
I won't ride in a small and broken boat.

736
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,460
I'd rather swim.

737
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,530
Let's take the flower boat.

738
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,570
I'll ask Old Heretic Huang

739
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,790
to lend it. Okay?

740
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,750
Why bother doing that?

741
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,280
You haven't settled the score

742
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,380
of being trapped for 15 years.

743
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,230
Taking his boat is nothing.

744
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
That makes sense.

745
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,580
- Yes.
- Right?

746
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,130
Come on. Come on.

747
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,670
Old Beggar, what are you doing?

748
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,080
Brother Guo.

749
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,170
Don't look back.

750
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,420
We're finally getting out.

751
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,650
Don't think of going back

752
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,570
for your wife.

753
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,270
Old Heretic Huang is eccentric.

754
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,650
He might also trap you for 15 years.

755
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,490
What should you do?

756
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
You've seen the island's

757
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,970
formations.

758
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,360
We'll be together forever, forever.

759
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,400
Don't go back!

760
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,500
Let's have fun!

761
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,820
Let's go!

762
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,490
Jing.

763
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,310
Don't look back.

764
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,820
I know what you're thinking.

765
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,790
Rong is a person.

766
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,400
He can hold her back for a while,

767
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,900
but can her father hold her back
for a lifetime?

768
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,310
Once this thing settle,

769
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,340
I will figure it out for you.

770
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,820
I spoiled Rong.

771
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,890
She grew up

772
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,750
on this small island.

773
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,460
She doesn't understand

774
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,540
the deceitful hearts

775
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,980
and dangers of the world.

776
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,790
Guo Jing...

777
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,540
This kid is

778
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,370
very cunning.

779
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,670
He tricked Hong Qigong

780
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,450
into teaching him the whole set

781
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,670
of Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms,

782
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,270
and tricked Zhou Botong

783
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,420
into becoming his sworn brother.

784
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,820
He's sincere and honest?

785
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,420
I will never marry Rong

786
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,070
to him.

787
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,010
Old Heretic Huang's boat

788
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,110
is flashy outside.

789
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,210
But he has everything

790
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,420
below the deck.

791
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,240
Jing,

792
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,270
come drink with me.

793
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,340
Old Heretic Huang's wine is good.

794
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,850
Master,

795
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,420
I don't feel like drinking now.

796
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,560
Zhou Botong!

797
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,230
Come drink with me!

798
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,170
Luckily, we chose this boat.

799
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,440
It's so much fun. What are we drinking?

800
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,420
Come drink with me.

801
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,290
Brother Guo.

802
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,980
It's all my fault.

803
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,490
I thought Old Heretic Huang

804
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,230
was fixated on the Nine Yin Manual.

805
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,230
But I didn't expect that to happen,

806
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,110
making him misunderstand you.

807
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,020
It's- It's so hard to explain now.

808
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,450
Brother Zhou.

809
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,170
You meant well

810
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,590
and taught me great skills.

811
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,860
How could I blame you?

812
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,710
Do you forgive me?

813
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,380
I won't do it again. I won't.

814
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,800
Jing. Jing. Come here.

815
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,190
- Yes. No more playing.
- Come and sit.

816
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,400
- Let's have a drink.
- Let's drink.

817
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,240
Come here.

818
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,680
Have a seat.

819
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,280
We'll definitely figure out a way

820
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,590
to bring Rong back.

821
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:38,940
Yes. Sit down.

822
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,450
Here.

823
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,070
I'm afraid

824
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,010
Master Huang won't allow me

825
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,500
to see Rong again.

826
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,940
How can

827
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,690
a grown man

828
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,840
think about trivial love affairs

829
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,230
all day long?

830
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,840
When you become

831
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,010
a strong and upright man,

832
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,970
aren't you worried Yaoshi

833
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,360
won't marry his daughter to you?

834
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,820
He'll definitely let Rong marry you.

835
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,160
But, Master,

836
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,670
what should I do

837
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,790
to become that kind of

838
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,940
strong and upright man?

839
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,790
Look at me.

840
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,170
All beggars from the world

841
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,070
listen to me.

842
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,840
I defeat the powerful, assist the weak

843
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,540
uphold justice, and settle grudges joyfully.

844
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,150
Do you want to be like me?

845
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,520
Of course.

846
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,890
I definitely want to

847
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,670
become a person like you,

848
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,420
defeating the powerful,

849
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,630
assisting the weak,

850
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,340
- upholding justice...
- Brother Guo.

851
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,500
Did you understand or not?

852
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,270
Old beggar

853
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,590
wants you to succeed him

854
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,670
as the young beggar.

855
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Soon, I will take

856
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,750
the Nine Yin Manual to meet you.

857
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,070
They insisted on

858
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,070
taking that ship.

859
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,520
So

860
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,310
it's all their fault.

861
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,680
Jing.

862
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,280
You've already mastered

863
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,500
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

864
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,670
Your character and martial arts are superior.

865
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,450
Anyway, I'm tired of being the gang leader.

866
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,290
Why don't you

867
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,230
be the master of the gang?

868
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,280
That's settled then!

869
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,200
Greetings, Master Guo!

870
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,340
I don't think so.

871
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,190
Why is there water everywhere?

872
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,240
The water is celebrating for you.

873
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,380
That's fun!

874
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:38,890
Jump down!

875
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,020
Jing!

876
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,710
Jing!

877
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,590
Faster!

878
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,070
