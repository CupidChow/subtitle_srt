2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,980
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,910
Senior, please stay.

4
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,930
You want to save Duan Zhixing?

5
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,070
Me and Rong

6
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,730
received the grace of Reverend Yideng.

7
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,160
How can we stand by

8
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,010
and watch him suffer?

9
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,090
You remember his grace,

10
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,900
but forgot that I saved you first?

11
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,500
I also remember

12
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,010
your kindness to me.

13
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,830
It's just

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,710
you should not use us

15
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,750
to plot against Reverend Yideng.

16
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,030
If you can atone for your sins

17
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,030
simply by shaving your head

18
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,550
and saying Amitabha,

19
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,430
there will be

20
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,970
no grudges in the world.

21
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,460
Today

22
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,180
either you kill me,

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,340
or I kill him.

24
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,100
Duan Zhixing.

25
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,020
Senior, don't.

26
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Reverend,

27
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,540
what does this mean?

28
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,260
Jing.

29
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,780
I appreciate your kindness.

30
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,620
During these years,

31
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,540
I have always been afraid

32
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,620
I don't have much time left

33
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,620
and can't wait for Yinggu

34
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,700
to end this karma.

35
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,340
I've been waiting

36
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,740
for this moment for a long time.

37
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
It's time

38
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,660
to end everything.

39
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,420
Your Majesty.

40
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,460
I have been waiting for you.

41
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,580
What took you so long?

42
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,940
I needed to seclude myself these days

43
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,980
to practice martial arts.

44
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
Sorry for neglecting you.

45
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,260
Are you okay?

46
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,340
It's okay.

47
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,420
How come a woman like you

48
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,580
suddenly want to learn martial arts?

49
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,180
I just want to know

50
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,300
what the martial arts are like

51
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,460
that interest you so much.

52
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,100
It's him.

53
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,260
(Benefiting All Beings)

54
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,700
Qiu Qianren.

55
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,540
It's you.

56
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,300
You were the one who killed my son.

57
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,060
I can never forget

58
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,220
the laughter of yours.

59
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
Give me your life.

60
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,580
I have no grudge against you.

61
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,180
Why did you kill my son?

62
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,700
Why?

63
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,740
I didn't want to.

64
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,660
I left him in one piece,

65
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,700
hoping that Emperor Duan

66
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,900
would save him

67
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,420
for old times' sake.

68
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,820
Then,

69
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,300
I can have one less opponent

70
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,020
at the Duel atop Mount Hua.

71
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Who would have thought that Yideng

72
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,740
didn't have a kind heart back then.

73
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,500
It's just this kid's fate.

74
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
What a pity.

75
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,460
Brute.

76
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,340
I'm going to kill you.

77
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,180
I'm going to kill you.

78
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,620
I want to thank you.

79
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,900
You deceived Huang Rong
to come here for treatment,

80
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,260
not only did he get poisoned,

81
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,140
but also he wasted his vitality.

82
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,900
You have worked hard for many years

83
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,380
to be a mantis,

84
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,180
but unexpectedly,

85
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,900
I'm the oriole behind you.

86
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,060
Master Qiu.

87
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,420
There are two big condors

88
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,660
behind the oriole.

89
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,580
Girl.

90
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,100
Do you know that if tonight,

91
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,660
you take another palm of mine,

92
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,860
there will be

93
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,220
no second Yideng in the world

94
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,380
to heal your wounds?

95
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,780
If she is dead,

96
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,900
Old Heretic Huang
is bound to lose his mind.

97
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,140
In this way,

98
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,940
the Duel atop Mount Hua...

99
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,540
Great.

100
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,620
Girl.

101
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,780
You must die tonight.

102
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
How could you have such skills

103
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,620
at a young age?

104
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,900
If I let you practice for some more time,

105
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,900
I will have one more opponent

106
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,140
to compete with me.

107
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,100
Therefore,

108
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,940
you have to die too.

109
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,540
27, 28, 29.

110
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,300
(Brat.)

111
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,060
(What are you counting when you fight me?)

112
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,140
- Rong.
- Jing.

113
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,220
Master Qiu's inner force is profound

114
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,180
and his moves are vicious.

115
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,620
Within one hundred strikes,

116
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,260
you can tie with him.

117
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,300
But after a hundred strikes,

118
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,660
you won't be able to take it.

119
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,340
I can't let him off easily.

120
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,700
Perhaps

121
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,460
we can trick him.

122
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,060
45, 46.

123
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,940
49, 50.

124
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,380
51, 52.

125
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,780
(Still counting.)

126
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,500
(They must be playing a trick.)

127
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,140
(This brat must have
made a deal with that girl)

128
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,700
(to sneak attack me after some strikes.)

129
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,540
How long are you going to count?

130
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,740
81, 82.

131
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,260
(No, he's trying to trick me.)

132
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,820
95, 96.

133
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,340
97, 98.

134
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,420
99, 100.

135
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,140
This move is called "Hit the Dog's Head".

136
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,460
Good strategy.

137
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,460
Amitabha.

138
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,300
Master Qiu.

139
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
These years,

140
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,980
the karma

141
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,340
started all because of me.

142
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,500
And now

143
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,180
I'm just a dying person without any use.

144
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,380
Why do you bother to waste your energy

145
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,660
to exterminate them?

146
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,980
You're right.

147
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,540
I came here tonight

148
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,740
because I heard that
you had lost all your power

149
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,900
for saving lives,

150
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,700
so I wanted to do my utmost

151
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,260
to offer help.

152
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,300
It seems now

153
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,460
that you're in good state.

154
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,380
I can rest assured.

155
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,580
Qiu, don't run away!

156
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,620
Senior.

157
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,500
Senior.

158
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,900
You don't need to pity me.

159
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,940
Then you

160
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,020
should pity me

161
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,580
and settle our grudges today.

162
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
Since Emperor Duan has died,

163
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,860
the grudges between us have been settled.

164
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,900
If you're willing,

165
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,220
please release my son's soul

166
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,100
from purgatory

167
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,620
and let him rest in peace.

168
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,220
Senior, where are you going?

169
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,020
What?

170
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm going to seek revenge on Qiu.

171
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,700
Does it have something to do with you?

172
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
I only know that
there are unavoidable debts

173
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,100
of gratitude and of revenge.

174
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,100
My father hated Old Imp so much,

175
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,060
and locked him up on
Peach Blossom Island for fifteen years.

176
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,380
In the end, he released him anyway.

177
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Zhou Botong has already left the island?

178
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,380
Where is he?

179
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,820
Why hasn't he come to find me?

180
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,700
With his temper,

181
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,860
ordinary people
can't know his whereabouts.

182
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,860
Senior,

183
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,580
please keep your life and go find him.

184
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,060
After finding him,

185
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,660
you can kill Qiu together with him.

186
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,500
How does it sound?

187
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,140
Okay. Okay.

188
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,140
I will go find him right away.

189
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,260
He's also

190
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,540
in this revenge together.

191
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,820
- Reverend.
- Reverend.

192
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,500
Rechschu,

193
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,820
hahuwen poimmohanskol.

194
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,340
Why are you staring at him like that?

195
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,860
The words

196
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,300
that Indian reverend just said

197
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,140
are just like the strange words

198
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,100
in the last chapter

199
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,940
of Nine Yin Manual.

200
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,340
Rechschu,

201
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,300
hahuwen poimmohanskol.

202
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,620
Alas...

203
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,700
That's not strange words.

204
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,620
That's Sanskrit.

205
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,140
Jing.

206
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,700
How did you know

207
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,020
the content of Nine Yin Manual?

208
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,220
Well,

209
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,300
before, Big Brother and I...

210
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,020
Zhou Botong, I mean.

211
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,300
When we were trapped
on Peach Blossom Island,

212
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,140
I memorized the strange words

213
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,540
of the last chapter

214
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,660
in Nine Yin Manual with him.

215
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,060
Just now,

216
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,420
the words that Indian reverend said

217
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,180
are very similar to those

218
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,120
strange words in the chapter.

219
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,180
After Huang Chang
wrote the Nine Yin Manual,

220
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,620
he was worried that
it would fall into the hands

221
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,340
of a wicked person.

222
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,740
So he rewrote it in Sanskrit.

223
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,500
Afterwards,

224
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,420
only those who know both languages

225
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,900
can understand this manual.

226
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,980
You don't understand Sanskrit,

227
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,500
by you memorized all the words by heart.

228
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,460
This is really

229
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,140
incredible.

230
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,260
My master Qigong

231
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,140
was plotted against by Ouyang Feng,

232
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,420
poisoned

233
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,660
and lost all his martial arts skills.

234
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,860
But just by learning a few words

235
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,700
from the manual,

236
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,140
he recuperated from internal injuries.

237
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
I can't believe

238
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,900
this happened to Qigong.

239
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,500
It's a pity

240
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,380
that he only managed
to heal his internal injuries,

241
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,140
but his martial arts skills
have not recovered.

242
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,780
Reverend,

243
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,180
since you understand Sanskrit,

244
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,000
if you treat the wound

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,180
following the methods on the manual,

246
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,660
you'll definitely recover.

247
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,860
Amitabha.

248
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,300
Reverend,

249
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,940
I will write it down now.

250
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,380
It will take some time to translate.

251
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,140
Why don't you two

252
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,140
rest on the mountain for a few days?

253
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,060
I will pass it on to you

254
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,140
once I study it well.

255
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,140
Okay.

256
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,300
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Reverend.

257
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,900
You've been losing ground.

258
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,820
Why are you urging me?

259
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,460
Immediately go back
and report to His Majesty.

260
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,100
Once I obtain the Book of Wumu,

261
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,940
I will hurry back to apologize.

262
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,500
Father, why are you so angry?

263
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,780
Back then, Yue Fei received

264
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,060
twelve golden recall orders,

265
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,100
but now I have received

266
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,780
only six imperial decrees,

267
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,260
urging me to return to the court.

268
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,860
I can actually understand

269
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,580
how he was feeling at that time.

270
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,260
Kang.

271
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,660
Now the situation
in the front line is tense.

272
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,620
All the pressure

273
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,980
are transferred to us.

274
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,100
If we are still unable

275
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,180
to get the Book of Wumu
and turn the tide,

276
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,620
and His Majesty gets angry,

277
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,700
you and I

278
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,540
will surely have to suffer.

279
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,420
Soon it will be the fifteenth of August.

280
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,300
All the martial arts masters

281
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,380
will go to the Drunken Immortal Tower
in Jiaxing

282
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,760
for the Martial Artists General Assembly.

283
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,580
As a disciple of
the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan,

284
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,650
Guo Jing will definitely attend.

285
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,060
This is our chance
to retrieve the Book of Wumu.

286
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,820
This is our only opportunity

287
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,220
to turn the tables.

288
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,580
Father, rest assured.

289
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,740
I already have a plan.

290
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
Greetings, Master.

291
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,740
If you want to learn martial arts with me,

292
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,540
then study hard.

293
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,860
If you still can't let go
of romantic affairs,

294
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,580
you can leave now.

295
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Please rest assured, Master.

296
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,420
At present, I am fully focused

297
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,020
on practicing martial arts with you.

298
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,820
Okay.

299
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,380
Then I will teach you

300
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,220
Snake Boxing today.

301
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,500
Watch carefully.

302
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,940
I'll only perform it once.

303
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,900
Thank you, Master.

304
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,540
Master.

305
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,500
When Ke was practicing the Snake Boxing,

306
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,980
he was about your age.

307
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,740
Keep practicing.

308
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,940
Yes.

309
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,460
Zhen'e.

310
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,540
Why do we have to be the peacemaker

311
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,460
to resolve the grudges
between Old Heretic Huang

312
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,580
and Quanzhen School?

313
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,300
Considering Old Heretic Huang's
bad temper,

314
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,500
maybe he will think

315
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,260
we are meddling too much.

316
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,180
And those Taoists in Quanzhen School

317
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,700
are also not easy to deal with.

318
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,140
Even if we explain it to them,

319
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,100
they may not believe

320
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,940
Huang Yaoshi did not
kill their martial uncle.

321
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,660
Do you think Huang Yaoshi

322
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,500
will vent his anger on us

323
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,380
because last time Jing

324
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,580
did not marry his daughter?

325
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,060
Alright, alright.

326
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,780
If you don't want to go,

327
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,860
let me get off when we land.

328
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,140
I will mediate for them on my own.

329
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,660
We Seven Freaks of Jiangnan

330
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,460
always carry a sense of chivalry.

331
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,380
If we worry too much before we act,

332
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,780
how can we call ourselves
chivalrous people?

333
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,060
Also, at this moment,

334
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,660
only we know

335
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,900
the misunderstanding

336
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,460
between Quanzhen School
and Old Heretic Huang.

337
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,420
If we stand by and watch

338
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,260
the two sides

339
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,060
create a chaos in the martial world,

340
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,020
then we will be the real sinners.

341
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,140
Zhen'e.

342
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,300
We're sorry.

343
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
We will listen to you

344
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,900
and do what you said.

345
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,740
Yes, yes, yes.

346
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,260
We all listen to Zhen'e.

347
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,620
Anyway,

348
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,750
we will go to Peach Blossom Island
for the wedding sooner or later.

349
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,140
Let's go familiarize ourselves

350
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,300
with the environment.

351
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,660
Zhen'e.

352
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,660
We have arrived.

353
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,180
The Seven Freaks of Jiangnan
are here to see Master Huang.

354
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,060
Cong.

355
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,540
What does this mean?

356
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,620
Master Huang knew we would come,

357
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,740
but he doesn't want to see us.

358
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,980
See?

359
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,060
Zhen'e.

360
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,220
I told you Master Huang

361
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,580
won't appreciate our kindness.

362
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,820
Now look,

363
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,260
we got a rebuff.

364
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,380
Old Heretic Huang has a strange temper.

365
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,980
We can't go along with him this time.

366
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,420
It will be too late

367
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,050
when the people
from Quanzhen School arrive.

368
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,580
No more time to lose.

369
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,140
Even if we break in,

370
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,220
we need to see him.

371
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,060
Let's go.

372
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,020
- Zhen'e.
- Zhen'e.

373
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,660
Let's stop here.

374
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,780
Look.

375
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,540
This is tied up.

376
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,660
What's the use of this?

377
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,220
This unique formation of Eastern Heretic

378
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,020
does live up to its reputation.

379
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,180
Zhen'e.

380
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,860
Let's not waste our energy
searching for the way.

381
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,100
Look at the effort we put in.

382
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,500
Master Huang!

383
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,740
The Seven Freaks of Jiangnan
want to see you!

384
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,260
Master Huang!

385
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,340
The Seven Freaks of Jiangnan
want to see you!

386
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,220
Baoju.

387
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,100
Don't waste your efforts

388
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,340
doing these useless things.

389
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,020
Cong.

390
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,540
You are the smartest.

391
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,500
Think of a solution.

392
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,180
If I'm as smart as him,

393
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,860
I won't be trapped

394
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,540
in this formation.

395
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,660
Old Heretic Huang

396
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,020
used this stupid formation

397
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,180
to trap us here.

398
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,820
But look,

399
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,380
he still treats us

400
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,340
with nice food.

401
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,500
Zhen'e.

402
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,500
In my opinion,

403
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,100
we should fill our bellies first.

404
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,940
Everyone.

405
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,180
I have an idea.

406
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,700
Prepare the pen and ink.

407
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,900
What is this?

408
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,820
This is the character "qu".

409
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,460
You said this is...

410
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,460
If your father could know

411
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,100
you're this silly,

412
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,460
he would come back to life to teach you.

413
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,260
I'm born silly.

414
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,060
But my handwriting is good, right?

415
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,580
Yes, it is.

416
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,340
Don't write anymore.

417
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,340
Okay, okay.

418
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,340
I won't write anymore.

419
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,220
(To Huang Yaoshi)

420
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,740
What does this letter say?

421
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
I don't know.

422
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,380
But the handwriting is really nice.

423
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,100
Child,

424
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,260
I won't force you to write anymore.

425
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,580
Okay, thank you, Grandpa.

426
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,260
Go help me with something.

427
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,340
Okay.

428
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,940
I haven't told you what to do yet.

429
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,860
That mute servant
has been gone for so long.

430
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,700
Why is there still no feedback?

431
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,180
Zhu Cong.

432
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,420
Did you make it clear in the letter?

433
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,620
I wrote in the letter

434
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,820
not to escalate the misunderstanding.

435
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,140
If he cannot let go of his pride

436
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,420
to explain to the Quanzhen School,

437
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,540
then we can help him

438
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,260
clarify everything
to the Quanzhen School.

439
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,180
If Old Heretic Huang

440
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,140
still ignores us after reading it,

441
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,420
then he's really hopeless.

442
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,780
I also emphasized in the letter

443
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,020
and advised him not to act impulsively

444
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,540
to destroy Guo Jing

445
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,700
and Huang Rong's relationship.

446
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,580
Huang Yaoshi loves his daughter.

447
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,460
He wouldn't act recklessly.

448
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,700
Zhen'e.

449
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,820
Don't worry.

450
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,580
There are numerous mechanisms
on Peach Blossom Island.

451
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,900
Moreover, the servant needs some time

452
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,020
to deliver message.

453
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,860
Let's be patient and wait.

454
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,500
Who is it?

455
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,820
Grandpa asked me to take you over.

456
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,700
This is the translation

457
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,820
for the outline of Nine Yin Manual.

458
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,660
The content is profound and mysterious.

459
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,980
Although I cannot
fully understand it now,

460
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,820
according to the healing techniques

461
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,900
written on the manual,

462
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,340
originally I needed
five years of practice

463
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,340
to recover,

464
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,420
but now,

465
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,020
I can achieve that

466
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,660
in less than one month.

467
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,500
That is really great.

468
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,220
This way,

469
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,860
you can still make it

470
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,260
to the Duel atop Mount Hua.

471
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,660
At the top of Mount Hua,

472
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,340
Qiu Qianren

473
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,980
would be devastated.

474
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,300
Since I am wholeheartedly
devoted to Buddhism,

475
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,700
I will no longer get involved
in the affairs of the martial world.

476
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,380
But you guys

477
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,180
should give this Nine Yin Manual

478
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,540
to your master quickly.

479
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,740
Tell him

480
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,700
to practice according to the techniques.

481
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,420
Then he can open up his meridians

482
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,580
and restore his martial arts skills.

483
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,380
Okay, we'll give it to Master.

484
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,620
In that case,

485
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,740
I won't keep you any longer.

486
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,900
Be careful on your way.

487
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,860
Sir.

488
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,460
We will come to visit you again.

489
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,580
Botong.

490
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,460
Botong.

491
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,340
Old Imp!

492
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,260
Old Imp! Old Imp! Old Imp!

493
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,180
You always call my name.

494
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,220
I can't even fall asleep.

495
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,180
So annoying.

496
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,500
You are such a pain in the ass.

497
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,060
Old Imp. Old Imp.

498
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,260
You...

499
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,820
Old Beggar.

500
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,460
Well,

501
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,860
if I had left you

502
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,060
at the palace,

503
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,220
would you still call me?

504
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,220
Why are you so weird?

505
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
You said you couldn't stay in the palace.

506
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,780
Now you became impatient again.

507
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,260
Who's the pain in the ass exactly?

508
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,300
I...

509
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,420
We are...

510
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,350
You are glib-tongued
because you've eaten too much.

511
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,660
I can't outspeak you.

512
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,380
I'm going to find Rong

513
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,500
and have her serve you.

514
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,700
Then I'll get my freedom back.

515
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,260
Then I'll tell Rong

516
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,460
you left me here alone

517
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,940
to sink or swim.

518
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,980
Poor me.

519
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,620
I've served you quite well.

520
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,860
Don't tell Rong that.

521
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,220
Or she won't bring me anything fun.

522
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,380
I ran out of wine.

523
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,580
When you are running,

524
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,940
be steady.

525
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,740
Don't shake the wine.

526
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,460
Also, the wine is the
most mellow in the hour

527
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,540
after it comes out of the jar.

528
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,300
But the journey is long,

529
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,420
so I won't force you.

530
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,180
If you come back within two hours,

531
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,940
I will praise your lightness techniques.

532
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,420
Old Beggar.

533
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,740
Are you looking down

534
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,650
on my lightness techniques?

535
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,540
Half an hour.

536
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,740
Just wait and see if I can

537
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,580
come back in half an hour.

538
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,860
Follow this road east for twenty miles

539
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,100
and we'll reach Jiaxing.

540
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,730
Come on.

541
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,100
His Royal Highness is waiting for us.

542
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,940
Alright.

543
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,420
What's the rush?

544
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,300
It's still early for the 15th of August.

545
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,940
I think you are afraid
to go to the Drunken Immortal Tower.

546
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,220
I'm afraid? Well...

547
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,100
Of course I'm afraid.

548
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,580
You talk as if you're not afraid.

549
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,800
What's the interesting event

550
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,200
at the Drunken Immortal Tower
on August 15?

551
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,260
Didn't I tell you last time?

552
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,340
I forgot. Say it again.

553
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,220
- Zhou Botong.
- It's me, it's me.

554
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,700
Why are you running?

555
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,820
Why do they love to run so much?

556
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,260
How about you run errands for me?

557
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
This is what I stole

558
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,580
from Peach Blossom Island.

559
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,420
No,

560
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,660
I brought it back.

561
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,380
Eat.

562
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,100
The thing you just ate

563
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,900
is a poison

564
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,180
that will kick off in 49 days.

565
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Apart from me,

566
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,500
no one else can detoxify you.

567
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,660
As long as you listen to me...

568
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,900
I will definitely listen to you.

569
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,540
Good, good, good.

570
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
It's so fun.

571
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,220
Botong.

572
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,660
The method you came up with

573
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,980
is really wonderful.

574
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,620
I'm fed up with

575
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,820
being ordered around by you.

576
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,020
In the future, just order them

577
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
to buy meat and drinks.

578
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,660
Don't boss me around anymore.

579
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,780
Did you hear me? You run the fastest.

580
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,980
I heard it, I heard it.

581
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,300
Please don't hit me.

582
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
I can hear everything.

583
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,820
What method did you use

584
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,900
to make the four of them

585
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,620
listen to you?

586
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,780
Old Beggar.

587
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,460
Why don't you take a guess?

588
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,100
If you guess it right,

589
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,620
I will still run errands for you.

590
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,220
If you guess it wrong,

591
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,340
you can let me go without
any breach of contract, okay?

592
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,780
Do you think I'm stupid?

593
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,220
I'm in a sedan chair now.

594
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,860
I'm not guessing anything.

595
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,260
Old Beggar, you are no fun.

596
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,700
Boring, boring, boring.

597
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,180
I've been fooled.

598
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,540
I've been fooled, Old Beggar.

599
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,100
The world is so big.

600
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,780
How will Rong find us?

601
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,980
What if they can't find me?

602
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,860
Then I'll have to serve you

603
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,780
for the rest of my life.

604
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,300
I've been fooled.

605
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,220
Don't worry.

606
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,100
Don't be so petty-minded.

607
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,620
I've left marks along the way.

608
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,580
Sooner or later,

609
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,060
they will find me.

610
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,740
That's good, that's good. Well done.

611
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,420
What marks? It's fine.

612
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,500
Teach me, teach me.

613
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,660
I'm hungry.

614
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,980
Can't teach you now.

615
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,020
You four, run!

616
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,380
Run, run, run, quickly.

617
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,540
Qigong's hungry now.

618
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,900
Too brutal.

619
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,340
Brutal? Run, run, run!

620
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,580
All four of you run!

621
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,180
I won't drink.

622
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,260
I won't eat, I won't eat.

623
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,700
I won't drink. I won't drink.

624
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,860
Old Beggar, are you still not full?

625
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
In Jiaxing,

626
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,220
all we do is eat and drink.

627
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,060
Boring!

628
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,940
Not fun, not fun.

629
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,820
The four of you,

630
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,380
do you know what else is fun in Jiaxing?

631
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,100
Tell me. Tell me.

632
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,940
I heard

633
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,620
there are many beauties in Jiaxing.

634
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,860
Their skin is radiant and delicate.

635
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,700
How about

636
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,860
you go and try it?

637
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,140
Try my foot.

638
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,820
Women are not as fun as martial arts.

639
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,260
Your martial arts are so weak

640
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,460
just because of women.

641
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,300
You know? You know? You know?

642
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
Mr. Zhou, please stop that.

643
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,060
I've had another bump on my head.

644
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,940
Full of bumps. Full of bumps.

645
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,900
Full of bumps. Got it?

646
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,660
Well,

647
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,860
the four of you can hit me together.

648
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,940
No, no, no.

649
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,220
Senior.

650
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,700
Look, I...

651
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,890
I have a fun idea.

652
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,460
- Do you want to give it a try?
- Just tell me if it's fun.

653
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,620
We can have a match over meditation.

654
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,620
Whoever holds out longer

655
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,740
wins.

656
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,580
This is fun.

657
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,940
Let's do this.

658
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,980
But you have to promise us.

659
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,660
If we win,

660
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,500
please give us the antidote

661
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,580
and then let us leave.

662
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,940
They're just fooling you.

663
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
Match over meditation.
How can you beat those monks?

664
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,020
I am a Taoist.

665
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,980
I do meditation too.

666
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,140
You are not a real Taoist.

667
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,220
You are definitely going to lose.

668
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,220
Let's have the match! Let's do it.

669
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,300
The more you say that,

670
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,180
the more I'm determined to win.

671
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,460
- Let's get started.
- Let's begin.

672
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,740
Unscrupulous!

673
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,900
Unscrupulous!

674
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,140
Unscrupulous!

675
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,420
Botong.

676
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,540
Botong.

677
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,580
Senior.

678
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,580
Senior.

679
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,860
The Jiaxing dishes
at Drunken Immortal Tower

680
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,700
are especially famous.

681
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,460
But the most famous

682
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,460
is the Nu Er Hong wine.

683
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,380
Its fragrance

684
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,260
can linger in your mouth.

685
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,500
Many people in the martial world

686
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,420
come here to taste wine
and exchange martial arts skills.

687
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,580
Master must be here.

688
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,660
(Drunken Immortal Tower)

689
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,820
My seven masters

690
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,860
made the agreement right here

691
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,780
with Taoist Qiu

692
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,420
for me and Yang Kang
to compete in martial arts

693
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,140
eighteen years later.

694
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,460
This time I visit here,

695
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,180
everything has changed.

696
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,820
It's okay, Jing.

697
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,900
After we get the things done,

698
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,500
we will have a good drink

699
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,660
with the six masters here.

700
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,860
What do you think?

701
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,340
Okay.

702
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,140
These two people have been sitting here

703
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,980
for two hours.

704
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,980
Could it be that they are dead?

705
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,420
No, no.

706
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,260
What are you doing?

707
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,900
Big Brother.

708
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,300
Did they bully you?
What's wrong with you?

709
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,420
They're competing with each other.

710
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,380
So that's how it is.

711
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,140
It's good that he's fine.

712
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,180
What exactly happened?

713
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,140
Tell the truth.

714
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,260
There's another fight going on.

715
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,740
The Drunken Immortal Tower
will renovate again for a few days.

716
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,860
Let's go.

717
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,180
Well, Senior Zhou made a bet

718
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,020
with that monk

719
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,740
that whoever moves first loses.

720
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,260
It's none of our business.

721
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,180
None of our business.

722
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,460
Where is Qigong?

723
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,780
He was drinking here earlier.

724
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,460
Later, I don't know what happened,

725
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,140
he went downstairs for something,

726
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,580
and hasn't come back yet.

727
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,980
- Yeah.
- He left in a hurry.

728
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,100
- What a coincidence.
- Where did he go?

729
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,120
Which direction was he heading?

730
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,900
When did he leave?

731
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,300
I really don't know.

732
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,380
Old Imp.

733
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,500
Where is Qigong?

734
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,020
Don't know how many hours

735
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,340
will you sit here

736
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,420
to determine the winner.

737
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,860
It's not fun.

738
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,980
Well,

739
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,460
I will hit your laughing acupoint

740
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,540
at the same time.

741
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,380
Who laughs first

742
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,220
loses.

743
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,420
Well...

744
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,020
This...

745
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,820
Rong, Jing.

746
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,340
You guys are so bad, making me lose.

747
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,180
He lost.

748
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,580
Monk, you won, you won.

749
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,420
We won!

750
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,380
Big Brother, you're so playful.

751
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,620
I'm thirsty, pour some wine.

752
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,060
- Pour it, pour it.
- Good, good, very good.

753
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,860
I admit defeat.

754
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,740
Senior Zhou.

755
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,540
Where is our antidote?

756
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,620
- Yes, the antidote.
- Antidote.

757
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,660
How much do you need?

758
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,080
- I'll rub some dirt for you.
- Senior.

759
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,980
You might as well

760
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,860
pick two boogers for us.

761
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,460
I do have some, do you want it?

762
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,700
You can't do this.

763
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,860
It's our pleasure.

764
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,060
It's just for fun.

765
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,580
Be good.

766
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,420
Senior, if there are nothing else,

767
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,300
we're leaving first.

768
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,620
Go, go, go.

769
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,540
I had a great time playing with you.

770
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,340
- So much fun!
- Monk.

771
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,740
Why haven't you left yet?

772
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,420
Do you want to get hit by my stick?

773
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,060
Did he use too much internal force

774
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,140
to close the acupoints

775
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,380
and died?

776
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,860
Old Imp.

777
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,300
You've been fooled.

778
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,620
Why?

779
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,740
Don't blame me, please.

780
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,300
It was their bad idea.

781
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,460
You cheated.

782
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,780
Let's compete again.

783
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,420
Old Imp.

784
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,560
I asked you to take care of my master.

785
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,380
Where is he?

786
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,340
Yes, Big Brother.

787
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,380
Where is Master?

788
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,380
Old Beggar was there just now.

789
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,220
I was here.

790
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,940
- Where's he?
- Jing.

791
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Let's go find Master.

792
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,580
Let's go.

793
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,760
Big Brother, you can play by yourself.

794
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,670
Wait for me to go find Qigong.

795
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,180
Old Beggar, they have left.

796
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Hide and seek, you won!

797
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,060
Come out.

798
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,580
Come out.

799
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,500
Old Beggar.

800
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,060
Come out.

801
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,140
You won. Come out, come out.

802
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,340
Come out, come out!
