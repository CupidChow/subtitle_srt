1
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:13,897
Where are we going to eat later?

2
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:15,674
Timmy, can I borrow your fan?

3
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:18,719
Borrow my fan?
Stop being so coy, Dominic!

4
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,775
- Bitch.
- It's so hot in here.

5
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,059
Our "skinny" friend here
is not used to it.

6
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,811
Mr. Cruz, you know
that's not allowed here.

7
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,980
- This, sir?
- Yes. Fans are for girls.

8
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,744
Hey, stop doing that.

9
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:42,189
Mr. Armada! Sit properly!

10
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:43,793
This is the house of the Lord.

11
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:45,871
- Sorry, sir.
- Put that coin away.

12
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:48,844
Sir.

13
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,556
May I borrow your fan?

14
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:55,736
But you have to promise me

15
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:58,221
that you will win the game
against St. Lucas later.

16
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,072
No problem, sir.

17
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,272
- That's easy.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:47,717
(THE BOY FORETOLD BY THE STARS)

19
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:02,553
(babe, I'm already here.
Where are you?)

20
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:05,307
(OMG, babe. I'm still here
at our council meeting.)

21
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,801
(Can you wait for me until 5PM?)

22
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,935
(Babe, I can't.
My basketball practice starts at 5.)

23
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:40,819
Remember, we have to make
this experience extra special.

24
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,922
The goal is to bring the new
participants closer to God.

25
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:44,948
Okay?

26
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:46,492
- Yes, brother.
- That's all for today.

27
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,552
Oh, and Dominic,

28
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:51,991
make sure that you help Jeff in all
the preparations for this batch.

29
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:54,550
- Yes, brother.
- It's a good training for you.

30
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,291
You never know, you might be
the next batch head.

31
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:57,961
Oh, my god, brother!
Don't be like that.

32
00:03:58,045 --> 00:03:59,500
Don't get my hopes up.

33
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,190
Do you have questions?

34
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:03,525
You're flirting even with Bro, Mike?

35
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,260
"Don't be like that,
don't get my hopes up."

36
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,348
- Shut up.
- Okay, dismissed.

37
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:11,076
- Okay, girls, I'll go ahead.
- Don't go yet, Dominic.

38
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:11,934
You're so unfair.

39
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,911
I accompanied you
on your classroom duties

40
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:15,896
so you should come with me
to Quiapo this weekend.

41
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,981
- Are you for real?
- Yes, I'm serious. Look at this.

42
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,236
Baby R, really?

43
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,463
That sounds so fake.

44
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,799
Don't be so negative! This is legit.

45
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:28,926
This is the man/woman

46
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:31,011
behind the most recent celebrity pairings.

47
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:35,284
The reason why Alex
and Carmen got together.

48
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,191
Also, Lloydie and Angelica,

49
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,750
Direk J and Chenylyn, and many more!

50
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,308
Basically, all their predictions come true.

51
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:48,111
It's about time
we get our fortune told!

52
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,446
Sounds dubious to me.

53
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:51,324
Please, friend!

54
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,650
This is for my future with Joseph!

55
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:54,810
Friend!

56
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,004
Don't walk like that,
it doesn't suit you!

57
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:03,880
(Babe?)

58
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,054
(Hi, babe.)

59
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:10,024
(Can we talk?)

60
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,624
(Babe, let's talk tomorrow.
I'm too tired.)

61
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,342
(I love you, babe. Good night.)

62
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:22,237
(I love you, too.)

63
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:35,184
Hey boys,

64
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,117
the sign-up sheet for Journey is up.

65
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,937
Maybe it's time for you guys to join.

66
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:39,980
Nah, bro.

67
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:40,942
Why not?

68
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,235
Everyone there is gay.

69
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,530
Asshole, that's not true.

70
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:45,779
There are a lot of straight guys there,

71
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,683
like me.

72
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,130
Exactly, you're all gay.

73
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:51,011
Fuck you!
Just kidding.

74
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:54,161
But seriously, you guys have
to try it before we graduate.

75
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,309
Take it from me,

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,306
it's a really great experience.

77
00:05:57,331 --> 00:06:01,018
And you know what,
there's a great thing about it.

78
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:01,970
What?

79
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:05,131
You can ask for Palanca letters
from the girls you like,

80
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,821
like Jeya

81
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:08,792
and Karen.

82
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,445
Bro,

83
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,055
if Jeya writes you a Palanca letter,

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,599
we'll finally know
if she likes you or not!

85
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,595
I don't need it, bro!

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,099
I'm definitely her type.

87
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,855
You're so cocky.

88
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:24,817
But seriously, boys,
you have to try going once.

89
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:26,864
There's nothing to lose.

90
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,463
And you know what?

91
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:32,542
For me, it's a good way to disconnect

92
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,399
and make people realize
how much you mean to them.

93
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,054
No cellphone for three days.

94
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,374
But at the end of it all,

95
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,955
they'll be the ones calling you first.

96
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:44,769
Okay, then. It's your treat.

97
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,647
Sure. Just kidding.

98
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,645
I'll help you sign up.
Let's go.

99
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:07,744
(Babe, it's already 5.
Where are you?)

100
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,212
Heads, school.

101
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,794
Tails, I'll wait.

102
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,493
Sis, let me catch a ride with you later.

103
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:42,561
Don't you have a ride home?

104
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,021
- Nah, I don't.
- You can ride with me.

105
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,029
- I'll go with Miguel.
- Alright.

106
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,441
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay.

107
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,801
What the hell!

108
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,270
Oh, my god, look!

109
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,482
It's Paul!

110
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:15,736
- Call him!
- I don't want to.

111
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,303
Why are you playing hard-to-get?!

112
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,311
Girl, you should get used to it by now.

113
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:20,376
Hold on.

114
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:22,184
Has Paul ever joined Journey?

115
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,643
No, not yet. Why?

116
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:25,708
- That's a good idea, sis!
- What do you mean?

117
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,066
Girl, you should invite Paul
to join the next batch.

118
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,023
Since you're the vice-head,

119
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:33,028
this is the perfect chance
to get to know him better.

120
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:34,504
- That's right!
- Oh, my god, no.

121
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,895
That's exactly the reason why people
don't want to join Journey,

122
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,070
because they feel like
we'll take advantage of them!

123
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:43,055
That's just a rumor made up
by people in the closet

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,848
since they can't join
without getting outed!

125
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,007
True, true.

126
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,351
Hey, stop playing hard-to-get
and go for it!

127
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,170
This is a golden opportunity!

128
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,187
I don't want to.

129
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:54,232
Girl, you knew you liked Paul

130
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:56,234
even before you realized you were gay.

131
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,944
Go for it, stop playing hard-to-get.

132
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,905
- I'm shy.
- Girl, go for it, push this!

133
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,973
- Push it. Push!
- Push, push!

134
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:04,065
Go for it. Good luck!

135
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,278
Are you okay?

136
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,012
I'm fine.

137
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,754
Yeah, he's fine.
He's super fine!

138
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:16,880
Super fine.

139
00:09:16,905 --> 00:09:17,994
That's good.

140
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,202
Thank you, Paul.

141
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,523
Paul! Have you joined Journey?

142
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:22,969
Not yet. Why?

143
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,888
No reason, just curious.

144
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:26,765
But you are interested
in joining, right?

145
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,835
Of course! Jason told me
it was a really fun experience.

146
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,842
Super fun! Legit!

147
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:36,716
Maybe I'm just looking
for someone to help convince me.

148
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,193
Oh, really?

149
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:41,104
Well, Dominic is absolutely
perfect for that role.

150
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:44,054
He can convince you in no time.

151
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:46,929
So, it's you.

152
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:53,500
Oh, my god! I can't believe it,
I can't believe it!

153
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:57,028
We actually spoke,
we spoke, I can't!

154
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:58,839
<i>Are you possessed?!</i>

155
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,215
<i>You're something else!</i>

156
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,901
<i>You act all innocent
but when you flirt,</i>

157
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:02,968
<i>all bets are off!</i>

158
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:04,594
Really? Was I that obvious?

159
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:05,745
<i>Well, you told him,</i>

160
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,119
<i>"Don't worry, I will take care
of you, promise,"</i>

161
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:09,542
<i>and then you reached
for his hand.</i>

162
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,559
<i>You flirt!</i>

163
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:13,292
Hello, I was just being nice!

164
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:14,855
<i>Whatever!</i>

165
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,325
But seriously,
I feel like this is destiny!

166
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,087
<i>If you say so. Bye!</i>

167
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:21,728
<i>So I should be the one to sacrifice</i>

168
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:24,739
<i>my co-curricular activities
just to fit in your schedule?</i>

169
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:26,683
That's not what I mean.

170
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,119
I just want to make this work.

171
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:31,030
<i>So what do you suggest we do?</i>

172
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,899
I don't know.

173
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:35,317
<i>That's just like you.</i>

174
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,652
<i>You always don't know what to do.</i>

175
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:39,920
<i>You want our relationship to work,</i>

176
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:42,201
<i>but I'm always the one who has
to make adjustments for you.</i>

177
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,202
That's not what I meant.

178
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,009
<i>Maybe...</i>

179
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:49,241
<i>it's time for us to take a break.</i>

180
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,043
Please.

181
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:55,128
Don't do this.

182
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,047
<i>I am sorry, Luke.</i>

183
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,115
<i>Goodbye.</i>

184
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,979
Girl! Out of the way! Dominic!

185
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,982
I can hear you
from a mile away, Timmy!

186
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,196
Why are you screaming
like you're in a horror movie?

187
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,194
Oh, my god!

188
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:20,587
Legit?

189
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,197
Legit! Oh, my god!

190
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:48,304
(Journey with the Lord.
Sign-up here.)

191
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,260
<i>Hi, welcome to HomeBoy!</i>

192
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:57,131
<i>I am the one and only
King of Talk, Bhoy!</i>

193
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:59,668
<i>Today, we have a special guest.</i>

194
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:01,644
<i>Girl, where are you?
I'm on the way to Quiapo.</i>

195
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,644
I'm on my way.
I'm just waiting for my driver.

196
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:06,117
<i>Jared Quirino!</i>

197
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:07,646
<i>Hello, thank you for having me.</i>

198
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,700
<i>Shout out to my friends
from St. Francis School!</i>

199
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,196
<i>Ma, Pa, hello!</i>

200
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:13,784
<i>Thank you for coming here.</i>

201
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,079
I didn't realize Jared's
already left <i>Pinoy Big Brother</i>.

202
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,668
<i>Oh, who is he with?</i>

203
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:20,438
I think he's with our batchmates.

204
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:23,008
<i>With Joseph and Luke!</i>

205
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,318
<i>Welcome to HomeBoy guys,
welcome!</i>

206
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:28,725
<i>Oh, my god,
I'm so excited to meet Baby R.</i>

207
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:32,367
Oh, right. Okay, bye.

208
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,518
<i>Hurry up!</i>

209
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:36,965
<i>Luke has a special talent to show us.</i>

210
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,748
<i>This was viral online!</i>

211
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,859
<i>Come on, show us!</i>

212
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:42,853
<i>Show us, show us!</i>

213
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:48,950
<i>Let's give it up for Luke!</i>

214
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,132
<i>Stay tuned for more on HomeBoy!</i>

215
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,174
How many mattresses did we buy?

216
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,533
We already have four.

217
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:04,357
How about boxes?

218
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:05,525
I don't know.

219
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,218
I think we got everything already.

220
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,528
What do you think?

221
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:10,787
I'm so tired, Timmy!

222
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:15,744
Timmy, do you even know
where we're going?

223
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,520
We've been walking for almost an hour.

224
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,844
Well, the guy said
it's just around the corner.

225
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:23,109
Just hold on a little longer!
This is for our love life.

226
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:24,562
Just yours.

227
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:27,273
Fine, fine, I'll ask for directions again.

228
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,282
Wait, I think it's there.

229
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:31,242
Let's go! Just a little more!

230
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:34,349
There!

231
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,179
OMG, girl!

232
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:53,314
This is it!

233
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:56,692
Anyone home?

234
00:13:57,394 --> 00:13:58,501
Baby R?

235
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:09,928
Welcome!

236
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,582
Hey, go back inside.
You're scaring the customers.

237
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,444
Are you really Baby R?

238
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:25,897
Who else could it be?

239
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:30,301
Now tell me, who wants to have
their fortune told?

240
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:31,494
Are you in a rush?

241
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:35,115
Yeah, I have a Zumba class
at 5PM so let's start now.

242
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,324
Really?

243
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:38,260
Wait, before we get started,

244
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:41,204
let me just confirm
if you're <i>the</i> Baby R

245
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:46,156
who has an accuracy of 99.5%
in predicting soulmates.

246
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:47,888
The one and only.

247
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:49,487
Okay.

248
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:52,410
I expected you to look like
an old fortune teller.

249
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,722
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

250
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,314
I am the real Baby R.

251
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:01,243
Before we get started,

252
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,453
a warning:

253
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:11,551
I don't guarantee that
everything I foretell is true.

254
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,893
Treat this as a guide to life.

255
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:15,952
There's always a possibility

256
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:17,960
that my prediction won't
come true. Understand?

257
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:22,091
Kidding, let's do this!

258
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:24,888
Do you know what this is?

259
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,835
It's a mermaid. That's you.

260
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,385
This symbolizes the water element.

261
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:33,098
So it means water will play
a part in your destiny.

262
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,574
Your soulmate might be a swimmer.

263
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,911
Swimmer?

264
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,803
She said swimmer! Oh, my god!

265
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,507
Joseph's a swimmer, right?

266
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:42,138
I think this means

267
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:44,142
I have to hang out by the pool all day!

268
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,411
But you don't even know how to swim!

269
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:47,907
Then I'll learn! All for love.
Right, Baby R?

270
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:49,296
That's up to you.

271
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:50,673
Okay, that's the end for you.

272
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,199
Do you want to go next?

273
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,602
Oh, no. I'm okay.

274
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,069
I'm not into this kind of thing.

275
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:58,031
Girl, didn't you hear
what she just told me?

276
00:15:58,056 --> 00:15:59,157
Besides, we're already here.

277
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:00,658
But I don't believe in fortune telling.

278
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:02,550
No one can foresee
what will happen in the future

279
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,287
because it hasn't happened yet. Sorry.

280
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:05,330
Wait, please.

281
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:07,045
Dominic, don't be so skeptical!

282
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,666
Didn't you hear what she said earlier?

283
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:10,210
These are just guides to the future,

284
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,295
it doesn't mean it will actually happen.

285
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,307
So just try it! Come on. Don't be lame.

286
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:15,840
It's okay if you don't want to...

287
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:17,258
No, we want to hear our fortunes.

288
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:18,718
- Right?
- No.

289
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,470
Come on, girl. It's my treat.

290
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,385
Why are you being so pushy about this?

291
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,744
I'm just curious and I want to know

292
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,517
what the future holds for you.

293
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,989
And besides,

294
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,463
sometimes you need to do stupid things.

295
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:32,023
You need to loosen up!

296
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,883
Fine, just this once!

297
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,068
And you're paying.

298
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:36,083
Okay, fine, I'll pay.

299
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,192
He's ready.

300
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:39,472
- Can we start?
- Yes.

301
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:41,434
And now you can choose your cards,

302
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,585
you overacting gays.

303
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:44,177
Unbelievable.

304
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,270
Hurry up.

305
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,834
I'm so excited!

306
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:52,860
Here you go.

307
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,234
Cut the deck into three parts.

308
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:15,717
Now,

309
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,221
choose six cards and give them to me.

310
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:39,032
This card is you.

311
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:43,606
This is the Fool card.

312
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:47,040
It symbolizes people like us.

313
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,625
People who are different.

314
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,959
Queer.

315
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:52,895
What's so funny?

316
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,188
Dominic's still in the closet.

317
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,648
Just to my family.

318
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,854
Sorry. Go ahead.

319
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,056
Opposite your card is the King card.

320
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,216
This symbolizes your future soulmate.

321
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,646
You're lucky to get a court card

322
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,548
because others are not as fortunate.

323
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,525
They get cards that decrease
the possibility

324
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,183
of finding their soulmate.

325
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:20,782
At the bottom of your cards
are the Sun and Tower cards.

326
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,810
This means you have a chance
at a relationship.

327
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:27,321
Oh, my god!
The future is bright!

328
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,608
But you need to be careful,

329
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:34,391
because underneath these cards
are the Hermit and Moon cards.

330
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:36,814
This means your soulmate
is still looking for something

331
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,744
and doesn't know it yet.

332
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:39,984
OMG. Confused! Okay, confused!

333
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,653
But that's okay, we'll find a way,

334
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,346
at least we have a fighting chance at love.

335
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:46,008
Ask her if you've already met the guy.

336
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,087
So, have I met this person?

337
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:50,561
Pick two more cards.

338
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:53,919
The cards aren't clear.

339
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,024
Maybe you have, maybe you haven't.

340
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,385
All I know

341
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:59,028
is you've already seen each other,

342
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:01,806
but you haven't really talked.

343
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,575
But, I'm certain

344
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,720
that you often cross each other's paths.

345
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,163
OMG, Dominic!

346
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,890
I'm sure that guy goes to our school!

347
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:13,017
- Oh, my god!
- Shh! Quiet please.

348
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,269
Sorry, I'm just excited for you.

349
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:16,958
Choose three more cards.

350
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,182
A week from now, you will meet
the boy meant for you.

351
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:26,717
Just keep in mind that
if you don't take this chance,

352
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,118
you might miss the opportunity.

353
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,893
One week from now?
Oh, my god, sis!

354
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,537
One week from now!

355
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:34,856
Journey with the Lord
is a week from now!

356
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:39,460
It might be Paul!
It's definitely Paul!

357
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:42,880
We're gonna make this work.

358
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,273
Oh, my god!

359
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,450
You think?

360
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,918
Who else could it be?!

361
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,439
Is his name Paul?

362
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:55,435
- Brother Mike!
- How are you guys? Excited?

363
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,311
- Yes.
- Enjoy!

364
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,427
Thank you, brother.

365
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:02,113
Fuck, if a gay guy tries
to hook up with me here,

366
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,264
I'll definitely beat him up.

367
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:04,719
Dude, calm down.

368
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,721
This is a school activity, remember?

369
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,573
Nobody's going to take advantage of you.

370
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,868
You know how they are.

371
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:12,852
Perverts.

372
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,782
Just ignore him.

373
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:17,273
Ah, I see.

374
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,751
Karen hasn't texted you yet, right?

375
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:20,860
Jerk.

376
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,846
Bro, that's okay.

377
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:24,739
Maybe Andoy was right and she'll miss you

378
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:26,623
while you're gone these three days.

379
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:31,000
She might even beg you
to get back together.

380
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:34,624
Hi, Batch 226.

381
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,267
Welcome to Journey with the Lord!

382
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,727
Registration will open in a while.

383
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:40,034
After that, please drop off
your bags inside

384
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:42,311
and we will take care
of them for you. Okay?

385
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:44,330
- Thank you, guys!
- Thank you.

386
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:52,742
Dominic, I'll leave you in charge.

387
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,285
Yes, thank you, bro.

388
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,416
Thank you.

389
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,413
Girls, listen. For our battle plan,

390
00:20:57,438 --> 00:20:59,946
you have to be Paul's sponsor
during F-Night

391
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:02,018
so you can get to know each other.

392
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,211
Girl, who's in charge of the event?

393
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,655
Nigel.

394
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,006
Negative, sis.

395
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,272
Nigel's a closet queen,
he ain't allowing that.

396
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:11,007
Leave it to me, girls.

397
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:13,679
I'll be in charge of Operation Sul-fate.

398
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:15,024
That was so corny.

399
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,058
I'm doing this for Dominic's love life!

400
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,936
You're so mean.

401
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,312
Alright, you're funny.

402
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:24,340
Adjust! Raise your arms!

403
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:26,984
Our school is the best.

404
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,007
I agree.

405
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:29,737
Best view of the school.

406
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:30,964
That's not allowed.

407
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:31,948
Why?

408
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:33,074
Just because.

409
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,767
Whatever, let me take
a video of this view.

410
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:35,807
Wait, where's my phone?

411
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,854
Shit, I think I left it in the classroom.

412
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:43,192
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, shit! Sorry, Timmy.

413
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,027
Wait for me, I'll get you some tissue.

414
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:46,420
Joseph?

415
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,134
Girl! Are you okay?

416
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,828
Did he just spill soda on me?

417
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:55,892
- Yeah.
- Soda?

418
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:58,576
Joseph spilled soda on me.

419
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,469
Oh, my god!

420
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,233
- OMG!
- Are you alright?

421
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:04,981
Of course! Don't you get it?

422
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:07,174
This is what Baby R predicted!

423
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:09,405
This is the first sign!

424
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:12,346
The soda he spilled on my face!

425
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,950
OMG! Joseph and I
are going to be a couple!

426
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:18,613
Oh, my god,
we're going to be a couple!

427
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,115
I'm going to treat you all to soda!

428
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,475
Soda for the whole school!

429
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,210
I'll leave you in charge.

430
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:26,954
Okay, bye bye!

431
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,265
Nigel.

432
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:30,030
- Timmy.
- The thing is...

433
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:33,090
I know that you want to sponsor
a cutie for F-Night,

434
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:34,821
and the answer is no.

435
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:37,197
Way harsh!
I'm not asking for me,

436
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,440
it's for Dominic.

437
00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:39,863
Oh, if it's for Dominic,

438
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,983
then it's not a problem at all!
Who do you like?

439
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:43,095
- Ah, I...
- Paul.

440
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,201
Oh, Paul.

441
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:47,521
His best friend asked
to be his partner first.

442
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:48,896
What a bitch.

443
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:50,970
It's okay, Timmy. Nigel's right.

444
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,474
You'll get priority next time.
There's a lot of other guys.

445
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,001
Should I just assign someone for you?

446
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:56,611
Yup, anyone will do.

447
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,054
- Okay.
- Girl.

448
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:00,338
Girls, wait!

449
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:02,365
What about Baby R's prediction?

450
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,798
Well, I guess it's not gonna come true.

451
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:42,036
♪ Is there something
troubling your heart? ♪

452
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:45,277

00:23:46,614 --> 00:23:48,592

♪ I am your friend ♪

459
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,456
What's happening?

460
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:34,597
Are you here for pain or for pleasure?

461
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:39,682
Is that a trick question?

462
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,846
Just answer the question.

463
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,141
Okay.

464
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,332
Pleasure? Pleasure, pleasure.

465
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,487
I see.

466
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:48,966
Horny?

467
00:24:48,991 --> 00:24:50,187
Uh...

468
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,963
No. It's just very cold.

469
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:57,366
Okay.

470
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,554
Do you want me to blow you?

471
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,568
What?

472
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,305
You heard me.

473
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:07,342
No!

474
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,523
Do you trust me?

475
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,488
Can you trust me when I tell you

476
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,696
that there is nothing for you to fear?

477
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,669
Well, given that you're holding
a bat next to me,

478
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:23,442
I don't know.

479
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:24,472
Maybe?

480
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,189
Then, do you want me to blow you?

481
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,191
Okay, relax, relax.

482
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:31,590
Okay, this is a school activity.

483
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,229
I mean, what should I worry about?

484
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,644
Okay.

485
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:37,902
I trust you.

486
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:40,308
I want you to blow me.

487
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:42,743
Final answer?

488
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:44,731
I guess?

489
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:50,034
There, I gave you a blow.

490
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:51,060
Jerk!

491
00:25:52,604 --> 00:25:55,398
Told you, you've got nothing
to worry about.

492
00:25:57,234 --> 00:25:58,235
Okay.

493
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:04,493
So tell me, why did you join Journey?

494
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:09,101
I just wanted to disappear for a while.

495
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:10,625
Why?

496
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:16,361
My girlfriend of three years
broke up with me.

497
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:21,154
I still can't accept
that it's over just like that.

498
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,816
Oh. Condolences.

499
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:25,997
Jerk, did anyone die?

500
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:27,482
Your heart died.

501
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,735
That's so corny.

502
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm just trying to make you laugh here.

503
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:34,867
But sometimes it's okay
to feel that kind of pain.

504
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:37,855
It's actually good for you.

505
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,205
Why is that?

506
00:26:40,103 --> 00:26:42,980
I knew it, all of you here are sadists.

507
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:44,825
No.

508
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:47,760
But I believe that Journey
with the Lord is a process

509
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:50,041
that makes you reflect
on your life choices.

510
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,225
It makes us realize
that we are not alone.

511
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:55,153
All you have to do is be open

512
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:58,042
to all the activities lined up
in this retreat.

513
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:00,276
Okay. Wow.

514
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,961
That was smooth.

515
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:03,988
Of course,
I had a speech memorized.

516
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:06,956
To wrap things up,

517
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:10,214
the Fantasy Night or F-Night,
as we like to call it,

518
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:15,124
makes us realize how important love
and companionship is in our lives.

519
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:17,135
To love is to honor God,

520
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,321
because God is love.

521
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,918
So maybe after this weekend,

522
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:23,676
you should express your love
to the people who are closest to you.

523
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:26,004
Like... your mom,

524
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:27,723
or even your ex-girlfriend.

525
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,108
I'm serious.

526
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,698
Aren't they the most important
people in your life?

527
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:36,588
Maybe you should tell them
how much you love them.

528
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:39,651
There's a chance, it'll all work out.

529
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,618
And that's the end of our trust walk.

530
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:46,313
Our last stop is to go to
confession in the chapel.

531
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:48,263
You can remove your blindfold now.

532
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,239
Alright, cool.

533
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:54,444
But, Dominic,
I need to ask you something.

534
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:55,818
What is it?

535
00:27:57,137 --> 00:28:01,523
I know it's pretty obvious,
but I still want to ask.

536
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:05,023
You're gay, right?

537
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:07,989
I'm so not gay.

538
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:09,385
What do you think?

539
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,414
I just didn't want to assume.

540
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:16,130
I mean you could just be
effeminate, like... Mr. Oyco.

541
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,825
Did you just...? Oh, my god!

542
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:24,477
Yes. I'm gay.

543
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:26,912
Do you have a problem with it?

544
00:28:28,454 --> 00:28:29,844
No, not really.

545
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:33,318
Actually,

546
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:35,915
I think it's kinda cool.

547
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:41,285
By the way, I'm Luke.

548
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:47,354
At least now I can see you.

549
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:49,317
Dominic.

550
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:51,818
By the way,

551
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:53,472
here's the Journey cross.

552
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:55,908
You are now officially a Traveler.

553
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,170
And just like us,

554
00:28:57,416 --> 00:29:00,237
we continuously search for God's love.

555
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,676
Go inside the chapel,

556
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:17,992
turn left and you'll see
the confession booth.

557
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,755
I'll wait for you out here.

558
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,981
Hey Dominic! There you are.

559
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:39,832
Have you seen Jason?

560
00:29:40,556 --> 00:29:43,439
Paul. You surprised me.

561
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:46,384
Um... nope, it's just me here.

562
00:29:46,738 --> 00:29:48,275
Guess he went to the restroom.

563
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,066
Hey,

564
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:55,358
we need to wait for our sponsor

565
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:57,385
before we can go back
to the dormitory, right?

566
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,548
Yup. That's right.

567
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,061
Do you always volunteer for Journey?

568
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:05,864
Sorry, what?

569
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:09,674
Tired much?

570
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:13,406
You probably are since you spent
the whole day arranging this.

571
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,099
Thank you for inviting me here!

572
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:19,096
I'm having a great experience.

573
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:24,264
Hey Dominic!

574
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,621
Girls, girls, girls!
I have an announcement to make!

575
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:30,712
Baby R is the real deal!

576
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:33,279
Remember she told me to avoid seafood?

577
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:34,820
She totally didn't say anything like that,

578
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:36,076
I was there.

579
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,690
Okay, fine! That's just
my interpretation of her words.

580
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:41,374
But my point is,
we had shrimp for dinner, right?

581
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,972
Joseph noticed that I wasn't eating

582
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:45,726
so I told him, "I don't eat seafood."

583
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:47,242
Then he said, "Let's eat at McDonald's,"

584
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:49,363
so I said, "Okay."

585
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:52,176
What a flirt!

586
00:30:52,908 --> 00:30:54,075
You're just jealous!

587
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,646
Well, I'm not the only one!

588
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:59,252
Last night, someone here was
also making moves in the dark.

589
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:00,553
You're such a slut!

590
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:03,033
Oh, my god, spill, please!

591
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:05,685
Well? Did Baby R's prediction come true?

592
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:06,861
Secret.

593
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:09,367
- Secret? Secret my ass!
- Out with it! Tell us!

594
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:12,339
Let's just sleep. I'm tired!

595
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:50,315

Dominic.

604
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,201
I want to say thank you for everything.

605
00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:35,501
You have to promise me

606
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:38,112
that you'll tell your mom
or Karen how you much love them.

607
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:40,488
You're so persistent.

608
00:32:40,723 --> 00:32:41,909
It'll be good for you.

609
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:44,263

617
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:18,477
(I told my mom I love her.)

618
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:23,172
(You were right.
It feels good to say it:))

619
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:25,489
Thank you so much.

620
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:27,801
You're welcome.

621
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,987
Last week, you said that
I would meet my soulmate.

622
00:33:37,155 --> 00:33:38,156
Did I?

623
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,045
All signs point to...

624
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,382
- Yes.
- This is it, girl!

625
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:46,297
You already met him.

626
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,258
But how can I be sure that he's the one?

627
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,494
Choose six more cards.

628
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,692
These cards have given us three signs

629
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:08,035
to check if he is the one:

630
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:12,229
Your first sign has something to do

631
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,964
with a "king" and a "star."

632
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:19,840
The second sign is related
to "rain" and "music."

633
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:25,885
And the third sign
that he might be your soulmate

634
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,437
is connected to the "moon"...

635
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:31,920
and...

636
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:35,807
- "love."
- Oh, my god, it's love!

637
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,785
There will be a kiss,

638
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:43,474
a hug, and tenderness!

639
00:34:45,032 --> 00:34:48,625
But the cards don't show when
these events will take place.

640
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:52,174
So you will have to open up
your heart to all the possibilities.

641
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,513
I don't get it.

642
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:55,480
Can't you give me a clearer answer?

643
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:00,972
There's only so much I can share.

644
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,734
Let's not tempt fate.

645
00:35:04,891 --> 00:35:06,062
If you try to know too much,

646
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:08,106
what's supposed to happen
might not happen anymore.

647
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:11,624
How to read these signs
is all up to you now.

648
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:15,141
Okay, let's wrap this up

649
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,166
because I still have a competition.

650
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:19,652
You really like leaving us hanging, madam!

651
00:35:19,677 --> 00:35:22,560
Well, of course, we're talking
about destiny here!

652
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:26,864
Let's go, we might be late
for the ballroom competition.

653
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,742
Move your hips a little,
you look so awkward.

654
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,535
Close the door when you leave.

655
00:35:41,327 --> 00:35:43,763
(uploaded a new video)

656
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:54,345
(search: Luke)

657
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:58,018
(Is that really you?)

658
00:35:58,693 --> 00:36:00,973
(Yes. I look stupid there.)

659
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,195
(You look cute.)

660
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:44,430
(These are my favorite videos.)

661
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:50,364
(They are so fun to watch.)

662
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:56,313
(Oh, my god! They are so mean!
The video's funny, though!)

663
00:36:56,615 --> 00:37:01,234
(When I'm feeling down,
I watch videos like these.)

664
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:05,155
(Then after 30 minutes of watching them, )

665
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,342
(I feel good already.)

666
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:14,331
(I, on the other hand, love to
watch otter videos on YouTube.)

667
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:23,366
(Otters! WTF! Hahahahaha!)

668
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,885
(They're so cute.)

669
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:43,566
(Was that you? What happened?)

670
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:45,647
(What do you mean?)

671
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:55,019
(You look cute here.
Chubby cheeks!)

672
00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:00,739
(I'm still cute. You can even ask
the people at St. Mary's.)

673
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:06,072
(Confident.)

674
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:10,553
(Marketable! Haha)

675
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:29,868
(Are you sure we've never
been classmates before?)

676
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,658
(Nope, I'm sure of it.)

677
00:38:31,683 --> 00:38:34,052
(Because if we had been
classmates before, )

678
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,162
(I'm sure I wouldn't have forgotten you.)

679
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:42,667
(I guess. It's just weird
that we jive too much.)

680
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:45,519
(Actually.)

681
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:52,621
(Oh, my god! It's already late.
Aren't you sleepy yet?)

682
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,674
(A little.)

683
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:05,483
(I'm sorry for keeping you up
so late with my chattering.)

684
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:09,768
(It's okay.)

685
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:13,909
(Alright. Go to sleep now.
Goodbye, Luke.)

686
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:19,157
(Don't say "goodbye."
Say "see you later" instead.)

687
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:22,274
When you say goodbye,

688
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:28,746
(it's like we won't see each other again.)

689
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:35,700
(Is that so?)

690
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:40,602
(Alright. See you later, Luke.)

691
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,146
(See you later, Dominic.)

692
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:46,174
(Good night.
Oh, it's good morning already.)

693
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,595
[Timmy] Dominic! There you are!

694
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,222
We have good news for you!

695
00:40:17,305 --> 00:40:18,223
What is it?

696
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:19,849
Miguel and I figured it out!

697
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:22,852
Paul is definitely
the guy for you!

698
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:23,881
How?

699
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:27,320
Timmy told me all about
Baby R's predictions for you.

700
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,471
Well, last night,

701
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:31,069
you know what suddenly showed
up as I was watching TV?

702
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:33,955
Paul's rooster commercial showed up!

703
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,725
- And?
- And?

704
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,607
Isn't the first sign "king" and "star"?

705
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:41,150
Paul's role in the commercial is...

706
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:43,036
A king!

707
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:45,926
And the star can mean
a "commercial star", right?

708
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:48,580
Girl, what are the odds?

709
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:50,452
Okay.

710
00:40:50,477 --> 00:40:52,742
Wait, why aren't you excited?

711
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,682
I mean, I don't think it's a coincidence

712
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,381
that Miguel saw that old
commercial yesterday.

713
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:59,455
This is destiny, girl, destiny!

714
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,537
Guys...

715
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,564
I have a feeling

716
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:04,739
that Paul isn't the one
Baby R's prediction is about.

717
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:06,784
I think...

718
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,950
I think it's someone else.

719
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:10,060
What?!

720
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:15,051
- Oh, my god! Spill! Who is it?
- Tell us who he is.

721
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:16,269
I'll tell you about it next time.

722
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:17,378
Really?

723
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:19,011
Sir Oyco is calling you.

724
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:21,657
Bitch won't even share.
Fine, I'm leaving.

725
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,118
- Excuse me, pig!
- What the hell?

726
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:32,788
- Philip, you're an asshole!
- Sir, he's cursing.

727
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:34,048
Mr. Andres,

728
00:41:34,442 --> 00:41:37,318
we do not tolerate
the use of such language here!

729
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,769
Come with me to my office.
I've been waiting for you.

730
00:41:39,794 --> 00:41:41,003
What's your problem?

731
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:43,263
You're such a jerk sometimes.

732
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:45,985
Don't tell me you're defending them now?

733
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:48,971
Guys, it was an accident.

734
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:50,206
Accident my ass.

735
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:52,042
- Whatever!
- Anyway,

736
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:54,174
I saw Karen in McDonald's last night.

737
00:41:54,496 --> 00:41:55,873
She asked about you.

738
00:41:58,317 --> 00:41:59,693
Haven't you guys made up yet?

739
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:01,499
Of course, we haven't.

740
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:03,025
Why?

741
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:08,166
Just text her. She misses you.

742
00:42:08,587 --> 00:42:09,250
Dude.

743
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,298
She broke up with me, remember?

744
00:42:11,584 --> 00:42:12,425
Right!

745
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,876
We're guys, girls should be chasing us.

746
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:20,331
I'm sure you won't have
a hard time finding someone new.

747
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:21,434
It was so easy for me.

748
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:22,806
Wow, cocky much.

749
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,300
Of course.

750
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,528
According to Catholic teachings,

751
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,473
being a homosexual
is not actually a sin.

752
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:39,691
God created us
in his own image and likeness

753
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:41,518
and that includes everyone.

754
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,258
We have to learn how to respect
our brothers and sisters

755
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:47,643
who consider themselves homosexuals.

756
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:49,766
Yes, Philip?

757
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:55,099
Sir, aren't homosexual acts
considered evil?

758
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,908
That's right.

759
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:58,714
Well, it's not evil.

760
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,971
Although some theologians
may argue that yes, it's a sin,

761
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:04,952
but there are other
interpretations to this already.

762
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,102
But, sir, I read it in the Bible.

763
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:08,861
It's a sin to be gay.

764
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:12,925
Okay, Philip and everyone.

765
00:43:13,498 --> 00:43:16,643
We have to be critical
when we read biblical text.

766
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:18,701
We can't just take it for what it is.

767
00:43:18,855 --> 00:43:23,091
You have to consider what
it takes to be labeled as such.

768
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:27,400
We have to be open
in understanding

769
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:30,569
that maybe they don't have
a choice in the matter.

770
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:35,124
Okay, I want you
to research this.

771
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:38,117
I want you to write
a report on it,

772
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:41,634
if being homosexual is a sin.

773
00:43:42,302 --> 00:43:43,261
Okay?

774
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,305
Luke, please collect
all the papers

775
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:47,807
and submit them
before dismissal today.

776
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:50,083
You can do your research in the library.

777
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:51,103
Is that okay?

778
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,734
Okay, brother.

779
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:55,116
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

780
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,096
Uhm, excuse me.

781
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:08,385
Luke.

782
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,798
What are you doing here?

783
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:12,415
Bro. Mike just left.

784
00:44:12,627 --> 00:44:14,225
You can leave that here.

785
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,050
What are you doing?

786
00:44:20,897 --> 00:44:22,753
I'm organizing the list of participants

787
00:44:22,778 --> 00:44:24,770
for Journey Batch 227.

788
00:44:25,016 --> 00:44:26,212
Is it this week?

789
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:27,796
It's actually next week.

790
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:29,954
But preparations start this early

791
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:31,608
because I don't want to cram.

792
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:34,103
I don't want to miss anyone.

793
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,361
Why do you always volunteer on Journey?

794
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:40,228
To escape.

795
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:41,979
Escape.

796
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:44,947
Meaning?

797
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:47,585
Escape from reality!

798
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:49,636
Whenever I'm here,

799
00:44:49,661 --> 00:44:51,304
I don't have to think
about anything else

800
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:52,581
but the participants.

801
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:57,673
Wait, are you interested
in volunteering?

802
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,211
I don't know yet.

803
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:05,214
You should try it! I promise it's fun.

804
00:45:06,732 --> 00:45:08,817
Anyway, I'll think about it.

805
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:10,864
I'll go ahead, bye!

806
00:45:11,018 --> 00:45:11,888
Wait!

807
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,831
I thought you didn't believe in goodbyes.

808
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:15,995
Huh?

809
00:45:17,288 --> 00:45:18,389
When we were chatting,

810
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:20,353
you said you don't believe in goodbyes,

811
00:45:20,378 --> 00:45:21,796
only in "see you later."

812
00:45:22,781 --> 00:45:24,289
You still remember that?

813
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:26,049
Of course.

814
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:30,694
Okay, sorry, it's my fault.

815
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:34,119
Alright. See you later, Dominic.

816
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:35,699
See you later, Luke.

817
00:46:09,824 --> 00:46:11,951
(I'm game on weekend.)

818
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:28,311
Can I ask you something personal?

819
00:46:28,697 --> 00:46:30,319
Yeah, sure. What is it?

820
00:46:30,865 --> 00:46:32,650
I remember during the Palanca night,

821
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:35,618
you were trying so hard not to cry,

822
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:36,894
and you failed.

823
00:46:37,404 --> 00:46:39,114
Who sent you the letter you were reading?

824
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:40,443
Wait.

825
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:41,914
I knew it!

826
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:43,516
You were staring at me.

827
00:46:43,962 --> 00:46:45,050
Of course not!

828
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,357
I was observing everyone.

829
00:46:47,382 --> 00:46:49,730
I wasn't staring at you.

830
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,792
Observing, observing!

831
00:46:52,037 --> 00:46:53,622
Don't deny it, Dominic.

832
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:55,314
I saw you looking at me.

833
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,774
It's okay. It's perfectly normal.

834
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:01,220
Oh, my god! Don't be too cocky!

835
00:47:01,245 --> 00:47:02,819
You are not that handsome!

836
00:47:02,844 --> 00:47:04,304
"That handsome."

837
00:47:04,645 --> 00:47:06,855
So you do think I'm handsome?

838
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:08,963
Secret.

839
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,485
Then my answer to your question
is also a secret.

840
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,738
Okay, fine. Then don't answer.

841
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:15,893
Is that it?

842
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:18,973
You gave up just like that?

843
00:47:19,524 --> 00:47:20,995
Dominic, you know,

844
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:23,980
sometimes you need to fight
for the things you want.

845
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:25,500
Whatever.

846
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:29,382
I'm not invested in your secret
enough to fight for it.

847
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:36,132
It was a letter...

848
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:37,967
from my mom.

849
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:43,002
She apologized

850
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,494
for letting me grew up without a dad.

851
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:55,850
And she was worried that
I might take it against her.

852
00:47:58,714 --> 00:48:00,411
It's sad knowing that

853
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:04,877
she felt guilty about
what happened between them.

854
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:08,985
I don't blame her,
I really don't. It's just...

855
00:48:09,634 --> 00:48:11,610
It's not her fault they fell out of love.

856
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:13,371
It happens.

857
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:15,550
I'm sorry.

858
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,089
Don't be!

859
00:48:17,114 --> 00:48:20,005
I'm a proud mama's boy, no matter what.

860
00:48:20,718 --> 00:48:21,780
So, what's your story?

861
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:23,516
I'm sure you come from a perfect family.

862
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:26,855
You're too much of an achiever
to be part of a broken family.

863
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,519
That was extremely judgmental.

864
00:48:29,544 --> 00:48:30,731
Tell me I'm wrong.

865
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,090
Okay. I don't come
from a broken family.

866
00:48:34,615 --> 00:48:37,634
We are your typical, loving family.

867
00:48:38,017 --> 00:48:41,671
Both my dad and mom
graduated from Ateneo,

868
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:44,174
so it'll be embarrassing

869
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:46,273
if I don't get into
that university, right?

870
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:48,838
I'm the eldest child,

871
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:52,803
and I feel like they expect
too much of me.

872
00:48:52,976 --> 00:48:57,310
Sometimes, I don't know if I can
live up to their standards.

873
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:01,105
Plus the fact that
they don't know I'm gay.

874
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,710
Wait, they don't know you're gay?

875
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:07,100
Why not?

876
00:49:08,717 --> 00:49:09,830
I don't know.

877
00:49:10,786 --> 00:49:11,829
Maybe I just...

878
00:49:12,628 --> 00:49:14,338
don't want to disappoint them.

879
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:19,979
I don't want them to know

880
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:21,945
that their only son

881
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,556
is not actually a son.

882
00:49:27,892 --> 00:49:28,808
Well...

883
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:33,621
If, for instance, I was your dad,

884
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,255
I would be...

885
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:40,463
so proud of you.

886
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:49,278
Whatever!

887
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,581
But thank you.

888
00:49:51,128 --> 00:49:52,874
I think I see a little tear.

889
00:49:52,899 --> 00:49:54,465
If you want to cry on my shoulder...

890
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,798
- I'm not going to cry.
- It's okay.

891
00:49:56,842 --> 00:49:58,139
Okay.

892
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,628
Just like God,

893
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:04,332
we find love in the most
unexpected of places

894
00:50:04,357 --> 00:50:06,427
and the most unexpected of times.

895
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:09,901
We have to be open to the possibility

896
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:14,134
that love, and/or God,
is knocking on our door.

897
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:16,341
And He is just waiting for us to open it

898
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:18,273
and welcome Him into our lives.

899
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:20,919
Mr. Andoy Ramos.

900
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:22,134
Bro.

901
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:23,743
Why don't you share with the class,

902
00:50:23,768 --> 00:50:24,990
have you ever been in love?

903
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,421
That's my name.

904
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,027
Too bad we have to erase these.

905
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,278
It will be there forever,

906
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:38,019
hidden beneath the different
layers of blue paint.

907
00:50:39,968 --> 00:50:42,498
Why do we have to recycle this?

908
00:50:42,523 --> 00:50:44,751
Why can't we just build a new one?

909
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:46,890
You know, it'll be a lot easier.

910
00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:48,953
History, I guess.

911
00:50:49,164 --> 00:50:50,479
There's a lot more meaning

912
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:53,486
in carrying the same cross

913
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:56,222
that was carried by others before.

914
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:57,947
Brotherhood.

915
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:00,909
Or, in your case, sisterhood.

916
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:02,583
Right.

917
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:16,552
Do you ever think
Jesus loved Mary Magdalene?

918
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:20,068
I don't know. I don't think so.

919
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:22,050
That's so random.

920
00:51:22,868 --> 00:51:24,837
I was just thinking.

921
00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:28,934
Since Jesus is God's son

922
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:31,547
and God is the personification of love,

923
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:35,393
isn't it weird that his son
never experienced love?

924
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:38,247
But I think he did experience love.

925
00:51:38,272 --> 00:51:40,963
I mean, he loved his followers.

926
00:51:41,762 --> 00:51:42,972
Of course that's different.

927
00:51:43,513 --> 00:51:45,470
I'm talking about

928
00:51:46,408 --> 00:51:47,826
the romantic type of love.

929
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,891
Love is love, no matter what type it is!

930
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:53,293
Okay, wait, no. No.

931
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,729
It's completely different.

932
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:58,808
The love you feel for a girl,

933
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:00,880
or a guy in your case,

934
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:04,750
the joy, the intensity you feel
for them is different.

935
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,589
Haven't you ever experienced that?

936
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:12,823
Okay, it's time to change the topic.

937
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:15,940
Wait, don't tell me
you've never been in love.

938
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:20,085
Anyway, let's move on!

939
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:21,555
You haven't!

940
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,937
Oh, my god, Dominic!

941
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,416
Falling in love is such
a wonderful feeling.

942
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:28,579
You feel like...

943
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,940
I can't explain it,

944
00:52:33,795 --> 00:52:35,296
but you'll know when you feel it.

945
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:38,049
You get to feel like...

946
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:39,793
you're whole.

947
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,974
So is that how you feel
whenever you're with Karen?

948
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:50,854
Hey.

949
00:52:51,123 --> 00:52:52,791
Not ready to joke about it yet?

950
00:52:58,655 --> 00:52:59,781
I'm sorry.

951
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:10,043
Hey!

952
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:12,096
Luke!

953
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:40,078
Aren't you going to wash up
before you sleep?

954
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,496
Maybe later.

955
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:48,808
Do you believe in destiny?

956
00:53:50,256 --> 00:53:51,257
Huh?

957
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:54,444
Do you believe in destiny?

958
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,612
Well, I do.

959
00:54:05,002 --> 00:54:08,706
I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

960
00:54:11,397 --> 00:54:14,859
When I was young,
my mom would always tell me,

961
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:18,495
"When you have a problem
and you don't know what to do,"

962
00:54:19,328 --> 00:54:20,498
"you grab a coin,"

963
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:22,490
"flip it,"

964
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:24,820
"and as it spins into the air,"

965
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,556
"you make a decision
on which one will go on heads"

966
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:29,238
"and which one will go on tails."

967
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:32,587
"And when you catch it
and look at it,"

968
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:34,730
"you'll know your answer."

969
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,652
You'll know what destiny chose for you.

970
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:46,187
Do you really believe that?

971
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:50,357
It sounds silly, right?

972
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:58,385
So, what did you ask destiny?

973
00:55:12,411 --> 00:55:14,579
Your destiny hasn't changed,

974
00:55:15,034 --> 00:55:17,027
it's still the same.

975
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:21,896
The cards said the first sign
has already appeared.

976
00:55:22,473 --> 00:55:23,891
Do you remember what it was?

977
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,742
The king and the star.

978
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:37,779
Luke!

979
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:40,764
I know this may sound silly,
but I just need to ask.

980
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:41,957
Sure, what is it?

981
00:55:41,982 --> 00:55:44,303
By any chance, do you know of any kings?

982
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:45,538
Kings?

983
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,885
- That's so random!
- I know. I know.

984
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,890
But seriously, do you know of any kings?

985
00:55:49,915 --> 00:55:51,917
Or are you related to any stars?

986
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,796
- Are you serious?
- Yes! I need to know.

987
00:55:57,467 --> 00:56:01,152
Maybe Bhoy, isn't he
the King of Talk or something?

988
00:56:01,177 --> 00:56:02,201
Does that count?

989
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:04,060
Oh, my god! Yes!

990
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:05,335
And you were interviewed by him

991
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,823
because of our schoolmate,
Jared, the Big Brother star!

992
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:09,185
Oh, my god!

993
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:15,483
Are you okay, dude?

994
00:56:17,802 --> 00:56:18,770
Sorry.

995
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:21,681
I think destiny just spoke to me.

996
00:56:23,034 --> 00:56:26,164
Wait, what? What destiny?

997
00:56:26,189 --> 00:56:29,041
Hi guys! On behalf of
the grad ball committee,

998
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,123
I'm here to announce

999
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:32,990
that the senior's grad ball
will be in three months' time!

1000
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,398
So just tell us if you're going stag

1001
00:56:35,423 --> 00:56:37,110
or if you have a date, okay?

1002
00:56:37,558 --> 00:56:39,819
Guys, this will be our last ball together,

1003
00:56:39,844 --> 00:56:43,512
so I suggest you make it extra
memorable by bringing someone special.

1004
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:45,937
I'll leave the forms here with Timmy.

1005
00:56:45,962 --> 00:56:47,917
The deadline is by the end
of the month. Okay?

1006
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:50,167
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you!

1007
00:56:50,545 --> 00:56:55,073
Girls! I'm going to ask Joseph
to be my date to the grad ball.

1008
00:56:55,098 --> 00:56:56,479
How brave of you, sis.

1009
00:56:56,504 --> 00:56:58,822
You know it! We only have three
months left before the ball.

1010
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:00,317
Who are you going to ask?

1011
00:57:00,342 --> 00:57:01,436
No one.

1012
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,329
How about you, Dominic?

1013
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:06,538
Good thing Andoy arranged
a soiree for us next week!

1014
00:57:06,563 --> 00:57:10,684
Fuck Paul. Why is he suddenly
giving a deadline for the ball?

1015
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:12,028
I don't have a date yet.

1016
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,403
Fuck, I can't go alone.

1017
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:17,449
You have Tricia
and you have Karen.

1018
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:18,475
No way.

1019
00:57:19,196 --> 00:57:20,197
Shut up.

1020
00:57:21,643 --> 00:57:23,482
- What's your problem?
- You okay?

1021
00:57:24,996 --> 00:57:27,415
We'll help you out,
who do you want to go with?

1022
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:37,267
Luke, I'm here. Where are you?

1023
00:57:38,027 --> 00:57:39,150
<i>Dominic</i>?

1024
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:40,877
<i>I'm in the forest.</i>

1025
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,813
What? Are you really inside the forest?

1026
00:57:44,588 --> 00:57:47,388
Yeah, I'm inside.
Just go inside.

1027
00:57:48,075 --> 00:57:49,177
Go inside?

1028
00:57:49,202 --> 00:57:52,872
But there might be ghosts...
or even frogs!

1029
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:55,703
<i>Seriously, you're afraid of frogs?</i>

1030
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,467
Of course I am! Who isn't?

1031
00:58:06,033 --> 00:58:06,935
Luke.

1032
00:58:07,506 --> 00:58:10,055
This is not funny!

1033
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,038
<i>Okay, okay. Relax.
I'm on my way there.</i>

1034
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,681
<i>Just stay where you are,
I'll come find you.</i>

1035
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:36,085
Oh, my god!

1036
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:38,422
Hey, hey, I'm sorry!

1037
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:41,467
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1038
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:44,762
You can't ask me to come here
and then torture me like this!

1039
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,595
- How dare you!
- I'm sorry.

1040
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,891
I didn't know you were
afraid of ghosts and frogs.

1041
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:51,060
Well now you know,
so can we please go?

1042
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:54,352
Okay, but I still have
something to show you.

1043
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:55,378
What?

1044
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,495
It's my secret.

1045
00:58:58,015 --> 00:58:59,893
But we have to go over there.

1046
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:02,191
Are you serious?

1047
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:03,659
Yeah.

1048
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,064
No way, I am not going in there.

1049
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:07,090
Why not?

1050
00:59:07,607 --> 00:59:08,738
Because...

1051
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:09,955
Oh, no!

1052
00:59:10,229 --> 00:59:11,480
Hold on, Dominic!

1053
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:13,215
There are frogs,
frogs inside the forest!

1054
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,322
- Relax, relax.
- I can hear them.

1055
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:17,098
Hey, look at me.

1056
00:59:18,085 --> 00:59:19,592
You don't have to be afraid.

1057
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:21,846
I'm here. Relax.

1058
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:25,260
Come on, let's go.

1059
00:59:25,285 --> 00:59:27,217
But seriously, I'm going to faint

1060
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:30,370
if we encounter a ghost or a frog.

1061
00:59:30,853 --> 00:59:31,854
Dominic,

1062
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:33,566
do you trust me?

1063
00:59:34,677 --> 00:59:36,429
Yes, but...

1064
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:44,727
Let's go.

1065
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:58,615
I never knew
there was such a place here.

1066
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:03,662
Well,

1067
01:00:04,697 --> 01:00:06,538
this used to be our secret place.

1068
01:00:07,828 --> 01:00:08,829
Our?

1069
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:10,891
Me and Karen.

1070
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:22,245
I think we were in sixth grade
when we discovered this place.

1071
01:00:24,993 --> 01:00:28,059
We used to see each other
in the playground.

1072
01:00:29,263 --> 01:00:31,976
I remember we discovered
many other places around here,

1073
01:00:32,626 --> 01:00:35,535
and a lot of them were off-limits.

1074
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,687
I am sure this place is one of them.

1075
01:00:38,712 --> 01:00:39,922
Actually, yeah.

1076
01:00:42,795 --> 01:00:44,838
But why did you bring me here?

1077
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:48,686
To be honest,

1078
01:00:50,816 --> 01:00:51,817
I don't know.

1079
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:58,625
I guess I just don't want
to be alone right now.

1080
01:01:01,854 --> 01:01:04,440
Three years ago, in this exact same spot,

1081
01:01:05,113 --> 01:01:06,281
I was with Karen.

1082
01:01:09,901 --> 01:01:12,987
We've only been together for a year then,

1083
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:17,634
but we were already talking about
our plans before we graduate.

1084
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:22,548
I remember she made me promise

1085
01:01:22,573 --> 01:01:26,781
that she should be my date
in all our school activities.

1086
01:01:30,346 --> 01:01:35,012
From sophomore's night,
to junior prom,

1087
01:01:36,156 --> 01:01:37,338
and finally...

1088
01:01:39,459 --> 01:01:40,969
the senior's graduation ball.

1089
01:01:44,227 --> 01:01:45,437
Together forever.

1090
01:01:48,574 --> 01:01:50,726
That was the plan.

1091
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:53,170
But now,

1092
01:01:55,188 --> 01:01:56,488
I don't know anymore.

1093
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:00,872
She hasn't texted you yet?

1094
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:03,443
But...

1095
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:06,407
Have you texted her?

1096
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:11,517
Luke.

1097
01:02:11,922 --> 01:02:14,672
Someone has to take the first step.

1098
01:02:15,878 --> 01:02:18,495
If you want to be with her,
then be with her.

1099
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:22,403
You should've asked her
to come here, not me.

1100
01:02:24,812 --> 01:02:27,523
I wanted to call Karen,
I really did, but...

1101
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:29,497
So, why did you call me instead?

1102
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,177
I wanted to call Karen, but...

1103
01:02:36,644 --> 01:02:38,688
I didn't know if it was
the right thing to do.

1104
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:43,470
So before I came here, I asked this.

1105
01:02:47,828 --> 01:02:48,906
If it lands on heads,

1106
01:02:50,703 --> 01:02:51,973
I'll call Karen.

1107
01:02:54,213 --> 01:02:55,214
Tails,

1108
01:02:58,325 --> 01:02:59,326
maybe...

1109
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:02,430
now is not the right time.

1110
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:09,588
I guess you already know the answer.

1111
01:03:11,297 --> 01:03:12,298
I don't get it.

1112
01:03:12,843 --> 01:03:15,012
Why are you letting that coin
decide your fate?

1113
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,261
Because I believe in destiny.

1114
01:03:33,908 --> 01:03:36,452
Okay.

1115
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,332
Since we're being dramatic today,

1116
01:03:40,357 --> 01:03:42,359
why don't we play some emo music.

1117
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,531
The type of songs that leave you feeling

1118
01:03:44,556 --> 01:03:46,505
utterly and miserably broken.

1119
01:03:46,627 --> 01:03:48,651
I know the perfect song. Wait.

1120
01:03:50,148 --> 01:03:50,884
What?

1121
01:03:51,189 --> 01:03:52,190
What happened?

1122
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:54,190
Oh, no. My phone's dead.

1123
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:56,899
Wait, let me borrow your phone.

1124
01:03:57,467 --> 01:03:59,047
Wait, I don't have Spotify.

1125
01:03:59,072 --> 01:04:01,033
Don't you have any songs
saved on your phone?

1126
01:04:01,058 --> 01:04:03,941
I do, but I am sure
you wouldn't like it.

1127
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:04,996
I wouldn't mind. Come on.

1128
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:06,349
- Give it!
- Nope.

1129
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:07,501
Lend me your phone
Don't be lame.

1130
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:09,764
- I don't want to.
- Lend me your phone.

1131
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:13,292
Fine! Fine, fine, fine.

1132
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,514
But you have to promise you won't judge.

1133
01:04:15,539 --> 01:04:16,499
You won't laugh.

1134
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:18,013
I can't promise.

1135
01:04:18,038 --> 01:04:19,589
That depends on your playlist.

1136
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:20,615
Here.

1137
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:25,821
Oh, my god. Are you serious?

1138
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:27,229
Wait, you know this song?

1139
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,641
Yes, of course!

1140
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:29,981
- You know this band?
- Yes!

1141
01:04:30,226 --> 01:04:32,186
Banda ni Dolly!
Oh, my god!

1142
01:04:32,211 --> 01:04:33,797
You really know this song!

1143
01:04:34,893 --> 01:04:35,765
Oh my God! Okay!

1144
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,313
They're amazing!
Their songs are lit.

1145
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:39,662
Yeah, I love "Rain",
it's my most favorite song.

1146
01:04:39,687 --> 01:04:40,666
Okay, game.

1147
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:43,955
♪ You don't know what you do to me ♪

1148
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,894

01:04:48,948 --> 01:04:51,414
I've been following this band for months!

1151
01:04:51,439 --> 01:04:53,107
I love them so much.

1152
01:04:53,132 --> 01:04:54,472

(Thank you for last night.
Love you, dude. See you.)

1164
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:53,590
What time does
your basketball practice end?

1165
01:05:54,427 --> 01:05:55,908
Maybe until 9?

1166
01:05:55,933 --> 01:05:57,652
We can go home together later,
if you want.

1167
01:05:57,961 --> 01:05:59,294
You'll still be here by nine?

1168
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:01,566
Yeah, I volunteered to do
something for the Mass.

1169
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:02,884
Sure, where do you want to meet?

1170
01:06:02,909 --> 01:06:04,175
At the playground?

1171
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,519
Okay. See you later.

1172
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,706
Okay.

1173
01:06:10,242 --> 01:06:12,079
We just need to talk to him.

1174
01:06:12,104 --> 01:06:14,713
I'll pretend that I don't know
anything. Let's get him.

1175
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,731
Here's a coffee for you
to wake up to reality!

1176
01:06:19,756 --> 01:06:21,707
I thought you went home
early last night.

1177
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,499
Dude, get this.

1178
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:25,388
For the first time ever,

1179
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:26,993
I studied for a test!

1180
01:06:27,018 --> 01:06:29,032
Wow! You studied for a test?

1181
01:06:29,057 --> 01:06:30,433
I was surprised at myself too.

1182
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:33,222
Even my mom was surprised!

1183
01:06:33,604 --> 01:06:34,830
You're a changed man.

1184
01:06:34,855 --> 01:06:36,315
Who were you with last night?

1185
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,247
- I went home with...
- Dominic?

1186
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:40,572
Dominic? The homo?

1187
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,233
Luke! Come here!

1188
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:45,686
The faggot is calling you.
Go on, go to the homo.

1189
01:06:45,711 --> 01:06:47,205
Yes!

1190
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,761
Look at you.

1191
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:04,747
Wow, look at how nice my friend is to gays.

1192
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,412
Let's give him a round of applause!

1193
01:07:07,248 --> 01:07:08,548
Faggot!

1194
01:07:08,573 --> 01:07:10,032
You're such a douchebag, Philip!

1195
01:07:10,057 --> 01:07:11,253
Let me handle this.

1196
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:12,696
And you're super mega ugly too!

1197
01:07:12,721 --> 01:07:15,140
Fuck you! I've had it.

1198
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:16,541
We're just joking, Captain.

1199
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:17,661
Where are you going?

1200
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:21,251
(Bro, you know Philip's a jerk.)

1201
01:07:21,276 --> 01:07:23,111
(But we're just worried about you.)

1202
01:07:35,436 --> 01:07:38,350
Thanks to Baby R and the signs,

1203
01:07:38,743 --> 01:07:40,328
I found the courage to ask Joseph

1204
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:42,063
if he wanted to go
with me to the grad ball.

1205
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:44,355
- And?
- And he said yes!

1206
01:07:55,885 --> 01:08:00,230
(Are you okay?)

1207
01:08:04,007 --> 01:08:06,993
(Are you okay?)

1208
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:25,933
(Sorry, Dominic for being a jerk.)

1209
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:57,203
Luke, can we please talk?

1210
01:08:57,819 --> 01:09:00,157
Luke, did I do something wrong?

1211
01:09:01,008 --> 01:09:02,946
There's nothing we should talk about.

1212
01:09:03,636 --> 01:09:05,137
I gotta go,
I have a test tomorrow.

1213
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:06,163
Luke!

1214
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:08,659
Wait. Let's talk.

1215
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,986
We're friends, aren't we?

1216
01:09:22,448 --> 01:09:23,809
We're just friends.

1217
01:09:26,056 --> 01:09:27,892
I don't get it.

1218
01:09:28,737 --> 01:09:30,363
Why are you avoiding me?

1219
01:09:33,031 --> 01:09:34,471
I'm not like you, Dominic.

1220
01:09:38,576 --> 01:09:39,816
I'm not gay.

1221
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:42,924
So that's it?

1222
01:09:45,627 --> 01:09:47,516
I really thought you were different.

1223
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,495
I thought you were better than this.

1224
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,096
I thought you were secure
in your masculinity,

1225
01:09:55,284 --> 01:09:57,925
that it was okay for you
to have a friend like me.

1226
01:09:58,215 --> 01:10:00,004
A friend who is gay.

1227
01:10:02,852 --> 01:10:04,599
But I guess I was wrong.

1228
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:13,195
Luke, we're not doing anything wrong,

1229
01:10:14,296 --> 01:10:15,452
and you know it.

1230
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:24,979
Goodbye.

1231
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,609
I welcome everybody to Journey!

1232
01:10:37,727 --> 01:10:39,787
Before we all go to our rooms,

1233
01:10:40,422 --> 01:10:42,165
I just want to say that here,

1234
01:10:42,498 --> 01:10:44,482
you're free to be who you are.

1235
01:10:46,029 --> 01:10:47,310
No need to hide,

1236
01:10:47,803 --> 01:10:49,185
no need to pretend.

1237
01:10:50,148 --> 01:10:51,870
We are all the same in God's love.

1238
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,261
And with that,

1239
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:57,923
let us welcome our new batch of Travelers!

1240
01:11:00,917 --> 01:11:01,918
This song

1241
01:11:03,864 --> 01:11:05,223
is for all of you.

1242
01:11:07,095 --> 01:11:08,012
And before I sing it,

1243
01:11:08,037 --> 01:11:11,778
let's all take this time
to reflect on the coming days.

Dominic.

1262
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:51,819
Don't you have a soiree to go to?

1263
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:55,372
Yeah, I do.

1264
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,392
So why are you here?

1265
01:13:01,486 --> 01:13:02,487
Well,

1266
01:13:04,063 --> 01:13:06,524
I was about to go to the soiree
with my friends.

1267
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:11,154
When I was about to close my laptop,

1268
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:15,526
a song started playing.

1269
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:19,719
"Rain"... remember?

1270
01:13:22,447 --> 01:13:24,616
♪ Whenever it rains ♪

1271
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:27,835
♪ Whenever it rains ♪

1272
01:13:35,946 --> 01:13:37,170
Ouch!

1273
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:41,749
Well, that was embarrassing.

1274
01:13:51,412 --> 01:13:53,479
You're not really going to look at me?

1275
01:13:56,175 --> 01:13:57,921
I look so good today.

1276
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:07,349
Joke. That was a joke.

1277
01:14:08,594 --> 01:14:11,734
Come on, Dominic,
you can laugh if you want to.

1278
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,424
You're wasting your time here.

1279
01:14:16,336 --> 01:14:18,088
Just go to the soiree.

1280
01:14:19,322 --> 01:14:21,762
Your friends might see you here.

1281
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:34,461
I really am sorry, Dominic.

1282
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:37,005
I don't need your apology.

1283
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:38,812
But I need your forgiveness.

1284
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:44,854
I don't know if you deserve it.

1285
01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:53,826
You know...

1286
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:58,389
I really don't know why,
but before I came here,

1287
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:00,802
I asked destiny.

1288
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:08,913
Heads,

1289
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:13,133
I'll go to the soiree with my friends.

1290
01:15:17,295 --> 01:15:18,386
Or tails,

1291
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:26,830
I'll apologize to the person I've hurt.

1292
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,271
You know,

1293
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:41,021
this coin is really biased towards you.

1294
01:16:01,727 --> 01:16:04,415
Destiny brought me to you, Dominic.

1295
01:16:37,638 --> 01:16:39,145
I'm really sorry.

1296
01:17:00,787 --> 01:17:02,799
What will you do if I kiss you now?

1297
01:17:10,746 --> 01:17:11,747
I don't know.

1298
01:17:14,353 --> 01:17:15,954
Will you get mad?

1299
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:20,405
Probably not.

1300
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,286
Good afternoon guys!

1301
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:45,970
May I have your attention, please?

1302
01:18:45,995 --> 01:18:46,996
Just a sec.

1303
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:49,706
I just want to remind everyone

1304
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:51,546
that the deadline to RSVP
for the grad ball

1305
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:53,103
is already next Friday.

1306
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:55,672
Please make sure to finalize
your answers by then.

1307
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:59,600
We will not be taking further
requests after the deadline.

1308
01:18:59,754 --> 01:19:01,427
So, sign up here.

1309
01:19:01,452 --> 01:19:03,594
Oh, my god, the grad ball
is next Friday already.

1310
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:05,295
I'm surprised as well.

1311
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,932
So that's why you didn't come
to the soiree.

1312
01:19:09,234 --> 01:19:10,991
Do you like homos now, bro?

1313
01:19:11,718 --> 01:19:12,921
What do you mean by that?

1314
01:19:12,946 --> 01:19:14,470
Let's just go. He's being stupid.

1315
01:19:14,495 --> 01:19:17,020
Wow! He's even protecting you now.

1316
01:19:17,162 --> 01:19:19,387
You probably drugged my friend.

1317
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,202
What the fuck?!

1318
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,061
Oh, no.

1319
01:19:25,618 --> 01:19:27,475
I guess the saying is true,

1320
01:19:28,076 --> 01:19:30,080
homosexuality is a disease.

1321
01:19:31,658 --> 01:19:33,419
Are you really that stupid?

1322
01:19:33,716 --> 01:19:35,070
Hey, I'm not stupid.

1323
01:19:35,095 --> 01:19:36,853
Really? You look stupid.

1324
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:39,561
Who are you calling stupid?

1325
01:19:39,586 --> 01:19:40,587
You!

1326
01:19:41,642 --> 01:19:43,728
That's right, walk away!

1327
01:19:43,937 --> 01:19:45,366
That's what homos are good at,

1328
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:46,966
running away and sucking dick!

1329
01:19:49,656 --> 01:19:51,557
- You faggots!
- You're so funny.

1330
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:53,758
Congrats.

1331
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:55,337
Suck me!

1332
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:01,829
Still laughing?

1333
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,364
That's enough!

1334
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:06,062
Fuck you!

1335
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:09,956
What's happening?!

1336
01:20:10,749 --> 01:20:11,750
Mr. Armada.

1337
01:20:12,367 --> 01:20:14,587
Both of you! My office. Now!

1338
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:27,244
Does it still hurt?

1339
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:30,224
A little bit.

1340
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:31,907
Why'd you do that?

1341
01:20:34,088 --> 01:20:35,411
Do you even have to ask?

1342
01:21:03,193 --> 01:21:04,194
Luke.

1343
01:21:09,906 --> 01:21:13,203
So... you get into fights now.

1344
01:21:17,364 --> 01:21:18,949
A lot of things have changed.

1345
01:21:21,686 --> 01:21:22,811
I heard.

1346
01:21:30,793 --> 01:21:32,179
What are you doing here?

1347
01:21:34,572 --> 01:21:36,302
Can't I be worried about you?

1348
01:21:42,676 --> 01:21:43,977
Andoy called me.

1349
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,557
He told me everything.

1350
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:49,133
So I went straight here after school.

1351
01:21:51,652 --> 01:21:53,247
So Andoy had to call you.

1352
01:22:17,402 --> 01:22:18,992
I'm sorry for hurting you.

1353
01:22:48,454 --> 01:22:49,603
You okay?

1354
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:51,414
Of course.

1355
01:22:51,877 --> 01:22:52,878
Are you sure?

1356
01:22:53,103 --> 01:22:54,623
Do you have any problems?

1357
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,273
Do you want to talk about it?

1358
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:58,549
Nope. Everything's fine.

1359
01:23:02,196 --> 01:23:03,239
So...

1360
01:23:03,815 --> 01:23:05,578
Karen's back.

1361
01:23:07,299 --> 01:23:08,300
Yeah.

1362
01:23:10,014 --> 01:23:12,141
She came to see me after school yesterday.

1363
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:14,608
And?

1364
01:23:15,048 --> 01:23:17,487
And she said sorry.

1365
01:23:21,326 --> 01:23:22,756
So, you guys are good?

1366
01:23:24,918 --> 01:23:25,919
I guess.

1367
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:27,170
You guess?

1368
01:23:29,489 --> 01:23:30,715
Okay, fine.

1369
01:23:31,891 --> 01:23:33,022
We're good.

1370
01:23:39,941 --> 01:23:40,942
Alright.

1371
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,014
I'll go ahead.

1372
01:23:45,758 --> 01:23:47,651
Are you going to volunteer later?

1373
01:23:49,164 --> 01:23:50,706
Maybe not.

1374
01:23:51,102 --> 01:23:52,685
Are you going to see Karen?

1375
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:56,258
Are you back together?

1376
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,173
Sorry, I have to go.

1377
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:16,096
Yes, this is Dominic.

1378
01:24:28,582 --> 01:24:30,318
Thank you for meeting with me.

1379
01:24:33,081 --> 01:24:35,100
I thought you wouldn't show up.

1380
01:24:39,048 --> 01:24:40,575
Luke told me about you.

1381
01:24:41,836 --> 01:24:43,944
He said you and him
are very close friends.

1382
01:24:43,969 --> 01:24:46,418
He even told me you were able
to convince him

1383
01:24:46,443 --> 01:24:48,407
to study for the exams.

1384
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:53,126
I don't know how you did it,
but that was amazing.

1385
01:24:53,979 --> 01:24:56,600
I always asked him to study before,

1386
01:24:56,815 --> 01:24:58,370
but he never listened to me.

1387
01:25:04,493 --> 01:25:07,641
I don't know why,
but I feel like Luke changed.

1388
01:25:08,621 --> 01:25:09,955
I think it's a good thing.

1389
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:14,197
I think, sometimes,

1390
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:19,099
we need bad things in our lives
to appreciate the good ones.

1391
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:36,419
I broke up with Luke,

1392
01:25:38,896 --> 01:25:42,664
because I felt like that was
what we needed back then.

1393
01:25:45,531 --> 01:25:49,560
We were going in circles,
and we couldn't compromise.

1394
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:56,377
I love him,

1395
01:25:57,939 --> 01:26:00,567
and maybe that was why
I needed to let him go.

1396
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:04,537
And so I did.

1397
01:26:08,784 --> 01:26:09,910
And it hurt.

1398
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:17,378
I wanted to get back together
with him so many times.

1399
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:21,189
But I told myself, "No,"

1400
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:23,666
that I had to be strong
for the both of us.

1401
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:27,616
Nothing's going to change
if we don't grow up.

1402
01:26:31,822 --> 01:26:34,673
But now I feel like

1403
01:26:34,893 --> 01:26:37,118
we're both ready to be
in each other's lives again.

1404
01:26:44,812 --> 01:26:46,335
I love him, Dominic.

1405
01:26:47,885 --> 01:26:50,855
And I think he still feels the same way.

1406
01:26:56,035 --> 01:26:57,119
Sorry.

1407
01:26:57,144 --> 01:27:00,301
We just met and I'm already
being overdramatic.

1408
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:19,767
I called you because I want
to do the right thing for Luke.

1409
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:24,755
I need your help.

1410
01:27:28,033 --> 01:27:29,436
What do you want me to do?

1411
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:38,314
Girl, what is your problem?

1412
01:27:38,571 --> 01:27:39,369
Are we playing charades?

1413
01:27:39,394 --> 01:27:41,648
Are we supposed to guess
what the problem is?

1414
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,342
Shut up. He's already upset,
yet you're still sarcastic.

1415
01:27:44,367 --> 01:27:45,534
What the hell is happening?

1416
01:27:45,634 --> 01:27:47,552
We got a text to come here,
but he won't talk to us.

1417
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:48,968
Dominic,

1418
01:27:49,531 --> 01:27:52,752
come on and tell us what happened.

1419
01:27:52,777 --> 01:27:55,989
We're here for you, no matter what.

1420
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,632
Go ahead.

1421
01:28:16,434 --> 01:28:18,269
Luke is the boy foretold by the stars.

1422
01:28:19,225 --> 01:28:21,661
Luke Armada?

1423
01:28:21,686 --> 01:28:22,854
Oh, my god!

1424
01:28:23,182 --> 01:28:24,346
Yup.

1425
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:29,334
And just like you,
all the signs happened.

1426
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:30,796
Then you should be happy!

1427
01:28:30,821 --> 01:28:32,463
If the signs happened,

1428
01:28:32,488 --> 01:28:34,957
then that means he's your soulmate!

1429
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:41,599
Is it possible for a person
to have two soulmates?

1430
01:28:41,624 --> 01:28:42,838
What do you mean?

1431
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:48,866
His ex-girlfriend is trying
to get back with him.

1432
01:28:49,566 --> 01:28:50,505
Karen.

1433
01:28:52,143 --> 01:28:54,895
We met up yesterday,
and she wanted me to help her.

1434
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:57,196
That bitch.

1435
01:28:57,586 --> 01:28:59,362
She deserves to be smacked.

1436
01:28:59,387 --> 01:29:01,349
Wait, help her? How?

1437
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:06,874
She wanted me to help her throw
a promposal activity for Luke.

1438
01:29:06,899 --> 01:29:08,921
Obviously, you said no, right?!

1439
01:29:10,066 --> 01:29:11,259
Actually...

1440
01:29:15,949 --> 01:29:17,159
I said yes.

1441
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:19,609
What? Why?

1442
01:29:22,402 --> 01:29:23,737
Because I love Luke.

1443
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,081
Love?!

1444
01:29:25,106 --> 01:29:26,818
So soon?! How??

1445
01:29:26,843 --> 01:29:29,820
Wait, when did this happen?
Backtrack, backtrack.

1446
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:33,548
Where are you taking me?

1447
01:29:33,573 --> 01:29:34,891
Nowhere, we're just gonna make out.

1448
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:36,342
- No, no.
- It's a joke!

1449
01:29:36,367 --> 01:29:37,890
Come on, I'm just joking.

1450
01:29:37,915 --> 01:29:40,417
- What the hell!
- Trust me bro. You'll love this.

1451
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:41,951
This better not be a prank.

1452
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:44,603
You better not be playing tricks on me.

1453
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:46,357
Stand there. Wait.

1454
01:29:46,556 --> 01:29:48,246
It's not a prank.

1455
01:29:48,991 --> 01:29:49,992
Karen?

1456
01:29:50,472 --> 01:29:51,472
Hi, Luke.

1457
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,014
What's this?

1458
01:29:55,446 --> 01:29:56,580
A promposal?

1459
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,261
Really?

1460
01:30:01,946 --> 01:30:03,157
Wait.

1461
01:30:03,182 --> 01:30:04,183
Girls?

1462
01:30:07,196 --> 01:30:08,238
Go girls.

1463
01:30:12,343 --> 01:30:15,004
Seriously? Our song?

1464
01:31:22,659 --> 01:31:24,928
Here, give her flowers.

1465
01:31:26,993 --> 01:31:29,303
Team LuKren forever!

1466
01:31:29,328 --> 01:31:30,847
- Let's go girls.
- So?

1467
01:31:31,938 --> 01:31:33,511
Was I uncool?

1468
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:35,022
A bit.

1469
01:31:35,308 --> 01:31:36,751
So...

1470
01:31:38,764 --> 01:31:40,096
Will you be my date?

1471
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:44,719
You know, you are dorky.

1472
01:31:45,736 --> 01:31:47,166
But is that a yes?

1473
01:31:47,191 --> 01:31:48,192
Of course!

1474
01:32:01,924 --> 01:32:03,112
Thank you.

1475
01:32:11,554 --> 01:32:12,926
Baby R, I need your help.

1476
01:32:12,951 --> 01:32:14,299
She'll be back tomorrow.

1477
01:32:14,324 --> 01:32:15,149
Tomorrow?

1478
01:32:15,174 --> 01:32:16,761
I need to talk to her now.

1479
01:32:56,514 --> 01:33:02,825
(My gay best friend)

1480
01:33:14,064 --> 01:33:15,848
By the way, I'm Luke.

1481
01:33:17,443 --> 01:33:18,517
Dominic.

1482
01:33:20,539 --> 01:33:21,832
- Bye!
- Wait!

1483
01:33:22,002 --> 01:33:24,381
I thought you didn't believe in goodbyes.

1484
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:26,608
Right. See you later, Dominic.

1485
01:33:34,675 --> 01:33:36,301
I think I see a little tear.

1486
01:33:36,326 --> 01:33:37,904
If you want to cry on my shoulder...

1487
01:33:37,929 --> 01:33:38,940
I'm not going to cry.

1488
01:33:38,965 --> 01:33:40,344
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1489
01:33:40,512 --> 01:33:41,345
Okay.

1490
01:33:53,415 --> 01:33:55,796
Sorry, I think destiny just spoke to me.

1491
01:33:57,184 --> 01:34:00,158
Wait, what? What destiny?

1492
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:08,697
Dominic, do you trust me?

1493
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:43,408
(1 new message from Luke.)

1494
01:35:17,196 --> 01:35:18,197
You know what,

1495
01:35:20,687 --> 01:35:23,356
lighting candles is so therapeutic.

1496
01:35:28,619 --> 01:35:29,620
By the way,

1497
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,587
Nigel was looking for you earlier.

1498
01:35:35,222 --> 01:35:38,211
Lighting the candles was
your task for F-Night,

1499
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,761
but you weren't answering his calls.

1500
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,734
So I volunteered for you.

1501
01:35:48,813 --> 01:35:49,814
Of course,

1502
01:35:50,569 --> 01:35:52,534
you have to maintain
your good image, right?

1503
01:36:01,992 --> 01:36:03,101
Where'd you come from?

1504
01:36:06,688 --> 01:36:08,314
Why did you ask me to come here?

1505
01:36:12,051 --> 01:36:13,011
Because...

1506
01:36:14,888 --> 01:36:16,664
I wanted to know if you're okay.

1507
01:36:21,881 --> 01:36:23,101
Of course I'm okay.

1508
01:36:24,795 --> 01:36:26,119
Why wouldn't I be?

1509
01:36:29,588 --> 01:36:30,589
Because of...

1510
01:36:31,903 --> 01:36:32,904
you know.

1511
01:36:41,912 --> 01:36:43,163
Because of you and Karen?

1512
01:36:54,026 --> 01:36:55,071
Are you back together?

1513
01:37:04,701 --> 01:37:06,972
Shit. Why can't you answer me?

1514
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:08,611
Because...

1515
01:37:09,431 --> 01:37:10,658
I don't know, okay.

1516
01:37:11,435 --> 01:37:13,091
Luke, do you love me?

1517
01:37:20,476 --> 01:37:22,886
Look me in the eyes
and tell me that you love me.

1518
01:37:25,525 --> 01:37:29,125
Look me in the eyes
and tell me that you love me.

1519
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:30,161
I don't know.

1520
01:37:30,186 --> 01:37:31,546
You know!

1521
01:37:33,168 --> 01:37:35,081
You've always known.

1522
01:37:35,688 --> 01:37:37,935
Destiny chose me for you. Me!

1523
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:38,961
Right?

1524
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:41,181
Right?

1525
01:37:43,017 --> 01:37:44,966
A week before we met in Journey,

1526
01:37:47,393 --> 01:37:48,853
I went to see a fortune teller.

1527
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:51,005
She told me that
I would meet my soulmate

1528
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:52,365
a week after my visit.

1529
01:37:53,811 --> 01:37:55,312
Guess who I met.

1530
01:37:56,421 --> 01:37:59,966
She gave me three signs
to make sure that he's the one.

1531
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,402
That he's my soulmate.

1532
01:38:02,959 --> 01:38:05,795
The first one was a king and a star,

1533
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:08,690
the second one was rain and music,

1534
01:38:08,934 --> 01:38:11,936
and the third one was
the moon and a hug.

1535
01:38:13,379 --> 01:38:15,618
One by one, the signs started happening

1536
01:38:15,643 --> 01:38:17,381
just as the fortune teller foretold.

1537
01:38:17,801 --> 01:38:18,859
One by one,

1538
01:38:18,884 --> 01:38:21,289
I began to realize who the boy
foretold by the stars is.

1539
01:38:22,374 --> 01:38:24,024
Who my soulmate is.

1540
01:38:28,371 --> 01:38:30,751
Luke, you are not the only one
who believes in destiny.

1541
01:38:33,465 --> 01:38:34,970
I believe in it, too.

1542
01:38:37,419 --> 01:38:39,907
And I believe it's no accident

1543
01:38:39,932 --> 01:38:42,345
that every time
you would flip your coin,

1544
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:45,648
it would always, always point
towards me. Because...

1545
01:38:46,455 --> 01:38:47,789
you're my soulmate.

1546
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:51,831
You're the one I am destined to love.

1547
01:38:52,226 --> 01:38:54,903
That's you, Luke, and I know
you feel the same way.

1548
01:38:59,086 --> 01:39:00,553
But I love Karen.

1549
01:39:06,076 --> 01:39:07,949
I loved her first.

1550
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:15,407
No. That's not true.

1551
01:39:15,432 --> 01:39:18,568
Luke, destiny chose me. Me!

1552
01:39:18,593 --> 01:39:19,751
- Me!
- Dominic!

1553
01:39:19,776 --> 01:39:21,092
Me! Destiny chose me!

1554
01:39:21,117 --> 01:39:22,132
You're hurting me!

1555
01:39:22,157 --> 01:39:23,366
I am meant for you!

1556
01:39:23,676 --> 01:39:26,629
- Destiny picked me for you!
- Dominic!

1557
01:39:42,817 --> 01:39:45,014
But I'm in love with you too, Luke.

1558
01:39:48,819 --> 01:39:50,758
I love you so much.

1559
01:40:00,904 --> 01:40:02,254
Fuck this.

1560
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,231
I know.

1561
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,497
I know.

1562
01:40:29,346 --> 01:40:31,069
I love you too, Dominic.

1563
01:40:34,015 --> 01:40:35,376
I'm in love with you too.

1564
01:40:36,321 --> 01:40:37,916
I love you too, Dominic.

1565
01:40:59,955 --> 01:41:01,014
I told you,

1566
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:06,059
there's some fucking things
we can't control.

1567
01:41:13,069 --> 01:41:14,425
Let's just...

1568
01:41:20,002 --> 01:41:21,003
Heads...

1569
01:41:22,695 --> 01:41:23,958
Who knows?

1570
01:41:25,325 --> 01:41:27,074
Maybe we are destined for each other.

1571
01:41:32,988 --> 01:41:34,281
But if it lands on tails,

1572
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:41,131
maybe...

1573
01:41:43,036 --> 01:41:44,788
maybe this is the end for us.

1574
01:42:35,558 --> 01:42:36,559
No.

1575
01:42:43,234 --> 01:42:44,689
No. You know what?

1576
01:42:44,714 --> 01:42:46,006
Fuck it!
