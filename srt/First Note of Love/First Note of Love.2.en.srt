What? Are you nervous?

00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:27,831
What's to be nervous about?
You're the one who's nervous.

Hello, guys, we are Magnet.

[Episode 2: A Has-Been Singer]

35
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:32,956
Hi, are you Sea?

36
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,323
This is my card.

37
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:39,499
Call me Reese.

38
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:40,781
Sorry, I don't have a card.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,731
It's alright. Please, sit.

40
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,305
Please sit.

41
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:51,906
Thank you for coming over.

42
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,073
Not at all.

43
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:54,656
How should I address you?

44
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,073
- Sea.
- S... sea.

45
00:03:56,073 --> 00:03:58,656
- Sea.
- Just call me Sea.

46
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,429
Let's wait for Neil. He's gonna be here soon.

47
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:03,304
Neil is coming...?

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,800
Yeah.

49
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:07,781
Are you still in school?

50
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,218
I'm a sophomore.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,173
A sophomore.

52
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:13,448
I bet you have lots of activities at school.

53
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:16,040
I don't really get involved in things
like that.

54
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:21,998
So if you have to spend a lot of time with him,
is that going to be a problem?

55
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:26,073
Is Neil gonna make a comeback?

56
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,498
He is.

57
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:32,031
We're planning to launch
a brand new mini album at the end of the year.

58
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:34,073
It's been a while since Neil
released new music.

59
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,656
I think your music is amazing,
so I'd love a chat with you,

60
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:39,498
and see if you can be Neil's songwriter.

61
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:44,456
But I've never been a songwriter
for anyone else.

62
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:51,748
You have a composed personality,
and it might be a perfect match for Neil.

63
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:59,531
I mean, I just finished a song,
and Neil might want to hear this.

64
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,206
Sure.

65
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:08,373
Reese, don't make such an
early appointment next time.

66
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:37,498
Kiddo, what are you doing here?

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,116
You guys know each other?

68
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:45,790
- We don't.
- We do.

69
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:49,576
We briefly met on the street.

70
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,285
I thought you were hooking me up with Sea?

71
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:55,543
- Where is he? Is he late?
- Neil, this is Sea.

72
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:03,920
Let's sit and have a chat.

73
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Sit.

74
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:16,243
Sea, we expect to have
two songs on this album.

75
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,826
You heard Sea's work before.

76
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:19,743
I think your voice would be perfect
in the songs.

77
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:24,418
I'd bet that he's one of
the few musical prodigies in Taiwan currently.

78
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,660
A prodigy?

79
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,293
Him?

80
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:38,623
Kiddo, are you in high school?

81
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:41,123
I'm a sophomore.

82
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:45,748
You wanna step into this industry this young?

83
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,581
You started to pursue your career very young.

84
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:52,656
You know me well.

85
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:54,823
Then I guess you're a fan.

86
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:56,456
Right?

87
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,823
No wonder there is Magnet's shadow
in your songs.

88
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:03,448
Did you really make those songs?

89
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:06,540
The whole world knows you started
your career at 19.

90
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:10,698
Sea, we really like your music.

91
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,823
Your music has a special touch.

92
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,540
Have you guys listened to my music ever?

93
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:21,365
Didn't you say you have made a new song?

94
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:23,123
We have.

95
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,498
And what?

96
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:41,240
Honestly, you are way too young.

97
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,665
The timidness shows in your work,
there isn't enough bravery.

98
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,123
Oh, really?

99
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:54,040
Did I say it wrong?

100
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,956
Kiddo.

101
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:06,290
If you're eager to work with me,
that timidness won't do.

102
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,468
Reese said you are a genius,
but I guess you are overrated.

103
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,285
You are not bad, though.

104
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,826
Neil.

105
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:17,710
Let's give this new song a try first.

106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,720
[Senior Ting Fei:
Junior, see you in the societies atrium!]

107
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:30,085
Kid, it's time to go back to school now, kiddo.

108
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,585
I'm gonna head back.

109
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,043
Do you even know music?

110
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:47,210
Singing isn't your strongest suit now
after six years, huh?

111
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:05,168
Sorry, manager, I can't work
with this has-been singer.

112
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,285
Sea.

113
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,743
Sea...

114
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:26,493
I'm genuinely sorry about that.

115
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:29,410
Don't take it personally. Neil didn't mean it.

116
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,918
It's true that we are eager to partner up
with you, and we'd like a chance.

117
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,793
I make music for myself,
instead of showing off my braveness.

118
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:46,293
- Go ask someone else.
- Hang on.

119
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,835
What's wrong with you?

120
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,793
Cat got your tongue?

121
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:22,160
Next, we have a mysterious guest coming,
Neil, who has been gone for three long years.

122
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,210
Are you okay?

123
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,793
Neil...

124
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:58,785
It's been six years, Neil.

125
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,585
Are you still a singer if you can't sing?

126
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:15,868
Hey!

127
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,626
Give me the guitar.

128
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:44,501
Senior Ting Fei,

129
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:50,003
sorry, I was there in the classroom,
but I didn't see you. So I just left.

130
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:53,445
As for the report, I did work on...

131
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:54,832
I have no makeup on.

132
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,960
Do I look that much different?

133
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:05,418
- I'm sure you can.
- Nah...

134
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,868
Watch your step.

135
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:11,793
- Who is this?
- Damsel in distress.

136
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:15,160
You're from the restaurant...

137
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,918
You guys got me fired.

138
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,878
It was clearly their fault.

139
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:24,528
I can speak to your boss, or go to the police.

140
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,820
Never mind.

141
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,453
I'll just find another part-time job.

142
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
Sorry, senior Ting Fei.

143
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,740
For the sake of your sense of justice,
I'll overlook the fact that you stood me up.

144
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,240
Do I have to re-take the course?

145
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,915
I'll still put your name on the report.

146
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,698
I appreciate it.

147
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:52,448
Alright, let's get it going.

148
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:55,740
We're doing a brand marketing exercise.

149
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,373
Do you know friends who want to build a brand?

150
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:03,490
I have a friend who runs a music bar.

151
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,706
A music bar?

152
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,248
Hello?

153
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,990
They can't come?

154
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,373
It's for this weekend.

155
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,573
Are you okay?

156
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:30,573
There are some problems with the activity
this weekend.

157
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:33,615
The band that promised me
a show bailed last minute.

158
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,365
Band?

159
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:40,081
Yeah, where could I find people like that?

160
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:51,573
Didn't you say your friend runs a music bar?

161
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:52,573
Yeah.

162
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:55,790
Do you happen to know how to make music?

163
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,365
Annie, thank you.

164
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,448
I don't know what else to do
if it weren't for you.

165
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:11,208
Alright, but you have to be quick.
We need to use the space.

166
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,560
We won't take too long.

167
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:16,073
Junior, go pick something you can play.

168
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:18,698
Hurry up, junior.

169
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,248
Annie,

170
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:25,823
if he is not promising,
can you help me ask the Music Club?

171
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,573
They don't have any time.

172
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,040
Well, give it a try.

173
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,998
Fine.

174
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,040
Kiddo, do you know any of Magnet's songs?

175
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:27,206
They are a band,
and their songs are pretty good.

176
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,400
♫ At the edge of the stage, ♫

177
00:16:32,406 --> 00:16:35,948
♫ a horizon is drawn ♫

178
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:42,831
♫ Consumed, I descend like the setting sun ♫

179
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:59,790
Everything's gonna be alright.

180
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:02,035
♫ I am still learning ♫

181
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:05,285
♫ how to iron out the tears ♫

182
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:11,701
♫ to brush off the past with a dead face ♫

183
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:14,910
♫ I'm still hovering ♫

184
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,160
♫ on that date line, ♫

185
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:25,418
♫ longing for another metamorphosis
in the dark ♫

186
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:55,035
♫ How do I scream my existence loudly, ♫

187
00:18:55,035 --> 00:19:03,160
♫ while wandering in the dark,
gathering courage? ♫

188
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,410
♫ Every shard of broken dreams, ♫

189
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:13,826
♫ longs to rise again as the sun,
spreading warmth ♫

190
00:19:13,826 --> 00:19:21,035
♫ Fearless in release, ♫

191
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:29,118
♫ in darkness, we await the dawn's embrace ♫

192
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:32,410
♫ Every shard of broken dreams, ♫

193
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:39,785
♫ longs to rise again as the sun,
spreading warmth ♫

194
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:42,460
♫ Fearless in release ♫

195
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:50,993
Excellent, you're the one.

196
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,326
Can you sing and play at the same time?

197
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,535
I can't sing.

198
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,460
I genuinely don't know how to sing.

199
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:01,501
Or do you know someone who can?

200
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,376
No.

201
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:07,585
Right.

202
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,070
Good for you.

203
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,536
You're finally back.

204
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,203
You are ridiculous.

205
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,328
Where are you going?

206
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,785
That kid said I'm a has-been singer.

207
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:02,540
Sea.

208
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,156
Don't scare me like that.

209
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,115
- You know what?
- What's with the giddiness?

210
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:09,240
When I went to the supermarket earlier,

211
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,510
the auntie said it'd been a while
since she saw a cutie like me.

212
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:14,160
She gave me a carrot for free.

213
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,368
- I love it.
- Psycho.

214
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,376
Alright, time to work.

215
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,785
Sea, so later that day, how was the talk
with Echo Music?

216
00:22:28,785 --> 00:22:30,201
Did you see Neil?

217
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:33,543
You have some nerve,
all thanks to your help.

218
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:36,410
Did you take a picture with him?

219
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,460
He looks like shit now.

220
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:42,335
Anyway, I refused the offer.

221
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,501
Why's that?

222
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:51,391
This guy.

223
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,876
Kiddo.

224
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,085
Play a song for me, will you?

225
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:08,126
Why are you here?

226
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,918
We are not open yet.

227
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:17,618
It's fine. I'll wait.

228
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:20,085
Sir...

229
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,410
Aren't you the...

230
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,576
The guy from the diner...

231
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:27,160
The pickle guy.

232
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,660
I can't thank you enough,
for protecting Sea on that day.

233
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,501
Who wants his protection?

234
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,720
Hi, I'm the owner of this bar.

235
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:39,376
I'm Liang. What should I call you?

236
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:43,076
Neil.

237
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:44,793
Neil?

238
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,293
Neil.

239
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,185
Neil from Magnet.

240
00:23:51,185 --> 00:23:54,451
Wow! A big star.

241
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,160
Yeah.

242
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,418
A has-been singer.

243
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,793
Why'd he do that?

244
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,951
Excuse me, your booze.

245
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,001
Enjoy.

246
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,085
Kiddo.

247
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,210
Hey.

248
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:34,035
Yo Yo Yo.

249
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,660
Drinks for the big star.

250
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,251
Thanks.

251
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:43,460
I'm so happy.

252
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:49,043
Sea told me, you've gotten ugly.

253
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,660
I think you're fine.

254
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,126
Still handsome, I'd say.

255
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:02,543
Boss,

256
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:06,585
can I borrow your stage?

257
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:17,743
Excuse me, here's your drink.

258
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:19,576
- I'll clean it up.
- Thanks.

259
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,001
Thank you.

260
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,785
♫ I can hear, ♫

261
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:49,910
♫ the sound of cheering, ♫

262
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,910
♫ but I don't lose... ♫

263
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,826
♫ the sense of direction ♫

264
00:25:55,826 --> 00:26:01,160
♫ We have to keep fighting, ♫

265
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,785
♫ remaining wild, ♫

266
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:07,035
♫ the obsession, ♫

267
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:10,785
♫ born stubborn, ♫

268
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:13,160
♫ while loving... ♫

269
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,326
♫ the unique and plain ♫

270
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:24,160
♫ Fearless fire exists ♫

271
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,460
♫ in all of us ♫

272
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:19,951
I really don't know how to sing.

273
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:23,451
Sing? He knows how!

274
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:26,243
Do you know where Neil went today?

275
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:27,951
Is this on the schedule?

276
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:30,668
Gosh, this brat.
