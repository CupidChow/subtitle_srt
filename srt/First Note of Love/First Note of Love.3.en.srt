Is this event on our schedule?

182
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,895
It's not.

183
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:50,220
This little brat.

184
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,087
Should we stop him?

185
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,360
No need.

186
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,763

208
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,178
Sea! Neil!

209
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,728
Fighting!

210
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:55,470
Sea, what's wrong?

211
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,636
The audio cable is a bit loose.

212
00:19:56,636 --> 00:19:58,386
- I'll go get some help.
- It's fine.

213
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:02,020
- I'll just find something to get it fixed.
- Okay.

214
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:05,845
Sorry, guys,
we have a technical situation here.

215
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:08,728
Please hold on a second.

216
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,395
Are you okay?

217
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:26,520
- I'm alright.
- Take a seat.

218
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,686
Have some water.

219
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:50,595
Look at me. Hey, look at me.

220
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:52,603
Just look me in the eye.

221
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:58,603
Deep breath.

222
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:38,136
The south and north poles of a magnetic field
repel each other when they are strong

223
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:41,353
and attract each other when they are
at their weakest.

224
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:25,270
Every time when I'm on the stage,

225
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:29,478
seeing those fully packed rooms,

226
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:33,270
I get scared sometimes.

227
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:38,186
However, whenever I turn my head around,
I can see you there.

228
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:44,011
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't want
to go on stage at all. It is terrifying.

229
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:47,270
How so? You love playing cool.

230
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:50,728
Well, I'd be terrified
if I'm not cool on stage.

231
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,395
Now I've made a huge progress with my guitar.

232
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,345
- You don't believe me?
- I don't believe it.

233
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,811
Test me. Play a chord for me.

234
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:07,261
But you can only play
the first three frets on the guitar.

235
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,095
- Come on.
- You mean those I haven't played yet?

236
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:10,053
- Nah...
- Play those...

237
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:11,596
- The first three frets.
- Take the guitar.

238
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:13,428
- You play and I guess.
- Nope, I'm not.

239
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:15,345
- Nope, I'm not. I just played it.
- I'll guess.

240
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:16,386
Just play it for me.

241
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:20,353
Didn't you say, how great you are right now?
Come on.

242
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:32,436
I didn't. I mean, my hands are a
little slippery because of the booze.

243
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,643
You played it before,
but I don't find it good enough.

244
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,470
So, it's a revised version. My bad, alright.
Come on then... Go for it.

245
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,811
I think it sounds nicer this way.

246
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:11,178
Not bad, huh? The first three frets.

247
00:24:11,178 --> 00:24:12,811
Three frets.

248
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:16,428
What? Why didn't you say something?

249
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:18,270
Sure...

250
00:24:20,178 --> 00:24:22,178
I nailed it, right?

251
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:23,770
It's great...

252
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:29,311
- What? Are you afraid that I'll surpass you?
- Not at all, it's just...

253
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,020
It's been a fun ride to make music with you.

254
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,636
You're such a crybaby.

255
00:24:43,636 --> 00:24:46,395
Nah, I've got the best teacher right here.

256
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,678
Well, how about I show you?

257
00:24:51,678 --> 00:24:54,728
You said it was cool? This is cooler.

258
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,261
You aren't a has-been singer.

259
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:04,920
You are an excellent singer.

260
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,053
But after that performance,
I have an even bolder vision now.

261
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:10,936
You two will form a band.

262
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,470
Where should we start?

263
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,136
Leave the music part to me,
and you just focus on singing.

264
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:20,553
I refuse.

265
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,053
I'm a guitarist.

266
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,553
One more time.

267
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:25,220
- His rhythm's off.
- The rhythm's off.

268
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,770
- Where did I do wrong?
- Listen up, can you use your ears?
