2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,041
I want to thank you.

3
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,091
For what?

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,250
Everything.

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:34,166
And... I want to talk about the
International music festival...

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,716
I knew you would refuse me.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,916
Sea, do what you like.

8
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,008
And...

9
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,925
love the one you like.

10
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,675
Cheers.

11

Cheers.

12
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,125
Yummy!

13
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,625
- Thank you, Liang.
- Thank you, Liang.

14
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,041
Thank you, Liang.

15
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,291
It's no big deal.

16
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,041
Today's concert was a huge success.

17
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,375
Make sure to come back and perform often
if you can, alright?

18
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,250
Yeah, I don't see many people coming
to perform.

19
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,625
- Yeah, it'll boost sales.
- And the important thing is,

20
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,666
after today's show,
a lot of people will come back.

21
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,166
Because they want to eat the
fried instant noodles.

22
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,291
Does that mean we should hire a couple more
part-timers?

23
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,500
No need. Sea is coming back!

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,041
- Are you really going to let me come back?
- Sorry, hold on.

25
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,466
Mr. Cheng is calling.

26
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:49,958
Hello, Mr. Cheng?

27
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,166
Reese, congratulations!

28
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,375
Your performance was a huge success.

29
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,500
I even sent it to the shareholders to see.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,041
Let me tell you the good news, the shareholders
have decided to continue working with Neil.

31
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,791
And they're willing to increase the budget

32
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:06,083
to organize a comeback concert for him
with a five-figure crowd.

33
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,000
A concert for ten thousand people?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
- I believe it'll be a huge success.
- It is, right?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,541
A win-win for both you and the company.

36
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,500
How about it? I'd imagine you're really happy.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,750
The shareholders are very excited
about holding a concert now.

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,250
Mr. Cheng.

39
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,583
We already finished that concert together.

40
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,383
We saw the live stream...

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,125
Why did you hang up?

42
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,875
Why did you hang up the call?

43
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,083
Cheers!

44
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,541

46
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,258
Alright... Cheers...

47
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,550
Why don't you go?

48
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,250
That's Mei.

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,416
Mei.

50
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,416
- Mei.
- What's wrong with Mei?

51
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,125
Mei. Neil always talked about you.

52
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,466
Thank you for taking care of them.

53
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,833
I want to drink...

54
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,791
No...

55

[Episode 12: First Note of Love]

57
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,258
You did well!

58
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,883
Kiddo, you did so well on the test,
why are you still sad?

59
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,550
When you grow up,

60
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:17,216
you'll find lots of warm and wonderful things
waiting for you.

61

Don't cry.

62
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,208
Hi, everyone. Hi, teacher.

63
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,916
- I'm Ting-Fei.
- I'm Cheng-Xi.

64
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:46,250
This is our final project for
Marketing and Digital Media.

65
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,666
We'll cover five parts today:
design, motivation, method,

66
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,416
growth areas, and conclusion.

67
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:56,583
We also made a fan page for Neil and Sea
to track their activities.

68
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:00,833
I used Sea's music to make an AI music video.

69
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:06,883
The concept was about going on an adventure.

70
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:15,555
And this YouTube channel is run by Sea himself.

71
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,925
That's our presentation.

72
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,256
Why did you choose this topic?

73
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:28,625
Teacher, I'm a fan of theirs.

74
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,883
Sea from the group is acutally "Sea" here.

75
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,716
So please support his channel.

76
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:45,500
The presentation was... pretty good.

77
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,466
Your channel hasn't been updated in a while.

78
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,800
Thanks, teacher.

79
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,500
What do you want me to hear?

80
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,583
A song I made for you.

81
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,675
You made it?

82
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,466
Why are you here?

83
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,883
Good night.

84
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,925
Good night.

[Good morning.]

86
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,625
The most important thing is,
I see you as a brother.

87
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,133
I don't believe you.

88
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:27,133
You know, I really like you,

89
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,050
but I'm so scared of losing again.

90
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,966
Neil.

91
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,175
Are you sure you're leaving Echo Music?

92
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,341
Yeah, I'm saying goodbye to Magnet too.

93
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,216
Will it get you fired?

94
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,750
I'm not afraid.

95
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,841
I'll leave with you.

96
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,341
What's the point of staying if you're gone?

97
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:41,583
You told those shareholders
I don't sing for applause.

98
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,250
Did you see Cheng's face?

99
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,800
He was furious!

100
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,841
Bro.

101
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,925
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

102
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:25,750
I hope from now on,
you can do whatever you want,

103
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,666
live the life you want with the people
you love.

104
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,083
Don't worry about me.

105
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:37,675
And just know, you're not just a great manager,
but an amazing brother.

106
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,708
You can't control me anymore...

107
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,050

00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:36,096
Are you coming with me to Thailand?

111
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,841
I'll go.

112
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,675
Do you remember this song?

113
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,500
You've heard it before?

114
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,125
- I've heard it.
- No way.

115
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,341
I never released it.

116
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,591
A stranger sang it to me once.

117
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,341
That kid was you, wasn't it?

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,416

00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,916
Of course.

120
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,091
It was the first song I ever wrote.

00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,175
you gave me courage,
and now I want to give you courage, too.

181
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:16,966
Before I met you, I wasn't brave at all.

182
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:23,550
I was always the one being pushed forward
by everyone else.

183
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,383
Thank you for loving me.

184
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,466
Thank you for accepting my imperfections.

185
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,383
What will you do when you leave Echo Music?

186
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,133
I'll form a band with you.

187
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,708
But I'm not going to be
in the spotlight anymore.

188
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,550
You don't want to?

189
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:24,083
Fine, I'll just tell Reese that
I'm starting a band with someone else.

190
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,958
No way.

191
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,125
You're so strange.

192
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,958
You won't start a band with me,
but I can't start one with anyone else?

193
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:35,966
You could go solo, and I'll write songs for
you, watching you perform from the audience.

194
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,291
I'll wait for you to graduate.

195
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,625
That's two more years.

196
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,125
So what?

197
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,550
Two years is short, come on.

198
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,716
But during those two years,
I can still write songs for you.

199
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,916
And you can't start a band with anyone else.

200
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,133
I won't.
