10
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,417
Hello?

11
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,333
Hello.

12
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,840
Can you listen to this for me?

13
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,160
Then take a look outside the window.

14
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,675
Can I listen to it?

15
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,800
Our song.

16
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,833
Uh...

17
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,482
I haven't tidied in a while. Sorry.

18
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,750
- Want me to help you?
- No...

19
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,633
I can do it myself.

20
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,508
- Let's do it together. It'll be faster.
- No, it's fine... I'm done...

21
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,883
Listen to the song...

Listen to the song.

00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,175
Don't like it?

24
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,592
If it's not good, I can tweak it. Or...

25
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,508
Just a second.

26
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,883
I miss you so much.

27
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,008

- Almost done.
- No, eat first.

It's incredible.

40
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,883
- Is it too hot?
- No.

41
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,925
So early.

42
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,217
I thought I was the only one here.

43
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,875
You... you didn't work overtime all night,
did you?

44
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,792
Yeah.

45
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,258
Too many things to do.

You've got a runny nose.

48
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,208
You're catching a cold, are you?

49
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,583
No way.

50
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,008
I'm not that weak.

51
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,092
You sure look pretty weak to me.

52
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,854
Make sure to double-check the contract
before giving it to me.

53
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,500

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,708

No, I'm looking for Reese.

58
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,592
Reese is already in there.

59
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,133

60
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,792
Good luck.

61
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,508
Thanks.

62
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,842
I am in love with this song.

63
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,117
I bet you love Neil very much.

64
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:55,842
It's a yes.

65

It's a yes.

66
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,792
Sea, you've really worked hard.

67
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,458
Not at all, it's what I should do.

68
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,583
I'm really sorry about my condition before,
for worrying you guys.

69
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,125
Not at all.

70
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,625
I've believed in you from the very beginning.

71
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,342
Thank you.

72
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,625
Well...

73
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,208
Alright...

74
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,300
Bye...

75
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,958
Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome...

76
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,050
Lieng.

77
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,458
All our sound systems are state-of-the-art.

78
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,583
We've just recently upgraded the audio system,

79
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,042
and brought in an engineer from the UK
to calibrate everything for us.

80
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:51,500
There's a lot of space
if you move the seating around.

81
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,375
Normally,
I don't invite just any artist to perform here.

82
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:01,750
But with Neil and Sea,
there's no problem at all.

83
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,708
Boss, these systems must've cost a fortune.

84
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,458
Of course, it cost a lot.

85
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:12,508
But money, if you don't use it,
is just a pile of worthless paper.

86
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,542
Why didn't you tell me about this place sooner?

87
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,333
Well...

88
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:24,633
Because Sea works here,
I was afraid you'd be mad.

89
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,833
Boss, this place is truly amazing.

90
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
Please let us use it.

91
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,458
Of course, no problem at all.

92
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,292
This stage is yours.

93
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:38,458
I'm telling you, it's absolutely perfect.

94
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,425
It's practically made for us.

95
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:47,217
Now that we've confirmed the time and place, we
can proceed with discussing the music festival.

96
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,333
What's wrong?

97
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,958
Nothing, I'm fine.

98
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,542
You help me set up a meeting.

99
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:03,458
I'll do it, but you need to rest first.

100
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,958
I don't have time for that.

101
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,458
Just give me his number,
and I'll talk to him directly.

102
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,008
I'll come find you.

103
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,050
This is odd. What are you doing?

104
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,200
Sit down.

105
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
- I need to respond to one more email.
- No.

106
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,925
Sit down.

107
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,050
How many days has it been since you last slept?

108
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,083
I don't know.

109
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,133
You're pushing yourself too hard.

110
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,625
Take some medicine and go to sleep.

111
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,333
I don't want to take medicine.

112
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,258
I've waited for this day for six years.
I'm not stopping now.

113
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,467
Do you really have to give this much?

114
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,333
- Neil isn't just anyone.
- You're too good to him.

115
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,800
I treat you the same way.

116
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,550
Matt, Neil, and you,

117
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,383
you all really treated me like family.

118
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,300
I'd do anything for you.

119
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,550
I didn't expect Matt to go first.

120
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:13,542
If I could, I'd go back to that morning,

121
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:18,008
change the schedule for that day,
or even cancel the concert.

122
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:27,342
Matt is gone, and I am Neil's brother.

123
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,675
I...

124
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,425
I didn't organize this concert for you.

125
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,258
I did it for myself.

126
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,333
But also because of you.

127
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,583
I want you to be able to let go.

128
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:05,258
Let's finish that concert together.

129
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,467
Thank you for always being there for me.

130
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,500
Right?

131
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,208
Am I not the best person to you in the world?

132
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,000
So...

133
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,550
Will you be with me?

134
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,925
I like you.

135
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:56,008
I like you, too.

136
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:04,675
I've always known,
but I was waiting for you to say it.

137
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:36,417
[Next Episode]
When did you get this injury?

138
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:37,958
From a car accident.

139
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,625
It must hurt.

140
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,083
It's all healed now.

141
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,125
Thank you for lending me
something so important back then.

142
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,292
Now I'm giving it back to you.

143
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:48,050
Let Neil return in his full form.

144
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,542
Everyone has been waiting
for this day for many years.

145
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:57,833
Today, Neil will return to the stage.

Let's welcome Neil and Sea!
