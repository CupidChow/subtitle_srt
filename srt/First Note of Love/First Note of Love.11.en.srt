What's wrong?

00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,091
When did you get that injury?

3
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,454
From a car accident.

4
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,966
Does it hurt?

5
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,133
It's already healed.

Lay it out.

10
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,208
Smooth it out...

11
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,708
Yes, good.

12
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,666
Alright.

You okay?

17
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,041
A bit nervous.

18
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,300
I'll be here the whole time.

19
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:46,125

something so important back then.

They said later, we need to change the order,
the songs, swap the second and third songs.

75
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,583
Does that mean we need to
change costumes again?

76
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,916
Reese is really going to...

77
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,208
Reese is going to freak out, I'm telling you.

78
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,250
What do you think? Are you okay with it?

79
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,758
If we swap the second and third songs,
you should change your outfit first.

80
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,508
Why aren't you answering?

81
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,758
What's wrong?

82
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,758
Bro...

83
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,550
I miss you so much.

84
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,883
Bro...

85
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,216
If you're not here,
I don't even want to go on stage.

86
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,258
I won't leave.

87
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,958
I'll always be by your side.

88
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,133
You promise?

89
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,841
Magnet... Have you forgotten?

90
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,633
I miss you so much every day.

91
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,133
While you were gone,

92
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,925
I often didn't know what to do on my own.

93
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,466
But, bro.

94
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,474
I'm scared.

95
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:07,758
Will today be the last time
I ever see you?

96
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:13,397
It feels like the time has come,

97
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,216
like I have to say goodbye to you now.

98
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,666
Because I met someone,

99
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:34,291
and he made me realize how much I still
love singing, how much I still love music.

100
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:40,300
And I realized there are still so many people
who have expectations of me.

101
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,133
I can write my own songs now.

102
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,841
I can stand on stage again.

103
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:58,458
I will walk forward bravely,
carrying part of you with me.

104
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,589
I'll finish the journey you couldn't complete.

105
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:13,091
Now I have Sea and Reese by my side.

106
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,883
I'm not afraid.

107
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,133
Don't worry about me.

108
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,008
Goodbye.

109
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:39,666
Bro, I'm so sorry for watching you be unhappy,
not doing well.

110
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,841
It breaks my heart.

111
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,633
But now,

112
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:53,425
seeing you write your own songs,
and getting back on stage to sing,

113
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,685
I'll always be with you.

114
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,175
I'll always listen to your songs.

115
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,883
Keep making music.

116
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,966
Goodbye.

117
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,541
It's been so long since I've seen
a concert for ten thousand people.

118
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,833
It's kind of moving.

119
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,800
- So funny.
- The idol's got a sense of humor.

120
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,750
Thank you all for coming to the show today.

121
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,166
But this performance isn't just mine.

122
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,300
There's also my composer, Sea.

123
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,791
Sea!

124
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,208
He's not just my composer,
he's my important partner.

125
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,300
The song you just heard
was the new one he wrote for me.

126
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,713
This song taught me to be brave
and face myself.

127
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:45,622
Accepting yourself, and cherishing
the person who accepts all of you.

128
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:53,706
For the next song,
I want to invite my good friend and rival,

129
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:57,715
my college buddy, Orca.

130
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,791
- Orca!
- Your idol!

Students, hold on... move back...

189
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,003
- Calm down...
- Move back...

190
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:06,836
- Step back.
- One at a time.

191
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:09,253
I really love you and Sea!

192
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:10,503
- Keep it up!
- Thank you.

193
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,003
Good luck.

194
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,128
You're amazing.
I'm a huge fan of you guys.

195
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:15,670
Thank you.

196
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,128
Alright.

197
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:19,878
Neil, I really love your music.
You've got to keep going, okay?

198
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,961
Thank you.

199
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,253
I made this...

200
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:25,503
I really like you.

201
00:21:25,503 --> 00:21:27,086
Magnet is so important to me.

202
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:32,586
Seeing you back on stage makes me so happy.

203
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:33,836
- But...
- Don't cry...

204
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:37,086
Being happy is great, don't cry.
Here... let me wipe your tears.

205
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:40,586
I... I have to confess something.

206
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:43,878
I... I like Sea too.

207
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:46,045
I'm sorry...

208
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:48,086
I promised to only love you.

209
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:50,336
I'm sorry...

210
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:51,711
It's okay.

211
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,628
I understand you.

212
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,461
I like Sea too.

213
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:57,553
Thank you for supporting us.

214
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,086
Keep going, alright?

215
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,003
Make sure to come by often!

216
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:03,711
- The fried instant noodles here are excellent.
- I'll support you.

217
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:06,386
- The fried noodles are super tasty.
- Okay...

218
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:15,261
Sea, I love your music. This is for you.

219
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,711
Me?

220
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,961
Thank you.

221
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:22,836
I've liked you since your channel only had
about 30 subscribers.

222
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:25,836
I'll keep supporting you, so keep going.

223
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:27,461
Bye-bye.

224
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:29,961
Bye-bye.

225
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:31,378
Sea.

226
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:34,095
Sea. Sea.

227
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:39,249
- Are they packing up the stage?
- No...

228
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:42,628
I just wanted to ask for your autograph.

229
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,878
An autograph?

230
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:47,220
Could you sign right here for me?

231
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:51,053
I brought my own pen.

232
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:56,836
Can you sign for me? And write down... for Mei?

233
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:58,595
Sure.

234
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:09,586
Sea, could you add
some English letters after Mei?

235
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,586
Jellyencore.

236
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:19,511
J-E-L-L-Y E-N-C-O-R-E.

237
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:23,836
That's you?

238
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,378
That's me.

239
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:27,907
I was the one who strongly recommended
your music to Reese.

240
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:32,546
Seeing you on stage today,
it all feels worth it.

241
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:35,678
Thank you.

242
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:40,045
Keep going, Sea.

243
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,920
I'll always be your number one fan.

244
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,878
Thank you. I'll keep going.

245
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:49,970
Oh, um...
Are you going to give my pen back?

246
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:52,280
Thank you.

247
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,664
- Thank you.
- No problem.

248
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,261
So, how do you feel?

249
00:24:01,795 --> 00:24:04,053
When was this taken?

250
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:07,595
Congrats.

251
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,970
Thank you.

252
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:28,220
I think Neil doesn't need to
go to the music festival anymore.

253
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:32,803
None of us do.

254
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:47,678
When are you going to start working
on your next album?

255
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:55,636
Next month.

256
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,378
What are you thinking about?

257
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:06,211
The schedule.

258
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:08,803
Don't you want me to be your manager?

259
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:11,503
Really?

260
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,336
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

261
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:16,511
The timeline is so tight,

262
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:20,378
I'm already a bit nervous.

263
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,886
I'm itching to pull the schedule up.

264
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:35,011
I'm going back to Thailand tomorrow.

265
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:27,170
Are you sure you're leaving Echo Music?

266
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,378
Yeah, I'm saying goodbye to Magnet.

267
00:27:30,378 --> 00:27:31,920
Will it get you fired?

268
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,878
I hope from now on,
you can do everything you want to do,

269
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:39,553
live the life you want
with the people you love.

270
00:27:40,336 --> 00:27:42,711
Do you remember this song?

271
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:43,878
You've heard it before.

272
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:45,586
I've got a gift for you.

273
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:47,970
Are you ready?
