00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:55,592
[Morning]

2
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:14,717
[Episode 8: Before becoming lovers...]

3
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,967
- Reese.
- Who...

4
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,375
Sea, you scared me half to death.

5
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,458
Why are you here so early?

6
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,840
We slept in the practice room last night.

7
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,167
You slept in the practice room?

8
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,500
Don't tell me you practiced all night long?

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,833
Yeah.

10
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:34,208
Don't tire yourself out. It's important
to keep healthy for this creative journey.

11
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,042
Got it.

12
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,917
Keep going.

13
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:42,167
Well, Reese,
can I talk to you for a second?

14
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,675
Sit.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,092
Are you having trouble raising funds?

16
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,342
You don't have to worry about that.
I'll find a way.

17
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,758
I mean, how are you handling it?

18
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:03,583
I'm still working on the song.

19
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,633
I'm not talking about the song.
I'm talking about you.

20
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm sorry I said that to you the other day.

21
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,458
It's fine.

22
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,675
You reminded me.

23
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,133
I want you to make an appointment
with Orca for me.

24
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,550
Come on in. Don't be shy.

25
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,542
Sea, this is Kevin.

26
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,417
Kevin, this is Sea.

27
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,717
Steven.

28
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:12,550
Perhaps you should try this.

29
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,633
Come on, give it a try.

30
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:29,092
Sea,

31
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,675
come practice with me.

32
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,967
Sure. What do we play?

33
00:04:56,542 --> 00:05:00,958
♫ I'm driving 65 ♫

34
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,833
♫ In the middle of the night ♫

35
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,708
♫ Feels like I'm ridin' in a dream ♫

36
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,342
♫ Where all the cars are just lights ♫

37
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:18,292
♫ I'm callin' ♫

38
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:23,125
♫ Picking you up in five ♫

39
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,000
♫ Don't know where we going ♫

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,333
♫ I don't know yet ♫

41
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,458
♫ I'm hoping that ♫

42
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,292
♫ You wouldn't mind ♫

43
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:37,792
♫ I'll drive you out until the sunrise ♫

44
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:42,292
♫ Then hold you close until it's midnight ♫

45
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,542
♫ Cause all that matters is that we are here ♫

46
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,042
♫ Right here ♫

47
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:50,958
♫ It doesn't matter what tomorrow brings ♫

48
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:55,708
♫ I'll drive you out until the sunrise ♫

49
00:05:55,708 --> 00:06:00,167

♫ I'll hold you ♫

♫ No need to worry ♫

57

♫ Not until the sunrise ♫

58
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,967
Sea,

59
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:42,024
something is different about you.

60
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,592
Your vibe has changed.

61
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,417
I see you have accepted your feelings.

62
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,883
Are you in love?

63
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,675
Can I ask you something?

64
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,958
The song that I'm writing for Neil...

65
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,592
It just doesn't seem right.

66
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,675
Can you give me some advice?

67
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:30,458
Dear Sea, you don't have to write your song
for Neil.

68
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,792
What you should be thinking about is...

69
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:36,717
what song would you want to write.

70
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,092
I'm...

71
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,765
I'm worried that...

72
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,425
Neil doesn't actually need me.

73
00:07:54,458 --> 00:08:01,217
If you didn't show up that day,
maybe we couldn't finish the performance.

74
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:07,042
Sea, haven't you noticed?

75
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:16,175
Neil was able to be on the stage,
because you were by his side.

76
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:36,042
So, write something that belongs to you.

77
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:40,717
That's what'll make you a good music composer.

78
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,425
Give me a moment.

79
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,217
This...

80
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:09,250
is you.

81
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,717
And this...

82
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,092
is Neil.

83
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,360
This... is your talent.

84
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,590
Everyone likes your talent.

85
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:33,122
However, if all you do is acommodate Neil,

86
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:36,967
then you will lose your original self.

87
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,055
Most importantly,

88
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:48,675
try believing that this mini album
will be great because of you.

89
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,467
Believe in yourself. You can do it.

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,217
[October 29th, Tuesday]

91
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,583
I found a great place that serves
delicious spicy green papaya salad.

92
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,917
- Let's go visit it.
- Sounds great.

93
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,333
Hey, Mos.

94
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,467
Have you seen Sea?

95
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:04,508
I heard that Orca is in Taiwan, right?

96
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,592
Yeah.

97
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,417
You... Keep an eye on that Thailand boy.

98
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,508
- Got it?
- What?

99
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,301
Goodbye.

100
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:20,792
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

101
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,467
See you.

102
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,458
You're awake.

103
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,342
Late night practice.

104
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,667
Where's Sea?

105
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,458
Why don't you head home and rest
for the day? Sea is busy with something.

106
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,217
Yeah.

107
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,050
What?

108
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,917
He's looking for Orca.

109
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,967
He's looking for Orca.

110
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,417
He's looking for Orca.

111
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,217
Yeah, why?

112
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,792
[Sea is my partner...]

113
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,667
[How could you let Orca take him away?]

114
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,583
[Just because he's famous, does that make him
so special? Does he think he's better than me?]

115
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,050
[You're just biased towards Orca.]

116
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,920
[Sea just took a day off.]

117
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,042
[He wanted to talk to Orca
about creative insights.]

118
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,292
[He's still young. Interacting with different
people is really beneficial for him.]

119
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:23,133
[You don't need to worry so much.]

120
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,750
[He's a Magnet fan.]

121
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,633
[It's only natural for an idol to have fans!]

122
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,300
Why are you here?

123
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,542
Neil, congratulations on your comeback.

124
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,717
I'm happy for you.

125
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,633
What were you two doing?

126
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:12,383
I was asking Orca's advice on music.

127
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,178
What's there to teach?

128
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,667
He taught me a lot.

129
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,592
Well, you can ask me.

130
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:25,570
Obviously, Sea has better choices.

131
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,792
You've always liked to steal my thunder.

132
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:34,300
I'm better than you.

133
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,167
Sea, you'd choose me, right?

134
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,883
Sea, I'm better than him, right?

135
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:46,793
Sea, will you go on stage to perform with me
at the international music festival?

136
00:14:46,793 --> 00:14:49,120
Orca, shame on you!

137
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,176
What's wrong? Low self-esteem?

138
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:53,417
I don't understand. Speak Chinese.

139
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,333
I refuse. Learn some Thai!

140
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,967
- Alright, stop the bickering.
- Shut up.

141
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,583
You're just envious of how
Reese is treating me, right?

142
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,217
You'll never get him.

143
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:19,633
Happy hour, come on... Take a shot.

144
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,400
Kiddo...

145
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,750
Hey, don't drink.

146
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,750
Neil.

147
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,792
- Buddies, huh?
- Stop drinking.

148
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,285
- Neil.
- Great...

149
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:42,960
Nice... Orca.

150
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,667
Hi, I'm Liang.

151
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,375
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

152
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,958
You're... my idol.

153
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,417
I'm a big fan.

154
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,792
See?

155
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,750
So happy, oh happy...

156
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,883
Nice to meet you...

157
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,083
Orca hasn't led you astray, right?

158
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,967
We were just talking about music.

159
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,583
Talking about music is dangerous.

160
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,467
Hang tight.

161
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,800
I fell in love with you just by
watching you play the piano.

162
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,967
Orca told me,

163
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,417
I shouldn't write something
you would normally sing.

164
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:58,508
I should write my own song.

165
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,766
He's right.

166
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,749
Just be yourself.

167
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,940
I'll try my best.

168
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,584
Not quite right.

169
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:18,967
We are doing this together.

170
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:39,083
Let's not practice tomorrow, alright?

171
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,800
Why?

172
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:44,925
I wanna have a date with you.

173
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,467
Why are you drinking again?

174
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,508
I'm sorry.

175
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,467
It's alright, Reese.

176
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,508
How come you're so stupid?

177
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,300
I've already rejected you like this,
yet you still like me so much.

178
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,925
I'm sorry. You must be really upset.

179
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:51,124
You know?

180
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,175
To be honest, I really like you, too.

181
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:03,675
Because I'm so afraid of losing.

182
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,798
So, let's be friends forever.

183
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,842
What did you just say?

184
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,792
You're awake.

185
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,258
I thought you have band practice tomorrow?

186
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,565
We took tomorrow off.

187
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,906
Well, rest up then.

188
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,050
Hold on.

189
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,731
You... do you wanna sing with me?

190
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,542
♫ I'm driving 65 ♫

191
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:05,417
♫ In the middle of the night ♫

192
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:09,292
♫ Feels like I'm ridin' in a dream ♫

193
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:12,967
♫ Where all the cars are just lights ♫

194
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:19,125
♫ I'm callin' ♫

195
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:23,965
♫ Picking you up in five ♫

196
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:26,750
♫ Don't know where we going ♫

197
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,083
♫ I don't know yet ♫

198
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:33,833
♫ I'm hoping that you wouldn't mind ♫

199
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:38,333
♫ I'll drive you out until the sunrise ♫

200
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,833
♫ Then hold you close until it's midnight ♫

201
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:46,167
♫ Cause all that matters is that we are here ♫

202
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,667
♫ Right here ♫

203
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:52,000
♫ It doesn't matter what tomorrow brings ♫

204
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,508
♫ Not until the sunrise ♫

205
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:44,467
Is it impossible between us?

206
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,717
Considering all aspects,
it's just not possible.

207
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,667
Look how far we are.

208
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:04,842
2,260 kilometers is just too far.

209
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,375
One flight takes four hours
and costs twenty thousand.

210
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,417
That's 240,000 a year.
It's not cost-effective.

211
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,050
And you.

212
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,292
Orca, love-struck.

213
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,542
I'm quite rational.

214
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,842
We will definitely fight.

215
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:30,008
Have we fought before?

216
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:34,333
During those six years, I've explained
a lot to you why we couldn't be together.

217
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,917
How come you don't get it?

218
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:38,292
Don't you think we have poor communication?

219
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:42,417
Besides, I have to spend
240,000 a year to learn Thai.

220
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,425
I haven't learned a thing yet.

221
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:50,092
Then learn it from me.
I can teach you, free of charge.

222
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,330
Most importantly,

223
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,292
I treat you as my brother.

224
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,633
I don't believe it.

225
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,883
I know you put up the house as collateral.

226
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,292
How did you know that?

227
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,342
It's a secret.

228
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:18,708
Mei, she's obviously a spy.

229
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,561
Look at this double standard of yours.

230
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:25,175
You're willing to go to any lengths for Neil.

231
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:31,675
I just want to finish that concert
from years ago.

232
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,566
I know.

233
00:25:56,083 --> 00:26:00,675
What if I can help you make it come true?

234
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:40,640
The biggest contributor to making this
wonderful collaboration happen is Orca.

235
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,708
Then I'm not going.

236
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:45,008
You little rascal, I'm trying to find us
funding, and you're busy falling in love?

237
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:46,920
Can I beg you guys to break up?

238
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,583
No one can replace Sea.

239
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,708
There's nothing I'm reluctant to let go of.

240
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,373
We all have more important things to do.

241
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:55,383
Bye.
