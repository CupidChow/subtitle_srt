1
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:21,883
Senior Ting-Fei.

2
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,042
What are you doing?

3
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:31,092
I'm not your senior, instead,
I'm your new colleague.

4
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:36,167
Time to eat!

5
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:38,758
Come on...

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,792
Dumplings, again?

7
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,417
What do you mean?

8
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:49,708
Senior, why are you working here?

9
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,864
I met him at the market the other day,

10
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:56,083
and complained to him that
because of you guys, I lost my job.

11
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:59,292
Then he asked me if I wanted the job,
so here I am.

12
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,708
Yeah, our restaurant has been
looking for someone to fill in.

13
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,092
Since when have we
been looking for someone?

14
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,133
Well... how's the band practicing with Neil?

15
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:21,542
Your timing is all over the place
when you play and sin.

16
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,833
I can keep up. I can play fast or slow.

17
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,217
You haven't caught up to this beat!

18
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:30,083
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.

19
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,542
- Give it to me.
- I want this.

20
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,508
I don't eat chicken.

21
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,792
Start over again.

22
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:37,375
- His beat was off.
- Your beat was off.

23
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,583

24
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,092

This is your live video.
2000 people have already shared it.

31
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,758
Let me take a look.

32
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,208
Why do these people have foul mouths?

33
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:54,640
What does it mean, "The other person person
is trying to ride Neil's coattail, right?"

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,542
You don't get it. You'll only get famous
if you've got haters.

35
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,292
But we also have to nurture our loyal fans.

36
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,042
Loyal fans?

37
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,917
Loyal fans will be your strongest supporters.

38
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:10,342
Loyal fans will stand up and clap back
when haters are attacking you.

39
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,792
Those fans sound impressive.

40
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,500
I'll manage the loyal fan base.

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,333
I'll be the one announcing
your public schedule,

42
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,792
and the interaction with the fans
to build a strong sense of unity.

43
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:27,417
So, loyal fans aren't literally "fans".

44
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,800
You didn't even know that?

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,600
I thought it was the other kind of fan.

46
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,621
Besides,

47
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:39,917
the fan page could also be our final report
for the digital marketing introduction course.

48
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,417
Killing two birds with one stone.

49
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,383
Smart move.

50
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,292
No problem.

51
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,217
What's the problem with that?

52
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,842
<i>Do you still get music?</i>

53
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,092

59
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,592
I made a remix version.

60
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,592

I'm Reese.

179
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,667
Happy birthday.

180
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:03,467
Thank you.

181
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,833
How are you? Nice to meet you.

182
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,842
It's nice to meet you.

183
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:12,875
Nope.

184
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,092
You can only drink soda.

185
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,292
He... no beer.

186
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:24,550
<i>[The effortlessly cool global star, Orca]</i>

187
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,050
What do you think about our performance today?

188
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,542
Not bad.

189
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,208
Not bad.

190
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,508
If it wasn't bad then why do you
look like you're down in the dumps?

191
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,592
I'm not...

192
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,633
It's been fun to play with you.

193
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,675
Have some water.

194
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:03,292
Sea, this is the international star, Orca.

195
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:07,092
Orca, this is the composer, Sea.

196
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:11,342
Superstar, huh?

197
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,083
Neil.

198
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:18,592
You have not lost your touch,
even after all these years.

199
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,667
See?

200
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,925
You should thank Orca for setting the vibe,
so that we had a successful show.

201
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,592
But...

202
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,342
You.

203
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:41,542
You're not comfortable
in front of a crowd, right?

204
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,167
You don't have much of a stage presence.

205
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,417
You play for Neil.

206
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,742
- Hey Orca.
- He should know.

207
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,667
If you are a duo, then you
should not treat yourself like some...

208
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,083
Okay, stop it.

209
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,758
Fine.

210
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:09,758
Sea, are you okay?

211
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,758
I'm good.

212
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:16,167
I'm off to work then.

213
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,542
At Liang's place?

214
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,467
Well, then I'm going too.

215
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,008
I'm hungry, I'll eat some noodles.

216
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,917
- Give it to me.
- I am fine.

217
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,467
Give it to me.

218
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,467
Come on.

219
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:51,217
Let's go.

220
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,717
Let's go.

221
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,123
Your helmet is ugly.
Ever think about getting a new one?

222
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,542
How about you hop off?

223
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,383
I'm just kidding.

224
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,842
Go slower.

225
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,292
Neil must be so pissed at me right now.

226
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,342
They are not ready.

227
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,967
You've always been nice to Neil.

228
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,217
How can I just leave him alone?

229
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:48,592
Sometimes, I envy Neil.

230
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,245
I'm gonna go to band practice.

231
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,590
I came back to Taiwan to see you.

232
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,967
What?

233
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,215
You should learn some Thai.

234
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,133
I did.

235
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:25,771
Seriously?

236
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:32,008
I like you.

237
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,883
What? I don't understand.

238
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,375
I know you can understand all of that.

239
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,592
Well, I'll start speaking Thai to you now.

240
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:50,717
In that case...
I will start speaking Chinese to you.

241
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,708
Bye.

242
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,068
Can you understand that?

243
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,335
See you.

244
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:02,833
Bye.

245
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,717
Goodbye.

246
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,383
Here, please enjoy.

247
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,658
- Boss, the beer restock has arrived.
- Just as good as last time.

248
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:22,960
Wow, you're having another bowl.

249
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,200
It's fantastic.

250
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,167
After all, this bowl of noodles
is full of love.

251
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:31,467
It's normal to get hungry this easily.

252
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,217
What's wrong with Sea?

253
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,167
Long story.

254
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,133
It's my bad, anyway.

255
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:46,625
You guys had a fight, huh?

256
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,333
Sea is still young.

257
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,292
If he did something wrong,
you have to be a mentor to him.

258
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,840
He doesn't need me to mentor him.

259
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,917
He's already good enough.

260
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,292
You know, Orca showed up to the show today.

261
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,864
- Orca is a true big superstar.
- Nah...

262
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:04,225
There was a time when I
was obsessed with his music.

263
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:07,042
- Liang...
- It's a shame I didn't get to see it.

264
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:09,480
- Truthfully, I was totally obsessed.
- Liang.

265
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,833
What? You guys are collaborating?

266
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,292
It would be so sick if you, Sea
and Orca all worked together.

267
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,542
Orca, Neil, and Sea.

268
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,917
- ONS.
- Shut up.

269
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:20,092
Introduce us if there's a chance.

270
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,292
Superstar.

271
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,508
How is it your business?

272
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:34,667
Dying your hair blonde.

273
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,842
Showing off.

274
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,217
What you did was quite good.

275
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:35,217
Seriously, I meant it.

276
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,467
I will keep getting stronger.

277
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,342
For Magnet.

278
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,880
Neil, do you still want to sing?

279
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,246
Sorry, let's start over again.

280
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:13,062
Take a break first.

281
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:14,840
- But I...
- Go home.

282
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,841
Cheng is taking away our funding.

283
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:21,342
I'm scared that my selfishness
will put you and Sea in danger again.

284
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:23,462
The bed.

285
00:27:23,462 --> 00:27:25,887
One. Mine.

286
00:27:27,587 --> 00:27:28,962
The sofa.

287
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:30,637
Mine.
