than radio silence.

181
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:01,011
This is a good start.

182
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,645
What in the world?

183
00:21:04,178 --> 00:21:07,970
Our plan is to have a rising composer, Sea,

184
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,720
create a brand-new mini-album
for Neil's comeback.

185
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,011
We want to use this mini-album
to tell the world

186
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:16,011
that Magnet's Neil is back,
and he's a whole new Neil.

187
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:21,270
That was the original idea, but after that
performance, I have an even bolder vision now.

188
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:25,015
I think your styles are a perfect match
on stage.

189
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,360
Plus, Chairman Cheng adores Sea very much.

190
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,470
It got me thinking all night.

191
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,886
What if you guys form a band with this album?

192
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:40,436
Let's do a comeback concert.

193
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,095
But I don't...

194
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:49,270
I'm aware you guys still need a great deal
of time, to practice and work on it.

195
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:56,511
[Stress resistance - 50, Stage performance - 0]

196
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:58,095
Hey.

197
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,095
Is there something wrong with your numbers?

198
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:01,720
This is exactly your score.

199
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,061
Yeah.

200
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,470
You're a ticking time bomb on stage.

201
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,353
You have to figure out a way to solve this.

202
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:11,645
Sea,

203
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,845
I know you've been working alone since forever,

204
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:18,645
but from now on,
you gotta learn to work with others.

205
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,050
This is the contract.

206
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:28,175
I'll get the best deal for you,
including band practice, and the shows.

207
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:30,925
Given the way you describe me,
you expect us to form a band?

208
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,425
Get your persona as a performer back.

209
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:36,925
You'll need to get used to the crowd,
and get used to each other.

210
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:41,308
The more you know each other,
the more you'll find your songs together.

211
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:47,925
But, do I need to be up on the stage?

212
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:49,175
Sea.

213
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:51,800
If Neil can't make his comeback
by the end of the year,

214
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,380
the record company won't renew his contract.

215
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,080
Magnet will be history, too.

216
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,516
Are you willing to give it a try
for Neil's sake?

217
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,262
How should we start?

218
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,680
Leave the music part to me,
you just focus on singing.

219
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:32,883
No way. I'm a guitarist.

220
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:35,808
Your timing is all over the place
when you play and sing by yourself.

221
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:54,716
How's so?

222
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,758
Your rhythm is off.

223
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,966
I'll turn on the metronome, listen to it.

224
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:00,383
Be my guest.

225
00:24:00,383 --> 00:24:03,141
- Ninety.
- Too slow.

226
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:06,933
- One hundred and ten.
- One hundred and forty.

227
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,917
Too fast. The tempo isn't right.

228
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:27,216
- I'm telling you.
- Your rhythm is off.

229
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,216
Listen to it yourself.

230
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:31,190
- Da...
- It's too slow.

231
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Way too fast.

232
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:33,987
I can do fast, and that means I can do it slow.

233
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,480
It's too quick.

234
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,966
Time for lunch.

235
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:40,516
You decide between beef brisket
and chicken thigh.

236
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:42,931
- I want this.
- Mine.

237
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,390
- Let it go.
- My hand is beneath yours.

238
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,556
- Give it to me.
- I got here first.

239
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:47,015
- I'm older.
- I want the beef one.

240
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:48,431
- Leave it.
- I want this.

241
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:49,890
Stop!

242
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,735
Can you two get along?

243
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,375
Please be more like Mosbank.
They treat each other with kindness.

244
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Look at them.

245
00:25:07,431 --> 00:25:09,330
- He isn't being nice.
- He isn't, either.

246
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,473
- Give it to me!
- I want this!

247
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:12,523
- I don't eat chicken.
- I don't want this.

248
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:16,681
Mei, I don't eat chicken.

249
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,356
Does it look like I care?

250
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:23,565
I'll see how you'll eat without these.

251
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,556
- First.
- I was first!

252
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:37,640
- Me first...
- Do you have a cup?

253
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,806
You don't have coffee.
These are all mine.

254
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,135
Step aside, I'm warning you.

255
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,120
I have a cup.

256
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:43,640
- Enough, you two.
- Me first.

257
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,556
- Give it to me.
- Don't stand in my way.

258
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:49,890
- Me.
- Wait in line.

259
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,690
I was first in line.

260
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:02,455
Do it again.

261
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,140
- His rhythm's off.
- Your rhythm's off.

262
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,190
- Where did I do wrong?
- Listen up, can you use your ears?

263
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,265
The sound isn't right.

264
00:26:09,265 --> 00:26:11,390
♫ Cuz I ain't gonna stop ♫

265
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,973
- This.
- Don't touch...

266
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:14,765
C. The third one.

267
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:16,773
- Stop.
- Over here.

268
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,615
Why are these people so nasty?

269
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,765
What do they mean by... "The other one is
just trying to ride Neil's coattails, right?"

270
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,365
You don't get it.
You know you've made it when you have haters.

271
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,223
Sea, this is the international superstar, Orca.

272
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:33,306
Superstar.

273
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:34,773
You.

274
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,681
You don't have much of a stage presence.

275
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:38,973
You're just an accessory to Neil.

276
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,832
If you're a duo,

277
00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:44,681
- he should not be hiding himself.
- Okay. Stop it!

278
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:47,431
Somtimes, I evny Neil so bad.

279
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:51,148
I came to Taiwan to see you.
