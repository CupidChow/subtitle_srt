Here, I have 8000 dollars.

179
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,080
- Look at that.
- No... I have ten thousand.

180
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,155
Don't... don't touch me!

181
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:30,238
Watch yourself.

182
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:31,363
Who is this?

183
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,405
Kiddo, swooping in for the prize, huh?

184
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,488
- Damsel in distress.
- Yeah.

185
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,205
- Looks like someone needs a lesson.
- What are you doing?

186
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,538
- Another one, I see.
- What are you trying to do?

187
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:54,538
Break it up.

188
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,905
Stop fighting!

189
00:15:57,905 --> 00:16:00,238
Pretty cocky, huh?

190
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,571
- Arrogant shit.
- Stop fighting!

191
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:04,163
Enough!

192
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:24,038
It's alright... I'll protect you. Come on...
You think you're hot stuff?

193
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,913
Sorry.

194
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:36,200
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

195
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,155
- Hide!
- What are you doing?

196
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:42,488
- I'm protecting you.
- Idiot, I don't need your protection.

197
00:16:42,488 --> 00:16:44,205
Run!

198
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:52,363
- Come on.
- Don't play with the bottles.

199
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:53,520
Beat him!

200
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,738
Get screwed!

201
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:59,380
- I'll go!
- Hear you are!

202
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,996
Run!

203
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:04,363
Go, go...

204
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:05,488
Brother.

205
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:08,038
Go after them!

206
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,375
Come on, let's go.

207
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,953
Where are they?

208
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,461
Let's go.

209
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,503
Go.

210
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,161
- Stop running!
- Hurry up!

211
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:47,003
Stay still!

212
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:54,211
This way...

213
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
Shit, don't run!

214
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,578
- Run!
- Don't run!

215
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,045
Shit, don't run!

216
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:24,378
Over here...

217
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,745
Where are they?

218
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:50,170
Careful.

219
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:58,211
Sorry about that.

220
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,253
Are you okay?

221
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,703
I'm good.

222
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:12,911
Thanks.

223
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,545
Kiddo.

224
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:20,836
Be careful. Don't let them catch you.

225
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,648
Old man, I'm still working.

226
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,530
Why do you keep grabbing me?

227
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,280
What old man?

228
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,655
We are protecting you.

229
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,913
I can work it out myself.

230
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:02,530
Girl, how are you gonna work it out yourself?

231
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,871
They're so strong!

232
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,871
Take this for me...

233
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,205
Pepper spray.

234
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:19,038
Hold it.

235
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,330
Brass knuckles.

236
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:30,746
- Baton.
- Hold it.

237
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,330
After you guys caused this mess,
I'm gonna get fired.

238
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:02,413
Sea. Sea.

239
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,280
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

240
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,488
It's cool.

241
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:07,488
I'm glad to hear it.

242
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:10,371
Don't you think those people looked familiar?

243
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:12,113
Not really.

244
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:13,738
But that girl is weird.

245
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:15,488
She knows magic, though.

246
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:22,113
She scared me. Brass knuckles,
pepper stray, and a baton.

247
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,920
Plus, a mirror?

248
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,613
Hey, Liang.
[See you at ECHO MUSIC tomorrow at 11am]

249
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:28,246
Chen Han Liang.

250
00:21:31,113 --> 00:21:33,246
Did you respond for me?

251
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
[File received]

252
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,520
♫ When the spotlight fades, ♫

253
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,566
♫ the world comes into view, ♫

254
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:30,113
♫ But my heart has already been swept away, ♫

255
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:32,823
♫ shattered and torn apart. ♫

256
00:22:32,823 --> 00:22:36,113
♫ At the edge of the stage, ♫

257
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:39,155
♫ a horizon is drawn. ♫

258
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:46,121
♫ Consumed, I descend like the setting sun, ♫

259
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,705
When I feel like the world is abandoning me...

260
00:22:57,863 --> 00:22:59,996
Everything's gonna be alright.

261
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:05,631
You're like my sun, surrounding me.

262
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:11,006
From that day on, I've followed you.

263
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,373
A compass will always point North,

264
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:23,215
like the law of attraction,
pulling me to you.

265
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:38,991
- Where's our drink order?
- Hi.

266
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:40,575
What drinks?

267
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:42,158
Aren't you the delivery person?

268
00:23:42,158 --> 00:23:44,741
- No, I have a...
- Miss, here are your drinks.

269
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:45,783
It's mine. Ya!

270
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:49,041
- Three hundred and ninety-eight.
- Four hundred dollars right here.

271
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:52,958
- Here's your change.
- Thanks.

272
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,783
If you aren't the delivery man, who are you?

273
00:23:56,783 --> 00:23:59,950
I'm Sea.
I have an appointment with Reese.

274
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,000
You're Sea?

275
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,541
Come on in.

276
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,291
Over here.

277
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:24,950
I'd bet that he's one of
the few musical prodigies in Taiwan currently.

278
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,866
A prodigy.

279
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:28,325
Him?

280
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:31,658
Aren't you Neil from the Magnet?

281
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:33,700
A big star.

282
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,283
Yeah.

283
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,075
A has-been singer.

284
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,366
There are some problems with the event
this weekend.

285
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:41,991
The band that promised me a show
bailed last minute.

286
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:45,541
- The band?
- Do you happen to know someone who can sing?
