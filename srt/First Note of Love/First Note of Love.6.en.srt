A change of plans.
They'll come up from the basement.

00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,925
Alright, good job.

4
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,542
Hello?

5
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:28,875
<i>Hi, this is the Kaohsiung General Hospital.</i>

6
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:33,458
<i>May I ask if this is the emergency contact
of Huang Ping-Xiang and Huang Ping-Wei?</i>

7
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:37,417
<i>There was a serious car accident.
Currently, they are in the ER room.</i>

8
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:39,292
<i>Please hurry to the hospital.</i>

9
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,300
<i>It's urgent and they may need surgeries.</i>

10
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,008
What happened?

11
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:16,333
How's Neil?

12
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,008
He finally fell asleep.

17
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:45,552
Next week.

18
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,717
Time flies.

19
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:59,592
The first time I met you was at this place.

20
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,467
I'm gonna forget you.

21
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,215
Sorry.

22
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,092
Sorry.

23
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:01,217

You've always been nice to Neil.

27
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,800

Magnet is promising.

Terrific, keep going.

- Thanks...

37
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,292
You did an amazing job.

38
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,917
We are interested in
signing a contract with you.

39
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,967
Let's move on to the next stage.

40
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,083
This is our company's agent.

41
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:01,417
Her name's Rina, and she'll be
the agent for your band.

42
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,917
Agent?

43
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,875
We've already got an agent, that's Reese.

44
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,292
The agents of our company
have a lot of experience,

45
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:10,542
so more people can discover you guys.

46
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:15,667
If Reese isn't our agent for Magnet,
there is no next stage in the future.

47
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,925
We've only got one agent,

48
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,008
and it's Reese.

00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,842

52
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:43,883
Call an ambulance!

53
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,545
Neil.

54
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,383
I've been meaning to ask you,

55
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,175
would you still like to sing?

56
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:18,046
Recently, seeing you with Sea,

57
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:22,276
it's like I'm seeing the
happy version of you again.

58
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:31,967
I'm scared that my selfishness...
will once again put you and Sea in danger.

59
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,050
Just like back in the day.

60
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:39,592
It was me who proposed to host the show.

61
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,133
I miss Matt so much.

62
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,988
My brother wouldn't blame you for it.

63
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,592
You know, he used to tell me,

64
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:16,542
if I can't find him, go visit Reese.

65
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,467
Because Reese is the same as him.

66
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,464
Bro.

67
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,790
You're the only brother I've left.

68
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,292
I feel the same as you.

69
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:43,467
I miss him.

70
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,717
But now I've got you.

71
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,592
You take care of me more than
you take care of yourself.

72
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:59,596
For all these years, I understand
you've had a rough time, too.

73
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:04,050
Also, I know you're just acting tough
in front of me, that's all.

74
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,287
Thank you.

75
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,279
Thank you for finding Sea for me.

76
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,383
I need Sea, and I need you more.

77
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,617
I still have a love for singing,

78
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,351
but, I want to sing with all of you guys.

79
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,720
Bro.

80
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,625
Let's finish the concert
that we never got to finish, alright?

81
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,383
Where's Orca?

82
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,708
It's late now. I bet he's at the hotel.

83
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,311
He's staying at a hotel?

84
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,167
Yeah, he's rich now.

85
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,333
You can't ask him to stay at a hostel.

86
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,917
How's that possible?

87
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:31,167
He clings to you every time
he's back in Taiwan.

88
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,842
No way.

89
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,660
Band practice is exhausting.

90
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,292
Aren't you supposed to be at the hotel?

91
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,113
I'm crashing here.

92
00:11:08,113 --> 00:11:10,092
Goodnight.

93
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,956
Goodnight.

94
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,912
I'm gonna change the passcode.

95
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:33,615
Why are you still here?

96
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,996
Morning.

97
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,607
It's done.

98
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,633
I thought I told you to go back to your hotel.

99
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,092
Hold on...

100
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,342
One bed.

101
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,391
Mine.

102
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,270
The sofa.

103
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,458
Mine.

104
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,717
Orca.

105
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:31,458
I told you to go back to your hotel.

106
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,467
Let's eat.

107
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,758
I'm not hungry.

108
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:57,503
<i>If Neil can't work for the company anymore,
why are we still talking about the renewal?</i>

109
00:12:57,503 --> 00:12:59,887
<i>How many people know about Magnet exactly?</i>

110
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:02,737
<i>Are you hiding something from us?</i>

111
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:05,287
<i>Can Neil really pull it off?</i>

112
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:11,712
Cheng, you know Neil very well, he's working
really hard to get himself back on stage.

113
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:13,962
I have faith in him.

114
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:19,428
<i>They can't even form a proper band,
and you're talking about holding a concert?</i>

115
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,587
Cheng, I really wanna host the concert.

116
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,637
<i>The company can't agree to this.</i>

117
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:28,758
<i>And I don't agree, either.</i>

118
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:30,128
<i>Then let's terminate the contract.</i>

119
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:33,303
<i>Reese, do what an agent should do.</i>

120
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:16,345
<i>[If you insist on hosting a concert,
Cheng won't be able to help you]</i>

121
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:20,303
Come on in.

122
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,712
Sea.

123
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,803
Reese, do you have a second for this demo?

124
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:06,378
It's not bad.

125
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:08,212
It's a great song.

126
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:10,262
It's just, there's no soul in there.

127
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,762
Sea, this song sounds like something
that could be for anyone.

128
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:42,178
Sea, you are more important than you realize,
do you know that?

129
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:46,512
Whether Neil can make it, it's up to you now.

130
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:53,787
- Please give me more time, I...
- We don't have much time left.

131
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:59,428
If investors pull out their funds for Neil,
we won't even have a concert.

132
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:02,095
Let's wrap it up today.

133
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,920
<i>[Cheng, I understand...]</i>

134
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,803
<i>[but I'll figure out a way
to finish that concert]</i>

135
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,587
<i>Sea, why aren't you responding to your mom?</i>

136
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:36,003
<i>It's already night in Berlin.
How have you been?</i>

137
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:38,837
<i>I've been meaning to invite you here
during winter break.</i>

138
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:44,378
<i>Well, to get know your younger brother more,
and see if you are used to the life here.</i>

139
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:47,803
<i>Maybe come to Germany for grad school.</i>

140
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,428
Sea.

141
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,095
Stay still.

No. Sea is not feeling well.

I see.

171
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:50,345
Cheng is taking away our funding.

172

Why's that?

173
00:20:56,837 --> 00:20:59,378
He doesn't feel like supporting this concert.

174
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:02,970
But don't you worry,
I'll figure something out.

Is Sea alright?

176
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:16,553
He doesn't seem to be.

177
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,428
I may have put too much pressure on him.

178
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:27,972
What does that mean?

179
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:38,878

he's the only one who can help you,

00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:41,637
and I also told him about the lack of funding.

181
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:49,345
Why did you tell him that?

182
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:52,137
Is that something he has to worry about?

183
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:57,212
Sorry.

184
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:59,028
Sometimes, I just forget he's only 20.

185
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,412
This has nothing to do with age.

186
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:07,845
Whether we're successful or not,
that's my own issue.

187
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:45,803
<i>I always talk about being responsible
for myself,</i>

188
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:51,137
<i>but... I always make it a habit to rely others.</i>

189
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,678
<i>When I'm hurt, I'll run away, I can't move on.</i>

190
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:08,262
<i>Subconsciously,
I seem to have started to rely on you.</i>

191
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:13,068
<i>I will keep getting stronger.</i>

192
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:15,587
<i>You are the ocean.</i>

193
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,295
For Magnet.

194
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,595
<i>You've caught me.</i>

195
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:25,262
<i>I'm the one who needs you, to push me forward.</i>

196
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:35,678
Hello?

197
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,512
Well...

198
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:45,803
Can you come over to my place?

199
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,095
Hi.

200
00:23:56,587 --> 00:23:58,637
Come on in.

201
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:04,512
Take a seat.

202
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:53,600
Sea, I like you.

203
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,503
One of your friends
made a romantic confession the other day.

204
00:24:56,503 --> 00:25:00,512
That friend... was you.

205
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:05,762
From making music to falling in love.

206
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,128
I want to tell you, that it was all because
I met you,

207
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:11,470
I was able to get back on that stage again.
