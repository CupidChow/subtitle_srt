That's the issue we're facing right now.

These are your previous scores.

39

You've improved a lot, well done.

40

your performance with the organizers.

I've been working super hard,
almost got a six-pack now.

217
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,933
I miss you.

218
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,190
Come on, Reese.

219
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,773
Neil,

220
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:35,798
take a look at this schedule,
see if there's any issue.

221
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:38,073
I arranged it especially for you.

222
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:43,607
You're not joking, right?

223
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,023
A one-day tour guide?

224
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,932
What does that have to do with me?

225
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,073
I'm not joking, it's great.

226
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:54,798
- It's awesome?
- Yeah.

227
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:56,798
Come on.

228
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,840
This is a very good idea.
Come on, let's applaud.

229
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,173
- Great idea.
- I came up with it.

230
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:03,690
I spent three days
and two nights thinking of it.

231
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,807
- You thought of it?
- Yeah.

232
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,798
I... need to go to the bathroom.

233
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,898
No, let me tell you... Come, have a seat.

234
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:13,673
What you're lacking right now
is interaction with the audience.

235
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:15,748
- Close-up interaction.
- So you want me to take a guitar

236
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,998
and interact with them on a bus?

237
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,523
I originally just wanted you
to take a microphone,

238
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:21,690
but you've given me an even better idea.
You're amazing.

239
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,898
I've got an idea.

240
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:25,023
- What?
- You go. You go with him.

241
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:25,898
No, it has to be you.

242
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:29,023
- Everyone will come just for you.
- You go.

243
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:30,898
- What song are you going to sing?
- Yeah.

244
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,573
Tell me first,
and I'll go discuss it with them.

245
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,390
Who?

246
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:55,998
Who is it?

247
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,565
Yo, man.

248
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,465
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry to bother you.

249
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,155
- What?
- Wait, don't move.

250
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:11,465
- Cooperate with us.
- What's going on?

251
00:21:11,465 --> 00:21:12,965
- Come with us.
- No need... I...

252
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:14,523
- Please cooperate.
- I'm wearing indoor slippers.

253
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,965
- It's an emergency.
- Wallet...

254
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,340
Don't worry about the wallet, I've got money...

255
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,382
Didn't I already ask for time off?

256
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:20,065
Ting-Fei's in trouble.

257
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:22,940
What happened to Ting-Fei?
She just messaged me.

258
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,065
She messaged you?

259
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:25,300
Yeah.

260
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,315
Ting-Fei, it's already this time.
Hurry, sit down.

261
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,290
Isn't the shop closed at this hour? Why did you bring me here?

262
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:39,648
Senior Ting-Fei, I've brought him here for you.

263
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:40,947
Sea, come on...

264
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,290
- We've prepared delicious food for you.
- Sit.

265
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,040
This is for me?

266
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,698
Eat up.

267
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,948
Eat a little more...

268
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:01,898
Look at you, you've lost weight.

269
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:03,465
Yeah.

270
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:06,865
Sea, this is for you.

271
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:08,732
Surprise! For you.

272
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:11,590
We're all your number-one fans.

273
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:17,673
[Dear Sea, Good luck with the performance!
Ting-Fei, Liang]

274
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:22,590
Your fans also want
their idol to take good care of himself.

275
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,448
Yeah. Look, you've got dark circles
under your eyes.

276
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:28,915
Haven't been sleeping?

277
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,948
The song's almost done.

278
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:36,765
Did you know Neil is going to be
a one-day tour guide tomorrow?

279
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,510
- What one-day tour guide?
- Yeah, a one-day tour guide.

280
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,315
One-day tour guide.

281
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,723
One-day tour guide.

282
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:50,115
One-day tour guide.

283
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:06,173
Good morning, everyone.

284
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:08,598
Morning.

285
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:11,323
My name is Neil.

286
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,798
Neil? For real?

287
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,440
So cool!

288
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,382
I'll be your tour guide for today.

289
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:22,923
No way.

290
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:27,048
Today, I'll introduce you all
to the beautiful city of Kaohsiung.

291
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,748
It's also my first time being a tour guide,

292
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:32,715
so if my service isn't perfect, I hope you'll be understanding.

293
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,973
- That's great.
- Let's do our best together.

294
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:36,798
I believe in you. Go for it!

295
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:38,532
- Go for it.
- Thank you.

296
00:23:38,532 --> 00:23:43,640
On your left, you can see
the Hamasen Railway Cultural Park.

297
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,098
During the Japanese colonial period
this was Takao Station, the Kaohsiung Port Station of Taiwan Railways.

298
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:51,792
After the station ceased operations, it
preserved the historical site of the station.

299
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:55,083
Feel free to take your time walking around,
and taking pictures.

300
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,000
Don't be nervous.

301
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,833
You've got this!

302
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,520
- You're the best.
- Thank you.

303
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,670
Every city has a famous river.

304
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,962
In India, it's the Ganges River.

305
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:09,520
In Paris, it's the Seine.

306
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,560
Kaohsiung also has a famous river,
and that's the Love River.

307
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,603
Now, on your left, you can see the Love River.

308
00:24:18,603 --> 00:24:22,003
During the Japanese colonial period,
it was a canal.

309
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,845
Do you know what Cupid is...

310
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,480
♫ I wish you would say "I believe!" ♫

311
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,630
♫ I'll love as long as I exist ♫

312
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:38,378
Up next is Central Park.

313
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:42,670
It features collaborations with many artists,
creating a leisure and art corridor.

314
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,670
Central Park is our second-to-last stop
for today.

315
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,962
That was fast.

316
00:24:47,962 --> 00:24:50,178
Yeah, really fast.

317
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:56,253
I want to tell everyone...

318
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,503
I've actually been really nervous today.

319
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:00,545
- You've got this...
- Don't be nervous.

320
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:04,628
- Don't be nervous...
- You've been amazing.

321
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,545
- Thank you.
- This has been so much fun.

322
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:09,670
This one-day tour guide event

323
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,478
was actually part of my preparation
and training, for an upcoming concert.

324
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:20,253
I want to thank you all
for keeping me company today.

325
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:23,787
- We'll always support you!
- You're awesome, keep going.

326
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:26,660
It's been a long time
since I've held a concert.

327
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,437
I wasn't even sure if I could
still get back on stage like before.

328
00:25:31,437 --> 00:25:32,800
- You'll definitely succeed!
- Neil, you're the best!

329
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,960
Keep it up.

330
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:39,878
Now, let's head to our final destination,
the Pier-2 Art Center.

331
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:41,945

Why didn't you tell me about this place sooner?

00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:30,962
Because Sea works here.
I was afraid you'd be upset.

348
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,612
I'll come find you.

349
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:42,720
Take a look outside the window. 
 ♫ Daylight ♫

350
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,080
♫ It’s by design... ♫

351
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,850
♫ Landslide ♫

352
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,130
♫ Let me hold you tight and comfort you ♫

353
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,580
♫  ♫

354
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,330
♫  ♫

355
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,530
♫ In the future, I'll stand your guard and heal your broken heart ♫

356
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:12,000
♫ I'll stand your guard and heal your broken heart ♫

357
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,610
♫ In the future, I'll stand your guard and heal your broken heart ♫

358
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,810
♫ They’re talking, acting like a child ♫

359
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,410
♫ They’re talking, acting like a child ♫

360
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,150
♫ ♫

361
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,260
♫ ♫

362
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,820
♫ ♫

363
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,190
♫ ♫
