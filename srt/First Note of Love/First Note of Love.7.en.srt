1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,758
Hi.

2
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,883
Come on in.

3
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,508
Take a seat.

4
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,458
How about some green tea?

5
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,175
Thanks.

6
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,792
These pictures are very valuable.

7
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,758
They can't be leaked.

8
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright... let's record this.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,667
It's war time.

10
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,542
That's a guitar.

11
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,042
- Why are you recording this, brother?
- Because I'm gonna teach you.

12
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:18,583
You said you wanted to write songs.

13
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,708
Your idol.

14
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,042
- My brother.
- C Major.

15
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,542
Are you familiar with A Minor?

16
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:26,667
C Major... C...

17
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,167
I kind of forgot about it.

18
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,542
- Okay, I'll play it once first.
- Alright.

19
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:31,633
I'll go first...

20
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,292
This chord...

21
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:36,875
I recognize this.

22
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,758
You do, huh?

23
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,542
Honestly, my brother is a better guitarist.

24
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,717
He taught me how to play guitar.

25
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,717
Matt had never played guitar in public before,
right?

26
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,717
You remembered.

27
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,833
No wonder you're his fan.

28
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,092
Yeah... looking good...

29
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,583
It's A minor, come on.

30
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,542
- Play it well.
- Am I in the shot?

31
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:16,833
Doesn't matter.
Right now, we're focusing on this, alright?

32
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,458
- What's this?
- Okay, I will play it for you.

33
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,083
- Teach me this.
- Simple.

34
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,167
You're hiding your cuteness away.

35
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,083
- Nonsense.
- I want to learn this.

36
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,208
I want you to be the coolest.

37
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,633
I miss him.

38
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:47,633
For now, practice the C major,
A, F, and G major. This one is unnecessary.

39
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:54,050
- Teach me...
- Give it a try.

40
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:06,675
The truth is, I did think about
returning to the stage.

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,360
But without my brother,
I couldn't do a thing.

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm always failing someone.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,092
When my brother was around,
he would keep pushing me forward.

44
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,050
Slowly but surely,

45
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:49,592
I seem to understand...
that my brother isn't coming back.

46
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,592
However, you showed up.

47
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:10,800
Just in time when I was about to give up,
you showed up.

48
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,883
I want to say to you,

49
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:35,592
that because of you, I'm now able
to stand up there on the stage again.

50
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,008
So please don't feel the need
to carry everything yourself.

51
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:57,175
In the past, I relied on my brother, and
relied on Reese to survive and keep going.

52
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,717
And now, I also want to become
the person that you can rely on.

53
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,717
Are you willing to trust me?

54
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:20,717
[Episode 7: Are you willing to trust me?]

55
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,467
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,690
Like what?

57
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,883
When you are looking at me,

58
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,175
you look upset.

59
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,842
Do I?

60
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:43,042
Well, I guess I'd better go now.

61
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,717
I promised Reese that I would give him
the song.

62
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,800
Sea,

63
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,383
I like you.

64
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,883
Neil,

65
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,550
today's been a lot.

66
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,717
I need some time alone.

67
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,550
Why's he naked?

68
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,050
You're too perfect.

69
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:36,717
Sea, I like you.

70
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,458
You never take it off.

71
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,508
Yeah.

72
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:25,425
Do you like me better,
or do you like my brother better?

73
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,842
Of course it's you.

74
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,333
Why are you so early today?

75
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,583
I have nothing else to do, anyway.

76
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,917
What's with that temper
this early in the morning?

77
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,567
Since you're here, do you wanna
order lunch together?

78
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,133
Nope.

79
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,917
Salmon sashimi bowl with sea urchin.

80
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:46,000
Count me in.

81
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,542
- Fine.
- Is Reese here?

82
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,842
Reese is out having a meeting.

83
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,708
It's not usual you're looking for Reese.
What's wrong?

84
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,083
What has gotten to you?

85
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,542
Mind your own business.

86
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,708
Whatever.

87
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,175
Mei.

88
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,875
I have a friend, he...

89
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,958
He confessed his love to someone
without thinking twice yesterday.

90
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,925
I was too ner...

91
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,167
He was too nervous.

92
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:17,208
He didn't make the relationship clear first,
what should he do?

93
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:23,333
So what you meant is that, you have a friend
who confessed to someone yesterday,

94
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:28,092
and your friend... is actually you.

95
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,083
It wasn't me.

96
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,175
You are in love.

97
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,375
- I'm not.
- Multiplication table.

98
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,708
- Four times four.
- Sixteen.

99
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,167
- Seven times five.
- Thirty-five.

100
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,342
- Boys or girls.
- Boys...

101
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,542
I said I'm not.

102
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,583
- You just told me.
- Nah...

103
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,625
- One, two, three, who is it?
- Nothing.

104
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,592
Go grab lunch for us. I'm not.

105
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,458
Understood. I'll take care of myself.

106
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:02,050
It's all good. I'll be back in Kuala Lumpur
during the New Year.

107
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,750
- Senior.
- Sea, you are back.

108
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,083
I happen to need your help with this segment.

109
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,008
[Neil is twenty-seven this year...]
[Neil & Sea]

110
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,092
I'm still not that close with Neil.
Can you take a look and see if this is alright?

111
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,258
Sure.

112
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,458
At 19, he debuted alongside his brother Matt.

113
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:34,675
With his striking looks, humorous personality,
and irresistible sex appeal...

114
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,406
What? Is there something wrong?

115
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,756
All good.

116
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:47,458
Known for his charm.

117
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:53,217
Neil's musical talent and exceptional
stage presence quickly won him...

118
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,008
You're acting strange.

119
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,383
Well...

120
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,550
Senior.

121
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,000
Kissed? When?

122
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,167
Yesterday.

123
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,792
What happened?

124
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:24,333
I went to his place.

125
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,592
Gosh!

126
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,333
Playing music and then falling in love, huh?

127
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,542
What else?

128
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,458
I don't know what to do now.

129
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,925
Do you want to date him?

130
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,292
I have no idea. I haven't thought about it.

131
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,542
What do you mean by that?

132
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:45,875
Alright, let me ask you this. I am your...

133
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,458
My senior.

134
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,090
- Liang is your...
- Boss.

135
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,390
Neil is your...

136
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:59,208
My... partner.

137
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,848
- He's my partner.
- You're done for.

138
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,292
Why did you say that?

139
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:04,458
You're screwed.

140
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,083
He's my partner. Something wrong with that?

141
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,750
You're screwed.

142
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,342
My... partner.

143
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,333
Is this the right thing to do?

144
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,592
Do you want to put a stop to this?

145
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,254
You can.

146
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,792
The feelings of being in love
can be put on hold.

147
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:34,083
Just a few days apart,
and the feelings can quickly cool off.

148
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,467
But is this what you want?

149
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,292
Love is like a gambit.

150
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:48,292
Some people get their happy endings,
but some get hurt in the end.

151
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:53,300
But, if you want to know your answer,
you gotta give it a try.

152
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,667
Just trust your instinct.

153
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,508
Let yourself fall in love.

154
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,083
You and Sea.

155
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,542
Are you insane?

156
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,417
You'll be dead if Reese hears about this.

157
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,633
Whatever.

158
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,508
As long as you don't spill, it'll be fine.

159
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,333
You guys are launching an album.

160
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,708
Can't you hold it back a little longer?

161
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,542
I have no control over my feelings.

162
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,542
Have you been in love before? Teach me then.

163
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:55,708
Well, I've never been in love.
I mean, that's not the point.

164
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,167
I'm warning you guys.

165
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,217
This is our Sea's first time
to launch an album.

166
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,042
Sea does not belong to you guys.

167
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,383
Sea is part of our family now.

168
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,792
If he belongs to you guys, what about me?

169
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,042
- Just a stray.
- Just a stray?

170
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:13,167
Yeah, I told you guys that now...

171
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,167
- Don't say it.
- You two...

172
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,217
How could you guys not...

173
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,292
Here you are.

174
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:26,917
I thought we were gonna practice?

175
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,042
- Yes.
- Yeah.

176
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,792
Great, you're punctual.

177
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,758
You'd better watch out.

178
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,758
About yesterday...

179
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,675
I...

180
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:07,050
It's alright... Keep doing what you're doing.

181
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,333
Why did you come back this early?

182
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,417
- What's going on in there?
- Um... nothing. Nothing.

183
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,125
Want a cup of coffee?

184
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,167
Nah, I'm alright.

185
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,833
How about the afternoon tea?

186
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,217
The afternoon tea.
The one that I told you we ordered.

187
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,717
You...

188
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,467
What do you want to practice?

189
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,675
The song we played last time.

190
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,758
Which chords should I use?

191
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,383
Hold on a sec.

192
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,560
The pitch of this song is not that high.

193
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,280
Let's take a look at the file.

194
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,092
What's wrong with you?

195
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:37,042
I have been...
I have been restless all day long.

196
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,342
I can't write a thing.

197
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,300
Is it because of me?

198
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,550
I'm sorry.

199
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,750
Thank you for comforting me.

200
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,467
But I've been a mess all day,
thinking about you no matter what I'm doing.

201
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,425
Sorry.

202
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:31,217
Sea.

203
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,550

Why are you looking at me like that?

234
00:24:35,846 --> 00:24:37,771
What do you mean?

235
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,022
When you're looking at me,

236
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,889
you look upset.

237
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,675
The reason why I look at you like that
is because...

238
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,658
I want to tell you a secret.

239
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:11,190
Since that day, you were already by my side.

240
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,842
When I was vulnerable and weak,

241
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,550
your voice stayed with me.

242
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:25,617
You made me feel like I wasn't alone.

243
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,883
Sea, I like you.

244
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,088
Now I still want to be someone
that you can rely on.

245
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,092
You've become my rock.

246
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,675
Neil,

247
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,758
I like you too.

248
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,691
I've always believed in you.

249
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:11,675
I'm willing to go someplace far with you.

250
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,675
I really, really like you.

251
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,042
[Next Episode] You know?

252
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,625
Honestly, I genuinely like you, too.

253
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,790
Is it impossible between us?

254
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,458
Sea, are you in love?

255
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,167
Orca hasn't led you astray, has he?

256
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,000
We're just talking about music.

257
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,833
Talking about music is the most dangerous.

258
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,917
I fell in love with you just by
watching you play the piano.

259
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,833
I know you put the house up as collateral.

260
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:28,842
- How did you find out?
- It's a secret.
