00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,568
Grandma!

4
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,278
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

5
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,488
Please stand back.

6
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,572
Grandma!

7
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,658
Grandma.

8
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,876
Grandma.

9
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,378
Grandma…

10
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,891
CURSED HOUSE.
YOU MUST DIE.

11
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,896
What happened?

12
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,648
What's that?

13
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,983
Hey, this is our building!

14
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,570
Which one of you will accompany her?

15
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,365
Excuse me.

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,159
All three of us will.

17
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,953
Yeo-reum.

18
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,706
Bom.

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,583
What do I do now?

20
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,544
It's okay.

21
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,462
It'll be okay.

22
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,465
He didn't do anything wrong!

23
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,800
-Please!
-Bring him.

24
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,635
-Wait.
-Please move aside.

25
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,679
-Please stand back.
-Wait.

26
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,685
-Please move!
-Hey!

27
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,353
-Hold on. What?
-What happened?

28
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,564
-Geun-ho!
-What's happening?

29
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,357
Geun-ho, it's going to be okay.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,984
Stay calm, okay?

31
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:31,985
-Don't worry.
-It'll be fine.

32
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,904
No.

33
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,116
She still feels warm.

34
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,201
Grandma.

35
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,122
Grandma, you can't go like this.

36
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,750
Don't go, Grandma.

37
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,795
What do we do now, Grandma?

38
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,174
ANGOK FUNERAL HOME

39
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,933
Let me know if you need more of them.

40
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,059
Okay.

41
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,396
And you can wear this shirt.

42
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,109
Thank you.

43
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeo-reum.

44
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,747
Why is life like this?

45
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,295
Why do bad things keep happening?

46
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,723
-Hello.
-Hello.

47
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,102
Bom.

48
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,604
Are you okay?

49
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,235
Yeo-reum.

50
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,779
You need to come with me
to testify as a witness.

51
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,156
Right now?

52
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,868
Yes. We got in touch with Bom's father,

53
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,161
and he'll be here soon.

54
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,291
Then…

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,380
could I wait until he gets here?

56
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,006
Yeo-reum.

57
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,051
I'm okay. You can go.

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,225
Hey, come on in.

59
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,269
Dae-bum.

60
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,728
What do we do now?

61
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,398
I mean,

62
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,442
I uploaded the thesis on arXiv,

63
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,278
and Holland read it.

64
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,030
Professor Holland read the thesis.

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,490
I see.

66
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,200
He wants to talk to us.

67
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,661
We arranged a call for later today.

68
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,246
-Really?
-Yes.

69
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,125
I'm so nervous as to what he'll ask.

70
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,876
-Eun-mi.
-Yes?

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,170
Prepare some sample questions, okay?

72
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,131
-All right.
-My goodness.

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,258
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM

74
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,343
How do you know the victim?

75
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,763
I'm close with

76
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,099
her granddaughter.

77
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,272
Why did the victim
visit the billiard club today?

78
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,945
We weren't supposed to meet today.

79
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,617
I've been teaching her Hangeul these days.

80
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,287
Hangeul?

81
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,084
About the guy next door.

82
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,671
Why was Geun-ho there today?

83
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,757
I don't know.

84
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,594
Did he visit the billiard club often?

85
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,347
Not really, but…

86
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,308
Excuse me, Detective.

87
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,977
My kid has

88
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,022
never been to that place.

89
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,654
Geun-ho.

90
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,532
-Geun-ho.
-Geun-ho.

91
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,826
Are you okay, Geun-ho?

92
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,952
Nothing's wrong, right?

93
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,455
-You're not hurt, are you?
-How did it go?

94
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,791
Geun-ho confessed.

95
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,375
What?

96
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,545
-What do you mean?
-That's ridiculous.

97
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,255
Confess to what?

98
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,093
He's already confessed
that he killed the old lady.

99
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,387
-Take him.
-What are you talking about?

100
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,556
He didn't murder anyone!

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,599
Geun-ho.

102
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,850
Geun-ho!

103
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,353
-You didn't murder the lady, did you?
-Take him away.

104
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,146
Continue with the investigation.

105
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,439
-Sir.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,400
-He's just lying
-I know you didn't do it, Geun-ho.

107
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,319
because he's afraid of the detectives.

108
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,321
He's just lying.

109
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,948
-Please stand back.
-Stop.

110
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,158
-What's going to happen to Geun-ho now?
-Look at me, Geun-ho.

111
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,452
Stop it!

112
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,954
-Stop it!
-Take him away.

113
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,039
Hold on, Miss.

114
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,582
-Please don't do this.
-Miss.

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,377
-My kid was with me at the time.
-Please stop.

116
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,837
He was having a meal with me.

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,380
He was with me when it happened.

118
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,924
-Ma'am.
-Can you please tell them that?

119
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,301
-Let's go outside and talk.
-I saw him.

120
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,512
I saw Geun-ho

121
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,306
leave the billiard club.

122
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,107
His clothes were stained red.

123
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,778
At first, I thought it was red paint.

124
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,576
I was rattled, so I ran into the building.

125
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,745
And on the wall…

126
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,247
SLUT. WHORE. DIE. GO AWAY.

127
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,459
There was graffiti everywhere on the wall.

128
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,751
And…

129
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,213
Ms. Jung was lying on the floor.

130
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,090
Ms. Jung.

131
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,175
LEAVE THIS PLACE

132
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,135
Ms. Jung.

133
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,013
Ms. Jung.

134
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,891
Ms. Jung.

135
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,018
Ms. Jung.

136
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,812
Ms. Jung.

137
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,523
Ms. Jung.

138
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,072
Oh, here he is.

139
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,327
It looks like he's hesitating.

140
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,498
That's how he went in.

141
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,421
And here comes Ms. Jung.

142
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,593
He was inside before she arrived.

143
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,804
He was waiting for her to come.

144
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,308
You said he drew
graffiti here before, right?

145
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,728
Yes.

146
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,232
You should have reported him back then.

147
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,244
Ji-yeong.

148
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,748
Bom's grandmother passed away.

149
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,253
She passed away in the billiard club.
They say it was Geun-ho.

150
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,296
I can't believe what's happening here.

151
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,115
-Hello.
-Hey.

152
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,834
The higher-ups are convinced
that he's the culprit.

153
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,505
The CCTV footage shows him
running out from the building

154
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,299
covered in blood.

155
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,968
-Could you help?
-We also have a witness,

156
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,928
-so it's quite conclusive.
-I'll do it.

157
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,117
You. Why didn't you report him before?

158
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,786
Why?

159
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,289
Why didn't you report to the police
about the graffiti?

160
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,916
Sorry?

161
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,418
They said you knew everything.

162
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,505
Why did you call my mom
to your house without even reporting that?

163
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,799
-Why?
-Why are you being like this, Jeong-hun?

164
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,758
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,427
If you just reported him.
this wouldn't have happened.

166
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,846
That fucking retard murdered my mom.

167
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,181
-That motherfucker…
-Jeong-hun!

168
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,225
-Calm down.
-Dad.

169
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,143
-Hey.
-Dad.

170
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,603
If you just reported him,

171
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,023
if you just said something,
my mom wouldn't have died.

172
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,108
Fuck!

173
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,984
Jeong-hun.

174
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,738
Don't be like that
when you're in mourning for your mother.

175
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,739
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,200
Hey, this is all your fault.

177
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,827
You killed my mom!

178
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,788
Come on, Dad. She didn't kill her!

179
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,374
Don't you dare come around here.

180
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,418
You better not show your face around here!

181
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,378
Do you hear me?

182
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,255
-Hey.
-Calm down.

183
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,424
-Come by later.
-Get out of here.

184
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,968
-I told you to get out!
-Calm down!

185
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,594
Dad.

186
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,181
-Calm down.
-Dad.

187
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,016
Calm down, okay?

188
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,402
Please.

189

ANGOK FUNERAL HOME

190
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,719
Don't beat yourself up

191
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,138
over what Holland said.

192
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,389
Even as it is now,

193
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,642
it's worthy of research.

194
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,104
Hawking Radiation.

195
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,940
You can't provide a solution
to that just yet.

196
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,860
Even Holland said

197
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,154
that he doesn't know.

198
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,573
Okay?

199
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,497
JUNG YEONG-SUK
SON: KIM JEONG-HUN

200
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,582
GRANDCHILDREN: KIM BOM, KIM HA-NEUL

201
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,863
Bom.

ANGOK FUNERAL HOME

203
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,144
Hey, you should eat too.

204
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,437
Okay.

205
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,066
What about Bom?

206
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,360
She doesn't want to eat.

207
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,240
She hasn't eaten anything since yesterday.

208
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,495
You got here fast.

209
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,247
No, don't get up.

210
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,582
I'll stay for a bit.

211
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,961
-Then you should eat.
-Later.

212
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,552
I can't believe this happened.

213
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,979
Did you come here directly from Seoul?

214
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,480
Yes.

215
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,441
What about Dae-bum?

216
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,029
Keep this a secret from him.

217
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,449
A secret? Why would you keep it a secret?

218
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,367
He's occupied with an important…

219
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,622
Keep it that way for the time being.

220
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,665
Okay.

221
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,628
I can't contact him anyway
except through you.

222
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,635
I thought Yeo-reum would be here,
but she's not.

223
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,969
Don't even get me started.

224
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,804
Things got really messy.

225
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,223
Why?

226
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,691
I thought she went home.

227
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,533
QUANTUM PHYSICS

228
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,640
Bom.

229
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,650
Bom, my goodness.

230
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,028
This is all too sudden.

231
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,574
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,165
I only found out
when I went to see you at work.

233
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,251
Bom.

234
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,753
Why are you here?

235
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,172
You should go eat with Bom.

236
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,762
Bom, get up.

237
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,018
Your friend is here. Eat with him.

238
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,644
Get up.

239
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,232
Why are you being like this?

240
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,124
Can you help her so she can eat?

241
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,003
She hasn't eaten anything since yesterday.

242
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,925
Bom.

243
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,470
Your friend is here. Eat.

244
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,015
Please eat something, Bom.

245
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,602
Stop forcing her.

246
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,815
Your grandma hated seeing you skip meals.

247
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,526
Think about how she'd feel

248
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,361
if she were to see you like this.

249
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,867
Are you going to be selfish until the end?

250
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,412
Eat for your grandma, not yourself.

251
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:30,943
Here.

252
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,569
What's this?

253
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,155
It's a gift for Jun.
I've had it in the car for a while.

254
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,451
Ji-yeong.

255
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,829
The other one is yours.
You haven't slept, right?

256
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,168
Hey, what's with you today?

257
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,462
I just wanted to thank you.

258
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,089
What?

259
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,342
For driving up to Seoul for me…

260
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,179
and for being my friend all this time.

261
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,181
I mean, this is…

262
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,433
Are you okay?

263
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,938
Anyway, I won't treat you
so harshly from now on.

264
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,399
I'll keep it to a minimum.

265
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,404
But you know, people don't change easily.

266
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,447
See you.

267
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,409
Don't get the wrong idea.

268
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,660
I'll end you.

269
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,418
Goodness.

270
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,797
What wrong idea?

271
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,719
Ji-yeong! What wrong idea?

272
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,928
What the…

273
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,948
Get them some more food.

274
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,116
All right.

275
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,931
Jeong-hun.

276
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,684
How dare you show your fucking face here?

277
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,353
-Jeong-hun.
-Get the fuck out.

278
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,812
-How dare you?
-Stop.

279
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,357
-Get out!
-Calm down.

280
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,943
-I'm going to kill him.
-Please calm yourself.

281
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,613
I know you must be heartbroken,
with your mother passing away.

282
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,989
What the fuck did you say?

283
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,242
We know! We know how you feel.

284
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,785
We feel the same way.

285
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,453
-Stop it.
-The hell you do, you pieces of shit!

286
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,537
But!

287
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,997
But please know this.

288
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,707
My Geun-ho…

289
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,043
Geun-ho didn't do it.

290
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,171
-I'm going to kill her.
-Come on, stop.

291
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,382
-Let me go!
-Please believe in me!

292
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,133
Come on, stop it guys.

293
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,718
Please believe me, Jeong-hun.

294
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,803
-Get out!
-Come by later.

295
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,429
-You have no right to be here.
-Get the fuck out of here!

296
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,056
-So just get out!
-Hey!

297
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,182
-Get out!
-Come on.

298
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,893
This is just as hard for us!

299
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,729
-We're barely holding up!
-We know.

300
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,023
I get it. Let's talk outside.

301
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,192
-Hey.
-Come on. Gosh.

302
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,902
Let's talk outside.

303
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,945
-Hey, Seong-min.
-Yes?

304
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:20,946
Hear me out.

305
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,116
Geun-ho may hurt himself,

306
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,159
but he would never hurt someone else.

307
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,370
How could he have done that to her?

308
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,039
I know, Chang-su.

309
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,042
This is absurd.

310
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,754
But still, you can't come here
and cause a scene!

311
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,839
Why not?

312
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,465
Why can't we?

313
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,968
Our Geun-ho is wrongfully in jail.

314
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,469
How do you think he'll hold up?

315
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,390
What if something bad happens to him?

316
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,308
I get it.

317
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,393
I understand, so let's talk outside.

318
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,937
-Seong-min.
-Chang-su, I get it.

319
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,230
But let's not talk here.

320
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,025
-Let's talk outside.
-This is just so wrong.

321
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,943
They're unbelievable.

322
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,742
-Hello, Professor.
-Did you eat?

323
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,368
Yes. Professor.

324
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,665
Dae-bum is acting strange.

325
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,167
How so?

326
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:19,046
He kept mumbling
in front of the board all day,

327
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,506
and he suddenly ran to the library.

328
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,591
Really?

329
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,846
Ahn Dae-bum.

330
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,514
Sorry?

331
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,101
Sounds like he found the way
back to his own little black hole.

332
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,189
Let's see what he brings out from there.

333
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,610
-What about Seong-cheol?
-He's taking a break.

334
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,320
Good.

335
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,946
He should be taking a break.

336
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,906
Eun-mi.

337
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,116
Last year's conference files
should be on Seong-cheol's laptop.

338
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,534
Can you send them to me?

339
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,162
I'll text it to you.

340
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,288
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,207
2021 CONFERENCE PRESENTATION

342
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,709
SEND FILE

343
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,628
I sent it.

344
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,299
2021 CONFERENCE PRESENTATION

345
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,426
PROFESSOR LEE

346
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,180
Sir, I've posted it
on the university forums.

347
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,640
Good work.

348
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,982
ANGOK FUNERAL HOME

349
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:55,851
I'm sorry.

350
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:03,942
Ms. Jung.

351
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,699
I'm so sorry.

352
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,599
Ms. Jung.

353
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,561
When you get to heaven,

354
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,940
please meet up with my mom.

355
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:51,823
She would love you.

356
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:01,416
After my dad passed away,
I asked my mom if she was sad,

357
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,544
and she told me this story.

358
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,302
She told me that life is like
traveling on a bus.

359
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,723
That on this bus of life…

360
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,853
my parents, friends, and acquaintances

361
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,774
are all passengers.

362
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,027
And that one point or another,

363
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,446
they all have to get off.

364
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,707
I sincerely hope you go to a good place

365
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,960
and finally be able to rest in peace.

366
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,544
Okay.

367
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,422
She will go on her final journey now.

368
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:52,050
Let's wish her a safe journey

369
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,302
with a silent bow.

370
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,429
All bow.

371
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,310
I don't know if my mom
truly believed what she said.

372
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,149
Maybe she had to believe that
to keep herself going.

373
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,530
That parting ways
is a natural part of life.

374
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,282
You may rest.

375
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,244
I'll be closing the door.

376
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,913
Ms. Jung.

377
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,960
Whenever I saw you,
you reminded me of my mom.

378
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,675
I won't forget

379
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,553
everything you did for me.

380
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,771
Ms. Jung.

381
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,065
Goodbye.

382
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,485
Safe travels.

383
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,918
You're home.

384
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,505
I've been waiting for you.

385
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,592
-Can we talk for a bit at my house?
-No.

386
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,261
I have something to give you.

387
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,014
-Please come with me for a minute.
-No, I have nothing to say.

388
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,265
I'm so sorry.

389
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,517
-Why are you being like this?
-Please.

390
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,479
-I won't take much of your time.
-I don't want to.

391
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,606
I'll be really quick.

392
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,776
Come in.

393
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,236
Come on in.

394
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,988
Please have a seat.

395
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,573
What do you want to drink?

396
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:41,242
Actually, do you want something to eat?

397
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,203
-You're hungry, right?
-No, I'm not.

398
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,122
This.

399
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,500
This is a petition.

400
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,044
Can you please sign one for us?

401
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,214
No, I can't.

402
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,131
Hold on.

403
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,258
Please.

404
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,804
I understand that it may be difficult
for you to sign this.

405
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,223
But please.

406
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:06,309
I'm grasping at straws here.

407
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,852
When I imagine

408
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,980
my poor son shivering in fear behind bars…

409
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,232
Ma'am.

410
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,985
It's Geun-ho that drew the graffiti
on the building.

411
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,030
But Geun-ho didn't kill anybody.

412
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,657
Stop doing this to me.

413
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,784
Wait! My kid lost
his glasses the day before,

414
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,078
so he wasn't wearing his glasses.

415
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,539
Without glasses, he's practically blind.

416
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,457
How could he have drawn the graffiti?

417
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,752
-Please don't do this.
-Miss, I beg you.

418
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,339
I'm begging you. Please sign this.

419
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,466
Here, sign this.

420
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,301
Do you even hear yourself?

421
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,388
How could you be so selfish?

422
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,184
Bom's grandmother died because of Geun-ho.

423
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,269
That's not true!

424
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,481
When you told me about the graffiti
in the billiard club,

425
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,358
Ms. Jung said

426
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,069
that Geun-ho was a good kid.

427
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,866
And that I shouldn't
report him to the police.

428
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,035
But that Geun-ho went and killed her!

429
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,787
Don't you even feel bad?

430
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,082
How can you only think about your kid?

431
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,710
Geun-ho didn't do it!

432
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,886
Ji-yeong.

433
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,263
-Are you coming from the lab?
-Yes.

434
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,432
You look exhausted.

435
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,933
I'm fine.

436
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,644
Dae-bum hasn't even
been sleeping or eating,

437
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,313
solving problems all day.

438
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,607
Compared to him, I'm not doing much.

439
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,984
I see.

440
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,238
The thing is…

441
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,491
Why do I feel bad?

442
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,535
Why would you?

443
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,496
I called to tell you

444
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,875
that there's going to be
a committee meeting…

445
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,046
and that we need Dae-bum here.

446
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,882
How is that your fault?

447
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,469
Right?

448
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,179
Goodbye, then.

449
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,765
Bye.

450
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,769
Ji-yeong.

451
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,982
Hey, Bom.

452
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,860
And Ha-neul.

453
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,445
Can we talk for a minute?

454
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,035
Bom, I'm sorry.

455
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,997
I'm so sorry.

456
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,082
Ha-neul, I'm sorry.

457
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,295
I've never been a proper dad to you guys.

458
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,797
I apologize for that.

459
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,134
I'm never going to drink again

460
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,470
and I'm only going to live for you.

461
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,473
I'll try my best, so please forgive me.

462
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,767
Please give me one last chance.

463
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,436
I'm sorry.

464
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,606
Get up, Dad.

465
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,690
Gosh.

466
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,026
Hey.

467
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,237
We only have each other now.

468
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,990
With my mom gone too,

469
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,952
you guys are all I have.

470
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,250
Here.

471
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,799
This is condolence money from the funeral.

472
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,844
This will cover our expenses for now.

473
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,349
I'm starting work tomorrow.

474
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,978
I'll be coming home late after work
from now on.

475
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,899
I'll really do my best.

476
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,569
Here, take this. I'll entrust you with it.

477
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,196
Take care of Ha-neul too.

478
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,700
I'm sorry.

479
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,371
Take it.

480
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,509
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K…

481
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,103
KIM JEONG-HUN

482
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,481
KIM BOM

483
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,532
Grandma…

484
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,414
I miss you.

485
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:21,142
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

486
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,407
When I first came here,

487
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,242
I had…

488
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,995
nothing left to lose.

489
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,879
I had no idea how to go on…

490
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,384
and my confidence was at rock bottom.

491
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,656
Then…

492
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,325
I made friends in this town.

493
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,997
Bom.

494
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,542
Jae-hun.

495
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,212
Ms. Jung.

496
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,756
Dae-bum.

497
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,436
They helped me smile again.

498
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:57,363
Every day I spent here was like therapy.

499
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,458
However…

500
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,045
I shouldn't have come here.

501
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,594
If they never met me,

502
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:26,767
Dae-bum wouldn't have had to
be reminded of this painful past,

503
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,940
and Bom's grandma would have
lived a long and happy life

504
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,818
alongside Bom and Ha-neul.

505
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,618
I never…

506
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,496
should have come to this place.

507
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,132
Let's wrap up
what Dae-bum is looking into for now.

508
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,967
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

509
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,385
All right.

510
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,721
Let's not go too in-depth.

511
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,805
Hello.

512
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,474
Welcome.

513
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,523
-Professor.
-Yes?

514
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,318
Is it okay to leave Dae-bum like that?

515
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,486
What do you mean?

516
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,697
He's researching without even sleeping.

517
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,492
That's his true side.

518
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,785
I guess you didn't know.

519
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,079
He can't stand not knowing something.

520
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,830
-Eun-mi.
-Yes?

521
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,961
He's gone into his own world.

522
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,295
Just like old times.

523
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,059
Seong-cheol is the one who posted
the accusations on the forum.

524
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,271
Why would Seong-cheol do that?

525
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,317
Professor Lee told him to.

526
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,613
I think Professor Lee asked the dean
to arrange a meeting with Holland

527
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,616
in order for Dae-bum to meet him.

528
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,952
I mean…

529
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,997
What do you mean by that?

530
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,333
What I mean is

531
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,545
Professor Lee is trying to keep
Dae-bum here to have him

532
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,754
write his thesis.

533
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,513
-Ji-yeong.
-Yes?

534
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,558
You'll have to find a place
to stay with Dae-bum.

535
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,190
Yeo-reum.

536
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,861
Gyeo-ul, she's back.

537
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,697
Gyeo-ul.

538
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,033
Come here, Gyeo-ul.

539
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,535
Have you been well?

540
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,750
He's acting like
he hasn't seen you for ages.

541
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,712
Thank you for taking care of him.

542
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,838
It was nothing.

543
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,467
Gyeo-ul.

544
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,094
Yeo-reum.

545
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,806
I might leave this place soon.

546
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,475
What?

547
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,314
My parents want me
back in the States again.

548
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,694
Did you tell Bom?

549
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:26,989
No.

550
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,951
Bom is going through a lot, so I couldn't.

551
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,087
I'm immature and childish.

552
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,300
So I don't know if I should be beside her.

553
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,388
Yeo-reum.

554
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,348
I'm afraid

555
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,725
that we'll grow apart.

556
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,520
That I'll be forgotten.

557
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,821
Jae-hun.

558
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,578
Just let those growing apart grow apart.

559
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,289
Just let those who hate

560
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,917
hate you.

561
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,002
But as for me,

562
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:27,883
I'll treat you as my friend
no matter where or when we meet.

563
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,345
When we meet again,

564
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,640
I'll put on a big smile
and give you a hug.

565
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,018
I'll greet you happily.

566
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,521
I'll ask how you fared
and tell you that I missed you.

567
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,733
To me…

568
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,780
you were a good person.

569
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,616
Yeo-reum.

570
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,662
And…

571
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,623
I'm sure Bom thinks that way too.

572
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,293
Yeo-reum.

573
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:06,922
Thank you.

574
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,439
Hello?

575
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,649
Seong-min.

576
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,569
Are you happy?

577
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,321
What?

578
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,573
What's this out of the blue?

579
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,867
Why am I unhappy when I'm in Seoul?

580
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,872
Hey, is something wrong?

581
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,251
I miss how uneventful it is in Angok.

582
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,169
Gosh.

583
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,672
Uneventful, my foot.
The town is a total mess right now.

584
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,843
Is this about Dae-bum again?

585
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,597
I don't know what to do with him.

586
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,851
Dae-bum must be sad to hear
that Yeo-reum is leaving soon.

587
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,605
-What are you talking about?
-You didn't know?

588
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,566
Yeo-reum is leaving Angok soon.

589
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,361
Hello?

590
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,655
Ji-yeong. Are you there?

591
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,307
It's been a while.

592
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,646
I missed you.

593
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,531
It's hard, right?

594
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,410
Have you eaten?

595
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,300
I'm sorry.

596
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,103
I'm sorry for even apologizing.

597
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:33,944
Yeo-reum.

598
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,617
I know that it's not your fault,

599
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,453
but I blamed you for it.

600
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,332
I kept telling myself I shouldn't,

601
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,251
but I was so resentful…

602
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,172
because I felt so bad for my poor grandma.

603
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,092
It feels so unfair,

604
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,637
so it makes me furious.

605
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,140
When I try to eat, I get angry.

606
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,436
When I try to sleep, I get angry.

607
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,898
Even just breathing makes me angry.

608
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,156
So…

609
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,203
let's see each other later.

610
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,205
Later.

611
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,506
Okay.

612
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,182
Dae-bum.

613
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,184
Hey.

614
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,609
Let's talk.

615
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,195
Wait, I have to read this part.

616
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,909
Yeo-reum is leaving Angok.

617
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,497
What?

618
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,627
Yeo-reum was involved
in a big incident while you were here.

619
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,631
She hasn't told you, has she?

620
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,303
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

621
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,680
What did Bom's grandma do wrong?

622
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,140
-Why did you kill her?
-Grandma is in danger!

623
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,225
Run away!

624
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,936
Geun-ho has been weighing on my mind.

625
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,813
Look what he drew on the walls.

626
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,022
I told you it's not him.

627
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,984
Could you tell us what this is?

628
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,987
It really sounds like
he's telling me to run away from someone.

629
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,782
I think someone is impersonating
Geun-ho with this graffiti.

630
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,742
Do you think my kid painted this?

631
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,619
My kid who is in jail at the station?

632
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,413
Geun-ho, you didn't kill her, right?

633
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,664
You killed her, didn't you?

634
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,875
