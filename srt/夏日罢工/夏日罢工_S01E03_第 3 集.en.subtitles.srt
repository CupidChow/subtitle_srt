1
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,376
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, GROUPS, AND
ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,379
SCENES WITH ANIMALS ARE STAGED
ACCORDING TO ANIMAL WELFARE GUIDELINES

3
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,529
This place used to be
a popular billiard club in this town.

4
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,574
It's really spacious, isn't it?

5
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,039
You'll never guess how much the rent is.

6
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,167
It's only 50,000 won!

7
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,461
Isn't that shocking?

8
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,592
Plus, I get to use
this whole building by myself.

9
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,470
I'm practically the owner of the building.

10
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,396
To be frank, I'm worried about being alone
but I'm also excited.

11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,025
I wonder what will happen from now on.

12
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:03,081
I calculated how much
I have saved up until now.

13
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,791
Goodness.

14
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,919
This is all Mom's money
except for 500,000 won.

15
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,837
5.5 MILLION

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,132
I only have 500,000 won
after working for four years.

17
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,592
Where did all my money go?

18
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,810
That's why I try to eat at home.

19
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,769
It's hot.

20
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,647
Sir, do you have a lantern here
by any chance?

21
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,857
It's 10,000 won.

22
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,860
-I only buy what's necessary.
-This is soft.

23
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,986
If I buy this too,

24
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,029
-can I get a discount?
-A discount?

25
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,906
It's always quantity over quality.

26
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,159
-Yes, this is cornbread.
-One of those, please.

27
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,580
Living here, I've decided
to only use 10,000 won a day.

28
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,792
That's the only way I can get by
for a year without working.

29
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,460
You may ask, "isn't it tough?"

30
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,921
No, completely the opposite.

31
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,269
I have my own hideout.

32
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,358
Although I did make
a commotion here at first.

33
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,154
I can read all day here

34
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,408
and watch all the movies I want.

35
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,540
I can rest and enjoy nature at leisure

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,752
and walk about wherever I please.

37
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,630
I even took up jogging in the morning.

38
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,507
Because time is all I have.

39
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,026
Mom.

40
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,238
This is how I'm living.

41
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,659
Are you doing well up there?

42
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,495
I miss you.

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,121
A lot.

44
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,599
Look at her.

45
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,934
Gosh.

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,895
-My goodness.
-Hello.

47
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,481
Do you have AAA batteries here?

48
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,150
Jeong-hun must have caused trouble again.

49
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,404
-What did you need?
-AAA batteries.

50
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,491
They are over there.
Which one are you looking for?

51
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,118
I'll go take a look.

52
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,955
Why does he love drinking so much?

53
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,582
It'll be the death of him.

54
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,126
Let's go home.

55
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,378
-Darn it.
-Stand up.

56
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,963
Get a hold of yourself.

57
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,132
Move, damn it!

58
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,551
-Damn.
-Goodness.

59
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,555
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

60
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm fine. Thank you.

61
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,684
-Hey, stand up.
-Don't touch me.

62
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,353
-Let's go home.
-I don't want to.

63
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,105
Please stand up.

64
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,024
-Mister, please get up.
-What the hell?

65
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,567
-Get up.
-Hold on.

66
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,068
Mister.

67
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,987
-I can't walk.
-Get it together.

68
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,365
My mom is such a pitiful woman.

69
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,450
Let's go home.

70
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,286
-Where's your home?
-It's a bit far.

71
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,872
-I'll help you take him home.
-Thank you.

72
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,459
Jeong-hun,
wake up and try to walk properly.

73
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,421
-Let's put him over there.
-Okay.

74
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,214
Goodness.

75
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,847
Gosh. You're exhausted, right?

76
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,016
Thank you so much.

77
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,101
I managed to bring him home thanks to you.

78
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,728
I'll get going then.

79
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,813
Hold on. Just a moment.

80
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,278
-Here.
-Thank you.

81
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,573
-Thank you so much.
-It's nothing.

82
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,743
Make sure you apply ointment
on your hands.

83
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,579
-Of course.
-Damn it. Hey.

84
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,123
-I'll be going.
-Goodbye.

85
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,542
You fucking bitch!

86
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,586
-Goodness, Jeong-hun!
-Fuck!

87
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,506
We're home now. Get yourself together now.

88
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,692
Liquor must be a real problem.

89
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,198
No, it's not.

90
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,742
People are the real problem.

91
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,537
-Come on!
-Gosh!

92
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,081
-Shoot her!
-Go away!

93
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,416
-Get out of her!
-Shoot!

94
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,459
Stop it!

95
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,877
How did you come in here?

96
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,170
What about you, old lady?

97
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,839
This is our building.

98
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,882
Hey, this is my house. Get out!

99
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,008
You live here?

100
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,593
Are you homeless, old lady?

101
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,846
How could a billiard club be your house?

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,223
-It's a house, let's leave now.
-Shoot!

103
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,183
-Get out!
-Shoot her!

104
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,477
-Shoot!
-Do you want a piece of me?

105
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,313
-No!
-Run!

106
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,108
-Run away!
-Quick!

107
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,776
-Let's go.
-Go.

108
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,826
Those little brats.

109
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,705
What's up with this?

110
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,637
What do I do?

111
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,347
What's wrong with this thing?

112
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,449
ANGOK SUPERMARKET

113
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,499
Gosh, to what do I owe the pleasure?

114
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,083
Yes, hello.

115
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,044
The water pipe is leaking.

116
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,046
I see. The water pipe.

117
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,591
Goodness, it must be a mess over there.

118
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes, so I was wondering…

119
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,930
Come on, I hope you're not calling me
to ask me to fix the pipe.

120
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,973
We had an agreement.

121
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,101
I thought I told you
to take care of it yourself.

122
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,564
But you know, the windows don't close
and the doors don't shut properly there.

123
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,566
There are loads of things
that need fixing.

124
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:51,030
Then could you at least give me a number
for a handyman to contact?

125
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,907
Right, a handyman?

126
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,075
A handyman.

127
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,077
I haven't thought of that.

128
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,996
-Mister!
-But the amount he charges for the service

129
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,290
-Mister.
-is more than your rent for six months.

130
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,043
-Come on!
-Do you still…

131
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,836
-Come on!
-Hello?

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,963
-Give us the money!
-What did you say?

133
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,923
So the price is… Excuse me.

134
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,424
Be quiet, you brats!

135
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,010
-Who are you on a call with?
-Give us the money!

136
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,095
Lady, just leave.

137
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,515
I'll talk to my dad
and ask him to give you back the money.

138
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,685
It's fine. I'll just fix it up myself.

139
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,103
-Come on!
-Hang up!

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,605
Gosh, this lady.

141
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,107
You little brats.

142
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,109
Couldn't you see I was on a call?

143
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,527
Why were you being so noisy?

144
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,779
-Give me the money first.
-Give us some money.

145
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,531
-There you go.
-Seriously.

146
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,783
You and your grandpa
steal so much money away.

147
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,493
Here you go.

148
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,663
Is that all?

149
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,124
-Gosh!
-Give us at least 10,000 won!

150
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,835
-You didn't do your jobs properly!
-What are you saying?

151
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,380
You said you would give us 10,000 won
for causing trouble with the water!

152
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,508
It was tough for us to act excited!

153
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,552
Fine. Have it your way.

154
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,803
Here.

155
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,263
Then give that money back.

156
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,599
-Thanks, Dad.
-Let's go!

157
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,059
-Bye!
-Goodbye!

158
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,770
Don't use it all at once! Save it up!

159
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,093
I'll just be careful with it.

160
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,653
I heard that lady comes here often.

161
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,573
Are you interested in her?

162
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,534
What are you saying?
Listen carefully, Bom.

163
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,244
I hate…

164
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,082
tanned and skinny girls like her.

165
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,585
-I like girls who--
-She hates you too. Wake up.

166
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,754
Gosh.

167
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:16,133
I heard she came into the library drunk
and fell asleep there.

168
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,887
Gosh, this town literally has no secrets.

169
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,724
Her behavior shows
she has no respect for the countryside.

170
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,143
She buttered up my old man
to rent the billiard club

171
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,104
for 50,000 won a month.

172
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,314
Isn't that ridiculous?

173
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,649
So what?

174
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,444
Why did you call me?
Was it so we could gossip about her?

175
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,071
Gosh.

176
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,656
-I'm leaving.
-Hey, wait.

177
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,492
Do you want a part-time job?

178
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,619
What part-time job?

179
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,829
I'll pay you 50,000 won.

180
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,498
What? 50,000 won?

181
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,210
Start talking.

182
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,586
NON-POSSESSION BY BEOPJEONG

183
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,399
Let's not avoid him.

184
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,693
I'll be seeing him every day anyway.

185
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,448
Do you…

186
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,408
repair all the books yourself?

187
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,784
Yes.

188
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,378
Can I try too?

189
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,589
Sorry?

190
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,800
You take the spatula

191
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,262
and spread the glue evenly,

192
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,266
and you place the page
at its original location.

193
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,022
And then…

194
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,194
And that's it.

195
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,865
You're like a doctor.

196
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,117
It's like you're applying
medicine to the books.

197
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,703
I think…

198
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,581
I'm in love.

199
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,794
What I mean is…

200
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,716
I think I'm in love with the process

201
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,552
of fixing up old things.

202
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,679
I see.

203
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,391
Let me help you.

204
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:44,865
Has anyone told you
that you're like Santiago?

205
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,785
-Me?
-Yes.

206
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,289
The old man from The Old Man and the Sea.

207
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,708
-You know him, right?
-I do.

208
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,920
When I first met you,

209
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,006
that character came to my mind.

210
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,682
Which one was this?

211
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,933
What do I do?

212
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,784
Did you memorize all of these?

213
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,035
No.

214
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,207
I only remember the names
and the places in the books.

215
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,044
I can never memorize the names
even after I read them multiple times.

216
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,632
Why don't you try this one, Ms. Lee?

217
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,011
I'll give it a try.

218
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,851
Are you helping us out?

219
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,603
-Hello.
-Hello.

220
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,646
Well, actually…

221
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,274
I'm not sure if I'm helping at all.

222
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,030
-It's not even summer, but there's a fly.
-I know.

223
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,407
How come you're having lunch so late?

224
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,415
Don't even think about it. Just get out.

225
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,669
Look here.

226
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,299
Do you think I came all the way here
without a plan?

227
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,718
-Attitude.
-Gosh.

228
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,136
What's gotten into you?

229
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,888
Your attitude.

230
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,556
What are you talking about?

231
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,267
Listen.

232
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,729
When city folks move to the countryside,

233
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,857
do you know why they come here excited
but leave in tears?

234
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,067
Why?

235
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,693
Because of the countryside attitude.

236
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,070
Look it up on the internet.

237
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,947
People even take pills because of it.

238
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,323
That's going too far.

239
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,991
I know, right?

240
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,285
So that's why I looked into it.

241
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,790
They whine over the smallest things,
blaming it on the social dynamic.

242
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,250
When the city folks
meet someone like your wife,

243
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,879
they'll know exactly what they're in for.

244
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,340
They'll say she's the real deal.

245
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,217
Who do you think you are?

246
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,885
Are you trying to start a fight?

247
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,596
This is it. This is a textbook attitude.

248
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,015
I'm about to pee my pants
from just watching you.

249
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,518
Let's take this face right to that lady
and show her.

250
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,435
You brat.

251
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,896
Then she'll pack up immediately
and go back.

252
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,357
-Hey.
-Hey, Seong-man.

253
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,109
We need to eat.

254
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,362
I'm pressuring her
from every direction right now.

255
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,031
The flower of Angok.
The attitude of Angok.

256
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,535
All I'm saying is that you should
go to her and teach her a lesson.

257
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,578
What do you mean "flower"?

258
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,288
Stop the gibberish and get lost.

259
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,456
And you.

260
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,751
If you don't show up with money next time,
you're dead meat.

261
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,211
Listen.

262
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,590
Not me, but you should get the money
ready for the building

263
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,509
I'm leaving. The kimchi looks good.

264
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,678
-Did you just use your hand?
-My bad.

265
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,514
-Damn you.
-Look what mess you made.

266
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,473
I'm leaving.

267
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,697
Oh, no.

268
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,658
What do I do?

269
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,995
Give it to me.

270
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,039
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

271
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,167
What's wrong?

272
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,502
I'm so sorry.

273
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,714
You should've been more careful.
It's all soaked.

274
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,716
It's fine. I can dry it.

275
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,432
He's going to try to dry it,

276
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,434
so let's check back on that tomorrow.

277
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,438
If it doesn't dry,
I'll buy a new one for the library.

278
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,274
Please drink the water outside
if possible.

279
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,525
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,861
First, you sleep here without permission,

281
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,197
and now you damage books.
What a catastrophe.

282
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,866
-I'll clean it up.
-I'll find a rag.

283
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,992
Gosh.

284
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,379
Hey, where are you off to now?

285
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,798
Stop bothering me.

286
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,965
Goodness.

287
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,760
Are you not going to say hello
to your dad?

288
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,845
Whatever.

289
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,098
-That little…
-Come in.

290
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,016
This damn family.

291
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,852
I beg you. Please don't drink too much.

292
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,938
How does he keep that up every day?

293
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,735
Grandma, I'm hungry.

294
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,405
Ha-neul will be here soon.
Do you still want to eat first?

295
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,701
Dried pollack soup again?

296
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,286
I'm sick of it.

297
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,581
Stop making him stuff like that.

298
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,501
If he gets sick enough,
maybe he'll wake up and stop drinking.

299
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,585
Bom.

300
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,712
You shouldn't treat your dad like that.

301
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,677
Hold on. What's wrong with your hand?

302
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,971
I was just bringing your dad home.

303
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,682
I told you to leave him
so he can just die out there.

304
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,684
Goodness, do you hear what you're saying?

305
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,691
That reminds me.
This lady helped me bring your dad home.

306
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,443
Who was it?

307
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,988
I heard she just moved here.

308
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,243
Did she have long hair?

309
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,413
Yes. She had long hair,
and she was pretty.

310
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,956
Grandma!

311
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,084
I told you not to bring
strangers into the house.

312
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,378
-So annoying.
-All right.

313
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:32,921
NON-POSSESSION

314
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,089
WE'RE SORRY
THIS BOOK IS UNAVAILABLE

315
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,299
It's out of stock.

316
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,555
NON-POSSESSION

317
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,140
It's 65,000 won?

318
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,936
I know they don't make any more copies,
but this is too expensive.

319
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,899
That's my living expenses for a week.

320
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,154
Who are you?

321
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,823
Come here.

322
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,912
Where did you come from?

323
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,830
Why are you alone?

324
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,584
I'm going to get going.

325
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,796
Go on home.

326
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,593
You can't follow me around.

327
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,470
You should stay here.

328
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,892
Stop following me.

329
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,186
Stop! No!

330
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,314
Stop it!

331
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,927
Goodbye.

ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

333
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,370
Hello, you're here again.

334
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,498
Hello, you're here again.

335
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,460
Hello, you're here again.

336
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,880
Hello.

337
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,799
-You're hello again.
-Sorry?

338
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,051
Darn it.

339
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,636
Mr. Librarian. I was wondering…

340
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:32,059
What happened to the book from yesterday?

341
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,685
Oh, that.

342
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,741
It's frozen.

343
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,120
Why did you put the book in there?

344
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:59,711
That's because the paper is
made from cellulose.

345
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,422
You see, the covalent bonds of cellulose--

346
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,758
It's supposed to help restore it.

347
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,051
Fascinating, right?

348
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,385
I see.

349
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,514
What a relief.

350
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,182
Thank you so much.

351
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,017
Please be careful next time.

352
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,061
That being said…

353
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,022
-Could I buy you coffee?
-Really?

354
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,608
Great. I wanted to take a break.

355
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,526
Let's go.

356
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,486
I hope you didn't mean
vending machine coffee.

357
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,403
No.

358
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,869
Thank you for the coffee.

359
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,884
You guys can share them.

360
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,549
It's raining.

361
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,101
I almost forgot.

362
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,156
My laundry.

363
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,996
I'm fine.

364
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,006
What the heck?

365
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,811
Use this.

366
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,234
Thank you!

367
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,028
I'll give it back to you tomorrow!

368
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,338
What's going on?

369
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,839
It's nothing.

370
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,175
-Were you in the rain?
-No.

371
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,993
Doggy!

372
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,664
Where are you?

373
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,042
Did you go home?

374
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,670
Doggy!

375
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,172
Oh, my gosh!

376
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,508
What's he doing here?

377
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,094
Where are you?

378
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,804
Doggy.

379
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,266
Why are you there?

380
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,312
Hurry, come on out.

381
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,235
There.

382
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,865
Why are you injured?

383
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,244
Let's go home for now.

384
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,539
Hang in there.

385
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,552
ANGOK SUPERMARKET

386
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,680
VEGETABLES, GOODS, DRINKS

387
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,309
He must be out.

388
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,855
What could I get for you to eat?

389
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,023
Pastry?

390
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,525
Can you eat pastry?

391
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,779
Gosh, you were here.

392
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,655
I was looking for you.

393
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,075
Me? Why?

394
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,868
Well, you know…

395
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:45,163
Actually, come with me.

396
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,331
Quickly.

397
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,500
Is something wrong?

398
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,337
It's that wall.

399
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,049
You don't need to take it seriously.

400
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,051
I've contacted Mr. Bae,

401
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,928
so he'll be here in a moment.

402
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,680
Go inside for the time being.

403
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,184
No, that's okay.

404
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,813
Mr. Bae has a temper,

405
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,274
so it'd be better if you stay inside
and avoid him.

406
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,653
Go up and act like you're not home.

407
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,279
Don't turn on the lights either.

408
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,991
No, it's fine. I'll stay here.

409
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,578
You have no idea how bad his temper is.

410
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,706
When he sees this,
he'll throw a fit at you.

411
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,749
Just…

412
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,420
Just go inside. You can talk to him later.

413
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,548
It's fine. Head on in.

414
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:48,977
What the hell?

415
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,148
-Who the hell did this?
-Who made this mess?

416
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,402
Who the hell would do this
to someone else's building?

417
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,780
Dad, keep your voice down.
You don't have to tell the whole town.

418
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,198
What do you mean?

419
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,408
Damn it.

420
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,954
Where did the lady inside go?

421
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,290
I don't think she's home yet.

422
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,501
-The lights are off.
-That girl.

423
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,713
I let her pay only 50,000 won a month
to take care of the building.

424
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,507
But I hear she wanders around town,
drinking every day.

425
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,302
That's why people did this!

426
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,388
Didn't I tell you that we shouldn't
rent out this place to her?

427
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,682
Do you think it makes sense
to live alone here

428
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,601
unless she gave up on her life?

429
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,061
Stop it, guys.

430
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,564
Nothing like this ever happened
when she wasn't here.

431
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,025
As soon as she comes, this happens.

432
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,486
Dad.

433
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,156
Let's give her back the money
and kick her out.

434
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,825
And let's sell the building to Chang-su.

435
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,951
Shut your trap!

436
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,621
Gosh, let's just leave now.

437
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,291
Just what are you good for?
What a useless son.

438
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,668
Erase it immediately
before anyone else sees it.

439
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,296
-Fine, I will. Just go home.
-Let's go.

440
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,634
When this lady comes home,
tell her to behave herself in town.

441
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,302
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

442
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,513
Such a big nuisance came into town.

443
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,436
Gosh, you startled me.

444
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,439
You were inside?

445
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,359
-Give it here. I'll do it.
-No, it's fine.

446
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,612
I'm almost done anyway.

447
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,370
You read the wall, right?

448
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,541
Don't think of staying here long.

449
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,334
It'd be better if you'd leave.

450
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,295
Don't ever talk about what happened today.

451
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,802
I didn't live a nasty life.

452
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,513
What?

453
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,308
I've never caused harm to people here

454
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,020
and I didn't move here
because I've given up on life.

455
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,189
I mean…

456
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,319
I didn't mean that you lived a nasty life.

457
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:07,115
But you blamed me
for this graffiti on the wall…

458
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,161
What I meant was…

459
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,582
The graffiti wasn't your fault.

460
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,129
I was only saying that a girl
shouldn't be living

461
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,631
in such a run-down place.

462
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,597
Anyway, think again carefully.

463
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:43,818
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

464
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,909
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

465
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,169
Don't use your power yet.

466
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,712
There you go.

467
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,216
Hey, Bom.

468
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,428
The library is closed, right?

469
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,598
They both went to Seoul
for Ji-yeong's test.

470
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,099
I never asked.

471
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,103
Seriously? I'm about to feel offended.

472
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,065
I picked out the right person for the job.
You are doing it, right?

473
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,653
I don't want to do it anymore.

474
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,156
Why not? All of a sudden?

475
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:35,745
Bom, with you making trouble,
Yeo-reum will be running out of here.

476
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,623
Her name is Yeo-reum?

477
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:42,460
Yes. Lee Yeo-reum? Kim Yeo-reum?
I can't seem to remember.

478
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,296
I don't care.
Anyway, I gave you back the money, okay?

479
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,006
Hey, Bom!

480
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,092
Mr. Bae.

481
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,679
Stop touching your feet
and do some growing up already!

482
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,597
You're so immature.

483
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,809
That little brat.

484
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:03,064
PUBLIC SERVANT
WRITTEN EXAMINATION CENTER

485
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,226
Did you do well?

486
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,605
I blew it.

487
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,482
I totally blew it.

488
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,155
I had no idea I could blow it this badly.

489
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,824
I'm in disbelief even as I'm saying this.

490
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,951
See? Those people are laughing.

491
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,078
I bet they're laughing
for a different reason.

492
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,789
I'm so damn jealous.

493
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,916
You did your best.

494
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,252
That's what pisses me off.

495
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,713
Why do I always fail
even though I'm trying?

496
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,720
What are you eating by yourself?

497
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,432
I'm so hungry.

498
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,768
Let's go eat.

499
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,270
I've been too nervous
to eat anything since yesterday.

500
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,646
What do you want to eat?

501
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,610
I looked up a restaurant,
and I heard it's really good.

502
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,862
-Shall we go there?
-Sure.

503
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,871
Lady.

504
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,165
Hello.

505
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,126
What do you think you are doing?

506
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,254
Where did you find this dog?

507
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,007
Well…

508
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,302
You're the one who took him, right?

509
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,765
He was shivering in the rain, so…

510
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,309
Do you see the collar or not?

511
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,270
-Sorry?
-The collar.

512
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,065
Do you see it or not?

513
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,196
-Are you his owner?
-Of course, I am.

514
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,448
Then why else would I be here?

515
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,826
How dare you steal someone else's dog?

516
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,245
I didn't steal him.
I just took him in for a night.

517
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,913
It doesn't matter how many nights.

518
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,706
If you took him, it's stealing.

519
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,626
Did you not think about the owner?

520
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,798
I'm sorry for making you worry.

521
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,133
Goodness.

522
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,594
Just look at that getup.

523
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,763
Sorry?

524
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,181
Never mind, what's the point?

525
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,393
Come here.

526
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,353
I said come here.

527
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,563
You brat. You come here.

528
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,064
Are you really the owner?

529
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,650
I am the owner.
Why would I be doing this if I wasn't?

530
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,110
Come here.

531
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,778
-I said come here.
-Don't do that!

532
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,239
You're hurting him!

533
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,159
I'm grabbing my own dog!
What's your problem?

534
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,243
Move!

535
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,703
-Come!
-Stop!

536
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,329
-Come on.
-You're hurting him!

537
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,082
-You shouldn't treat him like that.
-Why do you care?

538
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,792
-Come!
-Stop.

539
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,669
-You come here.
-No.

540
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,337
Stop it.

541
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,923
What do you think you're doing?

542
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:16,966
Give him to me.

543
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,218
Just sell him to me.

544
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,678
I'll take him home.

545
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,972
What? Sell him to you?

546
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,974
Goodness.

547
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,892
All right, then.

548
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,144
How much will you pay?

549
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,479
How much do you want?

550
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,233
Give me 300,000 won.

551
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,443
What?

552
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,862
What? You don't want to?

553
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,532
Then give him back.

554
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,993
No. I'll give you the money.

555
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,581
Please wait here for a moment.

556
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,002
Leave the dog here.

557
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,795
Do you take me for a fool?

558
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,594
I'll be right back.

559
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,013
Come here.

560
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,598
Where do you think you're going?

561
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,443
Please select the amount
you want to withdraw.

562
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,196
There have been fraud cases…

563
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,955
Are you sure about this place?

564
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:32,959
Dae-bum.

565
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,336
You know I really like you, right?

566
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,004
Yes.

567
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,882
Let's go.

568
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,599
Hello, I'm Cho Ji-yeong.

569
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,725
Hello.

570
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,480
Hey, Ahn Dae-bum.

571
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,856
It's been a while.

572
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,149
Hey, Dae-bum.

573
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,567
You look great.

574
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,031
You'll have to excuse me, Professor.

575
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:05,950
Dae-bum.

576
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,827
Dae-bum. Hey.

577
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,675
Here you go, 300,000 won.

578
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,469
I can take him now, right?

579
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,473
Consider yourself lucky
that I'm leaving it at this.

580
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,643
We've lost so much thanks to you
moving into that building.

581
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,188
You should be thanking me for
letting this slide with just 300,000 won.

582
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,232
What are you talking about?

583
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,819
I don't know what you were up to
or where you came from,

584
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,613
but not a soul in this town likes you.

585
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,407
So behave yourself.

586
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,909
-Don't drag our town through the dirt.
-Hey.

587
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,454
Aren't you being too harsh?

588
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,248
I've seen you pay dog traders 10,000 won

589
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,459
for them to take these dogs
off your hands.

590
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,419
How can you take 300,000 won from her?

591
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,130
Why are you butting in?

592
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,632
Whatever. Just give her back the money.

593
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,469
Why do you care?

594
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,971
Why do you care
if I take 300,000 won or 400,000 won?

595
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,681
I don't care.

596
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,975
I'm just worried you might make her think

597
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,935
that everyone in our town is a fraud.

598
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,605
What? A fraud?

599
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,191
My goodness.

600
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,194
You're just like
that drunkard father of yours.

601
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,280
Look how disrespectful
you are to your elders.

602
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,032
What did you just say?

603
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,494
How about I show you
what a drunkard's daughter can do?

604
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,788
You little punk. How dare you?

605
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,167
You can have this money back.

606
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,336
You sold this dog to me.

607
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,089
I'm not selling him. I won't!

608
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,216
-Give him back.
-No.

609
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,676
-Give him back to me!
-You sold him though.

610
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,178
Let me take him!

611
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,514
I'll raise him well.

612
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,723
Really?

613
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,935
Then give me 150,000 won more.

614
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,354
What did you say?

615
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:02,650
Since she's accusing me of being a fraud,

616
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,318
I want to get paid more.

617
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,362
Hey, just don't buy him.

618
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,823
You can find dogs like these
anywhere in this town.

619
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,538
Please wait here a moment then.

620
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,790
Hey, stop.

621
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,503
Hey, aren't you stepping over the line?

622
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,088
Seriously? 450,000 won?

623
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,798
You stay out of this.

624
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,508
What do you mean, "stay out"?

625
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,343
Are you that desperate for money?

626
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,095
You've got to be out of your mind!

627
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:35,683
You should learn how to treat your elders
before going to school.

628
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,892
Get lost!

629
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,688
I'll charge her more if you don't go.

630
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,191
Damn you!

631
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,362
That insolent little brat.

632
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,000
Hey, Dae-bum.
I'd rather have you yell at me.

633
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,044
You're driving me nuts.

634
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,921
Professor Lee called me a few days ago

635
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,466
and begged me
to arrange a meeting with you.

636
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,093
To be frank, I don't understand
why you're like this.

637
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,261
What's wrong with you?

638
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,680
People dream of working in those places.

639
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,684
But I'm happy where I am.

640
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,813
What's good about
working part-time at a library?

641
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,650
And you've gotten better too.

642
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,989
All right. Fine. I'm sorry.

643
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:36,452
If I have to arrange another meeting,
I'll discuss it with you.

644
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,703
But,

645
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,873
don't just refuse.
Give it some serious thought.

646
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,335
Gosh.

647
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,215
I'm just sad because
the Japanese restaurant was wasted.

648
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,175
I heard the food is really good there.

649
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,309
This is the thesis you wrote before.

650
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,019
It's from Professor Lee.

651
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,146
I'll leave it here.

652
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,190
Hey, don't get mad at me.

653
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,235
Don't.

654
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,177
I'm sorry.

655
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,846
To be honest,

656
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,225
I hesitated

657
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,686
when I was withdrawing the money.

658
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,189
I'm sorry.

659
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,659
Hello?

660
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,953
Hey, Yeo-reum. Are you doing okay?

661
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,414
Hey, is something wrong?

662
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:04,999
Hey.

663
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,710
Can't an older brother call his sister
to check on her?

664
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,878
All right. Just wait.

665
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,548
-Is your wife next to you?
-What?

666
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,300
Yes.

667
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,511
The thing is, Yeo-reum…

668
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,151
You took Mom's house and her money.

669
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,196
That ring is all I have left of Mom.

670
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,906
I know.

671
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,492
But you know Gyu-beom…

672
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,372
All of his friends are
studying abroad every vacation,

673
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,249
but Gyu-beom never went.

674
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,335
Tell her he's going to the Philippines.

675
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,795
I got it.
Can't you see I'm talking to her?

676
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,258
Is this your wife's idea?

677
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,636
Does she want to sell
Mom's ring for the trip?

678
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,221
That's not it. Yeo-reum.

679
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,684
Don't you also feel bad
that your nephew is losing confidence

680
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,979
because he's never been abroad before?

681
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,731
Hey.

682
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,359
Do you even…

683
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,071
know how I'm living right now?

684
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,739
I know.

685
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,948
I do, but…

686
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,160
My family is short on money right now.

687
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,287
Am I not family?

688
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:45,117
So what on earth is it
that you're talking about?

689
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,785
Tell me.

690
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,663
Physics is an area of study.

691
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,832
The fact that it's named "entropy"

692
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,043
doesn't mean it has
the same physical quantity.

693
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,712
What the…

694
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,465
I did it correctly.

695
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,675
I solved it correctly.

696
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,261
I solved it correctly.

697
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,569
Why do you show up in front of me

698
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,072
Whenever I'm drunk…

699
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,199
Gosh, your money. Hey!

700
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,784
The liquor drank you last night.

701
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,826
Zero?

702
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,036
She lost all her money?

703
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,872
Someone must have taken it.
It's money in a plastic bag.

704
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,082
Damn it!

705
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,167
That long-haired guy is Dae-bum.

706
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,795
I should have taken you
back to your home safely.

707
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,088
Who is it?

708
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,007
Did you just not care
since it's not your problem?

709
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,050
I'm sorry.

710
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,261
The way I see it,
she'll never find that money.

711
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,931
