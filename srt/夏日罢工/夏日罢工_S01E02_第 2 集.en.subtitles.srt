00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,788
All right. I'll live here.

9
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,383
Excuse me.

10
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,852
Excuse me, Miss.

11
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,693
Where's the real estate agency
around here?

12
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,370
I'm sorry.

13
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,123
I'm sorry.

14
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,719
Hey.

15
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,388
-Hey, pass it here!
-No!

16
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,767
-You over there!
-Hey!

17
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,728
-Old lady with the bag! Pass the ball!
-Pass it!

18
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,479
-Over here!
-The ball!

19
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,439
Me?

20
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,065
-You're the only one there.
-Hurry up.

21
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,775
-Roll the ball over here.
-Roll it.

22
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,901
Hurry up.

23
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,236
-Give us our ball.
-Hey.

24
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,572
-Hurry.
-I'm not an old lady!

25
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,834
-Hey, Dae-bum!
-Dae-bum!

26
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,002
Hey!

27
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,337
-Dae-bum, look at me.
-Are you okay?

28
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,464
-Is your head okay?
-Are you okay?

29
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,840
-Are you okay?
-Look at me!

30
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,258
-Look at his face.
-Goodness.

31
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,302
-I'm so sorry.
-Dae-bum!

-Oh, no.

00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,221
-Hey!
-Do you want to die?

34
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,931
-How can you do this to Dae-bum?
-What is this?

35
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:49,932
-Go away!
-You're dead meat.

36
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,185
-How dare you?
-Go away!

37
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,895
-I'm sorry.
-Get out of here!

38
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,396
-I'm so sorry.
-Go away!

39
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,856

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,044
I told you it's fine.

My back!

Goodness.

50
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,724
Wait.

51
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,392
My back.

52
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,853
-Massage my back.
-You're on my legs, man.

53
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,231
Excuse me.

54
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,152
Do you sell superglue?

55
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,279
Check where the paintbrushes are.

56
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,657
Goodness. Are you okay?

57
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,951
You should be more careful.

58
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,869
This hurts so bad.

59
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,247
It's been so long since I've done that.

60
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,373
Man, my back.

61
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,752
I went a little overboard.

62
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,647
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

63
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,359
The glue is 2,000 won.

64
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,778
-Actually…
-What is it?

65
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,363
Where are you going, Bom?

66
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,574
I'm leaving because all your stuff sucks.

67
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,284
That brat.

68
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,578
Why does she come here
if she's not buying anything?

69
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,455
Like I said, this is 2,000 won.

70
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,789
Okay.

71
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,959
Is your back okay?

72
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,544
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

73
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,629
Goodbye.

74
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,966
-Have a good day.
-Sure.

75
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,221
Busted.

76
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:53,848
Come over here.

77
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,028
-Pass it over here!
-Hey.

78
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,113
Go hang out somewhere else, you punks!

79
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,741
You're dead meat if you hit my car.

80
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,326
Get out of here!

81
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,536
Darn it.

82
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,127
There's no one here, right?

83
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,018
Just how much longer
do I have to stay here in Angok?

84
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,897
Why won't they transfer me out of here?

85
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,483
They screwed me over again, Dae-bum.

86
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,401
I won't make it into
the district office this time either.

87
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm so irritated.

88
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,366
Why are they doing this to me?

89
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,329
I want to go to Seoul.

90
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,915
I hate Angok!

91
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,299
Whatever.

92
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,343
I'm so sick of this place.

93
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,346
I only bought the superglue.

94
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,225
We'll see about that
when I empty out your bag.

95
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,268
What's this?

96
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,145
Who carries their blanket around?

97
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,982
What are you, a traveler?

98
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
What's this?

99
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,822
-What about this?
-That's…

100
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,116
-Seong-man.
-Yes?

101
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,784
Pockets.

102
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,952
Check her pockets.

103
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,790
Miss, let me see…

104
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,626
-Let me see your…
-What are you doing?

105
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,420
Let me see your pockets.

106
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,300
There's nothing in here.

107
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,179
This is strange.

108
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,308
I paid a fortune for that alarm.

109
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,479
What's this?

110
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,985
Are you kidding me?

111
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,112
Why would you stick this on there?

112
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,656
I didn't put it on there.

113
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,034
A 4B pencil?

114
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,703
Do we have 4B pencils?

115
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,458
Why would you doubt your customer?

117
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,092
Young people these days are so creative.

118
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,596
They often renovate places like this.

119
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,098
The owner is an old lady…

120
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,183
Goodness, be careful.

121
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,018
Does the electricity work?

122
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,312
-Well… What is this?
-Goodness.

123
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,151
How much is the rent here?

124
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,696
It's 500,000 won a month,
but I can negotiate.

125
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,406
The deposit is 20 million won.

126
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,246
The rent is 200,000 won
with a deposit of 2 million won.

127
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,957
But I can get the rent down
to 170,000 won.

128
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,584
I see.

129
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,628
You said the bathroom was outside, right?

130
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,546
The communal bathroom is down here…

131
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,468
What the hell is he scratching?
Did he just smell his hand?

132
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,347
I'm sorry,

133
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,557
but I can't let you live here.

135
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,525
What a shame.

136
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,657
Excuse me.

137
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,411
This is my wife's idea,

138
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,329
but would you be willing
to see one more place?

139
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,123
Where is it?

140
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,041
It's a bit difficult to describe it.

141
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,876
-Let's go see it for ourselves.
-Okay.

142
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,175
It's this building.

143
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,554
-This isn't a house.
-What?

144
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,264
No, it isn't.

145
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,225
It's not even locked.

146
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,938
-Let's head inside.
-Okay.

147
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,274
Over this way.

148
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,694
Goodness.

149
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,489
Let's see.

150
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,658
Come in this way.

151
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:28,456
This place used to be
the largest billiard club in the town.

152
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,040
It's so spacious.

153
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,334
You could even play soccer here.

154
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,132
When they were building this place,
they used absurd amounts of cement,

155
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,009
so the building is extremely sturdy.

156
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,093
It'll never collapse.

157
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,513
Right, the rooftop.

158
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,057
Try going up to the rooftop
on a sunny day.

159
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,767
The sunlight is so warm

160
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,103
that your laundry dries nice and crisp.

161
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,149
That's not all.

162
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,988
You can use this whole building.

163
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,742
The entire building?

164
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,702
That's right.

165
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,915
So no one lives here?

166
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,627
Well, so to speak.

167
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,339
I guess it's not the best place
for a young lady.

168
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,889
How much is the rent?

169
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,642
Rent? Do you like it?

170
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,061
My wife was right.

171
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,063
I knew you were a unique one.

172
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,107
In that case, I'll go make an arrangement

173
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,485
with the landowner about the rent.

174
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,654
So please stay here for a second, okay?

175
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,864
Sir.

176
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,122
-Hey.
-Hey.

177
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,208
-I'm here.
-Welcome.

178
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,879
I have something to discuss with you.

179
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,258
Goodness. You shouldn't have.

180
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,426
Gosh.

181
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,263
-What is it?
-So…

182
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:13,143
I showed a few houses
to a young lady from Seoul today,

183
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,397
and suddenly, you crossed my mind.

184
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,899
Why me?

185
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,068
Well…

186
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,905
What if I showed her that place?

187
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,740
What place?

188
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,160
The first floor isn't great.
So the one above, the billiard club.

189
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,038
I already told Chang-su
that I'd sell it to him.

190
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,208
Plus, the place isn't for housing.

191
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,463
Did she seem like a decent person?

192
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,883
Yes, she seemed very honest.

193
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,846
But still, if she hears rumors
about the place later…

194
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,221
Towns like Yangyang became popular
after young people moved in.

195
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,100
You know how much the rents
and real estate prices went up by.

196
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,351
You little brat.

197
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,728
Why weren't you working at the store?

198
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,606
I was at Chang-su's for a bit.

199
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,316
What brings you here, Mr. Kwak?

200
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,945
I just had something to discuss with him.

201
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,321
ALTTEUL STORE

202
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,614
Seong-man.

203
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,534
I don't think I can sell
that building to Chang-su.

204
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,577
What?

205
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,581
Dad, are you losing it with your old age?

206
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,043
I just talked Chang-su
into buying the building.

207
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,714
He has the down payment ready
to sign the contract this week.

208
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,925
Just like you said,
we haven't signed the contract yet.

209
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,386
I changed my mind.
He'll just have to deal with it.

210
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,014
That's right.
The contract is what legally--

211
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,432
Come on, man!

212
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,268
According to Mr. Kwak over here,

213
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,812
we'd be at a huge loss
selling it for that price.

214
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,980
For goodness' sake.

215
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:03,897
Dad.

216
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,775
Do you know how many years
that place has been left empty for?

217
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,612
Whatever. Go with Mr. Kwak right now.

218
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,780
What? Where?

219
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,158
Go to the billiard club
and sign the contract.

220
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,078
I need to go into town
to get a new refrigerator.

221
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,830
-What the…
-See you later.

222
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,291
-See you.
-What contract, Dad?

223
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,258
-Who is it?
-Goodness!

224
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,801
Who are you?

225
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,344
-Mr. Kwak?
-Honey.

226
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,805
-Honey, what's wrong?
-Look over there.

227
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,807
Oh, my!

228
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,101
Who are you?

229
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,270
I came to look at the house.

230
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,730
Who are you?

231
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,066
-What?
-You're here to look at the house?

232
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,609
Chang-su!

233
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,527
-Chang-su!
-Seriously?

234
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,488
-What?
-Hey, Seong-man!

235
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,699
You said we can come and take measurements

236
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,077
and you rented it out to someone else?

237
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,787
That's not it.

238
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,123
I just found out as well.
Let's go outside and talk.

239
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,209
We can talk right here.

240
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,586
-We have a guest here, so…
-A guest?

241
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,630
Hey, don't worry about it.

242
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,881
-Let's go outside.
-Hey.

243
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,508
-Let's go outside and talk.
-You…

244
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,343
You little brat.

245
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,845
Trust me this once.

246
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,389
Do you know how many times you lied to us?

247
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,183
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

248
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,268
You must have been startled.

249
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,022
Let's go somewhere brighter
since there are no lights in here.

250
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,775
What's with all the yelling?

251
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:30,901
Let's go, come on.

252
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,653
Don't push me!

253
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,904
You should read the room.

254
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,198
Don't push me. I can walk on my own.

255
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,741
Who's that lady?

256
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,577
What do you mean she's a guest?

257
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,997
Is your dad selling her the place
for more money?

258
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,584
She's looking to rent the place.

259
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,837
It makes no sense,
so don't even worry about it.

260
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,091
But why would you rent this place out
without our approval?

261
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,510
Do you think that makes sense?

262
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,263
I've never rented this place out.
I don't even want to.

263
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,599
This is all my father's doing.

264
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,767
That's why I said…

265
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,227
Why are they yelling?

266
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,980
All right. If that happens,
I won't hold back either.

267
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,482
Go back to the store
with your wife, Chang-su.

268
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,569
I'll wrap up the situation here
and get back to you.

269
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,530
Seong-man. Do better, okay?

270
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,533
Of course. I'm Bae Seong-min!

271
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,701
What a joke.

272
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,619
You can go in now. Bye.

273
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,414
-For the love of…
-Come on now.

274
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,457
-You won't break it like that.
-See you.

275
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,712
Did I do something wrong, by any chance?

276
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,214
Not at all.

277
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,009
There must have been
some kind of misunderstanding.

278
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,595
No need to concern yourself over it.

279
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,472
Mr. Kwak!

280
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,060
How did you butter up my dad this time?

281
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,439
Come on, we have a guest here.

282
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,150
This is the landlord's son.

283
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,986
Aren't you from Altteul Store?

284
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,362
Lady.

285
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,824
I was an athlete,
so I hate beating around the bush.

286
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,162
Do you even know
what kind of place this is?

287
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,788
-Stop talking.
-Do you?

288
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,209
This place has been vacant for 20 years.
Why do you think that is?

289
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,002
Twenty years?

290
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:12,961
Come here.

291
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,507
Are you going to be like this?
Your dad already agreed on this.

292
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,884
You said she'll be a tenant.

293
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,219
What is it?

294
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,637
It's nothing.

295
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,931
What do you mean it's nothing?

296
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,058
People died here.

297
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,392
What?

298
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,895
Can you live in a place
where people died? I couldn't.

299
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,980
Are you really going to be like this?

300
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,442
Of course, this is your decision to make,

301
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,070
but nothing happened after that incident.

302
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,279
Mr. Kwak.

303
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,825
Look at her face.
She's totally freaked out.

304
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,203
Let's not talk here in the dark.

305
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,038
Let's talk outside.
There are ghosts in here.

306
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,373
-Let's go.
-You little…

307
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,167
If you keep this up,
I'm going to tell your dad.

308
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,585
Go ahead.

309
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,672
And you have issues too, Mr. Kwak.

310
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,925
Why did you bring her here
when there are perfectly fine houses?

311
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,261
-Are you trying to scam her?
-Miss.

312
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,679
It's 50,000 won.

313
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,389
-Sorry?
-What?

314
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,350
I'll rent it out to you for 50,000 won.

315
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,476
What did you say?

316
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,602
It's 50,000 won?

317
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,814
Why else would I show you
this good-for-nothing property?

318
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,149
Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Kwak.

319
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,860
The landlord agreed
to rent the place out to you

320
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,363
for 50,000 won a month under the condition

321
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,323
that you maintain this place.

322
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,368
So my dad agreed
to rent this place out for 50,000 won?

323
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,869
That's right!

324
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,371
-He did.
-Fine. I'll call him.

325
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,789
Lady, think rationally.

326
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,541
That's 50,000 per month.

327
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,210
If I live here for 12 months,

328
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,212
it'll be 600,000 won.

329
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,132
So what do you want to do?

330
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,137
I'll take it.

331
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,388
What did you say?

332
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,432
You've made a great decision.

333
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,227
-Hello? Dad, I'm at the building.
-Let me pray for you.

334
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,021
-Dear heavenly Father,
-He says the rent is 50,000 won.

335
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,856
This sister has found a new home

336
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,399
-in this building.
-He's right?

337
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,860
-Please bless her with your grace.
-Dad!

338
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,695
-Dad!
-Amen.

339
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,322
This is driving me nuts.

340
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,866
Seong-man! Let's go.

341
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,577
Wait a second.

342
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,871
Have you seen the bathroom here?

343
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,374
Your poop won't flush.
You can't even shower there.

344
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,626
How can you live in this horrible place?

345
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,628
Give it another thought.

346
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,215
LANDLORD: BAE YEONG-HO
TENANT: LEE YEO-REUM

347
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,302
I'm glad you liked the place.

348
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,344
I did.

349
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,680
-Come on.
-In that case,

350
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,183
-you can wire 600,000 won at once.
-Okay.

351
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,396
I transferred it.

352
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,939
Check your account.

353
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,819
What about the commission?

354
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,030
I don't need any. It's fine.

355
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,824
We just want you to be well.

356
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,701
Thank you so much.

357
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:57,501
Would it be okay if I moved in today?

358
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,835
Today?

359
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,797
But the place doesn't
even have any lights.

360
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,048
It's fine.

361
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,384
The contract is valid starting today, so…

362
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,221
You're so obnoxious.

363
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,140
-Darn it.
-Seong-min.

364
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,935
You have to give her the keys.

365
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,982
Here you go, ma'am.

366
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,776
-Okay?
-Honey.

367
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,778
Can you bring out that thing I mentioned?

368
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,321
Right. Sure.

369
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,616
There are no lights in there.

370
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,284
Thank you.

371
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,328
-Enjoy your new home.
-Thank you.

372
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,123
-He's such a brat.
-Goodbye.

373
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,458
-Good night.
-Goodbye.

374
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,881
Excuse me.

375
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,970
Thank you for telling me the truth
about the place.

376
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,266
I would have freaked out
if I found out later.

377
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,353
Whatever.

378
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:02,357
If anything breaks,
you can take care of it yourself.

379
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,985
You can always leave
when you can't take it anymore.

380
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,278
Got it?

381
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,488
Okay.

382
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,336
I have a home now.

383
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,265
MY FIRST DAY IN ANGOK

384
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,268
After I quit my job without a plan,

385
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,272
I stayed in bed for two days.

386
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,025
I was afraid.

387
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,614
I had no idea what to do next.

388
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,498
First, I decided to leave Seoul.

389
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,294
Seoul is too much
for an unemployed person like me.

390
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:05,522
I got rid of Jae-dong's belongings
that I'd been neglecting.

391
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,321
And as for my belongings,

392
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,782
I decided to only keep
what could fit in my backpack.

393
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,872
Cleaning up the house,
I realized that I bought a lot of things.

394
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,750
Mugs that I bought on a whim
just because they were pretty,

395
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,379
dishes that I used only once
to host a housewarming party…

396
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,344
clothes that I forgot existed,

397
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,598
cheap shoes I bought out of habit…

398
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,271
I picked out one from each category
that seemed necessary.

399
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,442
The selection process was more difficult
than my job interviews.

400
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,739
Useless items got sold
as soon as I posted them online.

401
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,495
Goodbye.

402
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,498
My six pyeong life.

403
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,051
I want to find an answer

404
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,762
before this journey ends.

405
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,476
As to how I should live my life
from now on.

406
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,660
ALARM

407
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,371
YOU HAVE NO ALARMS

408
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,346
The sky looks amazing from here.

409
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,280
Welcome.

410
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,201
Hello.

411
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,247
How can I help you?

412
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,042
How do I make a library card here?

413
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,963
You need an address in Angok for that.

414
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,423
I do have one.

415
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,757
Did you move here?

416
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:38,800
Yes.

417
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,969
He'll help you make one.

418
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,064
By the way…

419
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,985
Is your head okay from yesterday?

420
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,490
I'm sorry.

421
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,912
And thank you so much for the map.

422
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,003
What's she talking about? What map?

423
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,337
A map?

424
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,516
Here you go.

425
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,479
Isn't this the billiard club?

426
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,149
You live there?

427
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,110
-Yes.
-Right.

428
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,825
Thank you.

429
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,622
LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP CARD
LEE YEO-REUM

430
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,127
What's with her?

431
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,545
How could anyone live there?

432
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,842
Hey.

433
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,545
Excuse me.

434
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,713
Your bag is over there.

435
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,131
Actually…

436
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:46,928
Look.

437
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:50,014
This is my seat.
So don't sit here again, okay?

438
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,434
Kim Bom. Keep your voice down.

439
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,770
Why is she always picking on me?

440
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,283
Excuse me.

441
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,341
Hello?

442
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,012
Can you come outside the library
for a second?

443
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,056
-Who are you?
-You'll see when you come out.

444
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,309
Who are you to tell me…

445
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,936
Hello?

446
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,188
Hey, Kim Bom.

447
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,357
Are you serious? Take the call outside.

448
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,568
Whatever.

449
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,209
What do you want?

450
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,338
I think our phones got mixed up.

451
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,464
Sorry?

452
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,758
Here.

453
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,514
You must have confused them
because neither of us use a case.

454
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,810
Grandmother, I assume?

455
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,896
Do you mean me?

456
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,106
Can't you tell I'm in high school?

457
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,818
I mean the wallpaper on your phone.

458
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,740
Why are you looking through my phone?

459
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,617
I'm sorry.

460
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,077
Mind your own business.

461
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,829
Excuse me.

462
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,375
What now?

463
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,796
It's nothing.

464
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,847
Whatever. Time to go eat.

465
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,435
Here's your food. Enjoy.

466
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,189
-Where were you? You came late.
-He was busy.

467
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,691
-Goodness.
-Hey.

468
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,192
What would you like to order?

469
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,404
Hello.

470
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,156
What do you want?

471
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,159
Can I get a bowl of sundaeguk?

472
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,162
-One sundaeguk!
-Okay.

473
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,624
-Order's up.
-I'm coming!

474
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,130
Enjoy.

475
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,227
Can we get another bottle of soju?

476
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,937
Okay!

477
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,522
-Just one more.
-Gosh.

478
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,774
-Should you be drinking this much?
-It's fine.

479
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,443
Take a shot.

480
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,863
-You should drink in moderation.
-It's fine.

481
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,657
-I need the drink.
-The meat is delicious.

482
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:59,120
All right, I'll live however I want here.
No more walking on eggshells.

483
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,039
-The meat's really good, right?
-Ma'am.

484
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,749
It's amazing.

485
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,959
-I know, right?
-Ma'am.

486
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,127
Cheers!

487
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,463
Can I get a bottle of soju?

488
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,798
Make sure you don't drive, okay?

489
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,341
I got you.

490
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,177
I didn't even drink that much.

491
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,054
But it looks like you did.

492
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,347
No. I'm sober.

493
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,522
This feels amazing.

494
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,317
Hot food and a cold drink.

495
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,569
Who came up with this?

496
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,030
This is a grown-up's meal.

497
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,868
JEIL RESTAURANT

498
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,663
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

499
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,249
Okay, I'll put it on your tabs.

500
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,416
See you.

501
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,710
Gosh.

502
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,100
How can you not finish your fish cakes?

503
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,817
So obnoxious.

504
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,538
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

505
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,694
Gosh, my head.

506
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,547
How did I end up here?

507
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,011
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

508
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,555
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure.

509
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,185
10 HOURS AGO

510
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,604
Look how much she drank
so early in the day.

511
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,320
Steal it.

512
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,367
So close.

513
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,579
Let's play again.

514
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,498
-Where are you going?
-Dae-bum.

515
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,750
What are you doing?

516
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,169
Come back, Dae-bum.

517
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,867
-Come on!
-Let's go!

518
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,411
Try imitating her.

519
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,746
Should I do it?

520
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,333
-Hey, look at this.
-Let's play!

521
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,463
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Be quiet!

522
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,173
Oh, whatever.

523
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,092
-He's here!
-He's here!

524
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,678
-I got you!
-What is that?

525
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,471
Is she drunk?

526
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,598
-She's lying down.
-She fell.

527
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,808
She fell.

528
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,269
-What is this?
-Look.

529
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,354
-Hey, it's like a snake!
-The alcohol must have

530
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,024
-gotten to her hair.
-It must have!

531
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,191
Excuse me.

532
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,985
What do you think you're doing?

533
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,612
-That's Medusa, not a snake.
-Right, Medusa.

534
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,865
-The alcohol must have gotten to her hair.
-Is she out of her mind?

535
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,658
I think she might be.

536
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,744
Oh, I'm at the library.

537
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,579
-What's wrong with her?
-Hey.

538
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,414
-It's because she's drunk.
-Why is she at the library?

539
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,166
-I know.
-I have to go home.

540
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,669
-She's moving!
-Move aside now.

541
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,130
You shouldn't be coming here drunk.

542
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,299
I'm sorry.

543
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,425
I accept your apology.

544
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,429
-Push her down more!
-Come on, kids. Move now.

545
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,431
-Let's go!
-Come on!

546
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,390
ARCHIVES

547
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,017
Don't go in there!

548
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,144
-Let's go!
-Not in there!

549
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,520
Hey, Dae-bum!

550
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,814
I have to go home.

551
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,692
I have to go home.

552
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,319
-Guys, come here!
-What's this?

553
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,280
I must be out of my mind.

554
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,241
I should go home now.

555
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,746
What's this?

556
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,461
Gosh, what time is it?

557
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,548
It's 3 a.m.?

558
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,350
Excuse me!

559
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,188
I'm still in the library!
Please open the door!

560
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,482
Please. What do I do?

561
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,111
My phone.

562
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,289
Don't come near me.

563
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,376
Stop! Don't come near me!

564
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,924
Mr. Librarian?

565
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,766
Thank you.

566
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:55,077
But why are you here this late?

567
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,540
Did you stay because of me?

568
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,168
I'm so sorry.

569
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,428
You must be sober now.

570
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:16,765
The power will be back up
at eight in the morning,

571
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,267
and the door opens.

572
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,520
Feel free to rest
wherever you want until then.

573
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,484
I see. He must be mute.

574
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,403
But…

575
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,032
why didn't you wake me up?

576
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,913
I'll be going, Dae-bum.

577
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,664
Wrap up and go home, okay?

578
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,832
See you.

579
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,042
7 HOURS AGO

580
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,420
Bye.

581
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,035
I guess you tried to wake me up.

582
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,539
You should get some sleep.

583
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,104
If you want to do some reading,

584
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,024
go to the very right side of the windows.

585
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,151
It's the brightest there.

586
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,071
Thank you.

587
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,965
This…

588
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,847
Excuse me.

589
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,600
Are you in here?

590
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:12,983
Mr. Librarian.

591
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,278
Mr. Librarian.

592
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,032
I think you can stop rolling away.

593
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,498
I just wanted to return this to you.

594
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,712
But I guess…

595
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:42,262
I'll use it for the night
and give it back to you in the morning.

596
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,102
Have a good night.

597
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,107
Also…

598
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,486
Where is the bathroom?

599
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,874
The bathroom is outside.

600
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,880
Why did he give me water
when the bathroom is outside?

601
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,467
He didn't drink any.
I'm the only one who drank.

602
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,887
No. I shouldn't think about it.

603
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,390
Just don't think about
wanting to go to the bathroom.

604
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,225
Darn it.

605
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,052
It's almost time.

606
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,972
Almost time.

607
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,559
Hold it a little bit more.

608
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,608
A little bit more.

609
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,445
Please.

610
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,084
I can't let my guard down
at the last minute.

611
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,337
I must not run.

612
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,173
Once it starts coming out,
I won't be able to…

613
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,351
Goodbye.

614
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:55,831
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

615
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,150
My goodness.

616
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,819
-What's happening?
-Excuse me.

617
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,488
What is he doing?

618
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,657
Your bag.

619
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,332
Right. My bag.

620
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,502
Wait a second.

621
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,588
Did he just talk?

622
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,174
So he can talk?

623
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,970
Dae-bum, what was that?

624
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,680
Tell me.

625
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:10,280
How drunk do you have to be
to fall asleep at the library?

626
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,281
Right?

627
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,117
You're a weirdo too.
You could have just left her here.

628
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,702
Why spend the night here with her?

629
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,622
You can't even talk
when there's a stranger around.

630
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,292
Hey.

631
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,545
Go take a shower. Take this home too.

632
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,675
Mom packed you some ginseng
and some other stuff.

633
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,886
I haven't finished
the ones she sent before.

634
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:36,014
She's just trying to win you over.
Give her a call.

635
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,349
I think she's upset.

636
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,310
Tell her I said thank you.

637
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,603
All right.

638
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,939
-Make sure you do.
-Got it.

639
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,778
Did he hear it?

640
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,948
He must have, right?

641
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,535
Of course, he did. I'm so embarrassed.

642
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,665
What am I going to do?
This is humiliating.

643
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,054
So embarrassing.

644
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,198
Okay, I have nothing more to lose.

645
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,703
I'll live a life that I won't regret.

646
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,290
I can do it!

647
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,711
I can do it.

648
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,557
That lady is renting out the billiard club
at only 50,000 won a month.

649
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,683
Isn't that ridiculous?

650
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,519
The water pipe is leaking.

651
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,146
I thought I told you
to take care of it yourself.

652
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,106
-First, you sleep here,
-Oh, no.

653
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,233
and now you damage books.

654
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,609
What a catastrophe.

655
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,446
Not a soul in this town likes you.

656
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,198
So behave yourself.

657
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,075
Don't think of staying here long.

658
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,535
It'd be better if you'd leave.

659
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,037
Such a big nuisance came into town.

660
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,998
Let's give her back the money
and kick her out.

661
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,627
