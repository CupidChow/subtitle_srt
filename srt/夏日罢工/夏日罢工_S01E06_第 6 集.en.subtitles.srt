00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,220
Yeo-reum. Are you asleep?

4
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,806
No.

5
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,643
Are you not sleepy?

6
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,104
No.

7
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,273
Yeo-reum.

8
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:09,444
There's something I wish for every night
before I sleep, looking at the ceiling.

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,740
"When I wake up tomorrow,

10
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,784
please let me see a different ceiling."

11
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,953
"Please let me wake up ten years later."

12
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,414
Ten years?

13
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,291
Don't you think that's a waste?

14
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,627
No, not at all.

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,632
How do you want things to be in ten years?

16
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,012
First of all,
I definitely want to be rich.

17
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,849
What do you want to do with the money?

18
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,145
I'm going to buy Grandma an apartment.

19
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,271
And…

20
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,066
I'll send her on a trip to China.

21
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,152
You'd have to be really rich for that.

22
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,366
What about me? What will you do for me?

23
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,831
Maybe I'll become rich in my next life.

24
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,749
What a lousy answer.

25
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:10,380
What about you?
If you were to wake up after 10 years,

26
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,090
what would you want to do?

27
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,801
I'd be 38 years old.

28
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,179
Does it have to be in the future?

29
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,305
What?

30
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,641
Would you rather go back to the past?

31
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,309
Yes.

32
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,231
Once when I was young,

33
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,443
I woke up in the middle of the night

34
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,571
when I was sleeping with my parents.

35
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:40,076
We were in the middle
of a big thunderstorm,

36
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,079
but strangely, I wasn't scared at all.

37
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,039
It just…

38
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,544
It felt so nice and cozy.

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,590
I still remember
how the blanket felt that night.

40
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,598
Do you have any moments like this?

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,895
I couldn't have one.

42
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,151
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

43
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,695
Thank you for letting me crash here

44
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,283
and for not asking what happened.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,369
I'm thankful too.

46
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,581
You don't ask me questions like,

47
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,834
"Why are you here?"
"Why are you lazing around, not working?"

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,758
I hope you'll be happy to see this ceiling

49
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,093
when you wake up tomorrow.

50
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,017
Good night.

51
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,645
You too.

52
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,150
Gosh. You're home, Bom.

53
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,695
Where have you been all night?

54
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,031
You didn't answer your phone.

55
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,283
My phone was turned off.

56
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,952
Why were you sleeping here?

57
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,204
Did you eat?

58
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,790
Where's Dad?

59
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,126
He went out last night
and hasn't come back.

60
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,129
He must be upset too.

61
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,007
Bom.

62
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,093
No matter how much you hate him,
he's still your dad.

63
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,887
Grandma. I'm hungry.

64
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,555
Right. Of course.

65
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,849
I'll make breakfast for you.

66
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,400
You motherfuckers,
do you think I'm a pushover?

67
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,541
WARD NUMBER 2

68
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,751
Goodness.

69
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,837
Ma'am.

70
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,716
Where's Bom?

71
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,886
She's having surgery in that room.

72
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,763
What happened?

73
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,556
I don't…

74
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,435
My poor baby…

75
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,319
Ma'am.

76
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,122
Gosh, I feel sick.

77
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,374
Dae-bum.

78
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,002
Dae-bum.

79
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,346
Darn it. I'm late.

80
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,309
SEONG-MAN

81
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,230
What do you want?

82
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,815
Hello?

83
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,900
Hey, where are you right now?

84
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,861
Where would I be? I'm at Dae-bum's.

85
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,321
So you really slept over there?

86
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,491
I know Dae-bum is harmless,
but you're still a girl.

87
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,076
That's really not appropriate.

88
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,620
Why do you care if I sleep at Dae-bum's

89
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,747
-or at a motel?
-What did you say?

90
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,667
Why would you sleep at a motel
when you have a house?

91
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,295
Just shut up. Hang up.
I need to take a shower.

92
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,465
A shower? Hey, Ji-yeong. Hold on.

93
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,175
Go home and shower.

94
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,553
So annoying.

95
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,889
Why would she shower there?

96
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,310
The person you are trying to reach…

97
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,687
This is driving me nuts. Did she block me?

98
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,230
RETURNED BOOKS SHELF

99
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,357
Dae-bum, when does Bom usually come here?

100
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,443
I'm not really sure.

101
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,778
You're terrible at keeping track.

102
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,491
The only people who come here
are Bom and Yeo-reum.

103
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,164
Hello.

104
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,500
-I'll leave it here.
-Thank you.

105
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,295
What about Yeo-reum?

106
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,713
She'll be here soon.

107
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,425
So you keep track of when Yeo-reum comes.

108
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,344
Are you playing favorites right now?

109
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,056
Dae-bum, let's go hang out!

110
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,015
Let's play!

111
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,393
Hey, guys. You promised
not to act like this.

112
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,895
Treat him with more respect.

113
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,980
That feels so awkward though.

114
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,232
Yes, it's weird.

115
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,525
Then practice.

116
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,652
-What's wrong with him?
-Guys, heads-up.

117
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,861
-Mine!
-Nice!

118
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,239
-Give it here.
-Why are you taking the ball?

119
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,573
What are you doing?

120
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,409
Dae-bum.

121
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,869
What's up, Jun?

122
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,287
-Listen.
-Okay.

123
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,332
I heard Dad on the phone
while I was eating,

124
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,501
and someone is in operation at a hospital.

125
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,002
Who?

126
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,045
Was it Bom?

127
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,047
No, was it Yeo-reum?

128
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,757
-What?
-I'm not sure.

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,134
One of them got hurt really badly.

130
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,637
Wait for just a second here.

131
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,056
Hey, what did you just say?

132
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,016
Which one of them got hurt?

133
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,017
It's not Bom, is it?

134
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,352
-Is it?
-I don't know.

135
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,395
Dae-bum!

136
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,404
You can stay seated.

137
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,865
The operation was a success.

138
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,035
Her liver was slightly damaged,
so we had it sutured.

139
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,581
Fortunately, the injury wasn't fatal,
so she's not in any danger.

140
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,833
Thank you so much, sir.

141
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,459
-You must've been startled.
-Yes.

142
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,504
She'll have to be hospitalized
for about 10 days.

143
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,422
Okay.

144
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,799
When can she start eating?

145
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,135
The hospital will give her dinner
starting today.

146
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,556
So how did she get injured?

147
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,725
-Well, actually…
-What?

148
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,102
We're not so sure.

149
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,937
The insurance coverage will vary

150
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,897
between an accidental injury
and a self-inflicted one.

151
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,899
It may end up involving the police.

152
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,110
So please let us know
when the patient wakes up.

153
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,154
-The police?
-Okay.

154
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,905
I will.

155
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,745
What did the nurse just say?

156
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,705
I just don't get it.

157
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,790
Grandma.

158
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,752
When others ask what happened,
just say you don't know.

159
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,672
Dad might go to prison for this.

160
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,383
What do you mean he might go to prison?

161
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,969
It's not like he did this on purpose.

162
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,347
Mr. Librarian.

163
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,810
Ms. Lee.

164
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,562
Bom.

165
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,148
Bom!

166
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,401
What happened to you?

167
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,445
You shouldn't be waking her up.

168
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,448
Bom!

169
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,743
How did you find out?

170
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,829
Jun told me at the library.

171
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,167
Bom will be okay, right?

172
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,794
Yes.

173
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,048
The operation went well,
and the wound isn't deep.

174
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,810
I heard you were with Ji-yeong
until late last night.

175
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,395
Yes.

176
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,817
Ms. Cho…

177
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,737
She was very worried about you.

178
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,328
Shouldn't you be going now?

179
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,955
I should.

180
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,083
Then…

181
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,003
I'll let Bom know you stopped by
when she wakes up.

182
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,972
Ma'am, you should wear these.

183
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,808
Gosh, thank you so much.

184
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,855
Thank you.

185
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,733
Yeo-reum, did Dae-bum leave?

186
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,110
Yes.

187
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,029
He rushed over here like a madman earlier.

188
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,115
A kid came to the library

189
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,701
and told us either you or Bom were hurt.

190
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,537
I almost passed out keeping up with him.

191
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,123
I see.

192
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,708
It seems like…

193
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,294
it was Bom.

194
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,633
-Ha-neul.
-Grandma.

195
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,385
Come sit here.

196
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,888
Can we talk outside?

197
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,015
Sure.

198
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,905
If we say that she did this to herself,

199
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,073
it'll be considered self-inflicted.

200
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,076
Then the insurance
won't cover the hospital fee.

201
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,746
Do you by any chance

202
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,373
know how much the hospital bill will be?

203
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,001
Including her one-week stay
at the hospital,

204
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,505
it's over 10 million won.

205
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,756
Ten million won?

206
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,009
What do you mean by that?

207
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,470
Explain it in simple words.

208
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,973
If we say that Dad did it,

209
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,101
we'll pay less than two million
with the insurance.

210
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,439
But Dad will end up getting arrested.

211
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,615
Let's say I hurt her.

212
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,909
I'll tell them I hurt her,

213
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,578
-and I'll go to prison instead.
-Grandma.

214
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,456
What are you talking about?
No one will believe you.

215
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,042
But your dad will get arrested.

216
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,962
I can't let that happen.

217
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,838
Ha-neul.

218
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,050
Ha-neul.

219
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,343
Ma'am.

220
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,262
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

221
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,639
-Hey!
-Hey!

222
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,099
RETURNED BOOKS SHELF

223
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,100
-Yes!
-Hey!

224
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,852
Stop messing around
and put all the books back in!

225
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,689
This one? Where?

226
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,857
Just put it anywhere!

227
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,442
Hey, stop it!

228
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,194
-Stop it!
-Anywhere!

229
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,780
Stop that!

230
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,074
Hey! What are you kids doing?

231
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,201
Get over here!

232
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,203
Darn it.

233
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,081
Where did Dae-bum go?

234
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,499
He went to the hospital.

235
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,877
Hospital? Why? When?

236
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,628
Bom and Yeo-reum got hurt,

237
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,380
so the two guys rushed over there.

238
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,923
Really?

239
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,216
Where and how badly hurt are they?

240
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,511
You shouldn't be chatting in the library.

241
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,764
Hurry up and clean this up.

242
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,017
Don't run. Get over here.

243
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,935
Hey. Come over here, guys.

244
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,439
I can't keep my voice down
with these kids.

245
00:14:58,522 --> 00:14:59,690
Here you go.

246
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,692
Guys, wait!

247
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,912
Hey, Bom!

248
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,123
-Hello.
-Hello, Seong-min.

249
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,958
What happened to you, Bom?

250
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,962
Is she going to be okay?

251
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,298
The surgery went well, so she'll be fine.

252
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,846
Why does she have to go through
such a hard time?

253
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,723
Goodness.

254
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,561
Seong-min. Why are you crying?

255
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,856
He's been tenderhearted
since when he was a kid.

256
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,401
Seong-min, it's okay.

257
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,029
Her surgery went well. She'll be fine.

258
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,407
Can I ask you a favor?

259
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,536
I have to drop by my house
after I feed her dinner.

260
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,332
I panicked and rushed out in the morning,
so I couldn't bring anything with me.

261
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,917
Can you watch her until I'm back?

262
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,003
I could just stay with her today.

263
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,507
Gosh, no. It's fine.
You've already stayed for so long.

264
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,758
Ma'am.

265
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,386
Then I'll give you a ride home

266
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,096
and drop Yeo-reum off on the way.

267
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,932
Would you do that for us? Thank you.

268
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,271
It'll be uncomfortable
sleeping in a hospital.

269
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,023
I'll be okay.

270
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,526
I should be next to Bom when she wakes up.

271
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,071
I'm letting you stay with her
just for today then.

272
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,658
Thank you for everything.

273
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,910
You even bought me slippers.

274
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,122
You're a very considerate young lady.

275
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,129
Don't worry too much.

276
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,882
I don't know what to do.

277
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,553
Bom is my granddaughter.

278
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,056
Her dad is my son.

279
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,686
How could such a thing have happened?

280
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,877
Why are you outside?

281
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,421
You must be hungry.

282
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,423
I'll make you something.

283
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,091
What about Bom?

284
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,261
The operation went well.

285
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,847
-Mom.
-Yes?

286
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,017
I want to get treated.

287
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,686
What do you mean?

288
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,439
I want to quit drinking.

289
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,024
All right.

290
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,693
You should stop drinking.

291
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,780
All you need to do is quit drinking.

292
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,406
-Seong-man.
-Yes?

293
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,493
Can you give me a ride to the hospital?

294
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,871
Jeong-hun. That's a great decision.

295
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,706
It really is.

296
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,126
All right. Let's eat first then.

297
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,712
You've made the right decision.

298
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,799
I'll look into a hospital and everything.

299
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:15,677
The hospital can treat you
and make you whole again.

300
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,970
You'll be all right.

301
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,905
You must have been starving.

302
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,202
You're so good.

303
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,870
You didn't even poop all day.

304
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,331
Let's go for a walk after.

305
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,172
Hey, Mr. Librarian.

306
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,591
I thought you were at the hospital.

307
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,387
Bom's grandmother said
she'll stay with her today.

308
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,892
You must have been walking your dog.

309
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,646
Yes. Gyeo-ul has been alone all day today.

310
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,650
Gyeo-ul as in winter
and Yeo-reum as in summer?

311
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,029
I didn't name the dog.

312
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,656
Bom named him.

313
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,867
I see.

314
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,916
Were you on your way home
from the library?

315
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,715
I wanted to give you these.

316
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,508
What are they?

317
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,428
I figured you'd be too busy
to come to the library, so…

318
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,932
Thank you.

319
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,604
Will you be going to visit Bom
every day at the hospital?

320
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,522
Yes, that's what I'm planning.

321
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,990
Do you want me to take care of Gyeo-ul?

322
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,491
Sorry?

323
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,286
He can stay in the library yard
during the day.

324
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,079
I mean…

325
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:13,170
But you can't take him
inside the hospital.

326
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,388
Come here.

327
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,478
Ahn Dae-bum.

328
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,938
Professor.

329
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,065
I got here too late, didn't I?

330
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,567
Professor. How did you find me here?

331
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,027
That lady told me.

332
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,031
You live such a wonderful life.
How do you live without a phone?

333
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,243
The home takes after you.

334
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,620
It's quite bland.

335
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,832
Goodness. You even raise a dog.

336
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,669
Dae-bum.

337
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,923
Aren't you curious
why I suddenly came to see you?

338
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,550
Hawking radiation.

339
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,303
Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems.

340
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,516
Isn't it cool to have a theory
that's named after you?

341
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,725
-Wait.
-Professor.

342
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,977
Hold on.

343
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:15,857
Look, Professor.

344
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,567
-Give me a second.
-Please.

345
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,533
For the first time in Korean history,
we'll be naming a formula.

346
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,077
You said this formula was correct,

347
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,746
and I thought it was wrong.

348
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,082
No, I was convinced
that it had to be wrong.

349
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,167
Last month,

350
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,505
Professor Holland presented this.

351
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,466
Apparently, you're right and I'm wrong.

352
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
The thing is,

353
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,308
Holland only proved it partially.
It's incomplete.

354
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,310
What do you say?

355
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,021
Let's prove this formula together.

356
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,856
Let's shock the world with this.

357
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,898
Professor.

358
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,526
-Professor, I'm sorry, but…
-I get it.

359
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,570
Don't answer right away.

360
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,822
Just give it a serious thought.

361
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,408
You've been away for a while.

362
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,703
Give this a read when you're bored.

363
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,791
Why do I have to do that?

364
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,003
That'll never happen.
I'll never forgive him!

365
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,714
Please, Bom.

366
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,383
Can't you do it for me, Bom?

367
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,803
I'm going to tell the truth!

368
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,013
You can't.

369
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,350
You can't. If you do, your dad…

370
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:36,104
No. I don't want to!
Why do I have to do that for him?

371
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,231
Bom, your stitches are going to come out.

372
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,776
Tell him to rot in prison!

373
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,986
Tell the cops to arrest him!

374
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,198
I just want him dead!

375
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,283
You're always so self-centered.

376
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,243
How do you think Grandma will feel
if Dad goes to jail?

377
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,789
Do you think I care?
It's none of my business.

378
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,832
So everyone can just rot in hell!

379
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,460
-Why should I do that for him?
-Kim Bom!

380
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,129
How can you say that
in front of your grandmother?

381
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,687
-Here, drink this.
-Thank you.

382
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,650
She's just not herself right now.

383
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,819
-I understand.
-Right.

384
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,447
I'm sorry to ask,

385
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,409
but can you please come with me?

386
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,661
Of course.

387
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,872
-Give me your paw!
-Sit!

388
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,041
-He gave me his paw!
-No way!

389
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,335
-He did the shake!
-Give me your paw!

390
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,255
You even brought a dog to the library now?

391
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,464
So what?

392
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,799
-So what?
-Whatever.

393
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,425
Do you not hear me?

394
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,636
You can't bring dogs to the library.

395
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,347
-Hey!
-Stop it.

396
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,765
-Get him out.
-No.

397
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,392
How is he doing?

398
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,019
-Dae-bum, what's his name?
-Gyeo-ul.

399
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,272
-"Gyeo-ul"?
-Hey, Gyeo-ul.

400
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,566
Hey, Dae-bum. What's going on?

401
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,068
-I'm looking after him for the time being.
-So cute.

402
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,820
-You are?
-It's delicious, right?

403
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,573
-Whose dog is it?
-You have to pet him gently like this.

404
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,615
He's cute, isn't he?

405
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,327
He's so soft.

406
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,375
KO HYE-RIM
BANK TELLER

407
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,752
Please fill out the highlighted items.

408
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,258
Here, where it's highlighted.

409
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,178
LOAN REQUEST FORM

410
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,098
It's hard to read, right?

411
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,975
I'll fill it out for you.

412
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,977
Would you do that for me?

413
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,314
There's a magnifying glass
near the entrance.

414
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,858
It's fine. I can fill it out for her.

415
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,153
It's Jung Yeong-suk.

416
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,658
How much loan can she take out?

417
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,076
Let me see.

418
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,329
LOAN CONSULTATION

419
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,538
What the…

420
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,456
Ma'am.

421
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,458
How do you expect to take out another loan

422
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,793
when you have this much set in collateral?

423
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,214
I'm sure my son paid that off
a long time ago.

424
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,757
What do you mean?

425
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,801
We can't approve more loans like this.

426
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,929
You've already reached the limit.

427
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,815
Yeo-reum asks for your help a lot.

428
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,946
I offered to take care of her dog.

429
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,866
Is that so?

430
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,287
I don't know where I can lend more money.

431
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,957
I'll also look into it for you.

432
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,752
I'm so sorry for causing you
so much trouble.

433
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,088
-It's nothing.
-I only used it once.

434
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,340
-It's in absolute mint condition.
-Jae-hun.

435
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,675
Please hold on.

436
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,635
-Hello.
-Why are you outside?

437
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,096
There were some other visitors inside.

438
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,556
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

439
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,142
The doctor came to check on Bom earlier.

440
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,146
Bom told him she hurt herself by accident.

441
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,941
Goodness, gracious. My baby.

442
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:11,653
ANGOK HOSPITAL

443
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,698
You should be grateful
that it wasn't any worse.

444
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,200
Here, eat this.

445
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,914
-Come on. Eat it.
-Give it to me.

446
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,168
You've never been in surgery.

447
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,129
Were you not scared during anesthesia?

448
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,131
No.

449
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,010
Did her dad go into rehab
without causing any commotion?

450
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,220
Oh, yes.

451
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,432
What do you mean, rehab?

452
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,018
Well, Jeong-hun…

453
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,562
He always turned a deaf ear
whenever we told him to go.

454
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,523
He must have been
really spooked this time.

455
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,068
Hey, that's no way to talk about your…

456
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,114
Gosh. Yeong-suk

457
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,533
Are you okay?

458
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,244
Seong-min.

459
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,122
Jeong-hun made it into rehab.
You don't have to worry.

460
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,665
Thank you.

461
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,418
You're always helping me out.

462
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,420
-I owe you.
-Don't say that.

463
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,131
It's a government rehab program,
so it's free.

464
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,633
-So don't worry about it.
-That's great.

465
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,430
Bom.

466
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,724
I'm sorry.

467
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,518
My baby.

468
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,150
Words cannot express how sorry
and thankful I am.

469
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,404
Come on, Yeong-suk.

470
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,575
Things will look brighter from now on.

471
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,747
ANGOK HOSPITAL

472
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,377
Yeo-reum.

473
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,421
Yes?

474
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,717
Now you know what my life is really like.

475
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,261
I guess so.

476
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,099
I hate it.

477
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,815
I can't take back what I've already seen.

478
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,902
I was really hoping
you'd never see my dad.

479
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,326
Remember what you asked me last time?

480
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,246
If I had any moments
I'd like to go back to.

481
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,046
When we were young,

482
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,718
Ha-neul and I spent our days
counting the days

483
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,053
until our Dad came home.

484
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,515
-I'm home!
-Dad!

485
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,977
Dad…

486
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:53,523
worked in another region
and only came home once or twice a year.

487
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,486
I used to cherish that day

488
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,947
more than any holiday

489
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,575
and even my birthday.

490
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,669
These motherfuckers.

491
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,921
Do they think I'm a pushover?

492
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,174
-I'll fucking kill them all.
-Jeong-hun.

493
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,217
-Damn it.
-Hey.

494
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,635
-What are you holding in your hand?
-Those fuckers.

495
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,888
-They're dead.
-What are you doing right now?

496
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,556
Dad, what are you doing?

497
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,349
-Fucking let go!
-Stop it!

498
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,726
Put it down!

499
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,894
I said put it down!

500
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,395
Put it down!

501
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,481
-Damn you!
-Put it down!

502
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,323
I used to love going to
comic book stores with my dad.

503
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,369
But…

504
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,082
it wasn't the comics that I liked.

505
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,837
I liked it because…

506
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,425
I got to hold hands with my dad
on the way there.

507
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,501
What the fuck did you just do?

508
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,294
What do we do?

509
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,796
My goodness.

510
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,007
Ha-neul, your shoes!

511
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,884
That's how it used to be.

512
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,930
-Ha-neul, put your shoes on!
-That's what my dad used to be like.

513
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,231
Bom.

514
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,112
Get well quickly.
Make sure you eat well too.

515
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,740
What about the hospital bill?

516
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,951
That's not for you to worry about.

517
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,663
Should I just tell them the truth?

518
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,834
I have no idea what I should do.

519
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,713
This is driving me crazy.

520
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:34,517
ANGOK HOSPITAL

521
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,033
You know Bom, right? Jeong-hun's daughter.

522
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,327
Anyway, this is for her hospital bill,

523
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,204
so let's talk over a meal
sometime this week.

524
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,498
Goodbye. Okay.

525
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,420
This punk. I know you sold
a plot of land recently, you cheapskate.

526
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:06,549
How come the people of this town
care less about Bom than an outsider?

527
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,134
Let's see. Who else can I call?

528
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,474
So…

529
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,562
I was wondering
if I could get the rent money back.

530
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,022
What?

531
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,399
Your rent? Why all of a sudden?

532
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,278
I can move out as soon as I get it.

533
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,282
You didn't even budge
when I tried to kick you out before.

534
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,913
Is this about Bom's hospital bill?

535
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,748
Not at all.

536
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,376
I knew it.

537
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,378
Gosh.

538
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,757
But I'll have to discuss this with my dad,

539
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,510
so let's talk
at the hospital tomorrow, okay?

540
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,261
-Okay.
-Okay.

541
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,347
Put in a good word for me.

542
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,140
Sure. Don't worry.

543
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,934
-Thank you.
-Bye.

544
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,200
Gyeo-ul!

545
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm back!

546
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,790
Sorry to keep you waiting all this time.

547
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,292
You must've really missed me.

548
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,460
Gyeo-ul.

549
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,587
Hello.

550
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,132
Hello.

551
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,718
Gyeo-ul, let's go for a walk.

552
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,885
Here.

553
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,182
-I think he likes you more than me now.
-Come on.

554
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,476
No way, I think he's just a friendly dog.

555
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,189
What about Bom?

556
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,526
She'll be going home tomorrow.

557
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,777
What a relief.

558
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,450
Then will you be coming to get
Gyeo-ul tomorrow?

559
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,245
I found some toys for him,
so you can take them with you.

560
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,585
Well…

561
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,087
By any chance,

562
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:13,468
Could you take care of Gyeo-ul?

563
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,638
I think I'll have to…

564
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,347
I liked it here.

565
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,171
PROFESSOR LEE CHEOL-UNG

566
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,176
ALTTEUL STORE

567
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,971
You know Mr. Bong from downtown, right?

568
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,640
He asked me
if the building is up for sale.

569
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,392
Really?

570
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,644
Hello.

571
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:47,854
-Hey.
-Hey.

572
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,856
-Hey, you punk.
-What?

573
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,024
Where are you always wandering off to?

574
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,944
I hear you've been going to
the hospital to see Bom.

575
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,488
What? That's not true.

576
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,159
If you want to sell it at market price,
you should wait it out.

577
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,579
After seeing the graffiti,
I think I should sell it while I can.

578
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,165
So you should go downtown

579
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,167
and sound out what Bong thinks.

580
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,713
What are you doing?

581
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,630
What?

582
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,048
What are you doing?

583
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,553
I wanted to give you some allowance.

584
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,846
Like this.

585
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,306
Oh, no. You got me.

586
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,601
How is it allowance when you just
put my money back into the wallet?

587
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,436
What do you mean?

588
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,230
I put my money in your wallet.

589
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:35,026
If you keep talking nonsense,
you won't be getting any allowance.

590
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,694
I'm leaving!

591
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,739
He's done something again.

592
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,116
I can tell just by looking at you.

593
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,951
Let's see.

594
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,539
I knew it.

595
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:53,169
Of all the credit cards,
he took the one with the lowest limit.

596
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,421
Gosh, that idiot.

597
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,798
Goodness.

598
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,926
Yes.

599
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,844
-You're the guardian?
-Yes.

600
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,305
I'm here for Kim Bom's discharge today.

601
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,640
Just a moment, please.

602
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,687
This is 4.13 million won.

603
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,147
I can only pay this much right--

604
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,191
It's Kim Bom in the surgical ward, right?

605
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,651
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATION

606
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,818
Yes.

607
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,278
The bill's already been paid.

608
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,113
Sorry?

609
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,115
There's nothing to pay for.

610
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,577
Who paid?

611
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,162
We don't know that.

612
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,664
Next in line, please.

613
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,292
Hello.

614
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,670
Excuse me!

615
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,130
You should take your money.

616
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,892
Who could it be?

617
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,312
Are you sure you're not lying to us?

618
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,233
I wish I could have paid for it,

619
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,193
but I don't have the money.

620
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,073
Maybe the people in town helped out
because your grandma is so kind.

621
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,157
-Right?
-Hey.

622
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,909
No one in our town would do such a thing.

623
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,538
I don't know what to say. I'm so grateful.

624
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,041
-How could this happen?
-Gosh.

625
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,584
You must be going home now, Bom.

626
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,628
-Mr. Bae.
-Yes?

627
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,464
By any chance…

628
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,674
By any chance?

629
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,801
You're right.

630
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,761
Do you want to see what I brought?

631
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,306
Ta-da!

632
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,933
You can use this, ma'am.

633
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,019
Buy the kids something delicious.

634
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,104
Seong-min.

635
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,731
Thank you so much.

636
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,442
This is a total plot twist.

637
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,736
What happened? What plot twist?

638
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,112
What's up with you all?

639
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,364
Did you pay the hospital bill?

640
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,992
Me? The hospital bill?

641
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,287
-It must not be him.
-What happened?

642
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,372
Did someone pay for it?

643
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,500
Yeo-reum says someone came in earlier
and paid the bill.

644
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,127
Are you sure it's not you?

645
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,589
It's not me. I just came in
after I stole my dad's card.

646
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,424
So it's really not you?

647
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,177
Why do you keep asking?
It's making me feel awkward.

648
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,012
Then who could it be?

649
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,431
Who could it be?

650
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,607
Hello.

651
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,734
Hello.

652
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,244
Thank you for the books.

653
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,412
-No problem.
-Thank you.

654
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,917
How did you pick out
all the books that I wanted to read?

655
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,294
Did I? I'm glad to hear that.

656
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,801
By the way, what will happen to Gyeo-ul?

657
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,346
I think…

658
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,142
he'll be staying with me.

659
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,855
Is that okay with you?

660
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,941
Of course.

661
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,494
You should say goodbye.

662
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,372
Say "Thank you."

663
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,833
-Goodbye.
-"Goodbye."

664
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,379
I'll write up a story
about the lady we interviewed

665
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,090
and send it to you.

666
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,258
Sure.

667
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,845
These are toys for Gyeo-ul.

668
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,972
I bought these for him.

669
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,350
Thank you.

670
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,979
I've never bought anything
like this for him.

671
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,232
You must be happy, Gyeo-ul.

672
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,071
By the way,

673
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,199
-are you free--
-Gosh.

674
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,742
You're finally going home today.

675
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,161
Hello.

676
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,413
Bom must have been discharged.

677
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,415
I heard you took care of her every day.

678
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,877
It was nothing. How have you been?

679
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,838
It's the same old for us.
Boring and uneventful.

680
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,799
I'm glad you're taking him back today.

681
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,509
Dae-bum is going to Seoul tomorrow.

682
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,470
I see.

683
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,097
-He's going to Seoul.
-Yes.

684
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,891
I have an interview tomorrow,

685
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,809
and he offered to drive me.

686
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,103
I see. An interview.

687
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,607
Weren't you about to say something?

688
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,067
It's nothing.

689
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,361
We're not opening tomorrow.

690
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,488
All right.

691
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,115
Have a safe trip to Seoul.

692
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,241
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

693
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,242
Bye.

694
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,411
You take care too.

695
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,332
That's a weight off your shoulders.

696
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,084
It's not easy to look after a dog.

697
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,089
Now that I think about it,

698
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:53,219
I do kind of miss him from time to time.

699
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,765
I hurt my leg two years ago,

700
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:03,896
so I used to go to a hospital in Seoul
to get treatment.

701
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,901
But it didn't get any better.

702
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,489
I hurt my leg two years ago,

703
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:19,495
so I used to go to a hospital in Seoul
to get treatment.

704
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,333
But it didn't get any better.

705
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:29,505
GRADE 7 PUBLIC SERVANT INTERVIEW HALL

706
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,759
Ji-yeong. Good luck with your interview.

707
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,469
Thank you.

708
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,349
And I have to meet someone. I'll be back.

709
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,101
Who?

710
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,147
-The professor?
-You don't need to know.

711
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,483
-You're going to be late. Hurry on in.
-All right.

712
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,693
Good luck.

713
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,319
-Let's talk after.
-Okay.

714
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,821
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

715
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,158
Yeo-reum.

716
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,247
Yeo-reum.

717
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,999
What?

718
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,209
Where is she?

719
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,211
Yeo-reum.

720
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,721
Hello?

721
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,556
Yeo-reum, where are you?

722
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,309
I'm on the rooftop hanging my laundry.

723
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,269
Can you come and give me a hand?

724
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,312
The rooftop?

725
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,065
I see. All right, I'll be there.

726
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,529
What are you doing up here?

727
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,239
I've been waiting for you.

728
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,907
It was empty downstairs.

729
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,326
Heads-up!

730
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,662
Are you nuts, Jae-hun?

731
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,373
-Gosh, look at her face.
-One, two, three!

732
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,792
Congratulations on coming home, Bom!

733
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,003
Let's please live a mellow life
from now on.

734
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,006
Hey, Heo Jae-hun! What did you just do?

735
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,299
Come here.

736
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,551
-Come here, let's wipe it off.
-Gosh, seriously.

737
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,803
-Come take a seat.
-Darn you.

738
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,096
My eyes.

739
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,598
-Are you okay?
-Let's wipe that.

740
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,183
Do you have a death wish, Jae-hun?

741
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,477
You'll have to wash your face.

742
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,229
Oh, what's all this?

743
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,107
This party is sponsored by Altteul Store.

744
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,525
It's sick, right?

745
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,612
How do you like it?

746
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,448
Did you prepare all this?

747
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
Of course. We did everything.

748
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,453
We all got together to prepare this.

749
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,916
But what's that in your hand?

750
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,002
I heard Yeo-reum likes chicken,
so I brought some.

751
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,171
-Really?
-I can never allow that.

752
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,673
You just got discharged,

753
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,257
so you can't have fried chicken.

754
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,884
You can eat what I made.

755
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,053
What did you make?

756
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,888
It's called chicken noodle soup.

757
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,682
It's what they eat in the US
when they get sick.

758
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,350
You have to have it.

759
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,810
It's the same chicken anyway.

760
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,186
What? It's not the same.

761
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,479
-I'll eat it then.
-You can't either.

762
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,106
I'll throw it so no one will eat it.

763
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,274
-No, my chicken!
-Gosh.

764
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,151
You're a lunatic.

765
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,653
You need to be taught a lesson.

766
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,405
-Come here!
-I told you not to eat it.

767
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,949
-What a waste of chicken.
-Seriously, Heo Jae-hun!

768
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,688
This is good for the liver,
so make sure you eat everything.

769
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,481
Gosh, you little brat.

770
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,525
I'll let this slide
since it's a happy day.

771
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,156
-Yeo-reum.
-Yes?

772
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,034
To be honest, I've never done
something like this before.

773
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,870
-Really?
-Yes.

774
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,456
Me neither.

775
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,582
Really?

776
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,669
Hey…

777
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,921
Thank you, Yeo-reum.

778
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,926
All I did was let them use the rooftop.

779
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,473
Whatever happens,
I'll repay what you did for me.

780
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:11,268
Even my grandma said
that she'll give you kimchi forever.

781
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,900
But the one who paid the bill wasn't me.

782
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,071
Come on, everyone drink up your sodas!

783
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,574
I thought it was him.

784
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,951
What are you talking about?

785
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,245
Someone has a crush on me again?

786
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,705
I don't think it's him.

787
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,374
Yeo-reum. Are you sure
you're not putting on an act?

788
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,336
-It's really not me.
-So? Who's the one with the crush?

789
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,545
Here.

790
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,797
The chicken noodle soup is ready.

791
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,678
The food is all ready. When is he coming?

792
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,889
What? Who else is coming?

793
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,267
Dae-bum. I told him
we're having a party here today.

794
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,270
What are you saying?
Dae-bum went to Seoul with Ji-yeong today.

795
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,523
Really? He should have come here.

796
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,316
Tell me about it.

797
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,569
Dae-bum and Ji-yeong are always together.

798
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:07,032
I'm a better driver than Dae-bum.
Don't you agree?

799
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,576
Why are you taking it out on me?

800
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,248
-Let's dig in.
-So this is the soup you talked about?

801
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,290
Yes.

802
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,501
It looks funny.

803
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,295
It looks like chicken kalguksu.

804
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:21,838
You're right.

805
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,675
Isn't it just chicken kalguksu
made with pasta noodles?

806
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,843
Fine. I'll just throw this away too.

807
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,095
-No!
-Stop it!

808
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,889
Hey, Dae-bum.

809
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,143
There's still so much
I don't know about you.

810
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:36,937
What?

811
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,022
What do you mean?

812
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,943
How did the interview go?

813
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,238
No. My interview isn't the issue here.

814
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:51,201
I thought you were a different person,
watching you solve equations.

815
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,412
You shouldn't be rotting away in Angok.

816
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:57,374
I was born to live in Angok.

817
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,167
Even my last name sounds like An.

818
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,338
To be frank,
I sometimes looked down on you.

819
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,339
Sure.

820
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,092
I'm so ashamed about feeling that way.

821
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,053
That's what I like about you.

822
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,973
Hey, drop the sarcasm.

823
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:14,933
You little…

824
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,065
-Man, I'm full.
-I'm so full.

825
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,734
This dish is really interesting.

826
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,570
-It tasted better than I thought, Jae-hun.
-I told you.

827
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,030
All right.

828
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,115
-Shall we clean up?
-Sure, let's do that.

829
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,074
Wait.

830
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,077
Now that we're all full,
we need to digest the food.

831
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,330
-Right. Of course we should.
-Yes, that's right.

832
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,247
What's going on?

833
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,540
-I don't know.
-You don't know either?

834
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,460
-Are you ready?
-They must have prepared something.

835
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,878
-I'm curious.
-What is it?

836
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,301
-What's wrong with him?
-Give me a round of applause.

837
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,969
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

838
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,099
You're good at that!

839
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,184
No, I can't.

840
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,019
Come on!

841
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,521
Come hold my hand, Yeo-reum.

842
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:05,859
Here are your presents.

843
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,527
Gosh, this is so pretty.

844
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,154
It's beautiful.

845
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,577
-Yeo-reum.
-Yes?

846
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,330
Thank you.

847
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,956
I told you it wasn't me.

848
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:25,545
Thanks to you, I feel happier now.

849
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,590
Really?

850
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,926
Yes.

851
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,471
Why are you just standing there?

852
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,056
Hey!

853
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,042
I'm speeding up.

854
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,460
Shall we meet at the library
every morning for a jog?

855
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,128
-Do you want to see a movie?
-Chicken and beer?

856
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,588
Ji-yeong, that hurts.

857
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,008
I'm also starting to hurt because of you.

858
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,219
Our bodies are smart.
They don't forget traumas so easily.

859
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,846
-Dae-bum!
-He held onto his life

860
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,848
trying his best not to break down.

861
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,641
But all of that fell apart today.

862
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,436
Can you take responsibility
for Dae-bum's life?

863
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,396
I can.

864
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,066
For you, this might be
just a summer fling by the beach,

865
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,693
but that's not the case for me.

866
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,571
