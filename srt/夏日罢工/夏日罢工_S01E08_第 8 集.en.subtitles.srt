MYEONGJU STATION

4
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,966
Yeo-reum, let's just go.

5
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,926
We're going to end up missing the train.

6
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,179
Let's just wait a little longer.

7
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,141
When I called him earlier,
he said he was almost here.

8
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,018
But it's been 30 minutes already.

9
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,770
He probably just left his house.

10
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,980
We'll just run for it.

11
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,523
Yeo-reum, Bom!

12
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,442
-Jae-hun!
-Hey!

13
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,359
Hey!

14
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,320
Stop wasting time
and get over here already!

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,654
Run faster!

16
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,031
You punk.

17
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,783
Dae-bum?

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,452
-Jae-hun!
-I thought he couldn't…

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,329
Yeo-reum.

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,332
You were waiting for Dae-bum, weren't you?

21
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,084
That's not true.
I had no idea he was coming.

22
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,377
You had no idea?

23
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,255
-Get over here.
-Hey.

24
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,299
-Let's hurry.
-Come on.

25
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,801
MYEONGJU STATION

26
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,844
-The train is here!
-Let's hurry!

27
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,555
-We're going to miss it!
-Gosh.

28
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,932
Watch out.

29
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,684
-Let's hop on.
-Come on!

30
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,105
We almost missed the train because of you.

31
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,524
Sorry, I was…

32
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,567
boiling these.

33
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,819
You brought eggs?

34
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,403
What are you, an old lady?

35
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,281
Did you bring Dae-bum with you?

36
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,658
No.

37
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,284
I met him on my way here.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,412
I didn't know you were coming.

39
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,916
What do you mean you didn't know?

40
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,209
Are you sure you didn't?

41
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,336
You didn't even refund his ticket.

42
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,381
Did you bring salt too?

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,813
-It's so beautiful here.
-Everything is green.

44
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,358
DONGCHEON

45
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,819
-We're here already?
-Hey, Jae-hun.

46
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,529
How do you sleep the entire way here?

47
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,198
I stayed up preparing the food for today.

48
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:38,992
Yeo-reum.

49
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,952
How long do we have to walk from here?

50
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,413
It's just a 35-minute walk from here.

51
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,623
You looked into it already?

52
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,209
He's the best. Then shall we go?

53
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,086
-Sure.
-It's so far away.

54
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,339
Gosh, it is quite far.
When are we going to get there?

55
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,135
Hold on.

56
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,096
What's wrong?

57
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,307
We're missing a suitcase.

58
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,058
-What?
-It's not with you, Dae-bum?

59
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,978
A suitcase? What are you talking about?

60
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,438
You're the one who brought it.

61
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,524
The bus!

62
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,401
Mister!

63
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,612
Mister!

64
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,115
-Sir!
-How can he forget about his luggage?

65
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,543
-Can't I get it any sooner?
-This place is so beautiful.

66
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,878
Okay.

67
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,004
This is great.

68
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,882
I can get my luggage back
tomorrow morning.

69
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,717
Hey, it's fine. We have another suitcase.

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,302
We can share the food in there.

71
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,013
I only brought cooking tools in there.

72
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,181
What?

73
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,432
So we have to starve?

74
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,435
You should have told us earlier.

75
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,436
It's okay.

76
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,522
I brought some ramyeon just in case.

77
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,899
I brought something too.

78
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,235
Apples.

79
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,778
No.

80
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,112
-Both of you, stop.
-Hey.

81
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,241
What should we do then?
I don't want to starve.

82
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,618
Wait.

83
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,712
How did you think to pick peaches?

84
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,798
You're so resourceful.

85
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,677
Wherever I go,
I can get food in exchange for work.

86
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,097
You're putting me to shame, Bom.

87
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,226
I heard there was a storm coming,
so I was worried.

88
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,061
It's good that you came when you did.

89
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,149
Can you pick the ones
that are smaller first?

90
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,359
-Sure.
-Okay.

91
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,282
Goodness. That young man over there
is such a great worker.

92
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,159
You've made my day. You know what?

93
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,370
How about some Korean chicken
as compensation?

94
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,247
-Really?
-Seriously?

95
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,207
I feel so much more energetic

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,501
with all of you youngsters around.

97
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,255
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

98
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,049
-Yes, I can't wait!
-I can't wait.

99
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,222
-Dad.
-Yes?

100
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,308
You should dress up like that every day.

101
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,517
Why?

102
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,269
Do I look good?

103
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,021
You look rich.

104
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,481
Hey, I don't have to dress up
like this to be rich.

105
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,942
I'm just too busy to be playing dress-up.

106
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,028
Then why are you
dressed up like that today?

107
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,654
That's not for you to know.

108
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,740
Look at you.

109
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,908
Where do you think you're going?

110
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,952
I have an important appointment today.

111
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,539
Appointment, my foot.
All you do is laze around at home.

112
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,999
It's hot today, isn't it?

113
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,501
Hey.

114
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,379
Are you going out to meet a girl?

115
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,214
Gosh.

116
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,259
Why would you ask me that?

117
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,178
Can't I have some privacy around here?

118
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,221
Privacy? Goodness sake.

119
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,931
Are you trying to be funny or what?

120
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,517
Isn't he funny, Jun?

121
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,436
Dad.

122
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,857
Does my hair look better
when it's to the side or up?

123
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,150
-Let me see.
-All right.

124
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,944
-This way?
-Come closer.

125
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,237
Number one.

126
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,572
Number two.

127
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,699
-I don't know, you prick.
-Seriously?

128
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,242
Just come home early.

129
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,619
Don't go around causing trouble.

130
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,620
Fine.

131
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,997
I'm going out then.

132
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,665
Good luck on your date, Dad.

133
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,167
Be quiet, you little…

134
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,418
A date?

135
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,045
Hey.

136
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,631
-Is your dad going on a date?
-Yes.

137
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,859
Hey, Jae-hun.

138
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,361
You came up first!

139
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,779
Where's Dae-bum?

140
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,950
Dae-bum is amazing!

141
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,493
He's so great at this.

142
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,661
Let's go back in again.

143
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,674
Dae-bum, you came up already?

144
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,261
Dae-bum is more impatient than I thought.

145
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,471
He's in last place!

146
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm so out of breath.

147
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,227
The last place gets splashed!

148
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,687
Time for punishment!

149
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,272
-Gosh.
-Come here!

150
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,609
Heads up, Yeo-reum.

151
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,907
Stop it!

152
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,159
Hey!

153
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,910
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,162
Take this!

155
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,205
It went into my eyes!

156
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,711
-You brought a ukulele?
-Ta-da.

157
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,546
When did you bring that?

158
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,215
Music always accompanies vacations.

159
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,383
Are you any good?

160
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,551
-Yeo-reum.
-I'm quite good.

161
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,886
-Really?
-Have a peach.

162
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,473
I'm sorry. I should have washed it.

163
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,932
-Here's a soft one.
-Everyone.

164
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,100
I love soft peaches!

165
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,393
-Guys?
-Yes?

166
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,353
Shall we enjoy some music now?

167
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,813
Let me see you perform first.

168
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,028
He's quite good.

169
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,242
Spring is here

170
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,704
-Spring is here
-What the heck?

171
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,706
-I'm happy
-You lovebirds.

172
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,957
What do you mean?

173
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,584
-To be
-Look at you smiling.

174
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,337
With you

175
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,340
Yeo-reum, sing along.

176
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,384
-Summer is here
-…here

177
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,385
Summer is…

178
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,847
-Here
-Here

179
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,807
-Dae-bum's turn. Dae-bum is
-Dae-bum is

180
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,310
-Here
-Here

181
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,437
-Dae-bum is here
-Dae-bum is blushing!

182
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,565
-Are you blushing, Dae-bum?
-He's really good.

183
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,691
-Yeo-reum, get up!
-Sing with me.

184
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,901
We are

185
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,612
-Here
-You should get up too, Dae-bum.

186
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,533
I'm happy that

187
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,453
-we are here together
-we are here together

188
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,374
Round of applause, please.

189
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,876
That was great.

190
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,253
Hold on, that's not fair.

191
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,337
I want a peach too.

192
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,589
-Gosh!
-Hey!

193
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,507
Watch out.

194
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,439
You…

195
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,192
What?

196
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,986
Do I look sharp?

197
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,738
Why do you look like that?

198
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,699
Just say that you like it.

199
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,158
I don't know where to begin.

200
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,911
What are we having? I'm hungry.

201
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,204
Actually,

202
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,500
I've called Angok Garden ahead of time
and told them to get a big carp ready.

203
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,211
It's too hot for that.
Let's just go somewhere nearby.

204
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,213
Hey, come on.

205
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,424
I'm buying you a meal to cheer you up,

206
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,718
so we should at least have braised carp.

207
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,345
Are you wearing cologne?

208
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,891
Why? Does it smell nice?

209
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,977
-Wait here, I'll get my car keys.
-Hold on.

210
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,314
Let me take you on my bike today.

211
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,609
We're not some high schoolers!

212
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,778
Come on, this will bring back
memories back from high school.

213
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,281
-Gosh.
-Hurry, wear this.

214
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,074
For goodness' sake.

215
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,995
I'm just too embarrassed
to be on the motorcycle with you.

216
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,246
Hop on.

217
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,165
I can't believe this.

218
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,750
You have to hold on tightly.

219
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,169
Or you'll fall off.

220
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,670
Were you on a blind date?

221
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,255
Blind date, my foot.

222
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,090
It's just a happy occasion.

223
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,967
You're wearing too much cologne, idiot!

224
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,968
Hold on tight.

225
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,095
I said hold on tight!

226
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,271
You got all dressed up for me today.

227
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,982
I wear this all the time.

228
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,361
-The view is so nice!
-Will you keep it down?

229
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,155
Why are you being like this?
Let's just go quietly.

230
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,740
How do you like this?

231
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,158
It's nature's air-conditioning!

232
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,745
It's nice, okay?

233
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,167
I'm all you've got, right?

234
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,337
Whatever.

235
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,672
-"Whatever."
-Seriously.

236
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,300
Let's go have something good!

237
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,895
I really don't get it.

238
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,314
What is his intention?

239
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,440
Tell me.

240
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,567
Yeo-reum.

241
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,987
Don't you want to
experience this just once?

242
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,156
No. Definitely not.

243
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,284
Dae-bum.

244
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,786
What about you?

245
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,621
I think I'll pass.

246
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,833
Gosh, seriously. Look at us.

247
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,460
I was so happy
when he mentioned Korean chicken.

248
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,545
Tell me about it.

249
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,922
I didn't know it was a live one.

250
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,009
I'm starving.

251
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,136
Let's just kill it.

252
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,554
But who will?

253
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,473
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-That's so sudden!

254
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,559
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

255
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,354
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Hey.

256
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,898
-Oh, no!
-It's you.

257
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,110
Hurry up, Bom.

258
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,237
-It's all yours.
-No!

259
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,034
That looks so good.

260
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,668
This is so good.

261
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,089
I was going to add some eggs,

262
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,385
-but it kept staring at me.
-Good job.

263
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,889
I think cooking it in the caldron
made it even better.

264
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,183
It's good, right?

265
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,311
I told you I make great ramyeon
when we first met.

266
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,021
How is it, Dae-bum?

267
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,734
It's so delicious.

268
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,323
I'm so full.

269
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,283
That was a good meal.

270
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,993
I'm glad you all enjoyed the ramyeon,

271
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,078
but what was all that work for?

272
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,455
Hey.

273
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,458
Think about why
we had to work at the grove.

274
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,050
Hello?

275
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,552
Right now?

276
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,097
I thought he was going to bring it
in the morning.

277
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,642
-Okay.
-What is it?

278
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,768
Who was that?

279
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,355
It's the bus company. They're bringing
the luggage to the station.

280
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,898
-Right now?
-Yes.

281
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,149
Why now?

282
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,901
We just finished our dinner.

283
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,653
-I know, right?
-It's okay.

284
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,280
We'll have a feast tomorrow morning.

285
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,574
Should we go together?

286
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,327
No. It's fine.

287
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,328
Let's go, Bom.

288
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,539
Seriously.

289
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,251
Clean up for us, okay? See you.

290
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,335
Bye.

291
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,795
Stay safe.

292
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,263
Bom.

293
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,140
-Yes?
-It's nice.

294
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,103
What is?

295
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,023
Just the fact that
we're the only two here in this darkness.

296
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,025
Cut it out already.

297
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,321
When is the bus coming?
Is it even on its way here?

298
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,034
I've been really happy
ever since I met you.

299
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,161
Hey.

300
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,580
Be honest with me.

301
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,748
They sent you back to Korea
because you talked too much, right?

302
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,542
It's the opposite.

303
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,338
Everyone made fun of me
because I couldn't speak English.

304
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,923
So I was quiet the whole time.

305
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,051
When did you go to the States?

306
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,596
Back when I was in the sixth grade.

307
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,182
So you came back to Korea
because your English didn't improve?

308
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,392
No.

309
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,520
My English improved as time went by.

310
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,899
But when I pronounced something wrong,

311
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,775
they made fun of me
for being an Asian kid.

312
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,862
I couldn't put up with it at one point.

313
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,323
-So I beat someone up.
-What?

314
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,741
You did?

315
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,622
That's when my parents realized
how serious this was

316
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,956
and sent me back here.

317
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,418
Your parents must have been upset.

318
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:21,962
Not really.

319
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,090
I'm sure they're happy that I'm gone.

320
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,801
They're ashamed of me.

321
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,971
They're both extremely smart.

322
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,349
But I'm the only dumb one.

323
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,855
They're both renowned professors
in psychology,

324
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,193
but they don't know how I feel.

325
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,618
The bus is here.

326
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,577
Let's go.

327
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,920
Hello. I'm here for the luggage.

328
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,048
There it is.

329
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,883
Look how plump it is.

330
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,677
Let me debone it for you.

331
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,804
Stop.

332
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,014
I'll do it for you.

333
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,017
-Isn't that the innards?
-No, it's the meat.

334
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,560
Try it with rice.

335
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,150
It's good.

336
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,279
You won't get dishes like this in Seoul.

337
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,156
Have as much as you want.

338
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,658
Thanks.

339
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,205
Here, you love this.

340
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,707
Makgeolli.

341
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,209
You shouldn't drink.

342
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,294
I never drink.

343
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,261
So…

344
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,096
Ji-yeong.

345
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,475
I asked you out for dinner today because…

346
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,023
What is it?

347
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,441
You know,

348
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,736
it's not easy for a man and a woman
to just stay as friends.

349
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,654
But look how many years we've lasted.

350
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,159
And…

351
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,952
Well…

352
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,788
Ji-yeong.

353
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,334
-I…
-Seong-man.

354
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,755
Can I ask you a favor as a friend?

355
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,340
Of course.

356
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,719
Ask away. I'll do anything for you.

357
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,430
Can you please kick that lady

358
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,724
out of your building?

359
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,268
Who? Yeo-reum?

360
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,355
What? Why all of a sudden?

361
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,858
Yeo-reum is a decent person.

362
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,777
What makes her decent?

363
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,156
The way she quit her job
to laze around all day?

364
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,491
Do you also find that charming?

365
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,118
What do you mean? I didn't--

366
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,623
That's called being
irresponsible and incapable.

367
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,250
I want to live a life like that too.

368
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:09,755
Many people put up with their hardships
and fight to live on.

369
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,925
-Don't you think so?
-Yes, you're right.

370
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,344
And I don't care if she lives like that.

371
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,513
But she's a bad influence
to people around her.

372
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,311
Did Yeo-reum say something to you?

373
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,900
Dae-bum…

374
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,737
keeps changing because of her.

375
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,832
Wait, Ji-yeong…

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,710
when you were crying the other time…

377
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,589
Dae-bum changed too much.

378
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,014
What do I do?

379
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,477
I think I like Dae-bum.

380
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,671
-Bom.
-Yes?

381
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,467
Do you know
when I started falling for you?

382
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,471
Stop it. You're making me cringe.

383
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,934
When I got assigned to your class…

384
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,285
Even here, they made fun of me

385
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,121
saying I rolled my tongue
and tried to show off.

386
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,291
I thought, "it's the same in Korea."

387
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,834
Keep your voices down.

388
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,087
I felt like there was no place
for me here either.

389
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,175
Then I started hating myself.

390
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,887
Who would love me
when even my own parents don't?

391
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,307
I realized that racism
wasn't the problem in the US.

392
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,475
I was.

393
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,268
Keep it down.

394
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,770
I was to blame.

395
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,570
So I only listened to music during recess.

396
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,158
I ran away like I wasn't interested.

397
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,434
So this is what you always listen to.

398
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,980
It's not bad.

399
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,024
And…

400
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,528
you were the first person
to come and talk to me.

401
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,698
Although you might not remember.

402
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,357
When I'm with you,

403
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,819
it's nice that I don't have to
talk so much.

404
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,241
It's the opposite for me.

405
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,661
When I'm with you,

406
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,164
I tend to talk more.

407
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,171
Ever since I was young,

408
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,591
talking to someone

409
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,385
always felt like a burden to me.

410
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,227
Dae-bum.

411
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,067
Ever since the other night,

412
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,154
there's something that's been
weighing on my mind.

413
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,493
If only I didn't quit my job.

414
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,080
If only I didn't come here for the sea.

415
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,751
If only I didn't enter that library.

416
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,675
If only I didn't move into
the billiard club.

417
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,597
If any one of those didn't happen,

418
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,351
you wouldn't have had to
go through all this.

419
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,440
If only any one of those didn't happen…

420
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,036
When you…

421
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,081
first came to Angok,

422
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,376
when you came to the library

423
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,505
to make a membership card,
saying that you moved here,

424
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:49,344
when we spent the night in the library,

425
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,471
and…

426
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,473
when I took you home

427
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,977
when you were completely wasted…

428
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,563
That's…

429
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,399
When we had ice cream together
on the library bench,

430
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,444
when we went to interview
the old lady together,

431
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,071
and…

432
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,409
when we went for a jog together
in the morning…

433
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,037
I was happy.

434
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm…

435
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,546
truly happy…

436
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,300
that you came to Angok.

437
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,576
It's raining.

438
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,999
Hey, it's raining.

439
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,293
Let's just walk.

440
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,170
In this rain?

441
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,796
Yes.

442
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,341
Sure.

443
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,801
It's nice and cool.

444
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,439
I remember.

445
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,482
What?

446
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,319
I remember too.

447
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,783
Did you really think
I wouldn't remember that day?

448
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,200
Thank you for the food.

449
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,244
I called a cab.

450
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,208
You can't ride your bike in this rain.

451
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,251
Take the cab with me.

452
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,670
It's not my first time on a bike.

453
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,547
You still shouldn't ride it in the rain.

454
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,758
-Just take the cab with me.
-It's here.

455
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,054
Come on.

456
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,348
-Go in first.
-Gosh.

457
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,642
-Ji-yeong, I'll see you later.
-Hey!

458
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,561
-Sir, go ahead.
-Hey, get in!

459
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,002
I've…

460
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,089
always liked being in the rain
since I was young.

461
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,925
I used to never use an umbrella.

462
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,654
I heard about Bom's hospital bills.

463
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,995
I heard about what happened in Seoul too.

464
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,299
It's too good of an opportunity
to pass up.

465
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,896
Yeo-reum.

466
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,152
Do you want me to go to Seoul?

467
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,493
Yes.

468
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,236
I never used an umbrella as a kid

469
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,405
just like you.

470
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,201
We have fresh shrimp here!

471
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,535
Discount only for today.

472
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,829
Hello, sir. Don't you want some shrimp?

473
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,082
Are you sure? It's really delicious today.

474
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,667
It's in season right now.

475
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,253
-Thank you.
-He's good at that.

476
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,423
-Do you want some shrimp?
-Are you working like this every day?

477
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,091
No.

478
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,260
-I'm off on Mondays.
-Are you sure you don't want any?

479
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,013
-It'll be hot in the summer though.
-Thank you.

480
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,516
Do you prefer this over waiting tables?

481
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,433
-I do.
-Thank you.

482
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,810
-It pays more.
-Discount today.

483
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,853
Sir, do you want some shrimp?

484
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,313
Gosh, you're so cool.

485
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,314
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,857
Oh, right.

487
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,025
Thank you.

488
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,904
I found them at a good price,
so I bought them for you.

489
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,031
You really don't want some?
It's delicious.

490
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,200
I'm not going to draw anymore though.

491
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,244
Whatever. Just keep it.

492
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,912
We have fresh shrimp!

493
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,332
-Shrimp is here!
-Jae-hun is a natural.

494
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,792
-Some shrimp?
-Yes.

495
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,794
Are you sure he won't take your job?

496
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,796
Thank you.

497
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,631
Jae-hun!

498
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,883
That's enough.

499
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,009
Give it back now.

500
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,428
Give it back!

501
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,305
-I don't want to.
-Give it to me.

502
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,183
Hey, give it.

503
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,019
-Stop.
-What the heck?

504
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,104
Hello?

505
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,230
Hey!

506
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,942
"I've been eating well here

507
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,944
and working out every day."

508
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,487
"I'm much better now."

509
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,783
"Looking back with a clear mind,

510
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,453
I felt so bad for the kids

511
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,581
and you, Mom."

512
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,127
"Mom, you've worked tirelessly
all your life."

513
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,296
"My poor mother."

514
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,467
"I'll be good to you when I'm home."

515
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,389
"Please give my regards
to Bom and Ha-neul for me."

516
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,402
Jeong-hun.

517
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,197
Just stay healthy, okay?

518
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,826
I'm sorry…

519
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,454
for calling you
and asking you to read this.

520
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,580
It's fine.

521
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,667
Don't tell Bom about this, okay?

522
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,669
You know,

523
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,714
I think she'll be happy
to read this letter.

524
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,175
Could I…

525
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,845
Could I ask you for another favor?

526
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,389
What is it?

527
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,144
This is a bit embarrassing, but…

528
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,314
Come on. What is it?

529
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,276
Yeo-reum.

530
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,697
Is it difficult
to learn how to read and write?

531
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,576
I want to…

532
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:39,165
reply to my son to tell him I'm well.

533
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,428
This is so much better.

534
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,890
You might get a heat stroke
wearing that shrimp costume.

535
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,100
Can't you do something else?

536
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,227
They don't even pay you much.

537
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,898
What? What did you just say?

538
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,317
I was just worried because it's hot.

539
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,735
Heo Jae-hun.

540
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,697
I don't know how much money
is good enough for you,

541
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,657
but that money is important to me.

542
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,035
Bom, I'm sorry. It was a slip of a tongue.

543
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,251
Did that scare you?

544
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,294
What?

545
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,798
I'm asking if you're scared, you idiot.

546
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,675
What, seriously?

547
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,051
You caught me off guard.

548
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,765
I feel like the world is collapsing
when you're angry at me.

549
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,893
Collapsing, my foot.

550
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,771
I want to go on a trip again.

551
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,940
Same here.

552
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,151
It was nice.

553
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,986
Hey.

554
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,238
What's with that creepy smile?

555
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,992
You know what.

556
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,828
What's wrong with you? Have you lost it?

557
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,290
Bom. It's too late to back out.

558
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,126
What do you mean it's too late?

559
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,462
Bom, wait.

560
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,838
Don't follow me.

561
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,466
Then you click here.

562
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,718
You print these out so you can label them.

563
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,636
You enter the data here first,

564
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,263
and these will get arranged.

565
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,766
You enter the title of the book.

566
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,392
And then its number.

567
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,269
You finish that first,

568
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,147
-and you glue these here.
-Right.

569
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,067
All the information is here.
The rest is just manual labor.

570
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,321
LITERATURE

571
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,363
Yeo-reum.

572
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,408
-Hello.
-Hello.

573
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,829
About our morning jog…

574
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,874
You weren't there.

575
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,087
I…

576
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,173
My sneakers…

577
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,843
My sneakers got torn.

578
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,182
I don't think
I'll be able to jog for a while.

579
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,850
I see.

580
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,481
And also…

581
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,944
I'm going to Seoul tomorrow.

582
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,114
I see.

583
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,077
That's good news.

584
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,914
-Right.
-I'm sure you'll do well.

585
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,668
Hey, Part-timer!

586
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,754
Tell me where the library storage is.

587
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,506
Give me a second.

588
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,050
The storage is outside.

589
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,095
-It's outside?
-I'll show you where it is.

590
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,889
I'll be right back, ma'am.

591
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,034
Yeo-reum.

592
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,830
Thank you.

593
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,668
Sure.

594
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,412
This feels nice, doesn't it?

595
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:51,918
You look like a proper city dog
now that you've taken a bath.

596
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,003
You're so cute.

597
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,465
All right.

598
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,511
What else is there to do?

599
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,014
Should I clean the bathroom?

600
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,551
Does that hurt?

601
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,263
Answer me!

602
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,392
The person you are trying to reach…

603
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,310
-is currently unavailable.
-He never picks up when I need him.

604
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,146
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

605
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,399
I don't know the exact size,

606
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,234
but he's an eight-year-old boy.

607
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,319
He's a bit chubby.

608
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,865
For an 8-year-old,
the usual size is 120 to 130.

609
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:10,121
But considering how fast kids grow,
size 140 would be the best.

610
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,920
Do you have that size right now?

611
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,381
Give me a moment. I'll go check.

612
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,306
In life,

613
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,184
there are people I like
and people I dislike.

614
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,192
I can't do anything about that.

615
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,574
But the thing is,

616
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,077
when I dislike someone,
that's the end of it.

617
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,872
It's those I like

618
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,418
that end up making me sad.

619
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,715
Come here.

620
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,805
Those who have broken my heart

621
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:15,061
were the ones that I loved dearly.

622
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,110
I felt just as sad

623
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,239
as how much I liked them.

624
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,867
And now…

625
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:34,330
I'm afraid to love anyone.

626
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,545
I don't want

627
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,007
any more sadness in my life.

628
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,368
I'm being such a drama queen.

629
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,876
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

630
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,897
Dae-bum.

631
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,776
Dae-bum.

632
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,986
Dae-bum.

633
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:48,988
Yeo-reum.

634
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,869
There you are.

635
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,912
What brings you here?

636
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:00,708
Actually…

637
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,632
I wanted to wish you

638
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,927
a safe trip to Seoul and back home.

639
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,014
Pardon?

640
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,767
I wish you…

641
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,396
a safe trip to Seoul

642
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,398
and back home.

643
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,949
I'll be back safe and sound.

644
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,289
You know…

645
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,337
I didn't cancel the movie tickets yet.

646
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,344
Yeo-reum.

647
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,430
Here.

648
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,224
Take these.

649
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,976
What's this?

650
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,311
They're sneakers.

651
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,731
You said your shoes got torn earlier.

652
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,275
But I'm not sure about the size…

653
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,404
Wait, your shoes are…

654
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:14,865
just fine.

655
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,410
You're right.

656
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,540
They became fine.

657
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,128
Then please jog on my behalf
while I'm gone.

658
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,632
Okay.

659
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,740
Summer…

660
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,785
is so nice.

661
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,386
A LIBRARY WITH A HAPPY LIFE
AND A BRIGHT FUTURE

662
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,354
In the very corner of the library,
toward the left side,

663
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,648
you'll see another seat.

664
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,235
That's my favorite seat.

665
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,956
I can't believe he kept
this great spot all to himself.

666
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,675
Hello.

667
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:57,843
-Thank you for coming.
-Hello.

668
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:58,886
It's nothing.

669
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,721
-Go ahead, Dae-bum. I'll go park the car.
-Okay.

670
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,097
-Come to the third floor.
-Okay.

671
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,600
Professor Lee is already there. Let's go.

672
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:08,520
Just relax and tell them what happened.

673
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,243
It's here.

674
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,507
I'm sorry

675
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,342
for calling you here.

676
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,345
All right, then.

677
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,430
-You don't have to. I got it.
-It's fine.

678
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,598
Gosh.

679
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,892
So where's Bom?

680
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,061
She must have gone to get changed.

681
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,773
-You don't need to help. I got it.
-I'm almost done.

682
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,899
Goodness.

683
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,442
Hey.

684
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,360
Bom.

685
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,197
-See you.
-See you.

686
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,240
Goodbye.

687
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:03,325
That's an ice cream cake.
You guys can share it.

688
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,452
Oh, my. Thank you.

689
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,247
Hey, don't do stuff like that for her.

690
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,207
It'll only make my job harder.

691
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,959
Why? She seemed to like it.

692
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,963
Why would you buy such an expensive cake?

693
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,049
Because people like it
when they get nice things.

694
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,759
Heo Jae-hun.

695
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,594
Do you even know
how much I get paid a day?

696
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,806
I'm sorry.
I'll get something cheaper next--

697
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,974
-Hey!
-Hey!

698
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,435
You almost hit us!

699
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,561
Have you lost it?

700
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,895
-Hey, be careful.
-Hey.

701
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,731
-What's wrong with him?
-Maybe it's your bully's friend.

702
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,691
What?

703
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,734
Why would they drive a motorcycle?

704
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,571
Hey, watch out!

705
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,406
Who the hell are you? Do you want to die?

706
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,741
-You must be insane.
-Hey.

707
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,076
Hey, wait!

708
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,536
Bom, move out!

709
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,801
-Hey, Dae-ho!
-Bom!

710
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,763
-When did you get released?
-Just now.

711
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,224
I went to your grandma's,
and she told me you were here.

712
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,142
Hey.

713
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,436
You could have given me a heads-up.

714
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,354
How could you not tell me? Come here.

715
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,149
Wait. I think you've grown a bit taller.

716
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,193
-I have?
-You've gotten so big.

717
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,945
I haven't grown at all
since middle school.

718
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,615
It seems like you've lost some weight.

719
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,617
Well, I worked out a bit.

720
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,827
-Hey, let go!
-What the heck is this?

721
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,912
Get off her.

722
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,043
Who's this guy?

723
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,046
Oh, he's my…

724
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,048
This guy is Bom's boyfriend.

725
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,466
Well…

726
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,051
Let go.

727
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,888
I guess a lot has changed since then.

728
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,891
So who are you?

729
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,643
He's my best friend.

730
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,977
My childhood friend.

731
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,312
-Your best friend?
-Yes.

732
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,856
Why is your best friend…

733
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,651
We can introduce each other later.

734
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,652
Kim Bom.

735
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,196
Hey. Seriously.

736
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,490
Let's hang out soon.

737
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,867
Okay. Take care.

738
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,160
And…

739
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,871
your name is?

740
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,373
It's Heo Jae-hun.

741
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,208
All right. Good to see you too.

742
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,127
-Drive safely.
-See you later.

743
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,295
Bye.

744
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,049
What's wrong with you?

745
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,388
Come on, he's just a friend.

746
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,224
Friends don't hug like that.

747
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,642
It's because we're close.

748
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,435
He's my best friend.

749
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,646
Yes, you can come by today.

750
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,939
BILLIARD CLUB

751
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,399
I'll see you later.

752
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,446
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

753
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:31,051
The footage showed Geun-ho
running out from here.

754
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,594
Did anything happen?

755
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,973
You must be feeling uneasy
about telling him.

756
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,394
It's like you know me
inside out, Ms. Jung.

757
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,646
She's going to take my place
as your granddaughter.

758
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,898
You're here on a vacation, aren't you?

759
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,901
Can't you just consider this something
that happened on your vacation?

760
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,404
Please keep it a secret. I'm so sorry.

761
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,655
Grandma.

762
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,907
Where did she go with all the lights off?

763
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,913
