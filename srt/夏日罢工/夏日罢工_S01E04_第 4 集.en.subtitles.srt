1
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,418
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, GROUPS, AND
ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:46,379
SCENES WITH ANIMALS ARE STAGED
ACCORDING TO ANIMAL WELFARE GUIDELINES

3
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,837
Do you know that it's because of you

4
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,006
that our custodian just stopped cleaning?

5
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,676
Have some coffee.

6
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,272
It's for what happened in Seoul last time.

7
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,774
Sure.

8
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,821
Dae-bum.

9
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,198
You know what?

10
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,077
It won't be the worst thing
to grow old working here together, right?

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,913
And we only have one guest. Bom.

12
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,207
-And that lady.
-Right.

13
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,127
Ms. Lee. That's only two guests.

14
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,795
-And Jun.
-Gosh.

15
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,338
Stop it.

16
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,383
If you think about it,
not being able to work in Seoul

17
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,926
isn't something to be sad about.

18
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,262
The air is polluted there.

19
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,515
And people are always stressed over work.

20
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,600
Right. And the rent is expensive there.

21
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,810
Exactly.

22
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,354
The rent in Seoul is insane, right?

23
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,234
When does the result come out?

24
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,487
I don't know. Why do you ask?

25
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,698
Don't look for me on that day.

26
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,284
I'm going off the grid.

27
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,539
You're going to have to promote this area
to the outsiders for us.

28
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,001
You should do it
while we have a tenant there.

29
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,796
I've already posted it online,

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,214
so let's give it some time.

31
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,216
Really? You already did that?

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,718
Of course.

33
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,679
Hello.

34
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,973
-Goodness. Officer Kwak!
-Hello.

35
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,892
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

36
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,894
Here, Father. This is from Mother.

37
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,437
-Gosh, what's this?
-Have a seat.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,522
-Have some coffee before you leave.
-Sorry.

39
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,441
-I have somewhere to be.
-Really?

40
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,526
-I'll come again next time.
-Mu-cheol.

41
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,821
I was going to ask you a favor.

42
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,823
What about?

43
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,199
You know my building, right?

44
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,951
Sure.

45
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,204
Can you patrol around my building
every now and then?

46
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,248
Did something happen?

47
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,711
Some punk drew hideous graffiti
on my building last night.

48
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,213
A graffiti?

49
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,924
What did it say?

50
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,969
It was something along the lines
of "I'm going to kill you."

51
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,304
Goodness.

52
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,306
We don't even have CCTV in that area.

53
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,435
I apologize.
I'll be more vigilant from now on.

54
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,188
Yes. Please keep an eye on it if you can.

55
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,690
-Of course.
-I feel so relieved

56
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,859
-thanks to you, Mu-cheol.
-Sure.

57
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,490
Gosh, my head.

58
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,638
I don't feel well.

59
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,937
What's this?

60
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,192
It's dried pollack soup.

61
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,673
That's nice.

62
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,387
Who did all this?

63
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,270
Grandma wanted to thank you
for bringing Dad home.

64
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,522
Also, thanks for the pencils.

65
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,400
It's that student from the library.

66
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,250
What is that?

67
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,010
What happened to me?

68
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,222
What did I do yesterday?

69
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,443
WITHDREW: 400,000 WON
REMAINING BALANCE: 4.5 MILLION WON

70
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,694
What? 400,000 won?

71
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,324
When did I withdraw 400,000 won?

72
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,327
What happened?

73
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,542
WITHDREW: 500,000 WON
REMAINING BALANCE: 0 WON

74
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,878
Zero?

75
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,305
Ma'am, I came here yesterday, right?

76
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,933
Are you finally sober?

77
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,519
What's up with your face?

78
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,233
I withdrew cash from here, didn't I?

79
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,112
Don't you remember fighting the ATM?

80
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,033
You! You took my money!

81
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,284
Give it back!

82
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,953
Give me back my money!

83
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,788
Damn it. Give it back!

84
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,165
-Gosh.
-Give me back my money!

85
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,708
What's wrong with you?

86
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,877
Why are you hitting this?
Is your hand okay?

87
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,547
This thing ate up my money
and it won't give it back.

88
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,174
I have so much more money than this.

89
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,679
I was right to be worried
when you bought those liquor earlier.

90
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,140
You can only withdraw up
to 400,000 won a day.

91
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,516
You can't withdraw more.

92
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,227
Why not? It's my money.

93
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,687
Well…

94
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,606
Come back again when you're sober.

95
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,942
No. I have to withdraw the money now.

96
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,528
-Immediately!
-Hey!

97
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,614
Sober up.

98
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,410
And go to the bank downtown tomorrow
to withdraw your money.

99
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,123
Right. I can always go to the bank.

100
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,791
Thank you so much.

101
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,423
Gosh, your money. Hey!

102
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,385
You're leaving breadcrumb trails
with money.

103
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,513
You've got a rough night ahead of you.

104
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,558
Why are you acting like this
in the middle of the night?

105
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,435
-I'm so sorry.
-Goodness, gracious.

106
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,815
You shouldn't be out this late
wandering around drunk.

107
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,109
-How will you take care of the money?
-I'm sorry.

108
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,028
Gosh. Put the money in here.

109
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,200
Goodness. Here.

110
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,451
-Now go.
-What?

111
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,245
Why are you giving this to me?

112
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,876
Here, you can use this.

113
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,213
If you want to give me money,

114
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,382
give it to me when you're sober tomorrow.

115
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,677
Why won't you take it? I'm loaded!

116
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,804
Just put your shoes back on and go home!

117
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,391
-Go! Go home!
-No. I don't want to.

118
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,601
Hurry up and go!

119
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,437
-Bye, bye.
-Gosh.

120
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,607
-Goodbye!
-Goodness.

121
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,610
The liquor drank you last night.

122
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,156
So I… and the money…

123
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,033
And the plastic bag…

124
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,536
I put it in a black plastic bag
in case you lose it.

125
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,291
When I was walking by here again,

126
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,835
was I carrying the black plastic bag?

127
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,088
You didn't come back
until the store was closed,

128
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,381
so I wouldn't know.

129
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,636
Did you lose it?

130
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,558
Hurry and visit the bank again.
You might've left it there.

131
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,936
Thank you.

132
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,950
Chang-su!

133
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,326
Come out here for a moment.

134
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,373
Goodness. What brings you here?

135
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,876
There's a lot you're upset about
because of me, right?

136
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,713
-Sorry?
-I understand.

137
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,923
You must've been irritated

138
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,842
about losing the building.

139
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,845
-That's not true, sir.
-Is that why you did it?

140
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,638
-Sorry?
-What did you say?

141
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,099
What are you talking about?

142
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,604
I'm asking if you guys did that
on my building last night.

143
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,022
-What?
-What's this nonsense?

144
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,315
On a witch-hunt again?

145
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,525
Get lost. We have a business to run.

146
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,195
You guys are busted.

147
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,448
This here.

148
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,661
Be honest with me here and
tell me what you did with this last night.

149
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,871
Ridiculous.

150
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,789
That canister?

151
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,874
NO PARKING

152
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,000
We wrote that.

153
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,585
Why?

154
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,962
Do we need your approval
to write that over there?

155
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,049
Why are you trying to pick a fight
with ridiculous accusations?

156
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,052
What did you say?
How dare you take that tone with me?

157
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,720
Is it a fight you want?

158
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,971
-All right then.
-Please.

159
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,641
We'll both be
on the prime-time news today.

160
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,726
-Please stop.
-Come over here!

161
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,728
-Goodness, gracious.
-Calm down, please.

162
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,063
-Come here.
-I apologize.

163
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,356
A black plastic bag?

164
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,858
Who would put their money in there?

165
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,817
Why?

166
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,862
-It wasn't here?
-If it was,

167
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,530
someone must have taken it.

168
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,240
It's money in a plastic bag.

169
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:04,372
Would it be possible to check
the CCTV footage for the ATM?

170
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,166
We have some procedures.

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,378
So please fill this out
and come back tomorrow.

172
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,880
-So the stamp…
-Is there any way I can see it today?

173
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,757
This is really urgent.

174
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,966
That won't be possible.

175
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,134
Please fill this out

176
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,719
-and come back tomorrow.
-Seong-man.

177
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,931
-Isn't she the one you searched before?
-Please, I need it today.

178
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,225
I'll go and watch it in a flash.

179
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,560
Don't mind her.

180
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,145
So what were we talking about?

181
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,480
Seong-man.

182
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,483
Loans are different
from lending money to a friend.

183
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,068
-Next in line, please.
-Hold on. What's going on there?

184
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,028
Hey, how about just 20 million won?

185
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,072
-Next in line.
-Please.

186
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,158
-Please, I'm begging you.
-What's wrong?

187
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,537
Hello. We met the other time.

188
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,123
Hello.

189
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,752
Do you know what time you were here
approximately?

190
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,547
What time was it?

191
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,675
Why ask for the footage
if you don't even know the time?

192
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,385
It's fine. We can just look for it.

193
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,933
Here. Isn't this you?

194
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,519
This is you, right?

195
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:11,355
-Goodness.
-I think that is me.

196
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,441
Why are you crawling in?

197
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,776
You seem… What was wrong with you?

198
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,696
Hey, she was drunk.

199
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,865
Goodness.

200
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:25,244
Why did you come in drunk
looking to withdraw money?

201
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,121
What's that?

202
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,039
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.

203
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,710
Are you talking about
that black plastic bag?

204
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,462
This must be it.

205
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,756
You're holding it like a purse.
I thought it was a purse.

206
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,009
You're struggling.

207
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,553
I don't think you…

208
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:47,016
It seems like you couldn't
remember your PIN code.

209
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,642
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,896
-He's right.
-Gosh, that startled me.

211
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,690
I don't think you withdrew…

212
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,525
Where did you go?

213
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,777
Oh, you fell. That surprised me.

214
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,738
Gosh, this is annoying. Just skip over.

215
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,741
Goodness.

216
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,536
-Did you get the money or…
-She must have withdrawn it.

217
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,704
Stop here.

218
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,584
-There you go.
-You got the money.

219
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,128
Why would you withdraw
so much money late at night?

220
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,588
Goodness.

221
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,798
You should have put it in your wallet.

222
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,717
Why would you put it in a plastic bag?

223
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,344
You didn't leave the money.

224
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,890
You're supposed to pull the door,
not climb on it.

225
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,226
Gosh, this is annoying. Fast forward.

226
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,395
And you just left like that.

227
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,357
Thank you for showing me this.

228
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,318
I think you dropped it on your way back.
You should look for it.

229
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,653
-Okay?
-Okay.

230
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,447
Hold on!

231
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,907
-Who is this?
-What's this?

232
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,909
-Something flew by.
-Play it.

233
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,662
-What?
-What?

234
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,623
-Something flew by.
-Is that me?

235
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,292
-Who else would it be?
-You tripped again.

236
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,544
Someone came running.

237
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,757
That long-haired guy is Dae-bum.

238
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,345
Why would he be here at that hour?

239
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,305
This punk.

240
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,016
He picked up the money, but not you.

241
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,478
Look at her.

242
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,773
Look how relaxed she is
now that her exam is over.

243
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,899
I wasn't sleeping.

244
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,193
-Hello, Yeo-reum.
-Hello.

245
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,365
Mr. Librarian, could we talk for a moment?

246
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,575
Sure, of course.

247
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,746
Where are you two going?

248
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,957
Go back to sleep.

249
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,294
-Where are you going?
-Go to sleep.

250
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,504
Why are you leaving me all alone?

251
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,299
Did we…

252
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,759
We met yesterday, right?

253
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,344
Yes.

254
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,347
Let's talk over some cold drinks.

255
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,308
Thank you.

256
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,269
She doesn't remember seeing you yesterday.

257
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,313
Really?

258
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,482
By any chance,

259
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,694
do you remember the black plastic bag…

260
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,739
that I was carrying?

261
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,449
Of course.

262
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,702
We watched the CCTV footage from the bank,

263
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,038
and you took
the black plastic bag with you.

264
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,290
I was…

265
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,335
carrying it for you
so you wouldn't lose it.

266
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,003
What about that?

267
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:26,467
Could you tell me
what happened then in detail?

268
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,345
She's been freaking out
because she lost that plastic bag.

269
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,387
What?

270
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,805
Please tell me.

271
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,186
Last night,

272
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,481
you tripped in front of the bank.

273
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,359
-What's with her?
-Gosh.

274
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,486
My money.

275
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,112
Are you okay?

276
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,283
Mr. Librarian.

277
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,247
How did you come to find me
from so far away?

278
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,708
I'll carry this in case you lose it.

279
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,876
I'll give it back.

280
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,921
I'm a bit drunk.

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,425
-I'm a little bit drunk.
-Right.

282
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,177
Are you okay?

283
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,222
Goodness.

284
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,728
I've seen this happen before somewhere.

285
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,729
Sorry?

286
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,023
Where was it?

287
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,859
The library!

288
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,277
Yes! The library!

289
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,740
Why do you always show up
whenever I'm drunk?

290
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,076
-When did I…
-Ready.

291
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,787
-Sorry?
-Ready?

292
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,791
Ready! Why do you appear before my eyes

293
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,878
Whenever I'm drunk

294
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,630
-Everyone!
-Come on, let's go.

295
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,425
Why do you appear before my eyes

296
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,345
Whenever I'm drunk

297
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,848
Blah blah blah

298
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,309
Why does your face keep
Appearing in my mind

299
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,359
You're going home now, right?

300
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,528
-Home?
-Yes.

301
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,573
The billiard club?

302
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,741
Yes.

303
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,869
That's not a home.

304
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,127
Gosh, that hurts.

305
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,338
Nothing happened on the way home, right?

306
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,050
In the morning,

307
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,177
my face…

308
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,930
You guys didn't
have a fight yesterday, right?

309
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,938
Mr. Librarian.

310
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,733
What brings you all the way here?

311
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,943
You didn't take this with you.

312
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,077
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

313
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,161
Okay.

314
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,873
-Is it okay if I ask right now?
-Sure.

315
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,009
On the day
we slept in the library together…

316
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,720
Sorry?

317
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,348
What?

318
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,809
Do you seriously not remember that day?

319
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,935
That's not what I mean.

320
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,813
We slept together
in the library that night.

321
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,439
We didn't sleep together.

322
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,399
-We slept in different rooms.
-Forget it.

323
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,194
That's not the issue here.

324
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,282
In the morning, did you hear me or not?

325
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,328
What was I supposed to hear?

326
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,127
The trickle.

327
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,172
I do not understand
what you're talking about.

328
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,426
Stop acting like you didn't.

329
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,269
That really hurt.

330
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,272
Why did you just do that to me?

331
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,774
Why do you keep pushing me?

332
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,401
You almost tripped, so…

333
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,279
You've been pushing since a while ago.

334
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,323
You didn't even use your hand,
but you used that plastic bag!

335
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,533
Am I that filthy?

336
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,286
Am I possessed or something?

337
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,080
Look at this. You're avoiding me again.

338
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,915
Please.

339
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,793
All I want to do is live my life.

340
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,921
All I want to do is live my life
drunk like this.

341
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,550
So please just leave me alone!

342
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,428
I'm so upset.

343
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,764
Indeed. I'm also wondering
what I'm doing here right now.

344
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,726
Please. I beg of you.

345
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,937
It's nice to meet all of you.

346
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,037
That hurts.

347
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,540
Is my nose gone? I think it's gone.

348
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,209
No, your nose is still intact.

349
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,669
My nose.

350
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,087
But there's a scar.

351
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,093
You just dodged, didn't you?

352
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,890
-I'm sorry.
-So it's true.

353
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,353
So it's true that everyone hates me here.

354
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,520
Well, you were…

355
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,940
It's fine.

356
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,858
Today is the last day.

357
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,154
Hold this. Grab this.

358
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,913
So how old are you?

359
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,540
I'm 28 years old.

360
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,625
For real?

361
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,130
We're the same age!
Hey, we're the same age.

362
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,258
Hey, follow me. I'll buy you something.

363
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,927
Hey, come with me.

364
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,303
Hurry up.

365
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,230
We're here. Finally here!

366
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,899
We're here! It's this place.

367
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,860
Hey, buy everything you want to eat.
It's on me.

368
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,113
I don't think we can right now.

369
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,115
Why not?

370
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,950
The store is closed.

371
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,994
ANGOK SUPERMARKET

372
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,376
We have some liquor left in my house.

373
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,962
-Let's go!
-I'll be going home from here.

374
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,463
What?

375
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,382
No!

376
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,468
I can't take that. No!

377
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,478
Hey!

378
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,315
I told you to take this with you!

379
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,403
You threw me that bag and just left?

380
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,529
Yes.

381
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,824
This means

382
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,953
that you dropped the bag somewhere
on your way home.

383
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,583
I am sorry.

384
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,919
I should have taken you
back to your home safely.

385
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,004
No, it's fine.

386
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,634
Anyway, thank you for last night.

387
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,974
I told you so.

388
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,186
I told you nothing good will happen
if you live there.

389
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,773
Yeo-reum, goodbye.

390
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,691
That looks painful.

391
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,863
What happened? Tell me.

392
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,239
-You want to know?
-Yes.

393
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,866
Goodness.

394
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,792
If I wasn't there,
she couldn't have watched the footage.

395
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,628
I begged Yeong-sam to let her watch it.

396
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,258
Weren't you tired from driving that night?
But you still went out?

397
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,636
I was only out for a walk.

398
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,472
Dae-bum sure is young.

399
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,226
Why do people act like that
when they're drunk?

400
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,019
Tell me about it.

401
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,396
Drinking always gets the best of us.

402
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,108
She lost all her money,
so she'll be drinking again today.

403
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,026
The way I see it,
she'll never find that money.

404
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,195
She lost all her money? How much?

405
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,782
-Fifty million won?
-"Fifty million."

406
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,742
Not that much. She lost five million.

407
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,910
Five million.

408
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,412
Then she should call the cops.

409
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,707
You think that'll help her find the money?

410
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,793
Even if I don't try to kick her out,

411
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,795
she can't afford to live here anymore.

412
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,548
Ji-yeong, I'm heading out.

413
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,549
Where?

414
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,218
-I might run late.
-Where are you going?

415
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:51,972
He's acting weird.

416
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,932
What's so weird?

417
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,934
Why are you always making a fuss here?
Get out of here.

418
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,977
Me?

419
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,729
"Master yourself, master the enemy."

420
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,482
If you know yourself and your enemy,
you'll never lose.

421
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,026
I don't know what you're fighting,
but I hope you win.

422
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,027
Good luck.

423
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,197
Hey, Ji-yeong. When do you get off work?

424
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,117
-In two days.
-Goodness.

425
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,043
Where are you?

426
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,380
Let's see.

427
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,258
Why did I withdraw money when I was drunk?

428
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,761
Hey, did you not see where I put the bag?

429
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,014
Remember, Yeo-reum.

430
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,349
Darn it.

431
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,939
Please.

432
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,984
Please be it.

433
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,905
Please, I beg you.

434
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,660
Damn it!

435
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,252
GRANDMA WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR BRINGING DAD HOME

436
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,253
ALSO, THANKS FOR THE PENCILS

437
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,387
Anyone home?

438
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,139
Who is it?

439
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,440
Oh, my. Hello.

440
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,652
Goodness. What brings you here?

441
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,070
Come on in.

442
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,031
-Hello.
-The place is a bit of a mess.

443
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,701
Sit here.

444
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,537
-Thank you.
-I finally got to meet you again.

445
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,706
I was curious how you were.

446
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,708
-So?
-Well,

447
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,336
I was wondering
where your granddaughter is.

448
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,338
You didn't meet her?

449
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,090
She went to your house this morning.

450
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,050
No, I didn't.

451
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,594
So you didn't.

452
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,890
By the way,

453
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,476
did you try the dried pollack soup?

454
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,354
She randomly called me in the morning

455
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,691
and asked me
how to make dried pollack soup.

456
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,611
I see.

457
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,947
It was delicious.

458
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,491
I hope she cooked it well.

459
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:24,040
When did the two of you become friends?

460
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,215
-I'll be going now.
-All right.

461
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,802
I picked some tomatoes recently.

462
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,096
-Give me a second.
-It's fine, ma'am.

463
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,681
Just wait here a bit.

464
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,934
You really don't need to get it.
I'll get going.

465
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,484
Wait.

466
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,695
Here, take this.

467
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,366
My granddaughter.

468
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,869
Please take good care of her.

469
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,258
Let's start here and search
everywhere I could have gone.

470
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,179
I must find it.
I will find it no matter what.

471
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,813
Could I look in your plastic bag?

472
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,029
Gosh!

473
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,656
-What are you doing?
-I lost something.

474
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,617
Announcement to all residents.

475
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,702
The lady that lives by the stream

476
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,790
in the billiard club has lost her money.

477
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,794
She says it was lost when she was wasted
from liquor last night.

478
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,630
If any of the residents
find a black plastic bag

479
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:58,259
holding 4.5 million won,

480
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,263
Please report it to the community center.

481
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,350
I repeat.

482
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:10,230
If any of the residents find
a black plastic bag with 10,000 won bills,

483
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,651
please notify the community center.

484
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,339
Ms. Lee.

485
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,678
Well…

486
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,763
Here.

487
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,611
Where did you find this?

488
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,405
Last night,

489
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,868
I took it home by accident.

490
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,912
What?

491
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,666
I thought that I gave it to you.

492
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,254
You said you gave it to me before.

493
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,797
That I took it.

494
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,549
I'm sorry.

495
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,845
You know

496
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,598
I've been looking for this all day.

497
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,558
Darn it.

498
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,394
Did you just not care
since it's not your problem?

499
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,188
I am sorry.

500
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,900
I clearly asked you this afternoon.

501
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,402
I remember asking you.

502
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,537
Anyway,

503
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,541
thank you for finding it.

504
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,403
Grandma told me you came looking for me.

505
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,828
Why were you looking for me?

506
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,920
Nothing's wrong anymore.
The problem is solved now.

507
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,259
So I can go, right?

508
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,971
By the way…

509
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,102
thank you for the dried pollack soup.

510
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,479
Sure.

511
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,065
But be careful.

512
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,276
You can end up dead drinking like that.

513
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,155
Do you…

514
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,660
want some ramyeon?

515
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,704
Sorry?

516
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,210
I'm sorry,

517
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,004
but can you wait just a minute?

518
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,798
I think I need to go buy some ramyeon.

519
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,010
Let's go together then.

520
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,013
I don't want to stay alone
in someone else's home.

521
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,348
Sure.

522
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,854
Who is it?

523
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,358
Excuse me!

524
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,077
Hey, Heo Jae-hun! What are you up to?

525
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,579
You knew it was me?

526
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,708
Why would you wear a mask
when it's so obvious?

527
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,126
Do you know him?

528
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,588
No. You don't need to know him. Let's go.

529
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,256
Wait. What do you mean?

530
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,342
Hello.

531
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,595
I'm Heo Jae-hun, Bom's classmate.

532
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,681
But why were you in that building?

533
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,725
Well,

534
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,228
Bom doesn't come to school often
so I was worried,

535
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,439
and I kind of missed her.

536
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,942
Stop spewing nonsense.

537
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,361
-Let's just go.
-Wait.

538
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,488
Where are you two going?

539
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,948
To buy ramyeon.

540
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,783
Really? That's great.

541
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,618
I make the best ramyeon.

542
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,078
-If you…
-Don't follow us.

543
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,080
Hey, let's go together.
I'm a master at it.

544
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,165
-I said get lost.
-But you have to try.

545
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,418
Let's go together.

546
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,256
What happened to you?

547
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,844
Were you looking for Yeo-reum's money?

548
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,929
Yes.

549
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,848
-Did you find it?
-Yes.

550
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,892
Really?

551
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,978
Impressive. I thought it was a lost cause.

552
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,064
So you gave it to her?

553
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,733
Yes.

554
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,615
Don't you think you're meddling
too much in other's business?

555
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,659
-This isn't like you.
-Ji-yeong.

556
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,037
I'm hungry.

557
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,874
This place is so cool, Yeo-reum.

558
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,501
It's like a studio in New York.

559
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,753
New York, my foot.

560
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,423
I thought you were injured before.
Are you okay?

561
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,383
I'm strong, so it's fine.

562
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,593
Should I cook the ramyeon there?

563
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,930
-I'll cook it.
-No, it's fine. I got it.

564
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,350
You two don't even lift a finger.

565
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,436
You'll be dazzled when you try my ramyeon.

566
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,938
So, does the water boil
from you running your mouth?

567
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,357
-Actually, fire does that.
-So annoying.

568
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,192
I shouldn't have let you tag along.

569
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:59,495
Is it okay if I call you Bom?

570
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,290
Sure.

571
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,917
I have something to tell you.

572
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,045
What is it?

573
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,172
Bom.

574
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,592
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,595
-I'm so sorry.
-What?

576
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,806
All of a sudden? Why?

577
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,350
About visiting your home

578
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,020
and misunderstanding you.

579
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,106
I'm sincerely sorry.

580
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,318
Why are you apologizing?

581
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,237
I was the one being mean.

582
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,990
You had to pay a lot for the dog
because of me.

583
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,200
That's fine.

584
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,578
I'll pay you back as much as I can.

585
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,540
Are you saying you're going to
get revenge on me?

586
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,335
That's not what I mean.

587
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,254
-Yeo-reum!
-Hey!

588
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,006
What happened?

589
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,966
I didn't do anything.

590
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,176
This is…

591
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,597
It's because there's a leak in the pipe,
and it's only taped up.

592
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,395
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Move your hand.

593
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,234
You're going to have to throw that away.
The pipe is shattered.

594
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,777
Really?

595
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,196
I'll go to Mr. Bae and get a new one.

596
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,156
-Stay here.
-No need.

597
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,075
We agreed that I'd fix these things.

598
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,827
What? That's ridiculous.

599
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,829
Just wait here. I'll get you a new one.

600
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,747
-Let me tag along.
-Hey.

601
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,917
Just stop getting in the way,
mop up the floor,

602
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,086
and watch the dog properly.

603
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,504
Hey!

604
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,589
-I'll leave it to you, then.
-Yeo-reum!

605
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,974
What's your name?

606
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,268
Mr. Bae!

607
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,437
Who is it?

608
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,815
Gosh, you're here.

609
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,109
Mr. Bae, how could you be like this?

610
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,194
I know.

611
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,865
-I'm sorry.
-You should be.

612
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,909
The water pipe shattered
so she can't use the water there.

613
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,536
The sink was breaking down.

614
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,914
Shouldn't the landlord
be fixing it for the tenant?

615
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,129
-You're talking about that?
-Then what?

616
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,505
It's fine, Bom.

617
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,757
I can fix it myself.

618
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,427
-Just give me a pipe for the sink.
-No way.

619
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,470
I'll fix it.

620
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,223
I should be the one fixing it.

621
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,393
You two can head home first.

622
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,061
I'll be there with the parts.

623
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,104
-Mr. Bae.
-Yes?

624
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,773
You better hurry. We need to cook ramyeon.

625
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,317
All right. I'll hurry.

626
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,986
Yeo-reum, you should go with Bom.

627
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,030
Let's go.

628
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,084
Bom!

629
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,962
Bom, come out here!

630
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,175
-What do you want?
-Just come down here.

631
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,552
Who are you? You come down too.

632
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,511
Okay.

633
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,019
You're so annoying. What do you want?

634
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,563
Look who's here.

635
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,192
You're the kid from the library.

636
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,527
He's my son.

637
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,905
Say hello to the grown-ups.

638
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:21,948
Hello.

639
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,532
Hey.

640
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,619
He really wanted to see Billiard Lady.

641
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,454
Me?

642
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,248
What's up with you all of a sudden?

643
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,335
Anyway, I brought some things you can use,

644
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,003
so why don't we bring these up?

645
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,256
Hello, I'm Bom's friend from school…

646
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,008
Great. Good to see you.
You carry the heavy things with me.

647
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,053
Bom and Yeo-reum.
You can just move the small things.

648
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,013
And Jun. You know what to do.

649
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,181
The lights.

650
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,976
Are you giving those to me?

651
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,061
They're nothing special.
Try carrying this.

652
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,646
-It's light.
-Well…

653
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,816
You're giving her
all of this for free, right?

654
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,610
Of course it's for free.

655
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,529
You're giving me all of these?

656
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,240
-It's not much anyway.
-Let's just go up.

657
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,242
-Go up.
-He's the generous type.

658
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,952
That's not heavy. Come here.

659
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,287
Get the big things first.

660
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,122
Come over there. Grab this.

661
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,798
Geun-ho. What are you doing over there?

662
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,675
Come and eat.

663
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,484
Geun-ho.

664
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,448
You can never go outside, okay?

665
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,371
Should we place it next to the bed?

666
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,584
The lights are working well now.

667
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,877
Thank you.

668
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,340
Look at you. You're pretty good, Bom.

669
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,177
I'm the only one who knows
how to do these things at home.

670
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,806
Hey, Bom.

671
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,686
About the part-time job I offered you,

672
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,522
that's between us, okay?

673
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,150
What's with you today?

674
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,694
Does Yeo-reum have something on you?

675
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,946
Like what?

676
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,200
You didn't…

677
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,327
Did you hear something?

678
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,205
So there is something, then.

679
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,998
What do you mean?

680
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,167
Yeo-reum! It's working now.

681
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,920
Did you fix it?

682
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,590
-You can fix things like this?
-What a surprise, Bom.

683
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,967
Tell me something you can't do.

684
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,346
I knew it when I saw you
ripping off that tape.

685
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,680
You're like Macgyver.

686
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,017
Why does he keep talking?

687
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,270
The door downstairs doesn't lock,
so I'll go take a look.

688
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,242
-Excuse me. Here.
-It's fine.

689
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,079
-You gave me so many--
-Hold it.

690
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,459
There. It's sturdy now.

691
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:21,877
Here.

692
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,587
It's fine.

693
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,966
I also brought you a lock chain.

694
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,760
-You have to keep your doors locked.
-Okay.

695
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:33,055
You saw the hideous graffiti.

696
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,058
-Please take this.
-No need.

697
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,103
Just think of it as an all-inclusive deal.

698
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,022
-But still, it's too much.
-It's all right.

699
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,191
They are all used products anyway.

700
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,653
Just use them well and return them later.

701
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,822
I almost forgot.

702
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,073
Hey, Jun!

703
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,452
He's bringing it.

704
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,459
I'm sorry.

705
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,295
About what?

706
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,426
He broke open his piggy bank

707
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,928
to buy this for you.

708
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,224
Why are you being so nice to me today?

709
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,144
Yeo-reum.

710
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,772
What I'm about to say right now

711
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,693
is a bit embarrassing for me.

712
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,945
Well…

713
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
Goodbye.

714
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,784
My son loves to go to the supermarket
in the morning to buy pastries.

715
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,288
And on his way out of the store today,

716
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,791
he picked up the money. Your money.

717
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,171
He's the one who found it?

718
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,672
Tell me about it.

719
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,300
Isn't it a relief
that my son picked it up though?

720
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,135
Where did he find it?

721
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,638
Well, actually…

722
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,891
-Right here.
-Here?

723
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,898
No way!

724
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,570
He picked up a plastic bag
loaded with money on the street,

725
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:15,783
thinking that this was
a gift for him from the heavens.

726
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,953
He's read too many comic books.

727
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,038
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

728
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,748
But…

729
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,584
Mr. Librarian had it.

730
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,253
That was because

731
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,714
my son heard the announcement
that my dad made,

732
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,716
and that made him realize
what was going on.

733
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,844
After hearing that, he got scared
and ran over to Dae-bum.

734
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,721
And I went to the PC cafe with it…

735
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,309
What's ridiculous is that he went
running to Dae-bum, not to me.

736
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,273
I've been meaning to ask.

737
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,651
Did Dae-bum mention my son

738
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,696
when he gave you the money?

739
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,456
No, he didn't.

740
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,545
I wanted to ask you a favor.

741
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,963
I don't want anyone

742
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,258
to know about what Jun did.

743
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,176
Of course. I won't tell anyone.

744
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,596
Thank you so much.

745
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,599
And I'm very sorry.

746
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,393
I'll be going then.

747
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,228
It's…

748
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,106
It's not Jun's fault.

749
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,109
After all, I'm the one who lost it.

750
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,986
And don't worry.

751
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,739
I'd be too embarrassed
to talk about what happened.

752
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,450
Thank you so much.

753
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:46,373
If there's anything you need
or something that needs to be fixed,

754
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,500
call me immediately, okay?

755
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,128
Thank you.

756
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,055
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

757
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,851
Hey, Yeo-reum.

758
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,729
Look how much better it looks.
It finally feels like a home.

759
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,272
Indeed.

760
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,399
Mr. Bae finally did some good today.

761
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,068
Is that pizza?

762
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,153
-Yes.
-I've been craving this.

763
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,488
I'm hungry. Can we eat it?

764
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,323
Of course.

765
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,868
Hey. Why are you still here
when you're not even cooking ramyeon?

766
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,579
-Get lost.
-Stop being so stingy about food.

767
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,040
By the way, what's the dog's name?

768
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,043
He doesn't have one yet.

769
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,921
Really? Then let's give him a name.

770
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,716
Well, I actually have a name in mind.

771
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,051
What is it?

772
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,470
His fur is snow white,

773
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,765
so how about Gyeo-ul, as in "winter"?

774
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,475
Named after seasons, just like us.

775
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,018
That's brilliant!

776
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,436
-Really?
-Yes.

777
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,730
What? That sounds weird.

778
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,981
How about this?

779
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,358
What about Demian?

780
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,318
"Demian"? Demian, my foot.

781
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,070
You just keep eating your pizza.

782
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,738
Where's Demian?

783
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,448
-You want pizza?
-Hey!

784
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,658
-Don't give him pizza!
-You can't give him pizza!

785
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,660
-Demian can't…
-You like the name, right?

786
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,121
You called him Demian.

787
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,039
-I did? When?
-You did.

788
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,250
-I said Gyeo-ul.
-So it's decided, Demian.

789
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,751
-I called it Gyeo-ul, right?
-She said Demian.

790
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,086
I like Gyeo-ul better.

791
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,838
You see? She likes Gyeo-ul better.

792
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,800
PARKING LOT

793
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,512
-Hey, Jun.
-Yes?

794
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,557
-I'm heartbroken.
-Why?

795
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,600
How could you tell Dae-bum first

796
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,686
and not me?

797
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,729
I'm very upset.

798
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,648
Dad, what about that?

799
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,692
You go bring it.

800
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,615
What's this?

801
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,371
Dad!

802
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,458
-What?
-That.

803
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,919
Open it.

804
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,297
THANK YOU
FROM YEO-REUM

805
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,300
Gosh, this lady.

806
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,595
It's fine.

807
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,974
The Billiard Lady gave it to us
to say thank you.

808
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,518
-Really?
-Yes. You can have it.

809
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,189
-Jun.
-Yes?

810
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,400
You can't tell Grandpa
what happened today.

811
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,485
Sure.

812
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,489
Dad. I'm hungry. Can we also have pizza?

813
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,115
Gosh, you brat.

814
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,117
What kind of pizza do you want?

815
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,286
-Bulgogi!
-Bulgogi!

816
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,537
-Deal!
-Deal!

817
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,415
-You order it. You have their number.
-Okay.

818
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,893
I thought everyone in this town…

819
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:58,899
No, I thought everyone in
this world hated me.

820
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,699
I don't remember anything else,

821
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,493
but I do remember this one thing.

822
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,579
That is…

823
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,706
hatred.

824
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,754
I wanted to leave this place,

825
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,965
so I wished all my money was gone.

826
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,806
In my world, I was the victim.
And they were the assailant.

827
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,061
But the opposite happened today.

828
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,857
Where did you get those tomatoes?

829
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,943
Your Grandma

830
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,862
gave me these.

831
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:46,989
Really?

832
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,408
When did she give you these?

833
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,202
Yeo-reum.

834
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:59,376
Did you know this is where Dae-bum
used to live when he was young?

835
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,461
No.

836
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:06,508
To be exact, his family ran
the billiard club in this building.

837
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,096
Then who is Seon-a?

838
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,181
Seon-a is Dae-bum's older sister.

839
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,851
Apparently, his older sister was
an absolute genius.

840
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,062
SEON-A

841
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,984
You must have heard about Jun.

842
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,236
It was my fault for not telling you.

843
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,240
More people die from loneliness
than starvation these days.

844
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,992
You should go out and meet someone.

845
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,577
Are you two married?

846
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,621
No. We're not.

847
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:21,375
He's too competent to be here
working for a countryside library.

848
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,418
You must care about him a lot.

849
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,754
We've spent a long time together.

850
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,006
You're finally going to make it to Seoul.

851
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,091
Come with me.

852
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,388
