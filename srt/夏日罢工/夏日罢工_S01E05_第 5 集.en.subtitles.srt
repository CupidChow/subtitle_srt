Dad?

SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

7
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,739
Seon-a.

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,369
Seon-a, where are you?

9
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,216
Ahn Seon-a.

10
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,801
Why are you lying here?

11
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,387
Seon-a, wake up. Wake up now.

12
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,431
I told you to wake up!

13
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,600
Wake up.

14
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,021
She must have been exhausted.

15
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,272
-Let's go home.
-Seon-a.

16
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,899
-You'll be okay after some rest.
-Seon-a.

17
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,485
-You can't do this. Please stop.
-My baby.

18
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,736
Wake up, Seon-a.

19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,154
You can't be doing this.

20
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,490
-She's just really exhausted!
-Please.

21
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,575
Wake up, Ahn Seon-a!

22
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,454
You should have been there!

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,666
Why would you leave your sister alone?

24
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,084
Why?

25
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,338
Why did it have to be Seon-a and not you?

26
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,969
Hey, kid.

27
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,723
Are you Ahn Seon-a's little brother?

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,520
I heard you were the one who found her.

29
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,897
Did you see anything strange?

30
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,951
Was your sister alone in the billiard club
when you went out to play?

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,121
Hey.

32
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,998
Answer me!

33
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,249
Hey.

34
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,168
Why would you shout at a kid?

35
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,797
Goodness.

36
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,465
We're sorry.

37
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,593
Hey.

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,762
I heard your sister was
a well-known prodigy.

39
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,099
Then you must be smart as well.

40
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,021
You must like yo-yos.

41
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,106
My son is always playing with them too.

42
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,526
It's okay. You can keep playing with it.

43
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,913
Do you want me to take you
to your mom and dad?

44
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,461
All right. Let's go.

45
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,465
Mister.

46
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,098
-Come out this way.
-Please move.

47
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,725
Why are you doing this?

48
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,685
Honey.

49
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,146
Why are you taking him?

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,147
Honey.

51
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,815
This can't be happening.

52
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,442
Honey.

53
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,236
Honey.

54
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,988
Why is this happening?
I can't believe this.

55
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,950
Honey.

56
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:13,503
A mathematically gifted young girl
who gained popularity on a quiz show

57
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,339
was found in a billiard club,
strangled to death.

58
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,342
This is now known
as the Math Prodigy Murder Case.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,469
Shockingly, the culprit was found to be

60
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:25,056
-the victim's father, Ahn.
-Goodness. I feel so bad for them.

61
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,934
That father is nothing but a beast.

62
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,561
How can he kill
his own daughter like that?

63
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,731
Lower your voice.

ANGOK SUPERMARKET

65
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,360
-Do you want that?
-Yes.

66
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,321
Thanks.

67
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,615
Dae-bum.

68
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,660
-Take this home.
-It's okay.

69
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,248
I heard he told the police.

70
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,458
Watch your words in front of the kid.

71
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,210
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

72
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,963
Mom, I'm home.

73
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,590
Mom?

74
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,267
Mom, I'm home.

75
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,353
Mom.

76
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,939
Mom!

77
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,088
"About what happened last time…"

78
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,424
That's not it.

79
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,640
I'M SORRY, MR. LIBRARIAN
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS, BUT…

80
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,274
I FOUND OUT LATER…

81
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,490
Stop it.

82
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,829
Stop disturbing me.

83
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,872
I need to write this.

84
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,125
Gosh, you.

85
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,752
Fine.

86
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,837
Let's go.

87
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,964
Come here!

88
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:30,932
Hey.

89
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,975
-Come to school today, okay?
-What?

90
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,936
I'm your older sister, you know.

91
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,730
Why do you care if I go to school or not?

92
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,358
I keep getting called up
to the office because of you.

93
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,944
They want us to come in with a guardian.

94
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,946
-You'll get held back if you don't…
-Ha-neul.

95
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,781
Ha-neul.

96
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,535
Take this.

97
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,620
I heard you need it by this week.

98
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,456
It's fine.
I don't need to go on the field trip.

99
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,000
What do you mean? Take it with you.

100
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,002
-Wait.
-Give it here.

101
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,922
No, don't take that. It's for Ha-neul.

102
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,423
He said he doesn't need it.

103
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,175
What a piece of trash.

104
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,594
Goodness.

105
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,388
-I'll see you later, Grandma.
-Okay.

106
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,925
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,853
THE BATHROOM IS OUTSIDE

108
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:06,861
I'M SORRY

109
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,009
Hey, Bom.
Are you coming to the library today?

110
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,802
I brought ice cream.

111
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,978
Sorry, Yeo-reum. I'm at school right now.

112
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,731
My bad. I won't bother you then.

113
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,150
Excuse me.

114
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,070
Thank you for the flowers.

115
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,030
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

116
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,823
You're welcome.

117
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,623
You must have heard about Jun.

118
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,293
Yes.

119
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,338
I'm sorry.

120
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:11,092
Not at all.
It was my fault for not telling you.

121
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,807
Then I'll…

122
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,726
I'll take good care of the flowers.

123
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,436
Sure.

124
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,361
Mr. Librarian.

125
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,535
Do you want some ice cream?

126
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,426
You know,

127
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,263
I prefer cone ice creams over popsicles.

128
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,017
What about you?

129
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,563
I'm not a big…
Well, ice cream does taste good,

130
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,359
-but the apple flavor…
-You don't have to answer me.

131
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,822
But this one is good.

132
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,115
Okay.

133
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,997
I actually decided to live here

134
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,500
because I fell in love with this library.

135
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,294
I see.

136
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,798
You've actually told me that already.

137
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,760
I have?

138
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,595
Yes.

139
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,805
When?

140
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,224
Back then…

141
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,895
Back then.

142
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,522
Back…

143
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,608
then?

144
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,698
What else did I say?

145
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,536
It wasn't so much talking,
but rather singing.

146
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,122
I sang?

147
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,958
Sang?

148
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,003
I sang?

149
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,380
What did I sing?

150
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,760
Why…

151
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,846
That song.

152
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,517
Why do you appear before my eyes

153
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,394
Whenever I'm drunk

154
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,270
Stop. Can you please stop that?

155
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,150
Can you please forget
about that entire night?

156
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,946
-Well, it's not like…
-I'll do anything to help you forget.

157
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,783
I don't really think about it that--

158
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,452
Come on, you even sang the song.

159
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,870
That's because you asked.

160
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,540
So embarrassing.

161
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,084
Hey, Kim Bom.

162
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,752
How come you came to school?

163
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,088
Don't act like you know me at school.

164
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,257
Are you going to the library today?

165
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,175
I told you to get lost.

166
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,386
-This is awesome.
-What the hell?

167
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,554
Damn it.

168
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,014
-Damn it.
-Kim Bom!

169
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,224
Long time no see.

170
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,560
That little bitch has no manners.

171
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,896
Darn it.

172
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,607
Something smells like
a fucking slut in here.

173
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,693
I guess some slut came to school.

174
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,403
-Right?
-Should we do some cleaning?

175
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,196
-Why don't we?
-Come on.

176
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,657
Kim Bom.

177
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,909
Come out while we're still being nice.

178
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,536
We're not done with you.

179
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,789
I told you to come out, you fucking whore.

180
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,958
So fucking annoying.

181
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,006
-Gosh!
-Nice!

182
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,216
That's awesome.

183
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,219
Ma'am.

184
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,971
Something's going down
in the bathroom. Hurry.

185
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,140
-Hey!
-You're dead if I see you again.

186
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,725
What are you guys doing here?

187
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,976
Let's go.

188
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,026
Hey, Kim Bom.

189
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,487
Why can't you stay out of trouble?

190
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,821
Hey, Bom.

191
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,115
-Are you okay?
-Heo Jae-hun!

192
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,366
Come see me.

193
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,791
Did you skip school to hang out with her?

194
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,085
-No.
-Stop lying.

195
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,881
Don't hang out
with a girl like that, okay?

196
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,550
Why aren't you answering?

197
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,179
You coming back here from the US

198
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,723
-is embarrassing enough for your parents--
-Auntie.

199
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,351
I'm going to call your parents then.

200
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,102
Sorry.

201
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,232
So you better behave yourself, okay?

202
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,992
Gosh, who do they all think they are?

203
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,869
They act so high and mighty.

204
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,829
They won't do it?

205
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,126
I mean,

206
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,922
I guess it's not easy to come down here
to listen to old people talk.

207
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,009
That's not the issue here.

208
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,595
They might make me write it.

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,765
I don't even write a diary.

210
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,977
Gosh, I have to do it tomorrow.
What do I do?

211
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,311
Isn't there anyone else?

212
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,946
I only proofread when I was working
at the publishing company.

213
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,241
It's completely different
from writing from scratch.

214
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,286
The fact that you proofread
means you're familiar with writing.

215
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,162
I heard you majored in literature too.

216
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,581
You're much better than us.

217
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,165
Please, Yeo-reum.

218
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,417
But still…

219
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,210
Please. It's just for this month.

220
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,170
Just help me out this once.

221
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,548
I'm just not very confident…

222
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,301
It's worse for me.
I don't even write a diary.

223
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,969
Ms. Lee.

224
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,183
Why do you appear before my eyes

225
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,186
What did you say?

226
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,481
Who appeared?

227
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,566
It's nothing.

228
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,330
Did I bring any lipstick?

229
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,499
Let's see.

230
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,919
I'm sure I brought at least one.

231
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,883
What am I doing?

232
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,979
Maybe it's there.

233
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,296
Is this too much?

234
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,547
Ms. Lee.

235
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,720
Hello.

236
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,389
Hello.

237
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,568
Shall we go then?

238
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,862
Okay.

239
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,784
Hey, Bom.

240
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,494
Hey.

241
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,625
Are you still upset?

242
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,003
Sorry.

243
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,088
I won't act like I know you at school.

244
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:48,966
Hey, Bom.

245
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,968
Listen.

246
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,595
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,265
Please forgive me.

248
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,601
I should have known.

249
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,315
You did nothing wrong.

250
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,777
I was just too embarrassed.

251
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,740
Bom!

252
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,911
What?

253
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,914
What's with that face?

254
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,543
-Whatever. Just come and carry this.
-Okay.

255
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,339
-Should I carry your bag too?
-No.

256
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,383
-Isn't it heavy?
-It's not.

257
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,801
-It's heavy.
-I said no.

258
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,303
I'll carry it for you.

259
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,849
Hello.

260
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,225
Hello.

261
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,773
We're here for an interview.

262
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,904
Ma'am.

263
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,548
You can sit here.

264
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,551
Goodness.

265
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,055
You're dressed so nicely.

266
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,268
Just relax,

267
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,606
and imagine that
you're having a chat with your daughter.

268
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,989
Thank you.

269
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,452
-Thank you.
-It's hot.

270
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,914
What's your name?

271
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,624
Why is that important?

272
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,917
Just do the interview.

273
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,005
Go on.

274
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,011
That's…

275
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,305
You need to add sugar
to make it delicious.

276
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,348
Here.

277
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,767
Give this to him.

278
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,358
Eat.

279
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:16,572
Then may I ask how old you are?

280
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,699
Age doesn't matter when you're this old.

281
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,787
Goodness.

282
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,457
I see so many flies flying around
all of a sudden.

283
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,025
My kids are all grown up.

284
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,987
My grandchildren just started walking.
They're so adorable.

285
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,659
They're the apple of my eye.
Words cannot explain how cute they are.

286
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,871
I still remember
how they toddled in through that door

287
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,081
calling for their grandmother.

288
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,583
-They are so adorable.
-Ma'am.

289
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,293
-Well…
-But my grandkids,

290
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,003
-they don't really--
-Ma'am.

291
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,923
-What?
-May I go to the bathroom real quick?

292
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,217
Sure. The bathroom is over there.

293
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,843
-Over there.
-Thank you.

294
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,429
I knew this would happen.
You drank a lot of water.

295
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:26,141
Why didn't she finish this? What a waste.

296
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,897
Gosh, it's so bitter!

297
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,358
You've been eating this the whole time?

298
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,944
Are you stupid or what?
You should have said something.

299
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,237
Gosh, that startled me.

300
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,781
Why didn't you say anything?

301
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,266
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

302
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,728
I had no idea I was sprinkling salt
instead of sugar.

303
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,647
The bathroom…

304
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,608
You have to tell me these things.

305
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,151
Goodness.

306
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,946
What is your husband doing?

307
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,114
My husband?

308
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,409
My husband passed away.

309
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,078
What would he be doing up there?
There's nothing to do.

310
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,163
He's probably just lazing around.

311
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,335
It would be great
if he could watch over us from above.

312
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,921
But it's so strange.

313
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,174
We weren't so nice to each other
when he was alive,

314
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,261
but now I miss him from time to time.

315
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,847
I hurt my leg two years ago,

316
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,975
so I used to go to a hospital in Seoul
to get treatment.

317
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,436
But even though I went to the hospital,

318
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,690
but that didn't help much.
I'm still limping around.

319
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,487
GRADE 7 PUBLIC SERVANTS
WRITTEN EXAM RESULTS

320
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,491
ACCEPTED APPLICANTS

321
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,618
It was eight, five, three, seven.

322
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,787
Eight, five, three, seven…

323
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,872
five, eight, four…

324
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,918
Eight, five, three,
seven, five, eight, four…

325
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,222
No way.

326
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,142
Goodness.

327
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,066
I had no idea it was time for food.

328
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,233
You guys must be hungry.

329
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,568
Help yourselves.

330
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,613
-Let's eat together, ma'am.
-I don't need to eat.

331
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,157
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure.

332
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,703
This is so delicious.

333
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,954
-Really?
-Yes.

334
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,372
Is it not salty?

335
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,585
My name is Kim Bong-sun.

336
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,046
And I'm 75 years old.

337
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,091
But I'm registered as 72 years old.

338
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,301
You look healthy.

339
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,178
Indeed. I am healthy.

340
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,389
Are you two married?

341
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,519
No. We're not.

342
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,687
We're not married.

343
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,693
You guys would make a great couple
if you were to marry.

344
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,374
While I was on my way here,
I felt burdened.

345
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,545
All I did was listen to her stories,

346
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,755
but my heart is at ease now.

347
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,383
I'm glad to hear that.

348
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,763
You fixed the lights for her, didn't you?

349
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,848
Yes.

350
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,061
You're like Santa Claus.

351
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,315
Ms. Lee.

352
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,863
May I ask if you can keep
working with me on this?

353
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,323
But I…

354
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,787
You won't like my writing
once you get to read it.

355
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,419
Okay.

356
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,423
If you buy me dinner, I'll think about it.

357
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,761
You mean today?

358
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,930
But we just ate.

359
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,476
I think I'll get hungry
with all this walking.

360
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,073
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

361
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,242
No problem. Time flies when you read.

362
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,704
Why don't you wipe
that drool off your face first?

363
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,747
Yeo-reum.

364
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,083
This is fermented kimchi from Grandma.
You can make some stew with it.

365
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,378
I couldn't buy kimchi
because it was so expensive.

366
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,796
What? Kimchi is expensive?

367
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,673
All we have at home is kimchi.

368
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,634
Ms. Lee.

369
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,970
Shall we go to dinner?

370
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,682
What? Is he buying us dinner?

371
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,184
I'm in. What about you?

372
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,646
Gosh, you're so quick
when it comes to food.

373
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,898
Thank you. I was starting to get hungry.

374
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,316
Dae-bum.

375
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,817
-Dae-bum.
-Hey.

376
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,736
-What do I do?
-What's wrong?

377
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,987
I passed.

378
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,955
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

379
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,706
They announced the results today.

380
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,875
After you went out in the morning,

381
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,419
I was torn about whether I should
check it alone or with you.

382
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,338
-But I checked it. And I passed!
-Hey!

383
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,550
You called everyone in the neighborhood!

384
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,595
Dong-cheol called and asked me
if you really passed the exam.

385
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,138
No way. I didn't call him.

386
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,348
Whatever.

387
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:02,352
In any case,
this calls for a celebration dinner!

388
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,395
Are you buying?

389
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,938
No, Ms. Cho Ji-yeong is.

390
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,941
Chang-su! This is great news.

391
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,109
I brought company.

392
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,820
-Ms. Cho, what brings you here?
-Hello.

393
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,531
Ms. Cho Ji-yeong became
a grade seven public servant today.

394
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,824
-Really?
-What do we call her now?

395
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,451
-Stop it.
-Gosh. Congratulations.

396
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,452
Thank you.

397
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,579
-Come and help.
-Bring the tables together.

398
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,999
-Let's go.
-All right.

399
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,375
Gosh, this is great.

400
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,918
-Hello.
-Let me clean the table.

401
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,503
-Sit here.
-Thank you.

402
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,589
JEIL RESTAURANT

403
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,550
Hey, it's mustard leaf kimchi.

404
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,052
I brought some lettuce for wraps.

405
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,138
Can we eat them here?

406
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,932
Lettuce? Where did you get them?

407
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,017
Let me see.

408
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,186
We went to interview an old lady today,

409
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,022
and she gave us lettuce.

410
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,565
What interview?

411
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,818
A writer didn't show up,
so Yeo-reum did the interview instead.

412
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,821
How did you know how to do that?
Where did you work in Seoul?

413
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,781
-She worked at a publishing company.
-I see.

414
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,992
Then you must have
had a lot of boyfriends.

415
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,663
How are those two relevant?

416
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:07,125
I've always found well-read girls
charming and attractive.

417
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,419
So? Do you have a boyfriend?

418
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,504
I…

419
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,383
I used to have one, but we broke up.

420
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,303
Why? How long did it last?

421
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,809
-Quite a long--
-Ji-yeong.

422
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,561
This is about to burn. You should eat it.

423
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,896
-Okay.
-Hurry and eat.

424
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,023
-Thank you.
-It's hot.

425
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,903
Gosh, Dae-bum. You don't even know
how to grill meat properly.

426
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,072
You have to season it with salt like this.

427
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,740
Why would you season it with salt?

428
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,700
-Salt makes the meat richer.
-Whatever.

429
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,868
You ruined it.

430
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,079
What is that on your shirt?

431
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,706
I heard the exam
is extremely difficult to pass.

432
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,666
-It is.
-Tell me about it.

433
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,253
She's never been smart,
but she's always been a hard worker.

434
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,755
Gosh, seriously?

435
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,092
I mean, your grades were worse than mine
back in middle school.

436
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,427
-Damn it.
-What? Worse than you?

437
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,762
Yes. That's right.

438
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,848
She devoted herself to studying
after she did worse than me.

439
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,892
That's why she went to university.

440
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:10,063
And she had to take the lowest exam
five times before she barely passed.

441
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:14,442
In Angok, she's the best of the best
when it comes to putting in the effort.

442
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,947
Go on.

443
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,199
So back then, I gave her a nickname.

444
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,493
Chew Ji-yeong, for chewing up her exams.

445
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,161
-Stop it already.
-Fine.

446
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,289
This seems like a good time to step out.
Have fun.

447
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,000
But I heard that even trying takes talent.

448
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,794
Talent, my foot.

449
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,548
Those who are truly talented
don't even try hard for these things.

450
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,633
What about you, Bom?

451
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,969
You're always drawing in the library.

452
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,473
Hey, this is great.
I've always wanted to tell you something.

453
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,642
Coming from my life experience,

454
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,939
if you make up excuses
and put off what you really want to do,

455
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,608
you'll regret it.

456
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,569
You're already in your junior year.

457
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:01,030
If you really like drawing,
use that to go to a university,

458
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,825
rather than wasting your stop doodling.

459
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,078
Why are you patronizing me
when you don't even know?

460
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,205
Aren't we here to have dinner?

461
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,834
Bom. I'm just saying this
because I feel bad for you.

462
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,004
Look. Life is all about timing.

463
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,297
You don't think so, right?

464
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,340
-I made a wrap for you.
-Dae-bum can't relate

465
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,800
because he's special.

466
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,388
Normal people like us have to
try as hard as we can.

467
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,141
We have to be ready
to seize an opportunity when it's time.

468
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,894
If you lose your chance,

469
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,437
then it's over.

470
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,898
I'm serious.

471
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:41,488
But I don't think everyone has
a solid purpose in their life.

472
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,698
Because I don't either.

473
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,368
I see.

474
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,914
But…

475
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:56,336
isn't that why you settled here
to recreate yourself

476
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,879
and plan your future?

477
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,424
Not really.
I just try to have a good time.

478
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,888
Why don't we start
having a good time now, Ji-yeong?

479
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,098
Eat some wraps,

480
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,643
-some meat…
-Dae-bum.

481
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,813
Why do you keep cutting me off?

482
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,191
I just wanted you to eat.

483
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,446
From what I heard,
everything Ms. Cho said is right.

484
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,158
Bom. You must become a proper adult
for your family to live.

485
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,787
What a crappy evening.

486
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,664
Listen with an open heart.

487
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,583
How long do you think
your grandma could support you?

488
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,377
I always say this,

489
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,463
but your dad will never overcome
his addiction to liquor.

490
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,923
-So you should--
-Hey.

491
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,342
Can you please watch what you say?

492
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,469
What's with that tone?

493
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,722
How can the owner kick a customer out
with her words?

494
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,852
And you should be thanking Yeo-reum
for holding me back.

495
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,648
And by the way, you should give Yeo-reum
back her 450,000 won.

496
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,276
-You little brat.
-Hey, wait for me.

497
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,321
Congratulations, congratulations

498
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,075
Congratulations to Ji-yeong
for passing the exam

499
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,201
Hey, where's everyone?

500
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,288
Blow it out.

501
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,292
Gosh, my head hurts.

502
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,961
What's with the air in this room?

503
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,672
Hey, blow it already.

504
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,091
I even got seven candles.

505
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,138
All right, everyone.

506
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,432
For another round,
how about we go to karaoke

507
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,183
to liven up the mood?

508
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,186
Actually, I have to get going.

509
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,229
What?

510
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,524
I'll be going home as well, Ji-yeong.

511
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,651
Seong-man can go by himself then.

512
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,737
What do you mean? What's with you guys?

513
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,779
Yeo-reum.

514
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,281
I'll give you a ride.

515
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,991
It's okay. I can walk home.

516
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,493
Look at all this.
How will you walk with these?

517
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,121
-Hey, Ji-yeong. Are you really going?
-Yes.

518
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,540
We should hang out when we can
on days like this.

519
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,584
I even asked my dad
if I can stay out late.

520
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,211
Then you should.
No one is stopping you from hanging out.

521
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,838
Enjoy yourself, okay?

522
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,048
Hey, I mean…

523
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,966
Goodbye, Ji-yeong.

524
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,426
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

525
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,264
Drive safely.

526
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,894
Gosh.

527
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,398
What do we do now?

528
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,199
As Seong-min said,

529
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,451
it'd be a shame to go home early.

530
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,911
Do you want to grab some beer?

531
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,871
Right now?

532
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,332
There's a good sashimi place I like.

533
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,959
I don't take just anyone there.

534
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,004
But I'm a little full.

535
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,381
Just have a little.

536
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,674
Okay?

537
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,262
-Dae-bum. By the way…
-Yes?

538
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:57,350
Do you know if Ji-yeong plans to leave
right away now that she's passed the exam?

539
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,728
She needs to do an interview,
and she might blow that.

540
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,649
But this interview is more of a formality,
so she'll get in.

541
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,484
Oh, really?

542
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,197
She's finally going to
make it to Seoul then.

543
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,366
-Seong-min.
-Yes?

544
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,369
You must be bittersweet.

545
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,537
Me?

546
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,665
Why would I be? I feel relieved.

547
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,584
I'll even send the interviewers gifts,

548
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,253
to beg them to give her a pass.

549
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,922
The issue is not me, but you.

550
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,800
Ji-yeong was the only one
you spoke comfortably to.

551
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:34,554
More people die from loneliness
than starvation these days.

552
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,180
You should go out and meet someone.

553
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,599
You're wasting your handsome looks.

554
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,102
Don't just laugh.

555
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,813
Do you want me to introduce you to a girl?

556
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,107
You?

557
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,984
"You"?

558
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,778
Do you think I'm a loner?
I have lots of gal pals.

559
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,655
Tell me your ideal type.

560
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,240
Cute types? Sexy types?

561
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,742
I don't have a preference.

562
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,536
-There must be a celebrity you like.
-Goodness.

563
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,329
-Did you just say IU?
-What?

564
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,623
If you want to meet IU, follow me.

565
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,542
Seong-min. I'll really get going now.

566
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,377
You wanted IU. Hurry up and follow me.

567
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,050
-Congratulations on passing the exam.
-Thank you.

568
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,510
I heard grade seven exams are difficult.

569
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,722
It took blood, sweat, and tears.

570
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:22,143
And I couldn't have passed it
without Dae-bum's help.

571
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,311
Mr. Librarian?

572
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,230
It's hard to see
what an extraordinary person he is

573
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,899
from just meeting him.

574
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,198
Dae-bum got accepted to
Korea National University when he was 17.

575
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,866
He was the youngest researcher.

576
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,410
Fascinating, right?

577
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:44,040
He's too competent to be here
working for a countryside library.

578
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,210
I can't tell you more,

579
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,670
but he's been through a lot.

580
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:56,677
When people treat him badly in ignorance,

581
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,721
I get so frustrated.

582
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,848
Even the kids who come to the library.

583
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,352
Jun and his friends.
They don't respect him.

584
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,562
They need to be scolded.

585
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,607
You must care about him a lot.

586
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:11,818
Well…

587
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,029
We've spent a long time together.

588
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:22,161
But it seems like he's gotten
comfortable around you.

589
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,580
Maybe.

590
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,335
I'm happy that I passed the exam,

591
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,340
but I'm worried about
Dae-bum being here alone without me.

592
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,471
-So annoying.
-Damn it.

593
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,515
Who the fuck is this?

594
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,394
It's Kim Bom.

595
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,980
Where do you think you're going, bitch?

596
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,275
You should greet your seniors.

597
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,861
You don't even come to school.

598
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,821
Why the fuck are you wearing this?

599
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,323
Do you get paid more to fuck
with the uniform on?

600
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,909
Seriously.

601
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,494
Is that all you bitches can think about?

602
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,371
Gosh, you're so scary.

603
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,582
Too bad.

604
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,793
Your bodyguard, Dae-ho, is behind bars.

605
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,753
Hey.

606
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,089
You guys are nothing when you're alone.

607
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,508
Do you feel like you're worth more
when you're grouped up like this?

608
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,135
So fucking pathetic.

609
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,137
-Move.
-Where are you going?

610
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,389
Are you off to make money
for your dad's liquor?

611
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,474
You guys know too, right?

612
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,226
Her dad is a piece of shit.

613
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,562
I heard her mom used to work at a bar.

614
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,940
And she's the product
of them getting drunk together.

615
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,650
-So fucking disgusting.
-So retarded.

616
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,236
-What a slut.
-Why won't anyone stop talking today?

617
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,362
-Hey!
-Hey!

618
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,199
-Let go!
-Come here!

619
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,205
Yeo-reum, hop in. I'll take you home.

620
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,123
-It's okay. I can walk home.
-No.

621
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,750
It's too far. It's not safe.

622
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,084
Just wait a bit.

623
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,550
You know, there's something
I really want to ask you.

624
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,096
Don't you feel anxious
about not doing anything?

625
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,478
I do.

626
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,064
You do, right?

627
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,108
What if Bom takes after you?

628
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,779
You're a grown-up.
You're free to think relaxing is cool.

629
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,614
But she's still a kid.

630
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,492
What I'm saying is you can ruin her life.

631
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,994
Don't you feel anxious?

632
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,539
Why would I feel anxious?
I work in the public sector.

633
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,505
Actually,

634
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,302
I broke down trying to live up
to other people's standards.

635
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,391
I was troubled because
I thought everyone was running ahead

636
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,893
while I was the only one falling behind.

637
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,023
So for now…

638
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:01,195
I'm trying to become friends with myself
rather than others.

639
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,780
I see.

640
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,618
I have no idea what you're saying.
My head hurts.

641
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,537
Also,

642
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,207
I haven't known Mr. Librarian
for a long time,

643
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,751
but he's warm-hearted.

644
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:20,923
The kids like him
because they can feel his kindness.

645
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,384
It's not that they take him for a fool.

646
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,179
So don't worry.

647
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,348
I'm sure he'll be okay on his own.

648
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,481
Hello?

649
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,693
I'm at Bangrim Seafood.

650
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,820
Can you come to pick me up? I drank a bit.

651
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,031
Sorry, thanks. Bye, I'll wait.

652
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,451
-I'll get going then.
-No.

653
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,411
He'll be here soon. Just wait a bit.

654
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,705
It's fine. I just want to sober up.

655
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,458
Take care.

656
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,127
Goodbye, then.

657
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,382
Bye.

658
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,480
Why did I say that?

659
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,027
It's not like I know anything.

660
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,956
Hi, Bom.

661
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,210
What happened?

662
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,961
Bom.

663
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,713
Bom!

664
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,883
What happened to my baby's face?

665
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,511
I tripped on my way home. It's nothing.

666
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,055
How can they be so harsh?

667
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,849
How can they beat up
a small girl like you?

668
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,061
Nothing like that happened.
I honestly just tripped.

669
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,147
Let's go inside.
Let me put some ointment on you.

670
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,566
-Grandma, I told you it's nothing.
-Goodness.

671
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,235
Hey, you brat.

672
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,030
Look how messy you are.

673
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,200
How dare you go around picking fights?

674
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,576
Just close the door.

675
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,623
That little bitch takes after her mom.

676
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,084
How could you say that to her?

677
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,752
Close the door.

678
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,046
It's your fault.

679
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,632
What? What did you say?

680
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,593
This is all your fault.

681
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,096
You're why Mom ran away
and why we live like this.

682
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,098
It's all your fault!

683
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,850
What did you say, you fucking bitch?

684
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,268
Why did you even have me?

685
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,477
Why?

686
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,104
Just die!

687
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,481
Bom, why are you acting like this?

688
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,358
Fine! Let's die!

689
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,819
We can all die together!

690
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,196
How can you call yourself a dad?

691
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,656
Just die!

692
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,032
Bom.

693
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,784
-Bom!
-Fine!

694
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,871
Leave just like your mom did, you bitch!

695
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,291
Just fucking die!

696
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,876
You fucking brats!

697
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,131
Ji-yeong.

698
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,966
Am I going to be your lackey forever?

699
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,761
Just think of this as a gift
to congratulate me.

700
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,182
Gosh. You and your selfishness.

701
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,601
I'm sleepy.

702
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,103
Hey.

703
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,230
And…

704
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,525
Drop me off at Dae-bum's.

705
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,402
What?

706
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,655
Why would you go to his house
at this hour?

707
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,408
I have something to discuss with Dae-bum.

708
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,076
Do it when it's bright.

709
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,580
Do you think it's normal for you
to visit a man's house at this hour?

710
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,457
People will spread rumors about you.

711
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,834
That's what I'm hoping for.

712
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,793
What?

713
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,420
Look at you.

714
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,089
Have you done something like this before?

715
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,674
Yes. I'm going to sleep now.

716
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,092
-What?
-Wake me up later.

717
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,845
-Did you just say "yes"?
-Good night.

718
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,724
This is driving me nuts. I mean…

719
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,476
Damn.

720
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,655
Hey, we're here.

721
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,491
Hey, thanks.

722
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,036
Goodbye.

723
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,040
Hey, Ji-yeong.

724
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,710
I also have something to tell Dae-bum,

725
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,795
so let's go together.

726
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,296
Tell him what?

727
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,297
Tell him later.

728
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,050
Wait, Ji-yeong.

729
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,010
Don't forget your cake.

730
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,679
Eat it with Jun.

731
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,639
No. I can't have cake.

732
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,349
I'm nauseous right now. Just take it.

733
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,142
Actually, if you could
leave me two pieces,

734
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,352
that would be perfect.

735
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,895
-Bye.
-Hey.

736
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,022
Are you really going in there?

737
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,691
Answer me!

738
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,027
Goodness.

739
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,572
You're terrible. Seriously.

740
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,619
Ji-yeong.

741
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,917
What brings you here at this hour?

742
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,461
Tell me.

743
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,298
Look at you.

744
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,883
You seem different.

745
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,512
Did you drink a lot?

746
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,723
Of course, I did.

747
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,558
-Gosh.
-Sit down.

748
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,605
Why did you drink until so late?

749
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,899
I was chatting with Yeo-reum.

750
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,193
She's an interesting one.

751
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,987
You were…

752
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,115
drinking with Yeo-reum?

753
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,707
Today is such a wonderful day for me.

754
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,752
So can you do me a favor?

755
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,504
What is it?

756
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,799
You have to promise me first.

757
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,428
Well, tell me what it is first.

758
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,181
Do you

759
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,226
want to meet him after hearing about it?

760
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,063
Or do you want to meet him
without knowing?

761
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,483
Are you talking about the professor?

762
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,569
You're so smart.

763
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,822
He's coming here to see you tomorrow.

764
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,492
Hey.

765
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,285
He's an admirable professor.

766
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,372
He's coming all this way
to meet a disrespectful student like you.

767
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,792
So don't think about
running away somewhere.

768
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,462
I'll have my eyes wide open
to keep you right here.

769
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,255
Okay?

770
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,511
And let's go to Seoul together.

771
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,683
Come with me.

772
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,650
Hey, Bom.

773
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,735
Yeo-reum.

774
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,696
Are you okay?

775
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,116
I had nowhere to go.

776
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,039
You came to the right place.

777
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,084
Gosh, that looks painful.

778
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,640
It hurts, right?

779
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,350
It's okay.

780
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,352
You must be exhausted.

781
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:31,854
Get some sleep.

782
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,647
Hey.

783
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,526
Yeo-reum. Aren't you…

784
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,487
Aren't you going to ask what happened?

785
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,575
Do you want to talk about it?

786
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:48,996
No.

787
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,835
Tell me when you're ready.

788
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,963
But Bom.

789
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,468
I don't know what's going on,

790
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,180
but don't get yourself hurt.

791
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,856
I'm turning off the lights.

792
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,754
Good night.

793
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,882
You too.

794
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,961
Think of this as your second home
and come over whenever you want to.

795
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,255
Thanks to you, I feel happier now.

796
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,715
She's having surgery in that room.

797
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,343
How did you get injured?

798
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,095
Dad might go to prison for this.

799
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,681
Let's say I hurt her.
I'll go to prison instead.

800
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:31,765
Ma'am.

801
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,016
The hospital bill is 10 million won.

802
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,270
I was wondering
if I could get the rent money back.

803
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,063
Is this about Bom's hospital bill?

804
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,941
Could you take care of Gyeo-ul?

805
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,776
I liked it here.

806
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,405
