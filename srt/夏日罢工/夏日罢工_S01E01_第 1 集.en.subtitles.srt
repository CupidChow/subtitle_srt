1
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,007
I'm running tirelessly.

2
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,095
I'm sprinting at full speed.

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,099
But…

4
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,186
I don't know where I'm headed.

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,151
I must be at school this time.

6
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,241
The closer I get to my classroom,

7
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,537
the more certain I become…

8
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,921
that as always, the door will be locked.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,302
Sir, I'm not in class.
Please open the door!

10
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,470
Sir!

11
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,223
Open the door for me!

12
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,642
Can you not hear me?

13
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,186
COUNSELOR'S OFFICE
SOPHOMORE CLASSROOMS

14
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,649
-Answer sheets, please.
-Please let me in!

15
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,360
Open the door!

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,737
Please open the door!

17
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,325
Do you not hear me?

18
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,648
This must be how men feel

19
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,818
when they have dreams
of getting dragged back into the military.

20
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,664
Please do not run, play around,
or lean sideways on the escalator.

21
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,264
The train is approaching.

22
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,105
The doors are now closing.

23
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,774
The screen doors are now opening.

24
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,777
The destinations in my dreams can vary.

25
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:20,575
It could be school, work,
or a university entrance exam room.

26
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,079
The places may vary,

27
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,083
but it always ends the same way.

28
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,757
I'm always abandoned

29
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,927
outside of a closed door.

30
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,075
Hello, I'm Lee Yeo-reum
from Planning Team One.

31
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,870
Hello, I'm Lee Yeo-reum
from Planning Team One.

32
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,456
Handwritten poems.

33
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,292
Poems are drafted not only using logic…

34
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,422
THE EMOTIONS WILL BE FELT..

35
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,014
Were you rehearsing?

36
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,184
Are you already experienced enough
to submit proposals?

37
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,144
"Handwritten poems."

38
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,355
The theme of the project is…

39
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,023
Kind of old-fashioned, right?

40
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,316
Is everyone ready?

41
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,403
This one is important.

42
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,032
You don't look so terrible today.

43
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,868
I'll call the CEO then.

44
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,412
Mr. Choi.

45
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,664
This may not be so important, but…

46
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,957
What? Don't make me nervous.

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,544
I heard the new CEO is extremely picky.

48
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,587
He doesn't drink just any kind of coffee.

49
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,341
Do you think this
cheap canned coffee would do?

50
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,468
-Really?
-Yes.

51
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,763
He only drinks some fancy coffee
called Geisha or something.

52
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,140
Hold on.

53
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,810
-What was it called?
-Geisha.

54
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,564
Ms. Lee.

55
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,734
Were you not aware?

56
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,278
-I'm sorry.
-I mean…

57
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,032
Isn't it your job to find out
what your superiors like?

58
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,117
Should I go buy some right now?

59
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,536
Hurry it up. I can't stall for long.

60
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,581
Are you seriously walking?

61
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,860
Could I get Geisha coffee?

62
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,062
…handwritten poems.

63
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,482
Next is the concept of the project.

64
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,275
As you can see on the slide,

65
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:46,531
each poem illustrates
the poet's character, emotions,

66
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,700
and their surroundings at the time.

67
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,371
For example, the poet Shin Dal-ja…

68
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,208
was immersed in her surroundings,

69
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,254
so it's easy for the readers to understand
the poem was written for her lover.

70
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,881
Like this, handwritten poems contain

71
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,927
retrospective feelings
and heartfelt emotions that printed poems…

72
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,097
That was great.

73
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,057
Until now, we were only focused on

74
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,144
making a profit by investing well.

75
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:20,815
But a retro-themed project
in times like these?

76
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,734
It's fantastic. I was touched.

77
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,986
Thank you.

78
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,946
We've got a long way to go
until we're on your level.

79
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,909
Why don't we take this project
a step further and do one for each poet?

80
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,619
Thank you so much.

81
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,913
-Thank you.
-We'll do our best, sir!

82
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,540
Let's all go have lunch together.

83
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,500
-Shall we go?
-Sure.

84
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,253
A brilliant idea, right?

85
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,379
Indeed.

86
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,090
You were amazing.
It was like you prepared the project.

87
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,884
Mr. Choi.

88
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,805
You see, he came in
immediately after you left.

89
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,932
-We were all so rattled.
-Indeed.

90
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,852
While you were getting coffee,

91
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,063
Ms. Kim here stepped in
and managed to finish the job.

92
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,524
Great work.

93
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,861
It's going to be a lot of work
for Da-mi to clean up by herself.

94
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,987
That's true.

95
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,699
-I'll stay behind and help.
-Really?

96
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,285
Then make sure you have lunch, okay?

97
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,663
Thank you for the coffee. Good work.

98
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,806
Hello?

99
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,724
Hey.

100
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,643
Hey, Mom.

101
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,560
Are you busy?

102
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,271
Not really. It's lunchtime.

103
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,857
Is something wrong?
Why do you sound so down?

104
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,193
Nothing's wrong.

105
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,070
Why did you call?

106
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,781
I wanted to send you some dishes
with stir-fried anchovies.

107
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,157
You're out of kimchi, right?

108
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,659
Should I send some of that too?

109
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,244
I have some left.

110
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,037
You haven't finished it yet?

111
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,540
You should eat well.

112
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,916
And try not to eat out.

113
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,669
Okay, I can take care of myself.

114
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,546
All right.

115
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,713
Sorry for nagging.

116
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,218
Do you need anything?

117
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,887
I'll get it for your birthday.

118
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,765
You don't have to come. Birthday, my foot.

119
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,350
I'll just buy whatever then.

120
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,935
Oh, right.

121
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,522
Are your knees feeling better?

122
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,525
They're fine.
They only hurt for a bit back then.

123
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,236
Don't work at the restaurant anymore.
You promised.

124
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,237
Of course.

125
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,864
Hey, are you done washing the cabbages?

126
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,950
-Come and take a coffee break.
-Okay.

127
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,660
You're working again, aren't you?

128
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,744
Gosh.

129
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,539
I don't want to keep you from eating.
I'll call you later.

130
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,879
Why is she working
at the restaurant again?

131
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,151
I told you I'm working late.

132
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,777
You didn't have dinner, right?

133
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,197
You love the sushi from this place.

134
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,117
You didn't have to do this.

135
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,705
You have to get back to work, right?

136
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,421
-One more beer, please.
-Okay.

137
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,799
I sprinted next to the cars on the street
with coffees in my hands.

138
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,760
But I wasn't scared at all.

139
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,221
Then I finally arrived at the office
with the coffee,

140
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,266
only to hear that
the CEO doesn't drink coffee.

141
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,063
Da-mi says that
Ms. Kim tricked me on purpose.

142
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,397
Do you think that's true?

143
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,982
Well…

144
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,862
What you want to know is

145
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,407
if they were lying to you, right?

146
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,951
Yes. That's right.

147
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,745
Okay, how about this?

148
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,040
Let's say that they lied to you.

149
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,708
Why?

150
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,959
Why would they do that?

151
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,046
It's such an obvious lie you'll notice.

152
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,590
-I know.
-So why?

153
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,468
Why do they treat you like some pushover?

154
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,969
Let's think about it.

155
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,224
Do you really think
you don't have any fault in this?

156
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,225
Jae-dong.

157
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,228
Also, the real issue here isn't the lie.

158
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,440
It's the fact that you stayed outside.

159
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,737
Imagine you entered that room with coffee,
soaked in sweat.

160
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,823
The CEO would have been pleased.

161
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,286
You would have won him over
had you gone in and done the presentation.

162
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,497
Do you understand, Yeo-reum?

163
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,916
Yeo-reum. This…

164
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,336
The lie isn't the issue here.

165
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,006
The issue is your complacent attitude.

166
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,642
What now?

167
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,982
Are you offended by what I said?

168
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,194
You've always enjoyed giving me advice.

169
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,113
But…

170
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:25,578
you didn't use to get this worked up
giving me advice.

171
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,622
Yeo-reum. I…

172
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,835
I'm not angry right now.

173
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,212
It's not that I'm angry.

174
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,050
I'm just a bit tired of you.

175
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,017
Jae-dong.

176
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:05,075
I've been dating him
for six years since university.

177
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,663
We both changed as time went by.

178
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:14,752
And I've been obsessing over
marriage for some time.

179
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,091
I'm sure my obsession made him sick of me.

180
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:27,223
HEY, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A NUISANCE
WHEN YOU'RE SO BUSY…

181
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,562
I PROMISE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN

182
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,529
I shouldn't have gone to see him today.

183
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,505
YEO-REUM, LET'S TAKE A BREAK FOR A WHILE

184
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,012
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

185
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,144
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

186
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,981
I THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST.
LET'S TALK AGAIN LATER.

187
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,708
Jae-dong hasn't called since then.

188
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,796
We've had fights like these
in our six-year relationship.

189
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,133
But Jae-dong always
called me first the day after.

190
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,426
Ms. Lee.

191
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,554
Ms. Lee!

192
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,849
Yes?

193
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,309
What are you doing?

194
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,852
Mr. Choi is calling you.

195
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,147
Yes.

196
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,901
Come on in.

197
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,988
It's been about four years
since you started working here, right?

198
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,866
Yes. Four years and three months.

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,493
I see.

200
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,705
You must be eager to do more, right?

201
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,960
Is that why you're doing this?

202
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,634
We've only worked with
Joosung print shop until now,

203
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,220
and we pay them 100 million won
for their service.

204
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,472
That's right. Keep going.

205
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,559
I looked into other print shops,
and they had newer printers

206
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,561
and asked for 80 million won for the job.

207
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,647
I see. 80 million won.

208
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,066
That means we'd save 20 million, right?

209
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,196
Ms. Lee.

210
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,449
Do you know why I hired you?

211
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,785
Do you?

212
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,789
To be frank, you're not really
the sly type like Ms. Kim.

213
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,626
How should I put this…

214
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,423
Obeying your superiors
and working like a dog.

215
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,758
That's your strength.

216
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,179
Small companies like ours
don't have an established system,

217
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,640
so you have to stick to
what you're good at.

218
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,436
That's why I want you
to stick to your strengths,

219
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,980
carrying out your tasks quietly
like an obedient dog.

220
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,315
What do you think?

221
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,862
Who are you to change
the fucking print shop on your own?

222
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:10,946
Tell me.

223
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,657
What?

224
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,243
Did you think
this was your chance to act out

225
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,786
because the CEO liked your work?

226
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,413
No, sir. I'm sorry.

227
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,832
Gosh, your ambition scares me.

228
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,792
Ms. Lee.

229
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,505
If this place was the military,
do you know what you would be?

230
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:33,052
A military dog. You're not even human.

231
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:38,098
So please stop racking your brains
with the things you weren't told to do.

232
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,979
Man, this is exhausting.

233
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,806
I'm starving.

234
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,168
Why always me?

235
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,816
Hello?

236
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,407
EMERGENCY ROOM

237
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,746
Don't forget your credit card.

238
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,044
EMERGENCY ROOM

239
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,597
-Yeo-reum!
-Hey!

240
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,478
What do we do now?

241
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,606
Where's Mom?

242
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,818
I was drinking and fishing with my friend

243
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,069
when the cops called…

244
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,155
I'm asking you where she is!

245
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,782
She's…

246
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,535
Come see where she is.

247
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:20,469
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

248
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,337
Is this your mother?

249
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,639
Mom.

250
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,104
Mom.

251
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,088
Mom.

252
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,722
Mom.

253
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,016
Yeo-reum.

254
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,769
You should sleep.

255
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,774
We have to wake up early
to go visit your dad in the morning.

256
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,568
Mom.

257
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,905
I still sniff garlic whenever I miss you.

258
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,283
Why would you do that?

259
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,246
You used to come home so late
from the restaurant,

260
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,374
that I was always asleep by then.

261
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,919
Your hand smelled like garlic

262
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,922
when you came in to pat my head.

263
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,597
I'm sorry.

264
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,726
Why are you sorry?

265
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,563
There's someone else who should apologize.

266
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,940
Do you mean Dad?

267
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,694
If I meet him again,
I won't let him off easy.

268
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,363
-What will you do?
-For starters,

269
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,408
I won't lift a finger around the house

270
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,952
and I'll stay in bed all day.

271
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,330
And I don't know.

272
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,290
I'll make him do all the hard work.

273
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,462
Mom.

274
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,758
I'll do all of that for you.

275
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,844
I'll make a fortune

276
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:12,974
so you can go see flowers
and go to the beach.

277
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,643
I'll make that happen.

278
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,856
So don't grow old too quickly, okay?

279
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,373
Yeo-reum.

280
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,416
Yes?

281
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,669
I love you.

282
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,213
I love you too.

283
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,094
Mom…

284
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,180
never got the rest she wanted.

285
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,030
You don't have to see me out.

286
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,160
Thank you for coming.

287
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,786
It's nothing.

288
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,623
I didn't know if you would come.

289
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,627
I can't believe she passed like this.

290
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,088
It must be tough.

291
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,676
I'm sorry I can't be with you.

292
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,391
Stay with her until the end.

293
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,562
Try to eat and sleep

294
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,274
whenever you can find the time.

295
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,778
Okay?

296
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,492
Hang in there, Yeo-reum.

297
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,746
You'll get through this.

298
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,223
I'll get going then.
You should head back in.

299
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,575
And just like that, everyone left.

300
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,833
I rested Mom beside Dad.

301
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,964
She's probably with him by now,

302
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,216
making him work to his bone
to her satisfaction.

303
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,721
At least…

304
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,973
I hope she is.

305
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,579
TO LEE YEO-REUM

306
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,374
My baby.

307
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:51,086
You sound so blue lately.

308
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,714
You don't have to visit for my birthday.

309
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,550
I hope these home dishes
will cheer you up.

310
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,428
I love you.

311
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,306
Sincerely, Mom.

312
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,869
Mom.

313
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,670
Mom.

314
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,264
I'm so sorry, Mom.

315
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,648
I go to work.

316
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,487
And then I get off work.

317
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,365
Going to work.

318
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,287
Getting off work again.

319
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,833
Going to work.

320
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,169
Getting off work.

321
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,006
Going to work again.

322
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,849
I'm still holding onto my life,
trying not to break down.

323
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,733
Ms. Lee. Could you type any louder?

324
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,778
I can't work with all that noise.

325
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,029
I'm sorry.

326
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,741
Ms. Lee. Wash my mug.

327
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,662
Hurry. My arm's hurting.

328
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,628
Nothing has changed.

329
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,966
Perhaps nothing even happened.

330
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,946
The same sun goes down every day.

331
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,330
And the same sun comes up.

332
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,754
The world is exactly the same.

333
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,682
Except that I've lost my parents.

334
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,985
This stop is Samseong.

335
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,405
The doors are on your right.

336
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,741
Samseong.

337
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,704
Hold on.

338
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,664
Excuse me, mister.

339
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,374
Please stop!

340
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,921
Damn it. What the heck is this?

341
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,674
Talk about a crappy morning.

342
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,635
What a nuisance.

343
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,513
Mister!

344
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,348
Please do not run, play around,

345
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,642
or lean sideways on the escalator.

346
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,755
HI, MR. CHOI. I THINK I'M GOING TO BE
ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATE…

347
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,874
-It's spring.
-The screen doors are now opening.

348
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,221
The train will now be departing.
The doors are closing.

349
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,446
I'm not going to work.

350
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,360
MANAGER CHOI JI-WON

351
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:08,046
The morning train that goes
in the opposite direction of Seoul…

352
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,884
was relaxing, quiet, and peaceful

353
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:18,264
as if it was a completely different world.

354
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,747
Perhaps that's what life is.

355
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,627
If I go in the opposite direction
as everyone else,

356
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,006
perhaps life will be more relaxing, quiet,

357
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,634
and peaceful.

358
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,362
I must be out of my mind.

359
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,825
The charger.

360
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,701
Goodness.

361
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,415
14 MISSED CALLS
MANAGER CHOI JI-WON

362
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,167
Oh, right.

363
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,087
I decided not to go to work.

364
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,176
INCOMING CALL
MANAGER CHOI JI-WON

365
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,931
Hello?

366
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,976
Hey, where are you?
Have you lost your mind?

367
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,145
Why the hell won't you pick up?

368
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,896
Mr. Choi.

369
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,901
Just how do you expect
to continue to work here now?

370
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,117
I'm sorry, but I'm quitting.

371
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,411
What? What are you…

372
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,479
Yeo-reum. You really had me worried.

373
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,231
Are you really quitting?

374
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,693
How am I going to survive without you?

375
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,154
You'll be fine, Da-mi.

376
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,449
-Da-mi, can you photocopy this for me?
-Sure.

377
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,411
Ms. Lee.

378
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,288
Can I see you for a moment?

379
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,132
Goodness.

380
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,928
How can you quit so abruptly like this?

381
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,389
Are you getting married or something?

382
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,433
No.

383
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,478
Come on. Make yourself at home.

384
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,271
Why are you awkwardly standing there?

385
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,481
Have a seat.

386
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,608
I've been too harsh lately, haven't I?

387
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:19,612
I sometimes tend to get overzealous.

388
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,864
Ms. Lee.

389
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,159
I'm saying this not as a manager,
but as a friend.

390
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,207
Believe it or not,
I also graduated from a lousy university.

391
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,835
But I managed to become the team manager,

392
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,129
although I studied engineering
at a lousy school.

393
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,423
How do you think I managed?

394
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,634
It wasn't easy.

395
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,804
I had to grovel before my seniors,
running all kinds of chores.

396
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,682
Compared to back then, you have it easy.

397
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,226
So what I'm saying is

398
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,771
that this isn't the right time
for you to rest.

399
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,772
He's right.

400
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,691
Sure, a short break could be nice,

401
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,859
but you'd have to look for work again.

402
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,154
Ms. Lee. Put your trust in me.

403
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,656
You know I have your back.

404
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,451
So just stick with me,
and it'll be smooth sailing for you.

405
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,619
Okay?

406
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,372
I appreciate you saying that.

407
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,666
-No need to thank me.
-But…

408
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,461
I'm still going to quit.

409
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,304
I have an appointment with the CEO,

410
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,265
so I'll get going.

411
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,808
Ms. Lee.

412
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,688
Don't you fucking understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

413
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,275
You're leaving?

414
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,610
I see. You want to leave.

415
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,196
Go ahead and try.

416
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,324
Let's see what you're capable of.

417
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,700
Mr. Choi.

418
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,787
I tried to keep you around
because you're so subservient.

419
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,832
Kids these days don't know
what it means to persevere.

420
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,751
I feel disgusted to be born

421
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,503
in the same generation
as someone like her.

422
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,631
Fuck you.

423
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,136
"Fuck you"?

424
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,348
Did you just say that to me?

425
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,141
Ms. Lee.

426
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,146
No one in this world
could put up with you.

427
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,985
Why should I put up with
your abuse when I'm quitting?

428
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,946
Don't be like that.

429
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,949
He's only doing this for you.

430
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,202
For me?

431
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,245
That's not true.

432
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,665
His only concern is

433
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,794
that I don't tell the CEO
about him pocketing the rebate.

434
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,795
What did you say?

435
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,635
You!

436
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,429
Are you trying to start a fight?

437
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,056
-You little…
-Stop.

438
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,474
Stop it.

439
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,352
Apologize.

440
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,437
Are you insane?

441
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,022
Both of you.

442
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,315
You must be crazy.

443
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,984
You got 20 million won
from Joosung, right?

444
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,904
You're afraid that I'll tell
the CEO about it.

445
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,823
You crazy bitch.

446
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,826
Fine. Let's go see the CEO together then.

447
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,411
Wait.

448
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,038
Hey. Get a grip.

449
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,581
Why are you acting like this?

450
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,418
You get a grip, Ms. Kim.

451
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,587
He asks all the female employees
to come with him to bars,

452
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,297
-karaoke, and motels.
-Shut up!

453
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,800
He went for you because I rejected him.

454
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,801
What?

455
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,930
Are you seriously saying
that I came on to you?

456
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,724
She's totally nuts.

457
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,435
You want me to show her your texts?

458
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,604
-What? Is this true?
-What texts?

459
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,398
What a conniving bitch.

460
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,567
-What the hell?
-You believe her?

461
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,360
She's lying!

462
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,946
The CEO is looking for Yeo-reum.

463
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,406
I get it already!

464
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,325
-What texts?
-She's lying.

465
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,994
-Show me.
-I told you she's lying.

466
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,495
-Give me your phone.
-I told you she's lying.

467
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,621
Give it. Where is it?

468
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,790
-Wait.
-Where the hell is it?

469
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,958
Hold on.

470
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,752
Let's all calm down.

471
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,337
Do I…

472
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,466
Do I just need to apologize?

473
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,178
I'm sorry. I must have lost my…

474
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,347
I apologize. Please let this one slide.

475
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,311
I don't care what you two are up to.

476
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,815
But you should at least
refrain from harming others.

477
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,569
I will.

478
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,388
Excuse me.

479
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,933
Could you open the gate for me?

480
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,019
Thank you.

481
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,777
I've been living in a daze.

482
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,531
I tried so hard to not fall behind

483
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,158
and to not be mistreated

484
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,661
as if my life depended on it.

485
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,289
But looking back,

486
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,584
the one who's been mistreating me the most

487
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,921
was myself.

488
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,851
How big did you say your potato field was?

489
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,062
I only planted 1,000 pyeong.

490
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,273
He planted 2,000 pyeong.

491
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,066
That's a lot.

492
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,986
You need at least 1,000 pyeong
to call it a potato farm.

493
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,405
But it's not raining much these days.

494
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,033
They're getting all dried up.

495
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,828
I know, but we can't do anything about it.

496
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,939
YEONGJU TRANSPORTATION

497
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,864
My monthly salary was 2.38 million won.

498
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,993
That's the amount I exchanged my time for.

499
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,165
Now I've decided to use that time

500
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,127
entirely for myself.

501
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:06,101
You know I'm not the type
that trusts someone easily with a job.

502
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,647
So think of this as an opportunity

503
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,566
and give it your best.

504
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,734
Good luck.

505
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,693
Wait.

506
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,613
I think Ms. Kim was in charge of this.

507
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,032
How is that important?

508
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,743
We're on the same team.
Where's the team spirit?

509
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,210
Look.

510
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,671
You disgusting pig.

511
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,967
-Look at this.
-What? Really?

512
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,887
That's disgusting.

MANAGER CHOI JI-WON:
COME THE LOVER HOTEL, ROOM 802

516
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,272
YEO-REUM: I'M SORRY, MR. CHOI.
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS

517
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,239
Hey, Mr. Choi!

518
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,638
This feels great.

519
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,610
From this moment on,
I'm not going to do anything.

520
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,112
I'm going on a strike from life.

521
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:54,037
"We may fall at times
but we're never defeated."

522
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:58,417
All right, I'll live however I want here.
No more walking on eggshells.

523
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,170
So obnoxious.

524
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,924
How drunk do you have to be
to fall asleep at the library?

525
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,509
-I'm sorry.
-I accept your apology.

526
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,596
You can always leave
when you can't take it anymore.

527
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,056
I have nothing more to lose.

528
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,851
I'll live a life that I won't regret.

529
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,561
I can do it!
