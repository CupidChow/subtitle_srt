00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,100
Hey, slow down!

4
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,602
My bad. Are you okay?

5
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,021
If you need to use the bathroom,
we can stop for a bit.

6
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,522
No, I'm fine.

7
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,816
I'm not. I'm scared.

8
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,988
All right, here we are.

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,492
If I get a ticket because of you…

10
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,081
Go to the bathroom while I get the papers.

11
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,332
No, I'm fine.

12
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,334
I'll drive you home.

13
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,044
I'll get going.

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,879
-Where?
-Bye.

15
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,299
-What about my keys?
-They're in the car!

16
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,718
What's up with him?

00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,953
SEON-A

18
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,390
What's wrong?

19
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,808
You want to go for a walk?

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,103
Can't we stay in for tonight?

21
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,064
Fine.

22
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,566
Let's go.

23
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,444
Come here.

24
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,288
Mr. Librarian?

25
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,266
What brings you all the way here
at this hour?

26
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,893
I'm too late, aren't I?

27
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,935
Not at all.

28
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,403
Well, everyone did leave.

29
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:23,411
I was about to take a walk with Gyeo-ul.

30
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,707
If we're going the same way,
why don't we walk together?

31
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,542
Sure.

32
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,547
By the way,

33
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,383
why are you sweating so much?

34
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,305
Oh. It's a bit warm today.

35
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,642
Is it?

36
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,022
Do you really go for a jog
that early every day?

37
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,400
You have such a diligent lifestyle.

38
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,986
My eyes just open at that time.

39
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,906
I actually have trouble sleeping.

40
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,201
If that's the case,
you should keep your eyes closed.

41
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,204
When you close your eyes again,
you naturally fall back asleep.

42
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,873
I've slept up to 14 hours like that.

43
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,459
-Fourteen hours?
-Yes.

44
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,630
But back when I was working in Seoul,
I led a healthy lifestyle too.

45
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,425
-I only said that because I was jealous.
-I see.

46
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,226
I'll be going…

47
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,185
that way now.

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,937
Take care.

49
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:32,897
You too.

50
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,940
Thank you.

51
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,567
Goodbye, Gyeo-ul.

52
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,823
Mr. Librarian!

53
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,166
Never mind.

54
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,419
Goodbye.

55
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,005
-Okay. Goodbye.
-Bye.

56
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,759
Let's go.

58
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,557
As if I can wake up early in the morning.

59
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,018
Right, Gyeo-ul?

60
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,899
Good morning.

61
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,318
Ms. Lee!

62
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,863
I thought I'd get some exercise too.

63
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,989
Really?

64
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,617
Slow down.

65
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,536
You'll tire yourself out.

66
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,163
I see.

67
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,625
You don't even sound like
you're out of breath.

69
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,977
Stop it.

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,313
I need some sleep.

71
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,231
You should sleep too.

72
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,903
Come on, I can do this.

73
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,073
No, I can't.

74
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,991
There must be some soju left.

75
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,164
Ms. Lee.

76
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,666
Good morning.

77
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,502
You really came.

78
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,253
It felt good to jog in the morning.

79
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,090
In that case…

80
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,551
shall we meet at the library
every morning for a jog?

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,303
Every morning?

82
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:30,389
I planned out some decent routes for us.

83
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,313
But since it's very early in the morning,

84
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,315
shorter routes would be better, right?

85
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,400
Definitely.

86
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,948
But still, you really don't have to
change your route for me.

87
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,200
We can take the route you take,
Mr. Librarian.

88
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,786
It's Dae-bum.

89
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,038
Sorry?

90
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,290
My name is Dae-bum.

91
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:57,917

92
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,423
Okay.

93
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,268
Gosh, I'm drained.

94
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,901
I think he would like this.

95
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,863
Yeo-reum!

96
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,867
Are you inside, Yeo-reum?

97
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:32,994
Ms. Jung!

98
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,746
Gosh, there you are.

99
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,956
Hello.

100
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:39,959
Ms. Jung!

101
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,794
What brings you here?

102
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,671
You should come in.

103
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,506
It's fine. I need to get going.

104
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,591
I see.

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,342
Actually,

106
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,594
I…

107
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,514
have a favor to ask you.

108
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,724
What is it?

109
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,101
You can ask me.

110
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:01,647
Someone I know has a vacation home
by Dongcheon Valley.

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,820
I was wondering if you would be willing
to go there to spend some time with Bom.

112
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,030
Me?

113
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,325
That young girl went through a lot.

114
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,537
But I haven't done anything for her
as her grandmother.

115
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,541
This isn't a favor. It's a gift.

116
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,127
I'm so thankful to hear you say that.

117
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,421
I get to go on a vacation thanks to you.

118
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,215
Thank you.

119
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,426
-Dae-bum.
-Yes?

120
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,802
Dae-bum.

121
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,970
Get over here.

122
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,975
Look at this.

125
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,065
He's incredible.

126
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,776
Come here.

127
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,444
-What?
-Come here.

128
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,071
-What's this?
-Goodness!

129
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,447
Why?

130
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,575
-What's wrong?
-You had sand on you.

131
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,577
Oh, I see.

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,498
Why are you being so fussy
about me touching you?

133
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,583
Sorry.

134
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,963
Hey.

135
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,924

Yes.

141
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,875
By any chance…

142
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,796
are you going to have dinner--
I mean, are you busy tonight?

143
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,966
Why? Do you want to see a movie?

144
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,052
-A movie?
-Pardon?

145
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,682
What I meant was…

146
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,061
There's actually a movie
that I really wanted to see.

147
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,688
And it just got released
in the theaters today.

148
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,106
I see.

149
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,320
-Do you want to come with--
-Should we watch--

150
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,784
If it's okay with you.

151
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,827
Should we?

00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,041
-This must be heavy.
-It's fine.

153
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,626
-Let me help.
-No, it's heavy.

154
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,671
I'm so sorry.

155
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,506
It's fine. They're heavy.

156
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,596
And I already have the tickets
for the movie.

157
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,098
Already? Give that to me.

158
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,307
This is heavy.

159
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,102
-You can carry this.
-Okay.

160
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,457
-Bom, any plans for the summer?
-I don't know. None of your business.

161
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,126
-Yeo-reum!
-Yeo-reum!

Skipping classes?

163
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,547
What do you mean, "skipping"?

164
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,048
Our summer break started today.

165
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,216
-Already?
-Yes.

166
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,177
Every day is summer break for me, so…

167
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,595
How unfortunate though.

168
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,225
I honestly was determined
to go to school diligently this time.

169
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,520
But why do you keep smiling
while saying that?

170
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,813
Mind your own business.

171
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,232
Yeo-reum.

172
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,610
I saw Grandma
packing up some stuff for you.

173
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,654
Yes. I got them.

174
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,407
Did she mention anything else?

175
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,453
She said we should go somewhere together.

176
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,038
Really? Like a trip?

177
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,791
Seriously? I've been wanting
to go on a trip too.

178
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,750
Where to, though?

179
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,210
The beach? The mountains?

180
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,754
Your grandma said that her acquaintance

181
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,007
has a summer home in Dongcheon.

182
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,966
Dongcheon?

183
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,759
Where's that?

184
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,678
That's not important.
What should I prepare?

185
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,265
Hey, why are you assuming
that you're coming with us?

186
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,183
Right.

187
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,101
Let's invite Dae-bum as well.

188
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,978
-Wait…
-I'll talk him into it.

189
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,439
Dae-bum!

190
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,318
This isn't a playground.

191
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,611
My bad.

192
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,872
Hey, this is the valley in Dongcheon.

193
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,582
It's so nice. Look.

194
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:15,002
Stop making a fuss about it.
We can just go see it there.

195
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,462
I said I don't want to see it.

196
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,755
Hey, guys.

197
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,926
I actually have plans tonight.

198
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,761
I'll see you later.

199
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,304
Plans?

200
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,139
Who would you spend time with besides us?

201
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,808
Okay, Yeo-reum. We'll get going then.

202
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,770
-Take care.
-Good luck.

203
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,981
-What should we buy for the trip?
-How about meat?

204
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,157
-Let's go have dinner.
-Sorry, Ji-yeong.

205
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,160
I have plans tonight.

206
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,247
With Yeo-reum?

207
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,373
Yes.

208
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,552
-Ahn Dae-bum.
-Yes?

209
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,846
I'm not just a friend to you. Right?

210
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,891
No.

211
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,358
Ji-yeong, that hurts.

212
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,824
I'm also starting to hurt because of you.

213
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,546
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

214
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,089
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

215
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,602
Yeo-reum.

216
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,689
Let me lock up real quick.

217
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,399
Take your time.

218
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,034
Shall we go then?

219
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:10,951
Okay.

220
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,828
Did I keep you waiting?

221
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,205
Not at all. I just left the library.

222
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,752
Pathetic.

223
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,187
There are a lot of trees and…

224
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,027
Goodness.

225
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,739
You should always check
whether you have the lights on or off.

226
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,367
You're so clumsy.

227
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,417
Make sure to keep the engine running.

228
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,671
You should be thanking me.

229
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,756
Who else would come
to jump your battery this late?

230
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,300
And why would you call me,
not the insurance company?

231
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,677
You're such a weirdo.

232
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,223
Why are you so moody?

233
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,478
Ji-yeong, are you crying?

234
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,107
Hey.

235
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,446
What happened?

236
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,492
I don't know. I feel so pathetic.

237
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,746
All right, Ji-yeong.

238
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,915
Go ahead. Crying makes you feel better.

239
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,045
Everything is so annoying.

240
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,633
Gosh.

241
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,139
It's fine.

242
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,724
Get me some tissues.

243
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,475
Tissue? In the car?

244
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,647
-Bottom compartment!
-Found it.

245
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,117
Enjoy the movie.

246
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,745
Here.

247
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,956
I'm sorry, but you can't go in.

248
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,709
-Why not?
-The ticket isn't for today.

249
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,294
It's for next week.

250
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,296
This movie premieres next week.

251
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,881
That can't be true.

252
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,008
Take a look at the date.

253
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,260
You're right.

254
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,184
How did I miss that?

255
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,188
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. No problem.

256
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,110
Then…

257
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,113
Do you want to go have some
chicken and beer?

258
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,032
Chicken and beer?

259
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,159
Earlier at the library,

260
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,121
I was actually going to ask you out
for chicken and beer.

261
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,375
-Sounds good.
-All right.

262
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,753
Let me look a place up.

263
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,049
If we go that way,

264
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,844
there's a really old place
that sells amazing fried chicken.

265
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,721
And there's a place down that way

266
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,432
where the interior is nice and spacious,

267
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,393
but the chicken doesn't taste as good.

268
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,772
And down that way,
there's a place with outdoor tables

269
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,525
known for its refreshing beer.

270
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:33,028
You've really done your research.

271
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,572
Yes. Just in case.

272
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,075
I…

273
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,494
choose number three.

274
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,205
Beer tends to vary
more in taste than chicken.

275
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,332
I see.

276
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,251
How long does it take to get there?

277
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,585
About ten minutes.

278
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,170
It's close.

279
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,467
Why are you running?

280
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,719
It takes ten minutes by running.

281
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,932
Do you want to walk instead?

282
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,600
No, it's fine. Let's run.

283
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,686
It takes 30 minutes when you walk.

284
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,771
Let's get there in five minutes then.

285
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,488
It's amazing.

286
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,324
The beer here is so refreshing.

287
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,579
Who thought of eating
chicken and beer together?

288
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:30,669
Whoever first discovered
chicken and beer deserves an award.

289
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,422
Use this.

290
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,175
Thank you.

291
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,510
It's so tasty.

292
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,720
CHOSEON CHICKEN

293
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,388
Before I forget.

294
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,765
I brought this.

295
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,226
MYEONGJU

296
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,270
What's that?

297
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,521
Youth of Angok.

298
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,773
It was released today.

299
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,983
No way.

300
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,115
Hold on.

301
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,744
-Don't tell me you read it already.
-No, I haven't read it yet.

302
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,454
That's a relief.

303
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,290
You shouldn't read it though.
My writing is awful.

304
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,000
It was okay.

305
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,003
What? You said you haven't read it.

306
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,546
I meant the photo, not the writing.

307
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,341
I brought another copy so I can read it

308
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,800
as soon as I get home.

309
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,094
No, please don't read that.

310
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,347
You'll be disappointed.

311
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,185
You little prick.

312
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,064
How dare you trip me?

313
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,232
Mister.

314
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,484
-Gosh.
-What's wrong with him?

315
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,778
Are you okay?

316
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,197
-Goodness.
-Let go!

317
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,365
You bastard.

318
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,408
Listen.

319
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
I was only okay

320
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,121
because I learned
how to fall safely in the Marine Corps.

321
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,749
If it were anyone else,
they would've hit their head.

322
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,251
You better watch out!

323
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,545
Let go of me!

324
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,934
Is something wrong?

325
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,397
You're dead if you tell anyone
what happened today.

326
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,523
Goodness.

327
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,068
No one would believe that
the mighty Ji-yeong cried her eyes out.

328
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,616
Thank you.

329
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,995
What?

330
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,789
You're all I've got.

331
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,004
See you.

332
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,341
If there's anything that's troubling you,
just tell me.

333
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,844
Your existence is troubling me.

334
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,430
Seriously? At least you seem better now,

335
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,308
with that attitude back and all.

336
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,728
Bye.

337
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,230
Drive safely.

338
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,150
I'm going.

339
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,869
I'm all she has?

340
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,623
Am I the only one?

341
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,839
-Did you enjoy the food?
-Yes.

342
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,050
-How much is it?
-I got it.

343
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,134
It's okay.

344
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,136
It's already been paid for.

345
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,347
The guy who tripped earlier paid.

346
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,016
Really?

347
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:44,029
The beer was great,
and we got free chicken.

348
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,781
What an amazing day.

349
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,162
So, do you just not get angry?

350
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,583
I've never seen you get angry.

351
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,255
That was an aggravating moment earlier.

352
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,426
Do you not get angry
or are you just holding it back?

353
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,514
Anything can happen in life.

354
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,892
That's how I try to understand them.

355
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,022
So that I can keep living on.

356
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,405
You're much more mature than I am.

357
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,284
It's not easy for me to think like that.

358
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,958
It takes a while for us
to get home, right?

359
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,003
Why don't we kill some time
playing 21 questions?

360
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,840
Did you say 21 questions?

361
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,802
I'll probably be asking
all the questions, but…

362
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,970
Okay.

363
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,183
What's your favorite fruit?

364
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,561
Apples are my favorite.

365
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,230
You answered so quickly.

366
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,400
Mine are…

367
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,568
strawberries.

368
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,445
Strawberries.

369
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,781
Then…

370
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,283
For my next question,

371
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,451
who is your favorite…

372
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,203
author?

373
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,707
This is a hard one.

374
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,793
Just off the top of your head.

375
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,255
My favorite is Kim Ae-ran.

376
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,882
I see.

377
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,091
What about you?

378
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,218
My favorite is Carl Sagan.

379
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,347
I had a great time reading
Murmurs of Earth.

380
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,558
The book suits you well.

381
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,269
Let's ask our last questions.

382
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,148
What's your favorite season?

383
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,691
I love summer.

384
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,445
I mean the season.

385
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,281
I know.

386
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,075
Summer is my favorite as well.

387
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,167
Can I ask one more?

388
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,376
Of course.

389
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,755
When we first met,

390
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:11,009
why did you not talk to me?

391
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,555
Actually…

392
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,894
I have trouble talking to strangers.

393
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,604
That's why.

394
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,361
Does that mean you feel
comfortable around me now?

395
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,488
We talked a lot today.

396
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,242
Maybe that's why my throat kind of hurts.

397
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,037
I don't think you've talked that much.

398
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,174
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KILLED SEON-A

399
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,386
What the heck?

400
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,637
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KILLED SEON-A

401
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,060
YOU'RE THE ONE

402
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,813
Are you okay?

403
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,356
Excuse me, Yeo-reum.

404
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,191
Dae-bum.

405
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,485
Dae-bum!

406
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,972
YOU'RE THE ONE

407
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,726
WHO KILLED SEON-A

408
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,158
Answer me!

409
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,369
I don't know.

410
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,330
How dare you lie in front of the police?

411
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,501
Dae-bum.

412
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,380
You've told us everything until now.
Why are you acting like this?

413
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,424
You said you saw your dad run away
on your way home.

414
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,302
Am I wrong?

415
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,846
Dae-bum, look at me.

416
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,141
I'm telling you to look at me.

417
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,314
Tell me.

418
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,275
You're actually happy she's dead,
aren't you?

419
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,320
You hated her.

420
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,198
Aren't I right?

421
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,661
It's true.

422
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,205
You're glad that your sister died.

423
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,087
No, I'm not. That's not true.

424
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,505
It's not!

425
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,927
It's not true.

426
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,489
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KILLED SEON-A

427
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,926
Dae-bum.

428
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,683
Ahn Dae-bum.

429
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,527
Hey, you're here.

430
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,613
Who opened up the shutter doors?

431
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,907
-Did you open it?
-No.

432
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,910
Hurry up and pull it down.

433
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,830
YOU'RE THE ONE

434
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,665
What kind of lunatic did this?

435
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,626
-Gosh.
-Someone made a mess again.

436
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,794
"You're

437
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,420
the one…

438
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,464
WHO KILLED SEON-A

439
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,175
…who killed Seon-a?"

440
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,761
But it was Seon-a's dad who murdered her.

441
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,678
Gosh.

442
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,014
I think we should report this

443
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,265
before it blows up.

444
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,935
That's a bad idea.
Word will spread across town.

445
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,020
That's not the issue here.

446
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,688
Gosh, seriously.

447
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,609
What did I do to Seon-a's family
to deserve this nonsense?

448
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,111
Dad. Can you please watch your words?

449
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,406
Dae-bum, that bastard.

450
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,867
I took it easy on him
because I felt bad, but now…

451
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,327
He's a victim.

452
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,246
What?

453
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,332
Dae-bum is the biggest victim here.

454
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,626
I'm glad you brought that up.

455
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,337
Did I kill his sister and his mom?

456
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,341
Look what happened to my building
because of his family.

457
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,094
I'm the victim here!

458
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,638
-Dad.
-Sir, please calm down.

459
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,391
Sir, I'll tell you what.

460
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,018
I'll install CCTV there first.

461
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,688
Yes, CCTV sounds great.

462
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,190
You should've installed it sooner.

463
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,984
Mu-cheol, thank you.

464
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,444
I can always rely on you.

465
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,697
Damn it.

466
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,823
Yeo-reum.

467
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,539
If you see anyone suspicious,
call me immediately.

468
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,834
Okay.

469
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,294
Hello, Professor Lee.

470
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,671
-It's Park Cheol-hyeon from Naeil Daily.
-I don't do interviews.

471
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,882
-I'm hanging up.
-Please hold on.

472
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,175
In science forums,

473
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,052
-the dissertation you wrote--
-I'm busy.

474
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,972
-Goodbye.
-Professor Lee.

475
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,849
Professor Lee.

476
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,643
I think you should take a look at this.

477
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,730
It's a post
from our school's online forum.

478
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,940
What's this?

479
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:45,820
Everyone's talking about
how you stole someone else's idea.

480
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,363
"Stole"?

481
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,159
Look at all this nonsense.

482
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,120
I think this will only get worse

483
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,289
unless Dae-bum shows up himself.

484
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,541
The school president wants to call
the institutional review board.

485
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,877
Institutional review board?

486
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,087
What happens then?

487
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,631
If things go wrong,

488
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,175
it's over for him in his field of studies.

489
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,218
Buying ideas from another person

490
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,887
is a huge moral issue.

491
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,015
This can also cause harm
to Dae-bum if things--

492
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,517
-Even Dae-bum?
-Yes.

493
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,979
That's why he has to come
to the board meeting

494
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,606
and explain what happened.

495
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,733
I'm begging you.

496
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,322
All right.

497
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,700
I'll speak to Dae-bum about this
and let you know.

498
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,620
Hello.

499
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,624
Did Dae-bum come in today?

500
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,250
"Dae-bum"?

501
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,420
He's not here yet.

502
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,092
By any chance…

503
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,387
did something happen
when he was with you last night?

504
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,683
Well…

505
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,063
Did we really have to buy this much?

506
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,482
It's a day trip, not a neighborhood party.

507
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,192
My bad. It's just happened.

508
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,904
It may look like much,
but we'll go through these in a flash.

509
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,989
Gosh.

510
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,201
Hey, where are you going?

511
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,370
Are you not coming in?

512
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,454
This is my home.

513
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,540
-Here?
-Yes.

514
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,543
Come on in.

515
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,632
You can put it over here.

516
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,262
Hey.

517
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,347
Is this place really your home?

518
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,057
No. It's my aunt's.

519
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,642
My homeroom teacher?

520
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,644
You knew?

521
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,856
Everyone in our school knows.

522
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,316
You guys always meet
behind the teacher's office.

523
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:48,985
So everyone knows.

524
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,155
But I didn't know homeroom…

525
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,367
I mean, your aunt, was this rich.

526
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,619
Well, it's a bit complicated.

527
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,704
Come here.

528
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,707
My dad bought this place
so she can keep her eyes on me.

529
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,084
You can sit here.

530
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,798
It must be suffocating
to live with your aunt.

531
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,884
But my aunt doesn't live here.

532
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,885
What?

533
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,887
So you have this huge place
all to yourself?

534
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,307
Actually, I only use the first floor.

535
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,349
Why?

536
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,769
No idea. You rest up here.

537
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,771
It's fine. Let's organize it together.

538
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,189
Thank you.

539
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,277
Hey, what's this?

540
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,697
Why is this huge refrigerator
completely empty?

541
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,616
Don't you like cooking?

542
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,160
I cook for others, not for myself.

543
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,953
I don't usually cook.

544
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,210
Bom, if you're going to help,
can you peel the pears?

545
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,380
Hey, I think someone's here.

546
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,723
Why are you here so suddenly?

547
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,810
I told you the English teacher
will be here today.

548
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,312
What's all this?

549
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,189
And why is she here?

550
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,650
Auntie, actually…

551
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,527
Heo Jae-hun.

552
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,611
Let's talk outside.

553
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,987
-Thomas.
-Yes?

554
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,619
Bom, sorry. Give me a second.

555
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,959
Heo Jae-hun!

556
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,294
What on earth is wrong with you?

557
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,420
Tell me.

558
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,172
How many times did I tell you?

559
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,217
You can't be doing this!
Think of your mom and dad!

560
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,177
Come to your senses!

561
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,687
Get up. Let's get you to a doctor.

562
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,066
Come on, get up.

563
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,779
No.

564
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,574
I'm okay.

565
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,827
Fine.

566
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,539
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

567
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,093
I warned you. I won't tell you twice.

568
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,639
I'll be going now, Jae-hun.

569
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,556
Hey.

570
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,225
Listen.

571
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,518
I don't know what you're up to,

572
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,437
but don't call him ever again.

573
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,191
Heo Jae-hun.

574
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,069
Do you not like hanging out with me?

575
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,237
What did you say?

576
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,991
I do. I love hanging out with you.

577
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,037
See? He's the one who keeps
chasing me around.

578
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,121
You little…

579
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,957
Hey, do you want to get expelled?

580
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,375
Bom, I'll come with you.

581
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,168
Jae-hun! Where do you think you're going?

582
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,379
I'm going to tell your dad everything.

583
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,672
Suit yourself.

584
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,261
She's a very bad Auntie.

585
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,179
I heard everything too.

586
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,098
Thomas.

587
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,029
-Nurse Kim.
-Yes.

588
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,614
Give him an injection.

589
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,741
-Okay.
-Make sure you get the shot.

590
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,494
-Okay.
-Come this way.

591
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,962
How is he?

592
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,924
Our bodies are smart.
You might think you've forgotten about it,

593
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,136
but they don't forget traumas so easily.

594
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,306
His mind needs to rest, okay?

595
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,307
Of course.

596
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,227
Just let him do whatever he wants to do.

597
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,396
All we can do is just wait.

598
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,605
Lie down and relax.

599
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,401
He's not doing so great, is he?

600
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,820
No. Not too great.

601
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,282
I'll prescribe more medicine,

602
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,951
so make sure he takes it regularly.

603
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,328
Okay, I will.

604
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,746
By the way,

605
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,082
when are you two getting married?

606
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,459
Next in line can come in.

607
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,003
Gosh, I told you we aren't together.

608
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,840
He's just bad at expressing his feelings.

609
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,135
Hold on.

610
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,721
Who the hell drew that graffiti?

611
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,069
Die, Seon-a.

612
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,447
Kill Seon-a. Seon-a dies.

613
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,616
Kill Seon-a. Seon-a dies.

614
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,409
Kill Seon-a! Seon-a dies!

615
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,453
Kill Seon-a! Seon-a dies!

616
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,789
Kill Seon-a!

617
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,917
-Die Seon-a!
-She's not Seon-a, Geun-ho!

618
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,543
-Please.
-Seon-a die.

619
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,629
Get yourself together, please.

620
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,632
Geun-ho. Look at me.

621
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,134
If you do that again,
I'll have to call the cops.

622
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,762
The cops are so scary!

623
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,222
Geun-ho.

624
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,349
-The cops are so scary!
-Geun-ho.

625
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,684
-Seon-a is in danger.
-Calm down.

626
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,144
It's okay, Geun-ho.

627
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,317
Ji-yeong.

628
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,279
You were…

629
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,952
friends with my sister.

630
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,790
Did you like her?

631
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,794
Friends, my foot.

632
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,338
If she was at the top,
I was at rock bottom.

633
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,512
I hated her.

634
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,896
Father always scolded me…

635
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,486
because of her.

636
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,019
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

637
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,690
What brings you here?

638
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,031
So this is what your home is like.

639
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,866
I'll take a seat.

640
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,621
So…

641
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,665
What about Dae-bum?

642
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,085
He was medicated at the hospital

643
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,630
and he's now home getting some rest.

644
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,923
The hospital?

645
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,263
Yeo-reum.

646
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,559
You've heard what happened
in this place, right?

647
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,772
Yes, Bom told me.

648
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,109
When Dae-bum's sister died here,

649
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,946
do you know who found her first?

650
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,283
It was Dae-bum.

651
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,829
The first one to find his mother
when she had killed herself…

652
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,707
was Dae-bum as well.

653
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,710
For him,

654
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,881
the fact that you live in this building
is taking a toll on him.

655
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,758
It keeps reminding him of his past.

656
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:38,389
He thinks he caused
all of his family's deaths.

657
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,434
What about Bom's hospital bill?

658
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,853
Do you know who paid for it?

659
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,648
Hospital bill? I thought…

660
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:52,069
Because you were distressed about
Bom's hospital bills,

661
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,489
he called his old professor

662
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,324
and sold his thesis to him.

663
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,535
For the hospital bill.

664
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,333
Thanks to that, the professor
that helped Dae-bum is in trouble.

665
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,796
If Dae-bum doesn't go to Seoul
this instant,

666
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,008
everything will be ruined.

667
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,509
Why did this happen?

668
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,387
Yeo-reum.

669
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,889
Do you like Dae-bum?

670
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,309
Sorry?

671
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,227
I actually don't even care anymore.

672
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,230
I don't care how you feel about him.

673
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,733
I absolutely despise the fact

674
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,653
that Dae-bum is getting worse
because of you.

675
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,241
Do you know how hard it was
for him to recover as much as he did?

676
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,745
He keeps running because he can't sleep.

677
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,289
He's always alone.

678
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,458
That's how he held up.

679
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,961
He held onto his life
trying his best not to break down.

680
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,006
But all of that fell apart today.

681
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,134
He shut himself off in his room.

682
00:43:58,844 --> 00:43:59,970
I don't even know

683
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,515
when he'll be
able to leave his room again.

684
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,397
I'm sorry.

685
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,442
I don't need that. Anyone can apologize.

686
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,486
Yeo-reum.

687
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,405
Can you take responsibility?

688
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,869
Can you take responsibility
for Dae-bum's life?

689
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,331
I can.

690
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,584
I always have, and always will.

691
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,588
For you,

692
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,592
this might be
just a summer fling by the beach,

693
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,552
but that's not the case for me.

694
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,471
It's not like that.

695
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,518
If it's not, then help me.

696
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,146
If you're not going to leave this place,

697
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,816
please help me
so that he can leave this place.

698
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,486
I'm asking you a favor.

699
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,533
Just this once.

700
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,065
Will you be okay?

701
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,403
I'll have to beg for her forgiveness.

702
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,697
Of course, you will.

703
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,701
Thank you, Bom.

704
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,704
For what?

705
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,540
For everything.

706
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,128
I'm jealous

707
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,213
of what you can do.

708
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,299
You're jealous of me?

709
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,134
I'm jealous of you.

710
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,386
-You are?
-Yes.

711
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,722
You're rich.

712
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,853
The way I see it,

713
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,564
you're way richer than I am.

714
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,486
You have Ha-neul and your grandma.

715
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,954
Hey.

716
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,249
What if she really gets me expelled?

717
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,169
Go back home
and put in a good word for me.

718
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,256
I'll just say I'll quit school too then.

719
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,927
Whatever.

720
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,076
If only I didn't move into
in the billiard club,

721
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,871
you wouldn't have had to
go through all this.

722
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,165
You know it's not your fault.

723
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:42,127
I'm truly happy that you came to Angok.

724
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,297
I don't want any more sadness in my life.

725
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,466
If someone comes
to draw graffiti again, bite them.

726
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,843
All right. Take care.

727
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,179
The graffiti must be that bastard's doing.

728
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,639
We've installed CCTV, so…

729
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,765
