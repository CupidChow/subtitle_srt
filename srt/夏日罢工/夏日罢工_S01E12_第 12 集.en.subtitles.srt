ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, GROUPS, AND
ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,379
SCENES WITH ANIMALS ARE STAGED
ACCORDING TO ANIMAL WELFARE GUIDELINES

3
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:50,842
Is it okay

4
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,386
if I ask you a question?

5
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,555
Go ahead.

6
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,852
Did Officer Kwak ever tell you
about the footage of Geun-ho

7
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,938
coming into the billiard club in the past?

8
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,191
Geun-ho came to the billiard club?

9
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,110
No, he said nothing of the sort.

10
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,653
Really?

11
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,116
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,452
Mu-cheol is always watching the CCTV

13
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,162
but he hasn't said anything like that.

14
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,915
I wonder why he never mentioned that.

15
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,668
If I may ask,

16
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,172
what's the relationship between
Mr. Kwak's family and Dae-bum's family?

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,050
Their relationship…

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,886
They do have some history.

19
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,555
I only heard this from the others.

20
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,309
Apparently, Mr. Kwak and Dae-bum's father
were best friends

21
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,853
until that incident in this building.

22
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,816
Ever since then,
they became sworn enemies.

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,151
Why?

24
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,613
On the day of the incident,

25
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,241
Dae-bum's father said
he went fishing with Mr. Kwak

26
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,992
but Mr. Kwak denied it.

27
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,203
That testimony

28
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:05,458
was the final blow that made
Dae-bum's father the culprit.

29
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,963
Could you tell me how old
Officer Kwak was back then?

30
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,216
-What did you say?
-I didn't do it.

31
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,884
This is a police station, you punks.

32
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,386
I was…

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,471
I was 11 years old.

34
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,558
And Mu-cheol is
four years older than I am.

35
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,185
So he must have been in his
second year of middle school.

36
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,979
ANGOK MIDDLE SCHOOL

37
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,022
Calm down, breathe.

38
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,566
KWAK MU-CHEOL

39
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,734
Kwak Mu-cheol from Angok Middle School.

40
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,784
You killed her, didn't you?

41
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,787
My sister.

42
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,916
What are you so afraid of?

43
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,335
What?

44
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,673
What do you want to hide so badly
that you'd even commit murder?

45
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,592
In this building…

46
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,720
you murdered my…

47
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,680
Dae-bum.

48
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,308
What are you saying?

49
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,560
It's not me.

50
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,562
How can you do that to her?

51
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,484
How can you do that to my family?

52
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,991
It's not me.

53
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,492
It's not me!

54
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,628
Did you think I would never find out?

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,424
Did you think you could just live on

56
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,718
without anyone finding out?

57
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,303
It's not me.

58
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,721
I didn't do it!

59
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,057
I said I didn't do it!

60
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,893
Did you kill Ms. Jung to cover up

61
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,855
the fact that your son killed Seon-a?

62
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,984
You're making absurd accusations.

63
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,611
Then what's this?

64
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,155
What does this graffiti mean?

65
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,450
You know better than I do
as to what Geun-ho saw that day.

66
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,702
How dare you run your mouth!

67
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,746
It's over for you.

68
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,124
This is just graffiti,
but what would the experts say?

69
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,711
How dare you blackmail me
with some stupid graffiti?

70
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,421
Then what about the CCTV footage?

71
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,550
Did you think no one would see
if he stayed at the end of the stairs?

72
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,929
I bet you didn't even think about
the reflections on Geun-ho's window.

73
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,347
Geun-ho.

74
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,015
Get up here.

75
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,478
Hey.

76
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,938
Come on already.

00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,651
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

78
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm right, aren't I?

79
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,913
You killed Ms. Jung
to cover up for killing Seon-a!

80
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,331
Stop talking nonsense!

81
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,166
You don't know anything.

82
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,089
Everyone will now know

83
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,966
that your son is a murderer!

84
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,429
You're wrong.

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,517
You've got it all wrong.

86
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,691
Bom's grandmother

87
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,736
wasn't murdered by my son.

88
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,904
It was me.

89
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,827
I mean, shit. I wasn't planning on it.

90
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,790
But it should have been you.

91
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,667
It should have been you there!

92
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,074
Please start driving.

93
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,575
Where to?

94
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,202
Myeongju Police Station.

95
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,329
Hey, stop right there.

96
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,247
-Hurry and drive, please.
-Wait.

97
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,874
Hey, hold on!

98
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,044
Damn it.

99
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,464
I'm on my way.

100
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,967
I'm going there with evidence
for a murder case.

101
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,856
What's that?

102
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,276
Don't stop the car, okay?

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,028
-Vehicle 386,
-Please keep going.

104
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,571
stop the car.

105
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,865
-But the cop is telling us to stop.
-No.

106
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,659
-Please just keep going.
-Stop the car.

107
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,285
-Stop the car!
-Please.

108
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,370
Just trust me.

109
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,038
I'm going to the station anyway.

110
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,748
Stop the car right now.

111
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,544
Sir, please.

112
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,641
Please I beg you.

113
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,147
Get out of the car.

114
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,314
Get out!

115
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,025
-Get out!
-Trust me this once.

116
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,610
I said get out!

117
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,945
Hey, open the door.

118
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,488
Hey!

119
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,157
Get out.

120
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,741
Hey!

121
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,416
How dare he talk like that
to a tax-paying citizen like me?

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,543
Hold tight.

123
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,669
All right?

124
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,421
Thank you.

125
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,383

00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,662
Geun-ho remembered

129
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,789
what happened in the past

130
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,167
watching the footage Dae-bum recorded…

131
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,461
No, Seon-a!

132
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,922
-Run away, it hurts!
-Geun-ho.

133
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,757
One.

134
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,928
Two.

135
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,766
…and he began to talk.

136
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,490
…wasn't murdered by my son. It was me.

137
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,409
You're saying Mr. Kwak said this, right?

138
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,327
Yes.

139
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,163
He's the father of Officer Kwak
of Angok Precinct.

140
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,125
You know that secret recordings
can't be used in court, right?

141
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,753
You might even get punished for this.

142
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,130
I'm the victim here.

143
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,549
Sure, whatever.

144
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,092
I've been tricked by her.

145
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,469
Those two are trying to frame me.

146
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,428
Just you wait.

147
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,180
I won't let this slide.

148
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,473
Sir.

149
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,100
-I get it, let go!
-Move.

150
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,018
Who's the one that killed Ms. Jung?

151
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,776
Who killed Seon-a?

152
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,074
As we expected,

153
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,704
Mr. Kwak and Officer Kwak
were the culprits of the incidents.

154
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,501
It's what Geun-ho has been trying
to tell everyone for a long time.

155
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,302
How did you manage
to get a confession out of Mr. Kwak?

156
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,721
I don't know.

157
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:01,100
I wasn't in my right mind,
so I didn't even know what I was saying.

158
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,813
If it wasn't for the taser
you bought for me,

159
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,398
I would've been in big trouble.

160
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,070
Actually, the bit about seeing
Mu-cheol on the window

161
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,907
of Geun-ho's house was a lie.

162
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,454
I have no idea what made me say that.

163
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,499
Why didn't you fight back?

164
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,087
Well, earlier…

165
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,798
I wasn't in my right mind either.

166
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,681
I wonder why Geun-ho only
wrote down parts of his name.

167
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,769
If he had spelled it out,
the culprit would've been caught already.

170

He went fishing with my dad.

171
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,729
I see.

172
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,945
I heard you've been bragging
about solving hard problems.

173
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,784
Stop acting like you're studying.

174
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,452
Give it back.

175
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,372
My dad always scolds me because of you.

176
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,169
What an idiot.

177
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,549
Hey.

178
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,509
What did you just say?

179
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,761
If you're dumb, at least be nice.

180
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,887
You insolent little…

181
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,599
Hey.

182
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,935
You can brag all you want on television.

00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,563
How dare you call me an idiot
just because you're smart?

184
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,356
Hey, get up.

185
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,150
Hey!

186
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,148
KWAK MU-CHEOL

187
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,318
I'm sorry I've been gone
for so long, Gyeo-ul.

188
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,702
Yeo-reum, I have somewhere to go tomorrow.

189
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,665
Do you want to stay here while I'm gone?

190
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,585
It won't take long.

191
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,008
Okay, I'll do that.

192
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,391
ALTTEUL STORE

193
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,478
I guess you can't really know someone.

194
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,481
That Kwak family ruined our building.

195
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,316
Tell me about it.

196
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,652
The world is a scary place.

197
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,656
Mu-cheol became a cop
after doing something so terrible.

198
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,408
Gosh, it's scary.

199
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,119
This whole thing must have been
tough for Chang-su's family.

200
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,538
Take good care of them.

201
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,416
You feel responsible, don't you?

202
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,460
I decided to sell them the building.

203
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,795
What?

204
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,089
You're going to sell it to Chang-su?

205
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,757
Chang-su is willing to buy that?

206
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,011
I told him it was half-price.
Anyone would buy it.

207
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,222
Dad.

208
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,892
That's so awesome of you.
What a great decision.

209
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,185
Even I'm thankful.

210
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,520
You idiot.

211
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,647
Why would you be thankful?

212
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,942
Man, you're stupid.

213
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,823
Hello.

214
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,159
Welcome. It's been tough, right?

215
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,285
It's nothing.

216
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,914
Forget about it all and cheer up, okay?

217
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,290
Thank you.

218
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,669
Hey, Yeo-reum. Take a seat.

219
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,464
What brings you here?

220
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,341
Well…

221
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,011
The things you gave me for the house.

222
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,222
I think you're going to
have to take it back.

223
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,559
Are you moving out of the billiard club?

224
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,644
Yes.

225
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,980
I just heard that Chang-su
is going to buy that building.

226
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,359
-That's great.
-I know, right?

227
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,447
From where you stand,
I'm sure you're sick of this town

228
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,325
and want to leave as soon as possible,

229
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,662
but I'm a bit sad to see you go.

230
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,498
Same here.

231
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,126
Actually, Bom would be sadder than I am.

232
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:02,878
I mean…

233
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,838
You know Jeong-hun, right?

234
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,927
He got into trouble again,
so I'm sure it's been tough on Bom.

235
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,390
Did something happen to her?

236
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,934
Yes, do that.

237
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,103
Hey, you.

238
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,730
-Yes, sir.
-Take this to the third floor.

239
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,357
Yes, sir.

240
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,609
Take it easy. Do you have some left?

241
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,668
Where is the bag that was here?

242
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,836
It was just here.

243
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,340
This site is a fucking mess.

244
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,217
Hey, Kim!

245
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,469
What are you doing?

246
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,221
Excuse me?

247
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,765
Why are you taking that bag upstairs?

248
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,351
You told me to put it here.

249
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,394
I did?

250
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,313
You fucking imbecile.

251
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,191
Why would you take that upstairs?

252
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,818
We have to use them down here!

253
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,487
-But…
-Hurry up and bring them down!

254
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,240
Yes, sir. I'm sorry!

255
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,583
Take a look at this guy.

256
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,626
Look how old he is.

257
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,296
You poor bastard.

258
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,717
Hey.

259
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,011
Wait for Dad to do that. It'll get cold.

260
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,137
Oh, right.

261
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,308
The rice is cooked well though.

262
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,020
Have some, Kim.

263
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,564
I'll be right back.

264
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,276
Help yourselves.

265
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,653
I thought you wouldn't come.

266
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,907
Sir, let me pour you one.

267
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,126
Forget about earlier.

268
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,673
I can't say that
I'm satisfied with your work,

269
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,344
but you can come to work next month too.

270
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,808
Don't be like that and just drink.

271
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,227
He's letting you off the hook so much.

272
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,145
Don't drink if you don't want to.

273
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,819
Let me pour you one, sir.

274
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,964
So you can drink after all.

275
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,341
Here, let me pour you one more.

276
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,245
Bom.

277
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,747
I think Dad stopped by last night.

278
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,708
Bom.

279
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,586
Bom.

280
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,216
Jeong-hun gambled again.

281
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,052
He left with those people
with all the money.

282
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,102
Bom.

283
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,896
Bom.

284
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,648
Ha-neul.

285
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,909
Bom.

286
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,963
Ha-neul.

287
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,466
Yeo-reum.

288
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,804
Where are you coming back from?

289
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,349
I've been working these days.

290
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,476
What about school?

291
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,397
What brings you here?

292
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,274
What about Bom?

293
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,776
Bom?

294
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,488
She went to see you yesterday.

295
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,157
You didn't meet her?

296
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,742
To see me?

297
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,912
She didn't contact me.

298
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,252
When did she go out?

299
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,588
Yesterday morning.

300
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,634
Ha-neul.

301
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,887
Go to the station and report her missing.

302
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,308
And check the places she might have gone.

303
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,894
Yeo-reum.

304
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,314
I'll look for her too.

305
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,773
Let's go.

306
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,443
Come on.

307
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,330
Be well, Bom.

308
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,332
I…

309
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,918
Please put on your seatbelts,

310
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,547
and please enable airplane mode
on your phones.

311
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,718
You can store your belongings
in the overhead bin or below your seat.

312
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,094
Thank you.

313
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,787
Father.

314
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,017
Ms. Jung.

315
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,729
Please help us find Bom.

316
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,857
Please watch over Bom
so she doesn't make any rash decisions.

317
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,318
I beg you.

318
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,820
JUNG YEONG-SUK

319
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,422
I was wrong, Father.

320
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,145
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:27,257
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

322
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,353
Bom.

323
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,605
Bom!

324
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,484
Bom.

325
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,403
Please wake up.

326
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,385
Bom, wake up.

327
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,222
Please wake up.

328
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,268
Are you okay?

329
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,021
-Yeo-reum.
-Bom.

330
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,189
-Yeo-reum.
-It's okay.

331
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,195
Yeo-reum.

332
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,947
It's okay.

333
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,618
I'm so sorry.

334
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,706
It's all right.

335
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,668
Yeo-reum.

336
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,753
It's okay.

337
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,675
It's okay.

338
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,885
You're okay.

339
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,726
Dae-bum had the same look
on his face as Bom that day.

340
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,063
It felt like I saw him at his lowest.

341
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,832
I decided to stay in Angok.

342
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,126
And I decided to start working.

343
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:14,215
I make 50,000 won a day
working 4 and a half hours.

344
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,176
And I work six days a week.

345
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,929
My work begins at 4:00 a.m.

346
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,437
Oh, my gosh.

347
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,028
At first, it wasn't easy
to wake up early in the morning.

348
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,781
-But that's the best part of my work now.
-Good morning.

349
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,449
Thank you.

350
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,867
Here, take this.

351
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,244
-Thank you.
-Sure.

352
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,540
While the dusky night sky
may seem bleak at the end of the day,

353
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,294
the very same sky
is invigorating at the beginning of a day.

354
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,258
It's hard to believe
that they're one and the same sky.

355
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,557
When I'm done with work, it's 8:30 a.m.

356
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,520
From that time,
I have the whole day to myself.

357
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,108
I work less, and I earn time.

358
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,993
I'm living in Bom's house on rent.

359
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,543
I still have some money left to spend

360
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,712
after the 300,000 won rent
and the living expenses.

361
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,840
So I've been saving up as well.

362
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,303
After Bom and Ha-neul leave for school,

363
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,598
I go to the library every day.

364
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,811
You have to upload that
before you leave work every day.

365
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,522
How many times do I have to tell you
that you can't put off

366
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,524
book rental logs for a week?

367
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:58,903
But Ji-yeong, that lady is the only one
who comes to this library.

368
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,072
So why bother doing it daily?

369
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,700
You're pretty mouthy for a public servant.

370
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,577
Gosh. This stupid countryside.

371
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,754
Ma'am?

372
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,677
Where's the real estate office here?

373
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,681
Please don't call me "ma'am."

374
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,482
I've been hooked on transcription lately,

375
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,901
so I've been transcribing
my favorite book.

376
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:43,281
I feel like it clears out my mind
and fills up my heart.

377
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,578
After leaving the library,
I jog with Dae-bum.

378
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:53,875
Dae-bum changed his jogging schedule
from morning to evening because of me.

379
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,962
We like to talk while jogging.

380
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,088
Remember last time?

381
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,757
Our daily lives may be simple,

382
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,218
but we never run out of topics
to talk about.

383
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,512
I almost feel like Dae-bum talks

384
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,347
more than I do these days.

385
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,848
It feels easier than it used to.

386
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,850
I think you run better than I do now.

387
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,727
That may well be true.

388
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:28,201
Dae-bum started working
with Professor Holland again.

389
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:35,416
Professor Holland offered him
to work together in a relaxed environment,

390
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,752
saying he puts his family before work.

391
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,629
Dae-bum was touched,

392
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,422
so he decided to work with him.

393
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:48,596
He says it feels like Holland is
teaching him how to approach work.

394
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,122
-Yeo-reum.
-Yes?

395
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,542
There's something I want to do with you.

396
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,751
What is it?

397
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,673
But can you promise me first
that you'll do this with me?

398
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,926
I don't think I can do it alone.

399
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,387
Why are you getting all serious?

400
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,598
Don't fall for it. Just ignore her.

401
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,933
It's…

402
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,480
It's this.

403
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,692
What is this?

404
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,904
HONGS.COM COMICS WEBTOON CONTEST

405
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,157
-Webtoon contest?
-Yes.

406
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,367
But this is the real juice.

407
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,328
The first place gets 100 million won.

408
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,621
It's huge, right?

409
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,665
But why would you do this with me?

410
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,377
Look. I can kind of draw,
but I can't write.

411
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,839
But you've worked at a publishing company
and read lots of books.

412
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,133
You can write, and I can--

413
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,384
No way.

414
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,804
You know how scared I get about writing.

415
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,556
Yeo-reum, please.

416
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,060
You wrote that interview
with the old lady with Dae-bum.

417
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:20,521
But that's totally different from this.

418
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,857
Just ignore her.
She's just got her head in the clouds.

419
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,484
You can't even draw that well.

420
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,861
You little brat. You don't know anything.

421
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,196
I'll wash the dishes.

422
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,238
Seriously.

423
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,075
-I beg you, Yeo-reum. Let's just try.
-Come on, Gyeo-ul.

424
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,868
-Just this once.
-I can't.

425
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,995
-Just eat.
-Come on.

426
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,039
I beg you, ma'am. Please work with me.

427
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,669
You're being weird, Ji-yeong.
Why do you eat here these days?

428
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,214
And can't you call me before coming?

429
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,217
Then I would bring more food.

430
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,302
This is fine.

431
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,305
I got a house in Seoul.

432
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,683
So I just need to move there.

433
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,103
Are you here to ask me to help you pack?

434
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,396
Pack what?

435
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,737
I got the truck and the boxes
ready to help you pack up.

436
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,989
So don't worry.

437
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,617
Hey, I wasn't even thinking of that.

438
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,456
We're sharing this food, you know.

439
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,001
Sorry.

440
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,253
You're better than your dad.

441
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,923
-Hello.
-Hey, you were having dinner together.

442
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,966
Hey.

443
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,136
-Seong-min, actually…
-What?

444
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,513
-Do you need help with something?
-That's not it.

445
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:39,851
I was wondering if I could
get the billiard club girl's number.

446
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,519
Yeo-reum?

447
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,565
I'm glad you're here too, Ms. Cho.

448
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:49,235
Please give this message to Dae-bum.

449
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,362
What message?

450
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:56,993
I didn't even get to
thank those two properly.

451
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:01,539
So I was meaning to treat them
to dinner at my restaurant.

452
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,957
Oh, really?

453
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,667
That's a fantastic idea.

454
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,545
But while you're treating them,

455
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,922
could you treat everyone properly?

456
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,924
How?

457
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,301
Beef.

458
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,844
Beef!

459
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,596
-Beef!
-Beef!

460
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,097
-Beef!
-Beef!

461
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,932
Jun, come over for beef, okay?

462
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,186
All right. Tell me her number, okay?

463
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,687
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

464
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,567
Yeo-reum.

465
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,652
Then let's take Ha-neul with us.

466
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,780
Ha-neul? Why would you take him?

467
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,616
-He can stay and study.
-Why not?

468
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,243
He didn't come with us
to the valley last time.

469
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,245
He'd probably rather study.

470
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,288
Oh, right.

471
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,290
-Bom.
-Yes?

472
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,209
Do you…

473
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,170
not talk to Jae-hun anymore?

474
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,798
I mean…

475
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,469
I was so surprised when I got this text.

476
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,642
YEO-REUM, I'M GOING BACK TO THE STATES.
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF BOM.

477
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,148
I don't know what happened
between you two,

478
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,026
but Jae-hun really likes you.

479
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,029
You know that, right?

480
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,865
Stop talking about him.

481
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,077
Okay.

482
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,040
Yeo-reum.

483
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,544
I hope we win the contest
and win the 100 million won.

484
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,380
What will you do with that money?

485
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,056
I miss Grandma.

486
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,240
If Bom draws her webtoon
based on my writing,

487
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,284
It'll be a total failure.

488
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,410
Come on.

489
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,830
My writing is horrific. You know that.

490
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,957
I'm not sure I do.

491
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,626
Come on.

492
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,421
GIFT
ANGOK PUBLIC LIBRARY

493
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,134
If I'm being honest,
I think we are very much alike.

494
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,678
How so?

495
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:25,349
I'm always so nervous and afraid
when I'm solving math problems.

496
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,644
But one day, Professor Holland

497
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,689
got a question incorrect and he just said,

498
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,610
He just shook it off.

499
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,736
Really?

500
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,157
You know,

501
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,328
I really love talking
about these kinds of things with you.

502
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,670
So I decided to try writing.

503
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,381
Why can't I think of anything?

504
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,010
Gyeo-ul.

505
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,056
I'll end up having leukophobia.

506
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,731
But as expected, it was difficult.

507
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,442
What do I do?

508
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,488
What?

509
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,990
No one's expecting a masterpiece,
so just do it?

510
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,411
You're right.

511
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,164
How did you know?

512
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,042
All right.

513
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,841
I'm going to end up
in Hollywood at this rate.

514
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,308
I'm going nowhere with this.

515
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,728
Bom, I'm sorry!

516
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,190
Can I check these out?

517
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,192
Sure.

518
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,239
I'm not a genius.

519
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,367
I need to acknowledge that first.

520
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,663
I'm just an ordinary person.

521
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,833
Actually, I might even be a bit lacking.

522
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,213
Writing every day.

523
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,508
There's nothing else I can do
except for that.

524
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,309
-Gosh, you surprised me!
-What's this?

525
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,518
When did you come home?

526
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,103
Gosh, look at you.

527
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,355
And you were complaining
that you can't write.

528
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,691
You didn't read it, did you?

529
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,194
But isn't the lady too old?

530
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,530
How am I supposed to draw a mom?

531
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:48,075
This is just a rough draft, okay?

532
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,369
-So it's not final.
-Let me read some more.

533
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,704
No, you can't.

534
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,997
-Come on.
-Someone's here.

535
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,999
Who could it be?

536
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,002
Who is it?

537
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,008
Jae-hun.

538
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,885
Heo Jae-hun.

539
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,595
Bom. Yeo-reum.

540
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,473
Have you been well?

541
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,767
Didn't you go back to the States?

542
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:14,810
I did.

543
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,896
But…

544
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,316
I kept thinking about it.

545
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,400
Wait.

546
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,486
So you came back from the states?

547
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,779
That's right.

548
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,614
I see.

549
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,200
Anyway, I kept thinking

550
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,745
about myself while I wasn't with you--

551
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,455
Have you lost your mind?

552
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,290
It's not a trip downtown.

553
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,626
Do you even know
how much the plane ticket costs?

554
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,046
Can you please let me finish?
Stop cutting me off.

555
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,965
Fine. My bad.

556
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,637
I thought deeply about my life.

557
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,889
About what I truly want,

558
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,518
and about what I live for.

559
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,313
And at the end of that thought,
I ended up here.

560
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,900
Really? Why?

561
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,528
To marry you.

562
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,654
What?

563
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,741
Marry me? Are you crazy?

564
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,493
Bom.

565
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,246
Be honest with me.

566
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,456
Should I just go back to the States?

567
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,626
Hey.

568
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,838
We're not even old enough to marry.

569
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,881
I'm serious about this.

570
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,843
Stop beating around the bush
and answer me.

571
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,389
Do you hate that I'm here?

572
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,184
I mean, I don't hate it, but…

573
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:44,066
We should at least go out first
before discussing marriage.

574
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,067
I see.

575
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,403
Should we do that then?

576
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,156
I wasn't saying
we should get married right away.

577
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,700
Again with the damn jokes.

578
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,410
Do you have a death wish?

579
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,580
Jae-hun.

580
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,040
Welcome back.

581
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,709
Yeo-reum.

582
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,296
-I'm glad you're here.
-Thank you.

583
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,928
I missed you.

584
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,723
Fine, me too.

585
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,932
Gyeo-ul, I'm home.

586
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,272
Who is this guy?

587
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,149
Hello.

588
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,109
I'm your brother-in-law.

589
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,154
What did you just say?
You need to shut up.

590
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,572
What are you talking about?

591
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,407
My brother-in-law.

592
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,785
Stop it unless you want to die.

593
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,746
Gosh.

594
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,998
-Is it good?
-It's so juicy.

595
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,042
Beef always tastes good.

596
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,629
Dae-bum!

597
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,631
-We're here.
-Yeo-reum!

598
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,090
-Hurry up and sit.
-Hello.

599
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,218
Everyone, take your seats.

600
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,761
You must be starving.

601
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,721
-Thank you so much.
-We have more.

602
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,932
-Jun, sit down.
-There's so much food.

603
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,225
Right, Jun.

604
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,520
Geun-ho is going to school now.

605
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,812
What? No way.

606
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,690
He's finally going to school.

607
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,108
Congratulations.

608
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,236
This is the good stuff.
Look at the marbling on this meat.

609
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,904
Dig in.

610
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,781
Geun-ho, come and eat.

611
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,782
Yeo-reum.

612
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,200
-Dae-bum.
-Yes?

613
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,787
I'm so grateful to the two of you.

614
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,122
It's nothing.

615
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,374
Gosh.

616
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,209
Please help yourselves.

617
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,710
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

618
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,420
-Help yourselves.
-Thank you for the food.

619
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,506
-Thank you for the food.
-Mr. Bae.

620
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,465
What?

621
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,552
Aren't we hosting this party
for Yeo-reum and Dae-bum?

622
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,096
What's that?

623
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,515
Come on!

624
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:42,768
It's nice to celebrate
this good news with everyone.

625
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,353
Why don't we read it?

626
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,396
"Congratulations,

627
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,231
on making it to Seoul!"

628
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,942
"Ms. Cho Ji-yeong!"

629
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,820
She finally leaves Angok!

630
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,405
-What's wrong with him?
-What's wrong with him?

631
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,157
Jun!

632
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,826
Make sure you eat a lot!

633
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,161
Okay, I'll eat a lot.
Thank you for the food!

634
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,789
-Shall we eat too?
-Thank you for the food.

635
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,165
Thank you for the food.

636
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,334
-Enjoy.
-You want a wrap?

637
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,670
This is so good.

638
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,339
Eat it before it gets cold.

639
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,887
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

640
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,180
All right.

641
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,933
-Go, Jun!
-So cute.

642
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,481
-So adorable.
-Come here.

643
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,693
Way to go!

644
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,570
Come on, Ji-yeong.

645
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,840
I thought about what happiness is.

646
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,594
I looked it up in the dictionary.

647
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:03,432
Happiness is a state
of being pleased, fulfilled,

648
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:06,352
and content in life.

649
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,858
I found that definition to be too long,
so I decided to make it shorter.

650
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,986
Happiness.

651
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,531
The state of being sufficient.

652
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,207
I looked back on what happened today.

653
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,794
I biked through the cold breeze
of the early morning

654
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:35,255
to my heart's content before sunrise.

655
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,548
I was pleased.

656
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,343
It was sufficient.

657
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,644
I came back home thirsty and drank water.

658
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:54,108
It reminded me of what Ms. Jung said,
that water is the most delicious.

659
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,195
That indeed was true.

660
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,030
It was sufficient.

661
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,496
When I'm hanging my laundry,

662
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,623
I like the sound of my clothes clapping.

663
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:14,461
And I like the lingering smell
of detergent on my hands.

664
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,463
It was sufficient.

665
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,557
I dozed off at the library

666
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,934
thanks to the hypnotic afternoon sunlight.

667
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,811
It was a sweet nap.

668
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,396
It was sufficient.

669
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,191
It's always fun

670
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:40,279
standing in front of the shelves,
choosing what to read.

671
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,239
It's exciting.

672
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,616
THE ELEGANT TRUTH
BY KIM SEONG-HYEON

673
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,784
It was sufficient.

674
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,543
When I'm lying down
with Bom to go to sleep,

675
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,045
I always laugh so hard my stomach hurts.

676
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,299
Sometimes, just staring
at each other makes us laugh.

677
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,677
It was sufficient.

678
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,973
Stop doing that.

679
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,064
Bom.

680
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,149
Bom.

681
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,363
It's okay.

682
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,950
Bom told me…

683
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:27,993
You're fine.

684
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,996
… that when I consoled her that day,

685
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:36,084
she somehow felt like
everything was going to be fine.

686
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:38,754
That's how I felt too.

687
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,507
After I said
that everything was going to be fine,

688
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,385
I really felt like everything
was going to be fine.

689
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,141
Feel that breeze.

690
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,937
It really feels like
autumn now, doesn' it?

691
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,021
It really does.

692
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,441
Do you want to hear something cool?

693
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,859
What is it?

694
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,904
Bom as in spring,

695
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,739
Yeo-reum as in summer,

696
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,492
-autumn, the season,
-Autumn, the season,

697
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,660
-And Gyeo-ul, as in winter!
-And Gyeo-ul!

698
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,204
-You're right.
-We have all four seasons with us.

699
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,049
Goodbye.

700
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,637
My first summer in Angok.

701
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,191
This feels so weird.

702
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,574
Do you not feel anything when I'm leaving?

703
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,159
Ji-yeong.

704
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,913
Waiting for you is practically
my hobby and expertise now.

705
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,041
Until I go out with another guy.

706
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,086
If you want to, you should.

707
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,588
Seriously?

708
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,258
You can't live without tormenting people.

709
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,011
You'll never find a guy
who is as fun to torment as I am.

710
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,430
I only do that with you.

711
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,973
I never do that to others.

712
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,476
No one else in this world
makes me as angry as you.

713
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,397
Or you could go off the market
and come back like I did.

714
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,149
My heart will stay the same.

715
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,194
Back from where?

716
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,992
Have you lost your mind?

717
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,536
-Hey.
-You've completely lost it.

718
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,706
-You're going to wake him up.
-Don't say that in front of him.

719
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,249
Take it back!

720
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,588
You woke him up.

721
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,549
-This is your fault!
-My goodness.

722
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,933
What are you doing on your day off?

723
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,645
Why? Did you find something else to eat?

724
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,731
No, let's go see Dae-ho.

725
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,359
What? Dae-ho?

726
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,904
You said I should be friends with him.

727
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,906
Look at you, all grown up.

728
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,533
Here.

729
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,205
What was that?

730
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,041
I wanted to try refusing you once.

731
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,001
Gosh, that felt good.

732
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,879
How dare you refuse me?

733
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:27,714
You think you can get away with that?

734
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,509
-It's so much fun.
-Come here!

735
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,427
Gyeo-ul, go bite him!

736
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,054
Hey, give him back!

737
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,889
-Jae-hun, come here!
-Catch him!

738
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:39,017
Gyeo-ul, go bite him now!
Let's teach him a lesson.

739
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,894
Gyeo-ul, look at this!

740
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,062
Gosh.

741
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,271
Stop it!

742
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,607
-Dae-bum.
-Yes?

743
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,611
Do you regret staying here at all?

744
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,155
I don't.

745
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,991
What about you?

746
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,787
Me neither.

747
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,436
My life is

748
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,479
truly sufficient.

749
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,443
I haven't quite figured out
how I should go on,

750
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,572
but my life is sufficient.

751
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,158
Let's live this life.

752
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:50,524
