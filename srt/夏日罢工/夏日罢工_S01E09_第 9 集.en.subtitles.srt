ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, GROUPS, AND
ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

SCENES WITH ANIMALS ARE STAGED

3
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,468
No, stop!

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,388
You'll get in trouble for being noisy.

5
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,811
Help!

6
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,106
Help me!

7
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,235
You'll die if you get hurt.

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,695
It'll hurt if you die.

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,739
It'll hurt if you die.

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,371
Gyeo-ul, no!

11
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,832
-Run!
-Gyeo-ul.

12
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,417
Hey, what are you doing there?

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,044
Get over here right now!

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,879
Get back here this instant!

15
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
I'm in trouble for being noisy!

16
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,634
For being noisy.

17
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,593
I'll get hurt!

18
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,595
No!

19
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:39,724
I didn't give Dae-bum
the money for his idea.

20
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,226
I gave him the money because

21
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,937
I'm partly responsible
for his current situation.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,647
Sir, above all else,

23
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,857
isn't it hard to believe this story?

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,610
That he had already published his idea

25
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,403
seven years before Holland did.

26
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,989
And he was only an undergraduate.

27
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,201
Mr. Ahn, are you sure
there isn't another reason

28
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,203
for refusing to co-author
the dissertation?

29
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,122
Are you sure that your idea is original?

30
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,332
Professor Park, this is getting absurd.

31
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,252
-Are you suggesting we plagiarized?
-I mean,

32
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,462
the thesis is no different from Holland's.

33
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,423
Professor Park.
Did you even understand the thesis?

34
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,967
-You…
-Don't forget

35
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,221
the fact that you are here as an examinee.

36
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,723
What the…

37
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,684
What?

38
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,894
What is he doing?

39
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,439
What is this?

40
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,699
Yeo-reum!

41
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,076
Are you okay?

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,912
Are you hurt at all?

43
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,456
-Thank you for earlier.
-Well…

44
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,792
Look.

45
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,337
I'm very sorry.

46
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,505
Sorry?

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,592
The thing is,

48
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,511
that kid from earlier is my son.

49
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,555
What?

50
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,685
He only looks like a grown-up.
His mental age is that of a five-year-old.

51
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,063
I don't understand.

52
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,108
My son used to have a crush on Seon-a,

53
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,652
Dae-bum's late sister
who used to live here.

54
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,907
But he saw her dead body in this building,

55
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,326
so he must have drawn
the graffiti to make you leave

56
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,662
because he thought
it was dangerous for you to live here,

57
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,332
Graffiti?

58
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,043
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,545
But…

60
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:37,258
why didn't you ever tell me?

61
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,761
Miss.

62
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,389
You're here on a vacation, aren't you?

63
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:47,977
Can't you just consider this something
that happened on your vacation?

64
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,563
We have to keep living in this town.

65
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,649
If Mr. Bae finds out about the graffiti,

66
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,568
he's going to make me
send him to an institution.

67
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:56,986
Miss.

68
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,405
I'm really sorry to ask you this.

69
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,701
But I can't live without my baby.

70
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,205
-I'm begging you.
-Please don't do this.

71
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,248
Please…

72
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,501
Please keep it a secret. I'm so sorry.

73
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,044
-Please.
-Let it slide this once.

74
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,921
-Please get up.
-Please keep this between us.

75
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,214
-Don't do this.
-I'm begging you.

76
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,193
Ahn Dae-bum.

77
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,195
This solution puts into consideration

78
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,365
factors that Holland
didn't even consider in his thesis.

79
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,035
This isn't something
you can just plagiarize.

80
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,745
Right, Professor Park?

81
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,623
This theory

82
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,502
started from an idea
we came up with together.

83
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,463
Whatever thesis he decides
to write about this,

84
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,049
is not relevant to me.

85
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,470
We'll wrap it up here for today then.

86
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,889
We will discuss
and carefully consider everything.

87
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,402
Yeo-reum.

88
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,279
Oh, right.

89
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,368
Welcome.

90
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,245
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

91
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,789
-Not at all.
-You're home too, Gyeo-ul.

92
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,460
It's spacious.

93
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,838
-Let's sit over there.
-All right.

94
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,723
I look forward
to learning from you, Ms. Lee.

95
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,851
Come on, don't be like that.

96
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,563
I'm very slow at learning.

97
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,981
So please be patient with me.

98
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,067
I'm sure you'll do well.

99
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,706
Did you make that yourself?

100
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,707
Yes.

101
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,963
It's cute.

102
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,344
Shall we get started then?

103
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,263
A, B, C, D, E…

104
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,184
Hangeul consists of consonants and vowels.

SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

106
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,232
-Go on in.
-It's okay.

107
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,651
I have to take Gyeo-ul for a walk anyway.

108
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,446
Gosh, look at you.

109
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,824
Are you seeing me out with her?

110
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,370
-I told you not to go there!
-Let's go.

111
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,539
Geun-ho! Why did you go?

112
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,125
It's been a while
since I've heard them fight like this.

113
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,049
-You know about them?
-Geun-ho!

114
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:09,137
-You can't keep doing this!
-Every family has its own problems.

115
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,598
-What if someone saw you?
-For them, Geun-ho is one.

116
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,977
His name is Geun-ho?

117
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,729
Yes. Hwang Geun-ho.

118
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,568
I didn't know
you had an incident with Geun-ho.

119
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,029
You must have been startled.

120
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,198
I should probably tell

121
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,034
Mr. Bae about this, right?

122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,750
You must be feeling uneasy
about telling him.

123
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,090
It's like you know me
inside out, Ms. Jung.

124
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,511
I'm sure Geun-ho wouldn't do anything bad,

125
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,556
but if you're worried,
you should tell him.

126
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,352
Goodness, I've made you come too far.

127
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,687
You should go home.

128
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,065
-Ms. Jung.
-Yes?

129
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,651
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

130
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,827
What's this?

131
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,705
Just do what your heart tells you to do.

132
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,791
If you still don't know what to do,

133
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,627
then ask Gyeo-ul.

134
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,129
All right.

135
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,340
Ms. Lee.

136
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,133
See you later.

137
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,302
Get home safely.

138
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,517
You know,

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,228
Geun-ho really is a good kid.

140
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,901
I'll see you tomorrow.

141
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,200
Let's go.

00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,799
Hello.

145
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,301
-Hello.
-Hi.

146
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,098
The footage showed Geun-ho
running out from here.

147
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,933
Did anything happen?

148
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,024
Geun-ho just came over to hang out.

149
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,028
Geun-ho did?

150
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,155
Yes.

151
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,949
He likes to play with Gyeo-ul.

152
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,535
-Have a good one.
-Okay.

153
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,036
Come on.

SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

155
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,005
-Enjoy the food.
-Thank you.

156
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,964
Hey.

157
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,883
Hey, Bom. Are you off work?

158
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,511
I had to take extra classes
all of a sudden.

159
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,013
I'll be there in a flash.

160
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,097
Hey, Jae-hun.

161
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,100
You don't have to come today.

162
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,810
Why not?

163
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,895
-One more ramyeon, please.
-Okay.

164
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,647
What's going on?

165
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,901
I'm having dinner with the friend
you saw yesterday.

166
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,696
I see.

167
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,700
I'll call you tomorrow.

168
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,368
Okay.

169
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,704
Enjoy your dinner.

170
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,830
Thanks.

171
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,793
You're so popular.

172
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,837
Whatever.

173
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,552
How's your dad?

174
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,928
My dad?

175
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,930
He's still the same.

176
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,932
He didn't even know I was out.

177
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,315
You're finally starting to look your age.

178
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,941
Do you think so too?

179
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,902
I've gotten prettier, right?

180
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,864
Come on.

181
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,659
Do you still like pastry?

182
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,078
Of course. I can't get enough of it.

183
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,705
I got a certificate for baking in juvie.

184
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,540
For real?

185
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,669
I'll bake you lots of pastry from now on.

186
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,711
Sounds good.

187
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,881
That's so mature of you.
You even got a certificate?

188
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,674
I'm planning to study for my GED too.

189
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,427
I can't go back to school.

190
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,347
No one will welcome me there.

191
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,101
I'm sorry about everything.

192
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,021
If you ever say that again,
I'll really get mad at you.

193
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,442
-Hurry up and eat.
-Okay.

194
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,781
All right, we're here.

195
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,244
I'll get going. Here.

196
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,124
-Thanks for dinner.
-Sure.

197
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,627
It's good to have you back, Dae-ho.

198
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,549
Oh, right.

199
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,634
I met Mom.

200
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,347
She came to visit me. It was humiliating.

201
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,810
How was it?

202
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,895
I wouldn't recommend it.

203
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,940
It feels pretty crappy.

204
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,485
They should have
just not given birth to us.

205
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,821
Whatever.

206
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,406
I don't care anymore.

207
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,575
Good.

208
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,827
I just wanted to tell you this.

209
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,579
It's not like…

210
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,290
I can share this with anyone else.

211
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,337
Dae-ho. Do you want to see Grandma?

212
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,840
No.

213
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,634
She'll cry when she sees me.

214
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,096
-You should go.
-Okay.

215
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,347
-Bye.
-Goodnight.

216
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,432
See you.

217
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,977
Listen to your grandma, okay?

218
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,145
I got it.

219
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,440
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

220
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,068
A, B, C, D, E, F, G…

221
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,155
Your handwriting is neat.

222
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,699
No, it's all crooked.

223
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,829
Once you know how to write,
what do you want to write first?

224
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,540
Kim Bom.

225
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,751
Kim Ha-neul.

226
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,836
Kim Jeong-hun.

227
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,257
Yeo-reum.

228
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,303
You must be bored because
Bom isn't at the library these days.

229
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,556
That's not true. I do well alone.

230
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,641
Come on.

231
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:33,187
I know you're bored.
It's written all over your face.

232
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,942
I'm a bit bored.

233
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,610
It's all right.

234
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,364
Being bored is all right.

235
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,783
Being busy is all right.

236
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,577
Everything is all right.

237
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,287
Really?

238
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,872
Of course.

239
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,791
That's just how life is.

240
00:13:56,293 --> 00:14:00,339
Please stay friends

241
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,384
with Bom and Ha-neul.

242
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,803
Of course.

243
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,346
In that case,

244
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,307
are you free tomorrow evening?

245
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,770
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

246
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,071
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

247
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,406
Who is this?

248
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,825
THIS IS DAE-BUM

249
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,036
Dae-bum?

250
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,293
Wow! Did you finally get a phone?

251
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,838
Yes, I had it activated today.

252
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,676
Could this be your first phone ever?

253
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,261
It is.

254
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,013
Really?

255
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,852
What are those?

256
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,980
They're called emojis.

257
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,316
Try pressing the face-shaped icon
at the bottom.

258
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,402
THEY'RE CALLED EMOJIS.

259
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,404
Ta-da.

260
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,451
Wow, you're getting
the hang of it already.

261
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,996
When he was 17 years old?

262
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,790
I had nothing else to do back then.

263
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,169
I wish I could just be smart
out of boredom.

264
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,546
That wasn't what I meant to say.

265
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,633
Why aren't you replying?

266
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,140
What were you like as a kid?

267
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,437
Nothing about me was special back then
other than my name.

268
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,440
I see.

269
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,067
"I see"?

270
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,153
Did you just agree with what I just said?

271
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,208
It's been so long
since I stayed up all night texting.

272
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,919
It's a first for me.

273
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,172
Doesn't your wrist hurt?

274
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,143
Hello?

275
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,021
I guess this will do.

276
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,818
It's nice to hear your voice.

277
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,039
But you have to sleep now, right?

278
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,132
I jogged yesterday morning too.

279
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,176
With the shoes you gave me.

280
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,559
It was tiring at first, but now I love it.

281
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,937
When I like something,

282
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,399
I have a way of checking
if I really like something or not.

283
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,193
-What is it?
-I think about

284
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,321
whether I would do it
on a deserted island.

285
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,033
And I decided

286
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,869
that I'll jog every morning
even on a deserted island.

287
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,038
Same here.

288
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,333
But today,

289
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,503
I'm a bit tired from staying up all night.

290
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,297
I know.

291
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,679
Yeo-reum. Are you walking?

292
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,349
How did you know?

293
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,643
You're not watching me, are you?

294
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,314
You sounded like you were walking.

295
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,446
Hold on.

296
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,364
Hello?

297
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,791
Ta-da.

298
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,126
The beach of Angok in the morning.

299
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,671
Do you hear the waves?

300
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,685
It's beautiful, right?

301
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,608
Yeo-reum.

302
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,069
Thank you so much.

303
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,294
Hey.

304
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,464
You're early.

305
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,966
Want some coffee?

306
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,887
Professor.

307
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,055
Yes?

308
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
-Oh, no!
-Stop pissing me off. Get up.

309
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,567
For fuck's sake.

310
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,945
Hey, American boy.

311
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,947
Why are you alone today?

312
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,574
Where's Kim Bom?

313
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,284
Dae-ho got released, remember?

314
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,870
Hey, come here.

315
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,371
Where do you think you're going?

316
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,084
So Kim Bom is hanging out
with the ex-con now?

317
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,295
Hey, watch your mouth.

318
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,755
Oh, my gosh. So scary.

319
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,092
Hey, do you want to know something?

320
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,138
Dae-ho is Bom's pimp.

321
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,348
He went to juvie for prostituting her.

322
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,641
American boy.

323
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,019
Be careful of her. Don't get conned.

324
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,729
You might end up in prison too!

325
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,064
That's so fucking hilarious.

326
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,066
Hello?

327
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,862
Yeo-reum, guess what
I have in my hand right now.

328
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,323
-In your hand?
-Yes.

329
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,326
Your hand smells like sashimi.

330
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,494
What the heck? How did you know?

331
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,872
That's so scary.

332
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,541
I can read you like a book.

333
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,792
Seriously?

334
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,711
I'm bringing sashimi home today,

335
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,923
so I was planning to invite you over
for a meal with Grandma.

336
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,675
-Yeo-reum. Come help me with this.
-Gyeo-ul.

337
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,635
All right.

338
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,055
Wait. Are you at my place already?

339
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,183
No wonder.

340
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,352
That's why Grandma sent me to get sashimi.

341
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,896
Hurry up. I haven't had sashimi
in a long time.

342
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,689
All right. Just wait up.

343
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,608
-Come home safely.
-Okay.

344
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,735
Here you go, Gyeo-ul.

345
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,819
Good job.

346
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,240
This is delicious.

347
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,991
I know, right?

348
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,079
This almost tastes like
my mom's home-cooked meals.

349
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,750
People get shocked at how good my food is.

350
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,712
-This is so good.
-It is good.

351
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,511
Can I get another bowl?

352
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,763
-Grandma.
-Yes?

353
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,140
Yeo-reum wants more rice.

354
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,850
Hey!

355
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,269
You want more?

356
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,187
-I'll go get it.
-It's fine.

357
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,772
My goodness, Gyeo-ul.

358
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,275
Yeo-reum. Your stomach's going to explode.

359
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,026
This is your third bowl.

360
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,237
I haven't had
home-cooked meals in a while.

361
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,699
Hey, stop giving Gyeo-ul food.

362
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,826
-Hurry up and eat.
-Mind your own business.

363
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,952
Gosh.

364
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,662
It's a feast for Gyeo-ul too.

365
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,955
Hey, Kim Ha-neul.

366
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,208
Can you treat me a bit nicer like
you're treating Gyeo-ul right now?

367
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,419
I'd do that if you're as nice as Gyeo-ul.

368
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,254
-Don't you agree, Gyeo-ul?
-You brat.

369
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,922
Do you have a death wish?

370
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,300
-I told you to eat.
-You really are siblings.

371
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,804
Gyeo-ul, don't become like her, okay?

372
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,057
Thank you for the food.

373
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,393
What's this?

374
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,648
This isn't…

375
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,443
You can tell right away? That's amazing.

376
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,988
This is what I invited you over for.

377
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,282
-This smells so nice.
-It's homemade. Try it.

378
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,659
I should pour you one first.

379
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,204
Grandma doesn't drink. She hates alcohol.

380
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,832
But not if Yeo-reum pours me one.

381
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,167
Pour me one, please.

382
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,668
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,629
What the heck?
I've never seen you drink, Grandma.

384
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,091
I'm just in such a good mood today.

385
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,136
I love how we're gathered here chatting.

386
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,098
Don't give her too much.
She gets wasted in a blink of an eye.

387
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,893
She poured it for me.
It'd be rude if I didn't drink.

388
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,020
-Cheers.
-Let me in too!

389
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,313
I want in too.

390
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

391
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,234
You want this too, Gyeo-ul?

392
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,782
It's delicious.

393
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,825
What does it taste like?

394
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,952
How did you make this?

395
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,413
It's top secret.

396
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,625
-Gosh, a secret?
-I'm taking that home.

397
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,337
Did you have any luck finding a place?

398
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,633
I knew rent would be expensive in Seoul,
but it's worse than I thought.

399
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,052
How do people make a living here in Seoul?

400
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,597
Decent two-room houses are
around 700,000 to 800,000 won.

401
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,724
Not including maintenance.

402
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,520
I've been working so hard,

403
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,606
but I can't even afford
a semi-basement in Seoul.

404
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,696
I felt like I was worth
less than a speck of dust in Seoul.

405
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,120
Hey, do you want to sit for a bit?

406
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,454
-Shall we?
-Yes.

407
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,419
Gosh, my legs hurt from walking all day.

408
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,296
-They hurt, right?
-Yes.

409
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,424
I should have just signed
a contract I couldn't afford.

410
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,226
Thank you, Ji-yeong.

411
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,233
I've always been grateful,
but I've never told you.

412
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,361
You're welcome.

413
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,077
You were always the first one
to come to help me when I was in trouble.

414
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,954
Right. I remember.

415
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,290
I came here thanks to you too.

416
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,000
Fine. I get it.

417
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,459
You can stop.

418
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,587
Ji-yeong.

419
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,550
I'm going to go back to Angok
after this project.

420
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,975
Going back home to Angok feels like

421
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,603
the right thing to do.

422
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,445
Why would you go back there
all of a sudden?

423
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,741
I already talked to Professor Lee.

424
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,912
I told him that I plan to go back home

425
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,456
when this project is over.

426
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,879
But Professor Lee said he wants to
continue working with you.

427
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,966
You can't do this.

428
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,802
You can't go. You have to stay here.

429
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,476
Ji-yeong.

430
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,522
You've been my friend and my family

431
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,567
for a long time.

432
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,820
Can you please trust my decision again?

433
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,157
Like you always have.

434
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,994
I don't think I can stand

435
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,998
talking about numbers all day
with the people here.

436
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,917
Hey, Dae-bum.

437
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,963
How could you make such a big decision
without even discussing it?

438
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,925
You can get your doctorate
and become a professor here.

439
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,761
You can do what you're good at.
Won't that be a great life?

440
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,513
What are you even going to do in Angok?

441
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,308
This is wrong.
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said.

442
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,811
You might change your mind tomorrow,

443
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,104
so we can talk again then.

444
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,231
You should

445
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,401
find a house for yourself.

446
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,449
From now on, you should start
caring more about yourself than me.

447
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,328
Do you mean that?

448
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,956
I do.

449
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,219
Did you know today was the first time
you ever thanked me?

450
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,183
And I feel like crap.

451
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,165
Thank you.

452
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,099
Jun. Go play outside.

453
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,977
There's no one outside though.

454
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,729
Even so, just go out and play.

455
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,481
You're distracting me.

456
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,046
Hey, Jun!

457
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,923
Put Dae-bum on the phone.

458
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,592
You should say hello first, you brat.

459
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,636
Dae-bum isn't here.

460
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,891
You went to Seoul with him.
Hurry up and put him on the phone.

461
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,146
He's not here. Dae-bum went to work.

462
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,898
Hey.

463
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,983
Who are you on a call with?

464
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,319
I don't know.
She's not putting Dae-bum on the phone.

465
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,119
Hey, Ji-yeong.

466
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,621
It's Seong-man. What are you up to?

467
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,542
I'm just here.

468
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,544
What are you up to? Why are you drunk?

469
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,795
Are you with someone?

470
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,547
I am…

471
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,049
alone.

472
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,593
Where's Dae-bum?

473
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,886
Damn you.

474
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,598
What's with everyone looking for Dae-bum?

475
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,268
Move over, lady.

476
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,437
-Is this your house or what?
-What's going on?

477
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,523
I don't have the money
to buy a house though.

478
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,650
I can't even pay my rent.

479
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,110
What are you going on about?

480
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,196
If you're drunk, just go home and sleep.
Lady, just move.

481
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,573
-Hey, Ji-yeong!
-What?

482
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,700
Hey, don't pick a fight with him.

483
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,660
What did you just say?

484
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,996
-I'm Cho Ji-yeong!
-Sir!

485
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,206
-Why would you call me a lady?
-She's just drunk.

486
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,208
-Quit being so noisy.
-Sir!

487
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,252
-Move.
-I guess I need to call the cops.

488
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,420
You're driving me nuts.

489
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,756
Hey, where did Ji-yeong say she was?

490
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,757
I don't know.

491
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,759
Gosh, this girl.

492
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,802
Come here!

493
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,974
If I had known you'd sleep over,

494
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,101
I would have washed the blankets.

495
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,187
But it smells so nice.

496
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,730
It smells like home.

497
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,732
"Like home"? You must be drunk.

498
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,525
I knew you would get drunk.

499
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,569
Hurry up and lie down.

500
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,447
That being said,

501
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,699
I'll sleep next to your grandma.

502
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,701
You're so heavy!

503
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:51,372
Grandma, she's going to
take my place as your granddaughter.

504
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,792
You mean I'll have one more.

505
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,213
That means Bom is my little sister now.

506
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,214
What?

507
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,757
Come here.

508
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,592
Let your older sister hug you.

509
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,719
You smell like alcohol!

510
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,639
Don't be so loud at night.

511
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,891
Don't kick your blankets.

512
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,559
It gets cold at night.

513
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,395
Drink some water if you get thirsty
in your sleep.

514
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,231
We got it. Just lie down already.

515
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,274
Okay. I'm turning the lights off.

516
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,279
Go to sleep, okay?

517
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,656
Yeo-reum.

518
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,326
Grandma used to tell me
gomji will come out if I don't sleep.

519
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,411
-Gomji?
-Yes.

520
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,663
What's that?

521
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,748
I have no idea.

522
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,375
Grandma, what's a gomji?

523
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,127
Gomji will come out. Sleep already.

524
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,922
-Here comes gomji.
-No!

525
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,800
-Here comes gomji.
-Here comes gomji!

526
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,760
Come here!

527
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,971
It's really going to come out.

528
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,144
Gomji.

529
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,272
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

530
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,209
Don't be stupid Heo Jae-hun.

531
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,862
Gosh, you startled me.

532
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,282
-What?
-It's Bae Seong-man!

533
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,161
Who are you, Hong GIl-dong?

534
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,748
Why would you get wasted
and cause trouble up here?

535
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,875
And why are you up here?

536
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,418
This is amazing.

537
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,089
Hey, check if this destination is correct.

538
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,176
You're amazing, Bae Gil-dong.
A round of applause!

539
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,552
Seriously.

540
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,935
Seong-man.

541
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,854
I look pathetic, right?

542
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,108
I'm sure you can see everything clearly.

543
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,238
You can see what kind of an idiot I am.

544
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,910
I don't get it.

545
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,165
Don't fight your feelings.

546
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:47,382
A person's heart is like a wild horse,
so you can never tame it.

547
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,509
Just let your heart get the best of you.

548
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,972
And never mind what kind of feelings
he may have for you.

549
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,724
That's not for you to worry about.

550
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,398
Unrequited love has its merits.

551
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,484
No matter how the other party may feel…

552
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,571
seeing their face like this
can make you happy.

553
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,454
Unrequited love, my foot.

554
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,292
I'm saying you shouldn't
get yourself hurt.

555
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,465
Gosh.

556
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,968
Fine. I'll just keep quiet.

557
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,310
You must be happy, Bom.

558
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,647
You have such a loving grandmother.

559
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,151
But you're her granddaughter
starting today.

560
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,405
I hope you'll stay here for a long time.

561
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,408
Me too.

562
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,287
It would have been fun
if Jae-hun joined us on a day like this.

563
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,873
Jae-hun?

564
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,459
Why would he come here?

565
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,963
Do you think he'll go back to the States
after he finishes high school?

566
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,009
I don't know.
But I don't think he'll stay here.

567
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,344
He'll probably go
back to the States or to Seoul.

568
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,971
Then how will you guys go out?

569
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,682
What do you mean, "go out"?

570
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,853
We're going to break up anyway,
so I should keep my distance from him.

571
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,814
Come on, that's not right.

572
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,400
Your grandma will scold you
for saying that.

573
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:35,114
"When you go in search of honey,
you must expect to be stung by bees."

574
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:38,326
What was that?
Was that supposed to be Grandma?

575
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,952
-Don't I sound just like her?
-No.

576
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,080
"You guys."

577
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,998
"When you want honey,

578
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,000
you must expect to be stung by bees."

579
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,253
Gosh, that was awful.

580
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,343
That was close.

581
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,054
JAE-HUN

582
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,264
Who is it?

583
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,230
Do you want to have lunch tomorrow?

584
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,439
Get your honey.

585
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,316
Should I?

586
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,778
What should I say?

587
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,864
"I miss you tonight."

588
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,660
What the heck?

589
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,373
BOM

590
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,712
Sure.

591
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,840
Yes!

592
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,467
Thank you, Bom.

593
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,472
What do you want for lunch? Korean food?

594
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,766
Japanese? Chinese? Snack bar?

595
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,229
Snack bar.

596
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,024
I knew we would want the same thing.

597
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,401
Snack bar.

598
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,823
Let's meet in front of Cheongchun Bunsik.

599
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,200
What is it?

600
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,577
-Why?
-Show me.

601
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,537
-I don't want to.
-You're being so sneaky.

602
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,372
-What?
-Come on, show me.

603
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,166
-I don't want to.
-Show me.

604
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,084
Quiet. You'll wake Grandma up.

605
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,341
You still have the movie tickets, right?

606
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,677
Should we see the movie tomorrow?

607
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,308
Dae-bum?

608
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,478
You're getting your honey.

609
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,397
DAE-BUM

610
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:39,363
Yeo-reum is going to see a movie

611
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,907
Stop that.

612
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,909
So when did you guys start going out?

613
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,453
What are you saying?

614
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,792
Make a major breakthrough for me, okay?

615
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,045
Yes, sir.

616
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,465
Now that it's come to this,

617
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,051
there's no need to call
the Institutional Review Board.

618
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,261
Just have lunch with the school president.

619
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,805
When I told him about you,
he wanted to meet you.

620
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,806
Let's go.

621
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,810
I have a prior engagement, so I must go.

622
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,437
Prior engagement?

623
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,272
What is it?

624
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,233
I'm going to see a movie.

625
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,986
I'll be going if you're done.

626
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,113
-A movie?
-Dae-bum.

627
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,698
Hey, Dae-bum.

628
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,077
What the…

629
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,519
Grandma.

630
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,272
I'm going to buy some clothes
once I get paid.

631
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,898
So don't stop me.

632
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,235
All right. You can do anything
you want with it.

633
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,572
Are you going out to meet someone?

634
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,324
Is it Jae-hun?

635
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,077
No.

636
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:11,998
Yes.

637
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,794
Bom is all grown up now.

638
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,130
Seeing that you're going on dates.

639
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,758
-Grandma.
-Yes?

640
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,469
Did you not wash my sneakers?

641
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,888
Gosh, I forgot.

642
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,474
I'll wipe it for you now.

643
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,144
I'll just wear the other ones.

644
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,272
I asked you to wash them so many times.

645
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,775
I'm sorry. I forgot about it.

646
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,943
Whatever.

647
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm going out.

648
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,448
Have fun.

649
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,876
Hey, Bom!

650
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,878
Why are you here?

651
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,172
You should have told me
you were off today.

652
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,549
I came all the way here
from your workplace.

653
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,301
You should have called, you idiot.

654
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,470
I don't have a phone yet.

655
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,512
Wait.

656
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,098
-Let me see your face.
-What?

657
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,726
Are you wearing makeup?

658
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,437
-No.
-Come on.

659
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,730
You are.

660
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,607
-Let me see.
-I told you I'm not.

661
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,233
Where are you going?

662
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,694
-None of your business.
-Hop on. I'll give you a ride.

663
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,446
It's fine. I can walk.

664
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,448
Just hop on. I'll take you there.

665
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,407
-Hurry.
-Hey.

666
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,992
It's boring driving alone.

667
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,827
Please.

668
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,000
Are you joining me?

669
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,303
CHEONGCHUN BUNSIK

670
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,101
-Hey, Dae-ho.
-What?

671
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,936
Stop here.
Drop me off in front of that bakery.

672
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,354
What did you say?

673
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,855
Drop me off there.

674
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,233
Don't you hear me?
In front of this bakery.

675
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,275
Where?

676
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,069
You just passed it. Let me get off.

677
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,445
What are you doing?

678
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,405
Drop me off.

679
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,241
I said, drop me off.

680
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,076
-Let's go and hang out!
-What?

681
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,999
That was Bom.

682
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,172
She'll come.

683
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,716
I start work at the bakery tomorrow.

684
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,969
I might not have time to hang out.

685
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,555
-But still…
-Hey.

686
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,014
Today's my birthday.

687
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,768
Then you should have told me.

688
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,146
So I'm borrowing you for just today, okay?

689
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,355
Hold on tight!

690
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,788
ANGOK TINY THEATER

691
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,054
Yeo-reum.

692
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,225
Should we head in?

693
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,393
Okay, sure.

694
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,821
We're here!

695
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,420
This is nice.

696
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,967
Give me a minute.

697
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,053
I'll go get something to drink.

698
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,483
-Hello?
-Hello?

699
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,651
Jae-hun.

700
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,321
Bom, why aren't you here? Where are you?

701
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,493
Jae-hun, I'm sorry.

702
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,120
I can't see you today.
Something urgent came up.

703
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,331
I see. Something urgent?

704
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,750
What is it?

705
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,878
Well…

706
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,673
Sorry.

707
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,591
Let's have lunch together next week.

708
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,427
Or you can come by work tomorrow.

709
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,054
Fine.

710
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,141
-Bom.
-Yes?

711
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,352
Just be careful.

712
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,105
I'm hanging up.

713
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,765
Dae-ho, I'll buy you a meal
since it's your birthday.

714
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,100
What do you want?

715
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,813
There were two things I really missed
when I was in juvie.

716
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,064
Guess what they are.

717
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,443
You and the sea.

718
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,570
I saw both today, so I'm fine.

719
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,323
Seriously, what are you saying?

720
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,199
Oh, right. Hold on.

721
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,541
Here.

722
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,667
What is this?

723
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,669
I picked out the good ones.

724
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,799
Did you bake this yourself?

725
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,760
I'll keep baking them for you
if you like them.

726
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,720
You can have it with Jae-hun.

727
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,306
Dae-ho.

728
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,892
I feel bad to accept this
when it's your birthday.

729
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,895
You and the sea.

730
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,606
I already got my birthday gift.

731
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,485
-Thanks.
-Sure.

732
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,405
You're glad you came, right?

733
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,574
Yes, it's nice.

734
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,459
Yeo-reum enjoyed this last time.

735
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,255
Didn't you say you had a family?

736
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,091
They're waiting for me.

737
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,386
Let's run.

738
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,388
Let's run away.

739
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,431
Run!

740
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,275
The movie was fun.

741
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,278
-Dae-bum.
-Yes.

742
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,365
You seemed like
you've never been to a theater before.

743
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,325
It is my first time.

744
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,744
-Really?
-Yes.

745
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,540
That's amazing.

746
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,429
You're so pretty today.

747
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,273
I'm wearing these, by the way.

748
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,571
Shall we go for chicken and beer then?

749
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,783
I have to go back to Seoul.

750
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,535
I see.

751
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,622
So you came just to see the movie.

752
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,376
Let's do it next time.

753
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,087
-Okay.
-Okay.

754
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,383
Then…

755
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:05,387
would it be okay if I asked you
to walk with me to the terminal?

756
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,264
No.

757
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,849
-I see.
-Let's run instead.

758
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,933
What?

759
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,500
MYEONGJU BUS TERMINAL

760
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,132
I've gotten better, haven't I?

761
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,886
You got faster, really.

762
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,308
You have to go now, right?

763
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,853
Yes.

764
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,150
There's something

765
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:04,571
I realized recently, thanks to you.

766
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,115
What is it?

767
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,535
If I were on a deserted island,

768
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,038
I would never read a math book there.

769
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,667
Sorry?

770
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,378
Thanks to you,

771
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,631
it was really easy for me
to make up my mind.

772
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,760
That's good.

773
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,262
Right?

774
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,307
Yes.

775
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,648
Grandma, I'm home.

776
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,320
Grandma.

777
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,864
Is she not home?

778
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,783
Where is she?

779
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,245
Where did she go with all the lights off?

780
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,461
I was going to eat pastries with her.

781
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,548
What's this?

782
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,217
This is my favorite.

783
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,223
Where could she have gone?

784
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,721
When is she coming home?

785
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,008
He's already confessed
that he killed the old lady.

786
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,760
What are you talking about?

787
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,096
This isn't easy for us either!

788
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,181
If you just reported him,
this wouldn't have happened.

789
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,225
You killed my mom!

790
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,561
If they never met me,

791
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:27,858
Dae-bum wouldn't have had to
be reminded of this painful past,

792
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,611
and Bom's grandma would have
lived a long and happy life.

793
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,490
I never should have come to this place.

794
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,119
