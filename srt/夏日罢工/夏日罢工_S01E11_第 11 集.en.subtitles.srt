00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,343
Sit.

4
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,679
Okay.

5
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,528
Hey!

6
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,072
Sit.

7
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,298
Why did you do it?

8
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,310
Answer me.

9
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,940
Why did you kill Bom's grandma?

10
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,527
What did she do wrong?

11
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,741
Why did you kill her?

12
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,999
Grandma…

13
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,752
Grandma…

14
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,673
Grandma.

15
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,342
Grandma.

16
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,262
-Grandma is in danger!
-Hey, stop it!

17
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,100
Grandma is hurt!

18
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,144
Run!

19
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,396
Run away!

20
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,190
-Can you give me a hand here?
-Grandma, run away!

21
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,151
-Grandma, danger!
-Drag him out.

22
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,862
-She's in danger!
-Let's go.

23

TICKET
DESTINATION: SEOUL

24
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,246
We have four seats left for Seoul.

25
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,123
Are there any more passengers?

26
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,350
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

27
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,422
Seon-a!

28
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,678
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

29
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,263
Seon-a.

30
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,475
Where are you?

31
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,769
I'm here, Mom.

32
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,812
Mom.

33
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,981
Mom!

34
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,568
Mom.

35
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,560
Dae-bum.

36
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,612
It's been rough, right?

37
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,571
Who is it?

38
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,824
Who is it?

39
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,710
What are you doing here?

40
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,921
Have you been well?

41
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,466
Yes.

42
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,177
But what brings you here?

43
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,222
I missed you.

44
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,522
Wait out here for a second.

45
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,481
Bom.

46
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,111
Can I go into your house too?

47
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,363
What?

48
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,032
I'm sure Yeo-reum has been to your house

49
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,828
and Dae-ho as well.

50
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,124
Please let me in as well.

51
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,178
Way to visit out of the blue.

52
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,263
Sorry.

53
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,015
Let's go out.

54
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,142
Why?

55
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,144
You've seen the house now. Get up.

56
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,854
Can't we stay a little longer?

57
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,980
No.

58
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm going to practice too.

59
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,948
I want to know how you feel,

60
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,162
and I want to do everything for you
without being told what to do.

61
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,084
You can't.

62
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,795
Why not? I can.

63
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,756
I'll come over often.

64
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,175
I'll also spend more time

65
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,719
-with your family and neighbors--
-But you're Heo Jae-hun.

66
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,435
That's all I need.

67
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,232
I want you to stay clumsy and slow-witted.

68
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,573
So, do you want water or anything?

69
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,950
No.

70
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,869
Then…

71
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,289
can I try the tomatoes over there?

72
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,917
When did you spot those?

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,918
Come here.

74
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,371
The blankets are ready.

75
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,331
And…

76
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,169
there's some water
and some apples in the fridge.

77
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,089
You can have that.

78
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,215
Okay.

79
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,716
Then I'll get going.

80
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,719
Where are you going?

81
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,096
I'm going to the library.

82
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,890
-At this hour?
-Yes.

83
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,934
That's ridiculous.

84
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,435
I…

85
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,729
will sleep in the living room.

86
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,398
You can sleep in the room.

87
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,484
No, it's fine. I don't think
you'd be comfortable if I stayed.

88
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,819
-No.
-Rest up then.

89
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,861
Then I'll go out.

90
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,239
-No.
-It's fine. I'll go to the library.

91
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,992
I can't stay in your house all alone.

92
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,703
-I'll go.
-Yeo-reum, please wait.

93
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,705
Gosh.

94
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,711
Ha-neul.

95
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,338
Ha-neul.

96
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,009
Hey, you're back.

97
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,885
You didn't have dinner yet, did you?

98
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,264
Eat this with your sister.

99
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,683
What about you?

100
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,934
Don't mind me.

101
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,776
Dad brought home pizza. Come out.

102
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,654
I don't want any.

103
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,865
Hurry up and come out.

104
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,624
Hey, this is your favorite pizza.

105
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,899
Take this too.

106
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,736
-Go give it to him.
-What?

107
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,155
Give it to him.

108
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,992
You always make me do these things.

109
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,624
Dad, Bom asked me to bring you this.

110
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,250
Gosh, I said it's okay.

111
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,836
Enjoy.

112
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,549
Come and eat.

113
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,593
-Are you going to eat here?
-Yes.

114
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,234
-Grandma is in danger!
-Hey, stop it!

115
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,028
Grandma is hurt!

116
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,947
Run!

117
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,321
Yeo-reum.

118
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,118
I didn't know you were there.

119
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,663
I thought you went to the library.

120
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,461
I couldn't sleep.

121
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,130
Same.

122
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,341
You should sit.

123
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,051
Okay.

124
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,353
It's quiet here.

125
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,859
I never thought I'd visit here.

126
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,111
Same.

127
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,574
It's hard to fall asleep, right?

128
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,413
Geun-ho has been weighing on my mind.

129
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,665
At the station earlier,

130
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,418
Geun-ho didn't recognize me at first.

131
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,671
It's hard to believe

132
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,425
that someone with such a bad vision
drew graffiti and murdered someone.

133
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,845
It's been weighing on my mind.

134
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,725
You didn't know
that she was coming to your house

135
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,727
around that time, right?

136
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,396
No.

137
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,069
Yeo-reum.

138
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,114
Let's go to the billiard club tomorrow.

139
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,450
No. That place…

140
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,453
I can go alone.

141
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,546
Dae-bum.

142
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,008
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

143
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,610
GO AWAY

144
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,237
DIE

145
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,916
DIE. GO AWAY, GHOST.

146
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,852
DIE, GHOST.
YOU WHORE.

147
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,839
Let's not stay here. Let's go.

148
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,805
Dae-bum.

149
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,349
It's okay.

150
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,981
GO AWAY

151
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,526
I'm okay.

152
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,071
DIE, CRAZY BITCH
SLUT

153
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,031
These graffiti.

154
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,784
They are painted too clearly

155
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,745
for Geun-ho to draw without glasses.

156
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,168
I think someone is impersonating Geun-ho.

157
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,296
But why would they murder Ms. Jung?

158
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,100
What if someone wanted to hurt you…

159
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,939
and frame Geun-ho for it?

160
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,193
Geun-ho?

161
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,825
What if Ms. Jung came in

162
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,453
instead of you?

163
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,371
Yeo-reum.

164
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,295
Is that you, Geun-ho?

165
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,714
Grandma.

166
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,091
Hey there, Geun-ho.

167
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,551
Ma'am.

168
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,761
What?

169
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,928
Run away!

170
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,055
Geun-ho!

171
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,307
Oh, no!

172
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,600
Then maybe…

173
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,270
there is more than one culprit.

174
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,027
Geun-ho!

175
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,279
When I saw Geun-ho last time,

176
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,741
even a police officer couldn't
keep him under control.

177
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,584
But who…

178
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,921
and why?

179
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,009
You're here.

180
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,304
Hello.

181
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,227
Dae-bum, what brings you here?

182
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,853
Hello.

183
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,981
I thought you were leaving town.

184
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,944
No.

185
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,657
Gosh, this is a bit awkward.

186
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,326
Actually,

187
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,206
I ended up becoming
the owner of this building.

188
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,544
I'm sorry to say this,
but you'll have to move out of here.

189
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,759
I'll give you back the rent money.

190
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,806
Or I can find you another home in the area

191
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,809
that's cheaper and better.

192
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,811
Okay?

193
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,606
So how have you been, Dae-bum?

194
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,441
I've been okay.

195
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,032
Ji-yeong.

196
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,162
I haven't seen Dae-bum around
since yesterday.

197
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,830
Do you know where he is?

198
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,416
-Dae-bum went to Angok.
-Angok?

199
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,793
Gosh, this bastard.

200
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,880
Did he go there to see another movie?

201
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,882
Did he?

202
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,676
Professor.

203
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,970
Dae-bum won't be returning.

204
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,974
And I'm going to tell him the truth.

205
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,976
The truth?

206
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,936
What truth?

207
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,148
Professor.

208
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,234
I really want Dae-bum
to get back into academia again.

209
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:58,447
But I don't want him
to be manipulated into researching.

210
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,200
I want him to study of his own free will.

211
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,286
Look here, Ji-yeong.

212
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,372
Ahn Dae-bum and Holland
are competing with each other.

213
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,416
Do you know what that means?

214
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,210
But Professor Lee,

215
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,506
Aren't you ashamed of
letting a country boy carry you?

216
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,847
If you don't have what it takes,
you should stop being ambitious.

217
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,307
It'll be good for you. Believe me.

218
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,309
I'll get going.

219
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,779
You!

220
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,450
Gosh.

221
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,662
Hello, come in.

222
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,872
Come in, Dae-bum.

223
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,754
Thank you for coming.

224
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,548
But what brings you here?

225
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,635
We had something to ask you.

226
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,304
-Sure.
-Do you know

227
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:08,600
why Geun-ho wasn't
wearing his glasses on that day?

228
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,646
Glasses?

229
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,149
A few days before the incident,

230
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,570
he went outside and lost his glasses.

231
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,449
We should have gotten him a new pair.

232
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,079
Geun-ho's vision is really bad, right?

233
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,748
It's not just bad, it's impaired.

234
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,917
He has bad astigmatism.

235
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,628
He can't even walk straight
without his glasses.

236
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,798
I told you.

237
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,467
How could a person like that
paint graffiti?

238
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:48,140
Do any other people know about
the graffiti Geun-ho painted

239
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,684
in the billiard club before?

240
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,730
Why would we tell someone else that?

241
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,733
If someone knew,
Mr. Bae will end up finding out.

242
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,945
And I'm sure Geun-ho didn't do anything

243
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,406
to make enemies, right?

244
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,574
Enemies?

245
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,078
All he does is draw in his room all day.

246
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,331
There's no way he had enemies.

247
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,252
The graffiti in the billiard club
wasn't my son's doing.

248
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,423
He doesn't even know the obscene words
that are painted on the walls.

249
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,384
Look what he drew on the walls.

250
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,095
It's really not him.

251
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,473
My goodness.

252
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,061
Stop crying. We have guests.

253
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,273
I'm crying because I'm so frustrated.

254
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,819
They don't even try to listen
because he can't express himself.

255
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,197
How can I stay calm

256
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,949
when our son is behind bars
being forced to talk?

257
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,495
Dae-bum.

258
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,747
See for yourself.

259
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,041
See if my son is capable
of writing such vulgar words.

260
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,307
SEON-A

261
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,975
RUN AWAY

262
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,686
RUN AWAY SEON-A

263
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:28,281
SEON-A RUN AWAY

264
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,616
May I ask…

265
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,204
what these letters mean?

266
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,918
We're not sure, but he's been writing
that since when he was little.

267
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,296
When kids like him
get hooked on something,

268
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,007
they tend to write
and say them repeatedly.

269
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,177
I'm sure it's meaningless.
He just draws them.

270
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,556
Do you mind if I take a photo of this?

271
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,598
Sure.

272
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,183
Go ahead.

273
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,364
Geun-ho.

274
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,158
Look at me. Here.

275
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,034
I got you new glasses.

276
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,663
It must've been so frustrating.

277
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,124
We didn't steal it, okay?

278
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,500
We just borrowed it.

279
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,587
Didn't you have a question for him?

280
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,632
Hey.

281
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,719
Put your phone down
before I confiscate it.

282
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,721
Hey,

283
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,889
Geun-ho.

284
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,228
What does this mean?

285
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,152
Geun-ho.

286
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,156
Could you tell us what this is?

287
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,159
Please?

288
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,455
It's okay, Geun-ho.

289
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,707
You can tell him, it's okay.

290
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,002
I heard you've written this
since when you were little.

291
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,462
What does it mean?

292
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,422
Geun-ho, what's wrong?

293
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,924
Calm down. It's okay.

294
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,133
You can tell them.

295
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,510
Then why did you write

296
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,888
"run away" and "you'll die" on the wall?

297
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,181
Geun-ho!

298
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,099
It's okay.

299
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,935
Calm yourself.

300
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,187
You didn't kill her, right?

301
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,814
It's okay.

302
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,775
Are you okay, Geun-ho?

303
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,652
You'll be okay.

304
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,362
Look at that guy.

305
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,364
-Look at him.
-I'm sorry.

306
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,407
You'll be all right.

307
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,244
It's fine, Geun-ho. I apologize for this.

308
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,830
What are you doing this weekend?

309
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,501
-I don't know.
-Then let's hang out all day.

310
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,628
I'll have the day all planned out.

311
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm so jealous that
you can smile so happily.

312
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,967
Me?

313
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,053
That's not true. I have a lot on my mind.

314
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,722
You have a lot on your mind?

315
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,477
I'll have a lot of worries
for you on that day,

316
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,853
so be a good listener, okay?

317
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,815
Really?

318
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,900
Then let's meet tomorrow.

319
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,111
Don't you have work tomorrow?

320
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,362
They want me to take a day off.

321
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,365
And it's my treat tomorrow.

322
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,325
It's fine. It's my treat.

323
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,952
You don't even make that much.

324
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,454
What I mean is…

325
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,415
It's…

326
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,002
just that I don't want to use the money

327
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,713
-you worked so hard to make.
-Forget it.

328
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,089
Whatever.

329
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,301
This is part of your charm anyway.

330
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,387
Really?

331
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,639
It's my charm?

332
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,433
What other charms do I have?

333
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,351
That's enough.

334
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,190
What did they say

335
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,862
was the first graffiti Geun-ho painted?

336
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,617
The first one was,

337
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,288
"Run away, you'll die."

338
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,586
RUN AWAY…

339
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,212
And then?

340
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,465
The second one was

341
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,384
"Kill Seon-a,

342
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,428
you saw it."

343
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,721
YOU SAW…

344
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm sorry.

345
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,853
It's okay.

346
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,609
RUN AWAY, YOU'LL DIE
KILL SEON-A, YOU SAW IT

347
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,324
SEON-A

348
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,202
Do you think they're somehow connected?

349
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,455
I'm not sure.

350
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,336
I'm not sure if I should say this,

351
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,131
but I heard from Geun-ho's mom

352
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:01,096
that he used to like your sister, Seon-a.

353
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,268
Ever since your sister passed,

354
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,562
he started drawing these things.

355
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,317
She said Geun-ho is telling me to run away

356
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,153
because he thinks I'm her.

357
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,448
He keeps telling me

358
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,410
to run away by drawing these words.

359
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,454
It really sounds like
he's telling me to run away from someone.

360
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,045
SEON-A

361
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,089
This…

362
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,591
What is it?

363
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,845
SEON-A

364
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,431
-Look at him.
-I'm sorry.

365
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,558
You'll be all right.

366
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,235
Eat some rice too.

367
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,533
Ji-yeong.

368
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,952
What are you doing here?

369
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,079
Hey, it's food.

370
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,456
Good. I'm hungry.

371
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,585
There isn't much to eat though. Hold on.

372
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,795
Where's the spoon?

373
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,714
It's right here.

374
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,508
Jun.

375
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,926
You're not even saying hi?

376
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,805
But we're not that close.

377
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,809
Is this too big for you?

378
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,229
You should still say hello.
She even bought you the jacket.

379
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,023
-Here's your spoon.
-Thank you.

380
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,900
Thank you for accepting my gift.

381
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,944
How come you came back
without even calling?

382
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,238
Me?

383
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,242
I missed Angok.

384
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,244
What?

385
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,622
The human heart is so strange.

386
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,707
What do you mean?

387
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,710
When I used to live here,
I couldn't wait to leave this place.

388
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,296
But after a few days in Seoul,
I missed Angok.

389
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,300
You and your fickle heart.

390
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,845
Seong-man.

391
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,014
Should I not go to Seoul?

392
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,976
I mean,

393
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,773
staying here doesn't sound too bad.

394
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,899
Don't you think so?

395
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,112
Hey,

396
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,073
but it's only been a few days.

397
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,660
Once you get busy over there,
you'll soon forget this place.

398
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,247
Do you want me to live in Seoul?

399
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,419
What is this?

400
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,713
Can you talk about
these kinds of things outside?

401
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,341
It's not like that, Jun.

402
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,884
Don't get the wrong idea.

403
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,094
Look.

404
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,388
Don't do something you'll regret.

405
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,682
You tried so hard to pass that exam.

406
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,934
You should go to Seoul.

407
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,686
With you gone,

408
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,064
there's one less person
to chew my ears off.

409
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,524
You don't mean that.

410
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,943
You little…

411
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,241
Hello?

412
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,326
What?

413
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,955
Can't my dad go instead?

414
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay. All right.

415
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,753
What's wrong?

416
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,300
This is just terrible timing.

417
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,178
Enjoy your food, I'll be right back.

418
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,766
-Listen to Ji-yeong, okay?
-Okay.

419
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,022
Look at this.

420
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,817
Do you think my kid painted this?

421
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,028
My kid who is in jail at the station?

422
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,864
I told you it wasn't Geun-ho.

423
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,073
Why didn't you believe me?

424
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,117
Of course I believe you.

425
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,201
I mean it.

426
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,870
And Mu-cheol!

427
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,414
Go and tell the people at the station.

428
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,041
I'll report it right away.

429
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,836
And release Geun-ho immediately.

430
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,129
Yes.

431
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,631
But still,

432
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,883
the footage showed him
entering this building.

433
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,551
So we have to look into that.

434
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,387
-So for now--
-Look into what?

435
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:15,475
But what does this mean?

436
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,768
There are two triangles,

437
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,479
and this part looks like
some sort of letters.

438
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,980
It is like a code?

439
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,067
Hello.

440
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,861
-Hello.
-Hello.

441
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,821
Yeo-reum.

442
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,741
What do we do?
Someone drew another graffiti here.

443
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,163
Maybe Dad's right.
The building must be cursed or something.

444
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,792
Hey, Mu-cheol. That security camera.

445
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,710
Do you think it caught something?

446
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,587
Right, check the CCTV.

447
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,631
-Okay.
-Let's see.

448
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,008
-Come on.
-You should've shown us first thing.

449
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,760
Okay.

450
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,891
There's someone there.

451
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,228
How can you tell who this is
with this footage?

452
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,730
Do you not have their front side?

453
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,609
The camera is shooting from above,
so we didn't get the face.

454
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,111
Can you not zoom in?

455
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,406
Gosh.

456
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,454
You get a hang of erasing this
after a couple of times.

457
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,207
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,210
What? Why are you sorry?

459
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,256
Oh, right.

460
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,300
You're going to have
to look for another place

461
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,095
because this building might get sold.

462
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,931
-Yes, I heard.
-Really?

463
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,891
You heard already?

464
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,187
Is it okay if I ask you a question?

465
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,148
Go ahead.

466
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,281
Goodbye.

467
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,286
Hey, Lim Dae-ho.

468
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,831
Did they turn you into a baker

469
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,124
in juvie or something?

470
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,263
I want to hang out every day.

471
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,059
We can do that. Let's do this every day.

472
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,020
Hey, get yourself together.
We're in our senior year now.

473
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,482
Yes, ma'am.

474
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,985
Didn't you want to talk
about your worries?

475
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,528
What is it?

476
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,075
Tell me.

477
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,786
It took care of itself.

478
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,038
That's dumb.

479
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,708
-Stop it.
-Eat it, come on.

480
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,295
Darn it. Now I have to go to the bathroom.

481
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,756
-Eat this and go.
-You eat it.

482
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,021
You insolent motherfucker.

483
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,691
You should've come to say hello
after you were released.

484
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,527
Do we have to go look for you?

485
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,655
Did you just laugh?

486
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,323
Just leave.

487
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:20,243
Don't bother me
unless you're going to pay me.

488
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:24,122
Do you think you're all that
because you can fight, you little shit?

489
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,456
Hey.

490
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,041
Do you know who we are?

491
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,045
Is that a line they teach you

492
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,964
at bully school?

493
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,257
You motherfucker.

494
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,676
And you.

495
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,595
Stop spreading rumors about Bom.

496
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,389
Please.

497
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,099
Look at this punk.

498
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,017
Is that a threat?

499
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,104
What do you mean, a threat? I said please.

500
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,897
"Please", my ass.

501
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,445
You think you're better than us,
you son of a bitch?

502
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,114
Dae-ho.

503
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,574
Ha-neul, it's okay.

504
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,742
-Please don't fight.
-It's fine.

505
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,244
I'm not a kid anymore.

506
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,912
-Go take Ha-neul.
-Come with me, Dae-ho.

507
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,872
Come with me.

508
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,081
Let's go, Ha-neul.

509
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,124
Hey!

510
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,792
-I'll talk to them and go.
-Let's just go.

511
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,127
Come here.

512
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,504
I'll stand still.

513
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,008
Just hit me a few times and leave, okay?

514
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,554
Bom.

515
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,608
Jae-hun, I think I have to go now.

516
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,068
-Where?
-I'll tell you later, bye.

517
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,820
Bom.

518
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,947
Drunks' kids are all the same.

519
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,282
These poor fuckers.

520
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,326
They're so busy leeching off people.

521
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,495
You're right!

522
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,873
Look at Bom leeching off the American boy.

523
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,752
Take back what you just said,
and I'll let you go.

524
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,795
What the hell are you--

525
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,761
Wait. I have something to say.

526
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,429
Jae-hun, I don't have time.

527
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,972
Let's do this later, okay?

528
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,724
Why am I always put on the back burner?

529
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,310
You're going to Dae-ho again, right?

530
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,354
What?

531
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,482
You did that last time
when we were supposed to have lunch.

532
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,318
You were with Dae-ho that day.

533
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,780
I saw you leaving with Dae-ho
on his motorcycle.

534
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,450
You should've told me
when you saw me then.

535
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,452
Why are you making me look bad
after all this time?

536
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,454
I called you,
but you said something came up.

537
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,165
Do you want me to explain
every little detail to you?

538
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,126
Don't go today.

539
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,422
Jae-hun, I'm really sorry.

540
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,175
I'll explain everything later.
This is urgent.

541
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,469
I'm all Dae-ho has.

542
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,681
-What?
-If Dae-ho gets in trouble again,

543
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,432
his life is over.

544
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,017
You're the only one for me too.

545
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,146
I might go back to the US.

546
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,690
What?

547
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,734
Why are you telling me this now?

548
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,445
Are you doing this on purpose?

549
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,074
Fine. We can talk about that tomorrow.

550
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,326
That's a country you can come back from.

551
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,286
I'll get going.

552
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,247
Hey, I told you this is urgent!

553
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,374
You don't even know anything.

554
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,042
You have parents to rely on

555
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,794
but we don't!

556
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,379
You know my story.

557
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,673
Why would you say that?

558
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,591
Life isn't easy for me either.

559
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,260
Jae-hun.

560
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,638
We are walking on thin ice every day.

561
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,933
One wrong step can be the end for us.

562
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,020
Why are you referring
to you and Dae-ho as "we"?

563
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,773
Because we're different from you.

564
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,529
Do you know how little I felt
when I visited your house?

565
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:47,158
You have no idea how it hurts my pride
when you pay for everything.

566
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,368
Then…

567
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,495
What am I supposed to do?

568
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,666
I know I'm the only one who likes you.

569
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,917
I know that.

570
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,920
But you sidelining me every single time,

571
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,505
I can't take it anymore.

572
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,177
You deal with that yourself.

573
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,971
I never asked you to like me.

574
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,774
-Hey, let's run.
-Go.

575
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,779
Dae-ho!

576
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,614
Let's hold back, Dae-ho.

577
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,075
You son of a bitch!

578
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,413
You fucker.

579
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,291
Dae-ho!

580
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,626
Dae-ho, please!

581
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,177
Oh, no!

582
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,804
Hey!

583
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,889
-Stop it!
-Fuck!

584
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,933
Gosh!

585
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,976
-Come here.
-Let go.

586
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,646
I told you to let go!

587
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,649
You little bitch!

588
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,825
Hey, Dae-ho!

589
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,077
What are you doing?

590
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,370
Move.

591
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,746
I told you to move!

592
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,331
Get yourself together!

593
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,710
You were never here, okay?

594
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,509
Fuck, it's the cops!

595
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,054
Isn't it embarrassing
to get beaten up by a girl?

596
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,598
So just tell them I beat you up.

597
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,935
Damn it.

598
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,817
Hey, over there. Stop it.

599
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,277
Hey, stop.

600
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,945
-What are you doing?
-You son of a bitch.

601
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,613
Stay still.

602
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,906
Let go.

603
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,575
-Fucking let go!
-Take him.

604
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,034
Are you okay?

605
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,494
Stay still.

606
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,705
-Fuck.
-Are you all right?

607
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,915
Come here.

608
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,750
Hurry up and get in the car.

609
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,229
They picked the fight first.

610
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,482
-Say something, Dae-ho.
-Come on.

611
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,108
-Tell them.
-To the station.

612
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,109
Dae-ho!

613
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,277
Tell us at the station.

614
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,987
-Why are you arresting him when--
-I get it.

615
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,822
-Bom.
-This way.

616
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,907
I don't regret this.

617
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,618
I'll beat up all the bad guys from now on.

618
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,745
You idiot.

619
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,081
Why would you do this?

620
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,970
I KNOW

621
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:55,888
Hey.

622
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,765
Who are you?

623
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:06,899
I KNOW YOU KILLED HER

624
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:07,900
Hey!

625
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,500
There.

626
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,428
Hey, stop right there!

627
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,147
Who the hell are you?

628
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,982
Show yourself.

629
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,799
Girl from the billiard club?

630
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,846
What do you think you're doing?

631
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,766
I was curious.

632
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,517
About what?

633
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,979
About who is so interested
in Geun-ho's graffiti.

634
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,286
SEON-A BILLIARD CLUB

635
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,123
TRASH. GO AWAY, GHOST.

636
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,839
Hey.

637
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,175
You.

638
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,512
Why did you sneak in here?

639
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,649
Ahn Dae-bum.

640
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,610
Was it you?

641
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,699
You know what this is, don't you?

642
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,785
It's Angok Middle School.

643
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,340
KWAK

644
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:22,261
MU

645
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:31,228
CHEOL

646
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,189
Kwak Mu-cheol from Angok Middle School.

647
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,193
KWAK MU-CHEOL

648
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,071
You killed her, didn't you?

649
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,075
My sister.

650
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,923
SEON-A

651
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,410
You killed Ms. Jung

652
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,995
to cover up for killing Seon-a!

653
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:30,996
Stop talking nonsense!

654
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,290
I said I didn't do it!

655
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,709
-Vehicle 386, stop the car.
-Please keep going.

656
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,461
It's over for you.

657
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,087
I've been tricked. Just you wait.

658
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,547
I won't let this slide.

659
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,549
Everyone will know now

660
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,384
that your son is a murderer!

661
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,262
You know that secret recordings
can't be used in court, right?

662
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,264
Please help us.

663
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,724
Bom!

664
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,267
I miss Grandma.

665
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,477
I was wrong.

666
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,811
I'm sorry.

667
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,023
