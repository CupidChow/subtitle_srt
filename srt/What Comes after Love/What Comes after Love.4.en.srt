00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,805
Listen.

185
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,934
You're not supposed to marry someone you love.

186
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,778
You need a good person to be your spouse.

187
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,779
Jungo and I used to talk
about getting married.

188
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:45,075
But it wasn't the same kind of marriage
that my mom talked about.

189
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,326
Now that I think about it,

190
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,121
I don't think marriage is the right word.

191
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:53,667
We just wanted to be with each other forever.

192
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,962
That was what we wanted
to say to each other.

[ICHIRO'S RAMEN]

194
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,718
Hey, everyone!

195
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,928
- Welcome.
- Hello, Nozomi.

196
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,096
Good evening, Nozomi!

197
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,398
[DEAR MS. CHOI HONG]

198
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,934
What's... this?

199
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,684
It's a wedding invitation.

200
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,898
Oh, my god!

201
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,106
Boss!

202
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,775
I can't believe this.

203
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,026
You can't be serious?

204
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,029
This is a miracle!

205
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,573
What was it? Ten proposals?

206
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:31,704
I can't believe she finally said "yes"!

207
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,956
All right, everyone.

208
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,541
First things first.

209
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:39,512
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

210
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,475
- That's so good!
- That hit the spot.

211
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,267
What's got into you?

212
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,102
What's wrong?

213
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,104
It's nothing.

214
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,564
- I just...
- What's the matter?

215
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,442
Are you sad that I'm getting married?

216
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:05,906
I'm sorry, but I don't feel
the same way about you.

217
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,033
You should've told him sooner.

218
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,285
I could've got away then.

219
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,703
Too bad.

220
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,297
No, it's not like that.

221
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,175
It's just that...

222
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,004
I don't have any family or friends in Japan.

223
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,715
So, I always felt a bit lonely.

224
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,516
But...

225
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,220
But you've been so good to me

226
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,930
and even invited me to your wedding

227
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,517
as if we were family.

228
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,185
All right.

229
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:40,023
To celebrate Hong becoming
a part of our family,

230
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,483
how about another drink?

231
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,820
That sounds good.

232
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,197
- Jjan!
- "Jjan"?

233
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,741
Yeah, Hong taught me this.

234
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,953
That's how you say "cheers" in Korean.

235
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,121
- Really?
- Yeah.

236
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,666
- Ready?
- Jjan!

237
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,176
- Jjan!
- Jjan!

238
00:16:07,477 --> 00:16:08,719
What's this?

239
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,054
I got invited to a wedding.

240
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:14,349
Boss is finally getting married.

241
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,685
Really?

242
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,895
He wanted you to come as well.

243
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,464
- Did he?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:23,941
And he asked if you were allergic to anything.

245
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,736
I think that's so considerate.

246
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,205
People don't usually ask that in Korea.

247
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,212
You're coming, right?

248
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,334
I'll think about it.

249
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,865
Hey, don't be like that! You should come.

250
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:45,212
Come on, let's go.

251
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,465
What's the matter?

252
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,343
Do you need to go to work?

253
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,511
I mean, that's one reason...

254
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,305
You've got nothing to worry about.

255
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:56,160
I've already prepared a gift for them.

256
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,392
A gift?

257
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,186
You'll see what it is on the day.

258
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,571
That's another thing to look forward to!

259
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,360
What are weddings like in Japan, anyway?

260
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,287
I've only been to weddings in Korea.

261
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,783
Well...

262
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,252
I'm sure they're both pretty similar.

263
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,833
It's totally different from a Korean wedding.

264
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,794
It's totally different there.

265
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,462
Right?

266
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,048
Jungo won't ever talk about these things.

267
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,465
It's so frustrating.

268
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,467
He probably doesn't want you
feeling pressured.

269
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,094
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,679
Don't get me started.

271
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,307
I was totally flustered
when my cousin got married there.

272
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:41,819
First of all, the cash gift there starts
at the equivalent of 300,000 won.

273
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,148
Seriously? That's so much.

274
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,526
That's why they only invite
close family and friends.

275
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,278
And if you said yes to the invite,

276
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,571
you can't not show up like we do in Korea.

277
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,907
You have to be there in person.

278
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,950
I heard it's really rude not to go.

279
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,410
I see...

280
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,579
Hey, start writing this down.

281
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:03,041
You need to buy a special envelope for the cash gift, too.

282
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,418
- A special envelope?
- That's right.

283
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,754
It's so different over there.

284
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,673
You're right.

285
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,257
Oh, right.

286
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,509
When are you getting your hair done?

287
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,760
Why would I need it done?

288
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,012
The guests go all out in Japan.

289
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,391
They show up in sparkly dresses with perfect hair.

290
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,351
And the men put on clean-cut suits.

291
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,216
Have you decided what you'll wear?

292
00:18:23,216 --> 00:18:24,521
Clothes?

293
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,523
Oh, no.

294
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,561
You don't have any.

295
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,008
Ji Hui told me something.

296
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:53,302
What did she say?

297
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:57,679
Apparently, I need to dress nicely
for weddings in Japan.

298
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,396
That sounds about right.

299
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,862
Have you thought
about the kind of wedding you'd like?

300
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,483
I think...

301
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,695
I'd prefer to have a small wedding.

302
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,574
Just like the one in About Time.

303
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,826
Then, I guess you'll also need
some rain in the middle of it.

304
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,120
Of course.

305
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,038
With umbrellas turning inside out!

306
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,376
That sudden downpour was
what made the wedding so special.

307
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:32,756
I'd invite Ji Hui and everyone from Ichiro's Ramen.

308
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,799
I'd like to ask your father

309
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,178
to perform with his band, too.

310
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,646
I bet he'd be more than happy to help.

311
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,922
But...

312
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,896
I don't think my mom would come

313
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,822
if I got married in Japan.

314
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:54,454
Is she still ignoring your calls?

315
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,030
Don't worry.

316
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,623
I'm sure she'll get over it eventually.

317
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,572
It's so pretty.

318
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,329
Yun Oh?

319
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,117
- Welcome.
- Hello.

320
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,160
Hello.

321
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,412
Would it...

322
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,464
Would it be possible to try on that dress?

323
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,376
No, Yun Oh. It's fine.

324
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,545
Of course, you can.

325
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:58,689
We'll start by taking your measurements.

326
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,907
This way, please.

327
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,774
See you in a bit.

328
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,530
Are you ready?

329
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,657
Pardon?

330
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:27,203
Remember to give her a big smile, okay?

331
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,714
- Oh, of course.
- Okay, then. Here she comes.

332
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,811
You look...

333
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,897
so beautiful.

334
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,812
That's exactly what we like to hear.

335
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,856
I think the best compliments

336
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,617
come from being genuinely sincere
about your feelings.

337
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,791
- Hey.
- Hi.

338
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,126
Here you go.

339
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,336
Thanks. I'll take good care of it.

340
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,713
Do you have an interview?

341
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,717
No. I was just invited
to Hong's friend's wedding.

342
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:04,801
How's she doing?

343
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,094
- She's well.
- I almost forgot.

344
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:11,182
I heard Sato was looking for someone
to do some work for him.

345
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,475
Are you interested?

346
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,938
You've been looking for a publishing job, right?

347
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:19,107
Sato's looking for people?

348
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,734
I'd love that.

349
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,444
You should meet up with him tomorrow.

350
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,863
He seemed to be in a hurry.

351
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,448
You have his number, right?

352
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,575
I do. I'll give him a call. Thanks.

353
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,960
- I'm off. Thanks again.
- No problem!

354
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:46,684
- Do you know where it is, Yoshino?
- Check the top shelf on the right.

355
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,187
Over here, Aoki.

356
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,563
Thank you for meeting with me today, sir.

357
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,106
How's the writing coming along?

358
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,150
I haven't been writing much recently.

359
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,985
You always had a lot of potential.

360
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:07,405
Especially out of your classmates.

361
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,706
Thank you very much.

362
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,453
I'll save the rest
of my nagging for later.

363
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,703
Can you start today?

364
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,081
We just had two people quit.

365
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,383
We're in a real bind.

366
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,544
Do you need me to start today?

367
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,379
You don't want to?

368
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,974
No, it's not that. It's just...

369
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,990
- Congratulations on the wedding.
- Thank you for coming.

370
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,900
- Thank you.
- Please go on in.

371
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,620
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

372
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,671
Thank you for coming.

373
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,137
[MR. AOKI JUNGO]

374
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,516
[MS. CHOI HONG]

375
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,693
- Hong!
- Hey!

376
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,287
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

377
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,075
Isn't Jungo coming today?

378
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:36,872
He'll be here soon.
He had to stop by for an interview.

379
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:39,580
Everything set for today's special performance?

380
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,611
No. I've never performed
at a wedding before.

381
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,802
I'm so nervous.

382
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:47,881
Don't worry about it.

383
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,049
Everyone's going to be blown away
if you do what you did at rehearsals.

384
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,635
- He's right.
- You'll be fine.

385
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,470
I'm not sure about that.

386
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,056
- You'll be fine!
- Seriously, don't worry.

387
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,935
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much

388
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,938
for taking the time
out of your busy schedules

389
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,650
to attend the wedding
of Mr. Nitta Ichiro and Ms. Gato Nozomi.

390
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,654
The groom and bride will soon
make their entrance.

391
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,948
When you see them,

392
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,244
please welcome them
with a warm round of applause.

393
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:21,915
Now, I'd like to ask you all
to direct your attention to the back.

394
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,925
Please welcome the bride and groom!

395
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,970
Boss, you look so cool!

396
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,980
Try to relax a little!

397
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:43,770
This draft needs
to be proofread by seven o'clock.

398
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,113
- I got it.
- Thanks.

399
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,093
[MISSED CALL, BENI]

400
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:14,758
Next, we have a special surprise
for the bride and groom.

401
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:19,305
We hope it'll be a pleasant surprise
to mark this special occasion.

402
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,681
Actually,

403
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:23,476
we knew that the groom had kept
a secret crush from the bride,

404
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,186
so we tried to invite TWICE to join us today.

405
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,648
Hey, shut it!

406
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:31,441
- I guess his angry response confirms it.
- Come on.

407
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,903
I think that's enough joking around.

408
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,740
Joining us on the stage is
Ichiro's Ramen's very own K-pop star.

409
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,867
Please welcome Ms. Choi Hong!

410
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:42,211
Please give her a big round of applause!

411
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:46,916
Ichiro and Nozomi.

412
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,085
Congratulations on your wedding.

413
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,878
I might not be very good,

414
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:54,264
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd listen with kindness.

415
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,528
You scared me.

416
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,238
Were you taking a photo?

417
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,956
Yes.

418
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,465
Yun Oh!

419
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:20,003
Beni...

420
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,056
Are you okay?

421
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:28,388
The publisher I interviewed with

422
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:32,058
asked me to start today.

423
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,019
I see.

424
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,070
Why did it have to be today?

425
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:41,151
I've always wanted to work there.

426
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:43,369
I really couldn't help it.

427
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,968
What's this?

428
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,763
Your thank-you gift from the wedding.

429
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:08,310
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

430
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,107
You shouldn't have taken these.

431
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,358
What was that?

432
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,022
It's just...

433
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,815
I didn't give them any congratulatory money.

434
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,194
It'd be rude of me to accept a thank-you gift.

435
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,029
If you're so well-versed in manners,

436
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,365
why did you not show up at all?

437
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,574
But this was...

438
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:31,950
Didn't you say you'd try to make the time?

439
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,912
I told you that I'd try.

440
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:35,705
I didn't say I'd definitely be there.

441
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,667
You could've just said
that you didn't want to go.

442
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:39,751
What?

443
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,878
You shouldn't have said anything

444
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:44,388
if this was how it was going to be.

445
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:52,722
Wait, Beni...

446
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:54,773
Leave me alone.

447
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:21,008
It didn't take very long for me to realize...

448
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:25,012
that everlasting love didn't exist.

449
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:28,373
Here we go, Min Jun.

450
00:37:28,373 --> 00:37:29,666
Great. Forehand, now.

451
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,376
You need to see the ball through.

452
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,303
There you go. Backhand, now.

453
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,266
Are you all right?

454
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,811
Hey.

455
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:45,182
Let's call it a day.

456
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,692
I feel like I'm about to throw up.

457
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,191
- Have you found a house yet?
- Well...

458
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:58,111
Not yet. Hong's been busy, too.

459
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:00,030
How is she doing?

460
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,948
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, no reason.

461
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:06,244
I just remember how my wife was
before the wedding.

462
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:08,580
It took her a few years
to tell me how she felt.

463
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,508
She was scared at the thought
of actually getting married.

464
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,130
Your wife is the bravest person I know.

465
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,340
I doubt she was scared.

466
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,091
I know, right?

467
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:23,136
I was so nervous until the night before.

468
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:28,399
Just remember not to let your guard down
until you walk down that aisle.

469
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,904
Hong, you haven't forgotten about tomorrow, right?

470
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,448
Get a good night's sleep. See you tomorrow.

471
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:46,542
[ALL RIGHT]

472
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,346
Hey, Lightning.

473
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,592
You know, right?

474
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:05,853
How bad my memory is.

475
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,270
But why can't I forget

476
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,947
about Jungo?

477
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:27,868
Why do you think that is?

478
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,788
What are you doing
sitting outside in the cold?

479
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,131
What do you want?

480
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,377
Here.

481
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:39,053
What's this?

482
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,340
I found it in your guitar case.

483
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,843
I assumed you already had
a lot on your mind,

484
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,220
so I wasn't sure
if I should give it to you.

485
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,147
But I couldn't just pretend like I didn't see it.

486
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,810
It's fine.

487
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,070
Aren't you going to read it?

488
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:07,947
Really? Already?

489
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,918
Yes, I understand.
We'll be there as soon as we can.

490
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:12,495
Thank you.

491
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,872
We did it!

492
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:16,289
There's a huge line outside already!

493
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,125
Are you serious?

494
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,376
The book signing's
not for another four hours.

495
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,131
- That's great news!
- Amazing.

496
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,765
I almost forgot.

497
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,554
Ms. Hong.

498
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:33,224
I heard it was Mr. Sasae's birthday.

499
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:34,726
Oh, is it?

500
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,076
What should we get for his gift?

501
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:38,711
Pardon?

502
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:42,400
Why are you asking me?

503
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,236
I heard from Mr. Lee that you spent some time

504
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,072
- studying in Japan--
- Mr. Yun.

505
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:50,291
How are those two things related?

506
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:54,003
I'll try to figure it out on my own.

507
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:15,892
Please come in.

508
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:19,479
Ah, I'm so full.

509
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:22,941
Bulgogi is going to be
my go-to meal from now on.

510
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,567
And it was even better today

511
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:28,204
because Beni treated me.

512
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:32,992
Dad, you had three servings by yourself.

513
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,743
Do you know how hard she worked
to pay for that meal?

514
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,915
- Come on. I can afford that much.
- Right!

515
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:41,418
And I couldn't help it because it was so good.

516
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:45,463
Don't worry. I'll treat you on
your birthday next year, too.

517
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,048
Really?

518
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:49,259
I'm so happy today.

519
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:51,177
Thank you, Beni.

520
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:53,638
I should be thanking you.

521
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:55,390
Jungo and I wouldn't be together

522
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,650
if it wasn't for you.

523
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:20,999
Is this...

524
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:23,001
your grandmother?

525
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,635
That's right.

526
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:30,633
She raised Jungo when he was young.

527
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:33,060
After his mother ran away from home.

528
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,486
What a unique-looking cake.

529
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,864
Don't kids usually have cakes

530
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:56,126
that are decorated with fruits
or cartoon characters?

531
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,484
My grandmother really liked Mont Blancs.

532
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:02,624
A Mont Blanc cake

533
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:07,045
is supposed to look like
a snowy mountain top in the Alps.

534
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,542
The Alps?

535
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:11,049
- The mountain range?
- Yeah.

536
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:15,303
She always wanted to go to the Alps.

537
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:19,140
But she had weak legs since she was a child.

538
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,519
She loved to watch documentaries
on mountain trekking.

539
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:25,863
That's why she always bought me
a Mont Blanc cake.

540
00:43:34,155 --> 00:43:35,789
Jungo!

541
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:40,954
Look!

Beni.

I'm still full after that bulgogi.

546
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:52,340
I don't think I can have anything else.

Let's have it next time.

548
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:59,097
Can we buy it by the piece?

549
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:00,515
I'm sorry.

550
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:03,101
We don't sell the Mont Blanc by the piece.

551
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:06,480
Cutting it ruins the shape.

552
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,898
I see.

Shall we get something else, then?

554
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,074
Beni, I'm really full right now.

565
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:57,371
You usually don't talk about yourself.

Oh, come on. You know it's true.

568
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:11,461
We can't express all our feelings by just speaking,

569
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,847
but some things need to be said for it to be known.

570

You're right, but...

571
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,889
But I just find it difficult.

572
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:26,101
It's hard for me to find
the right way to say things.

573
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,728
As long as you're sincere,

your honest feelings

575
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:34,408

Even still.

577
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:39,836
It'd be nice if you could tell me.

578

I may already know how you feel,

579
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,955

581
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:52,252
"I love you."

00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,386
That could be one of them.

583
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,561
That's a hard one.

But instead,

585
00:46:06,641 --> 00:46:08,435
I'm going to write a novel

586
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:12,272
about how I feel about you one day.

00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,733

- Yes.

Apparently, we're all made of stars.

603
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,424
The earth was born when a star exploded,

604
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:24,886
and that's how we were created.

605
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:28,473

rolled into a snowball and buried us inside.

623
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:34,998
We were blind to the harsh realities of the world

624
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:38,084
when we were at the peak of happiness.

625
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:40,420

"I've also had a similar experience
