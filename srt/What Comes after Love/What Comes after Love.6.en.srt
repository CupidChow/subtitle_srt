1
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:19,527
What kind of a person am I to you, Jungo?

2
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,792
What kind of a person?

3
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,358
Yeah.

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,069
I just got curious about how you saw me

5
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,488
as a person.

6
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,539
That's all.

7
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,912
I'm not sure.

8
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,006
The Kanna I know...

9
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,878
has always been confident

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,339
and always honest

11
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:50,926
about how she feels.

12
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,594
I see.

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,312
Why do you ask?

14
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,475
I don't know when it started,

15
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,894
but whenever I'm with you,

16
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,356
I feel different from my usual self.

17
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,819
That's why

18
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,079
I decided to turn back.

19
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,700
I'll become myself again

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,868
back to being confident and honest

21
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,378
like the Kanna that you once knew.

22
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,168
I know now

23
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,380
that love is something I can't control.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,770
I was too late to realize that.

25
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,393
What do you think?

26
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,528
Isn't that good news for you, too?

27
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,848
That's such a Kanna thing to say.

28
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,890
Come on. I know how it must've been.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,312
It couldn't have been comfortable
to work with me.

30
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,002
- Just a little.
- Really?

31
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,234
Kanna?

32
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,035
What's wrong?

33
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,589
I guess she also knew...

34
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,460
that it was your birthday today.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,303
Who are you talking about?

36
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,932
That one that you can't get over.

37
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,271
She was...

38
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,108
just here.

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,904
What?

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,943
She was standing by the entrance

41
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,286
but saw me and took off.

42
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,753
[MOM]

43
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,600
I wanted to tell him how I felt.

44
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,430
I wanted to thank him

45
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,024
for being good to me
and showing me what love is.

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,981
I wanted to apologize
for complaining all the time

47
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,741
and never

48
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,493
thanking him.

49
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,616
I wanted to say

50
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,001
that we should let go of our regrets.

51
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,999
A wise man once said,

52
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,629
"Not getting what you want
　can be a blessing."

53
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,014
I wanted him to know that.

54
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,060
That's what I almost told him before I realized

55
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,320
that Kanna and he were together.

56
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,746
[THINGS THAT TIME MAKES YOU REALIZE]

57
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:32,256
[WHAT COMES AFTER LOVE]

58
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,332
Hong had grown tired by then

59
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,168
of being lonely in a foreign country

60
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,137
and even more so from living with me.

61
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,233
We were physically in the same space...

62
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,562
but deep inside,

63
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,320
we were in two different dimensions.

64
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,698
I failed to see how she felt.

65
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,993
I couldn't understand her one bit.

66
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,202
I thought

67
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,705
she was only thinking about herself.

68
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,749
That's how I felt at the time.

69
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,210
You might as well do nothing but work.

70
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,587
Why make promises you can't keep?

71
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,547
Why am I the only one who gets worried?

72
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,174
Why do I always have to wait?

73
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,385
This isn't easy for me, either!

74
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,387
Do you think I like living like this?

75
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,972
We see each other at home, anyway.

76
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,815
Why can't you be a bit more understanding?

77
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,621
But I get it now.

78
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,578
She had been growing lonelier every day,

79
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:30,516
and it was completely my fault
for not realizing it.

80
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,093
I wonder who came up with the word for regret?

81
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,140
Why did God create us to feel like this...

82
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,133
and what did they want us to learn from it?

83
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,794
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

84
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,515
I was kicking myself for it all night.

85
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,220
Me too.

86
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,855
What?

87
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,619
I was up all night thinking the same thing.

88
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,607
So?

89
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,908
What are you going to do now?

90
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,209
I don't know. What can I do?

91
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,590
Jungo.

92
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,629
You may be a man of a few words,

93
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,048
but with her,

94
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,517
you need to tell her exactly how you feel.

95
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,852
Look her in the eyes,

96
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:17,224
don't hold back,
and be honest about your feelings.

97
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,143
She'll see that you're being genuine then.

98
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,570
I'm sure that she will.

99
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,990
If you just talk to her...

100
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,161
it'll clear up any wrong ideas.

101
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,920
Go and be happy.

102
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,467
I really hope that you will be.

103
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:49,453
Thanks, Kanna.

104
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,728
I better get going.

105
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,391
I'll walk you to the lobby.

106
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,977
No, I'll be fine on my own.

107
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,437
I'm sorry to leave you behind.

108
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,273
Have a safe flight tomorrow.

109
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,907
Thanks.

110
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,910
Good luck, Jungo.

111
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,545
Thanks.

112
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,175
- Ms. Choi.
- Yes?

113
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:36,094
Today's interview will be
Mr. Sasae's last item on the agenda.

114
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,729
Will you be there?

115
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,601
I can't. I have something else
to take care of later.

116
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,437
- I'm sure you'll be fine without me.
- Yes, ma'am.

117
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:49,733
Mr. Sasae said he'd be fine by himself
to get to the airport tomorrow.

118
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,318
I don't think we'd need to accompany him.

119
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,736
Would that be okay?

120
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,532
Sure. I'll let Mr. Choi know.

121
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,417
Thank you.

122
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,683
Has Jungo left?

123
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,449
No.

124
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,872
When is he leaving?

125
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:35,403
Tomorrow.

126
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,672
Are you okay?

127
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:37,792
Yeah.

128
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,949
Are you sure?

129
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,577
Why? Would it be better if I wasn't?

130
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,872
Of course not. That's not what I meant.

131
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,125
Look, Ji Hui.

132
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,252
- This was my favorite paragraph.
- What?

133
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,880
"Just let yourself go
and let the moment take over.

134
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,216
Then, look back on yourself,

135
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,968
almost as if you were a spectator.

136
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,348
Once the river in your heart settles
and grows quiet,

137
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,727
keep watching until you figure out
where it wants to flow.

138
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,521
That might be the most honest approach

139
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,567
we can have toward our lives."

140
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,986
I couldn't agree more.

141
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,196
I'm glad.

142
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,615
As soon as I read it,

143
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:24,494
it felt like you saw right through me
for the very first time.

144
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,830
I actually wrote that
while thinking about you

145
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,006
after we met two days ago.

146
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:34,747
Right. I should've known.

147
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,760
Today's interview will start at two o'clock,

148
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,230
and it will be held at a book café
near the office.

149
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,516
In that case,

150
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,145
could we make a quick stop at the office?

151
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:53,606
Sure. It's pretty close by, so it should be fine.

152
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,308
Let's make a quick stop.

153
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,526
It should be fine since it's close by.

154
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,573
Sir, can we stop by the office first?

155
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,750
Yes, of course.

156
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,790
The book signing went without a hitch,
thanks to everyone.

157
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,500
It was such a wonderful experience.

158
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,045
"The book signing went without a hitch,

159
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,798
It was such a wonderful experience."

160
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,841
I hope to work with you again soon.

161
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,226
Thank you.

162
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,645
Ms. Choi had a meeting to get to today,

163
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,939
so she's currently out of the office.

164
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,775
Oh, I see.

165
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,777
It's snowing.

166
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,745
Look, it's snowing.

167
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,458
Mr. Sasae.

168
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,462
Shall we head over to the interview now?

169
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,923
Yes, of course.

170
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:58,216
[WHAT COMES AFTER LOVE]

171
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,671
It's a shame, but we've come
to the last question already.

172
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,799
"It's a shame, but we've come
to the last question already."

173
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,943
Mr. Sasae.

174
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:10,679
What do you believe comes after love?

175
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,017
Regret, loneliness, and other emotions
certainly come to mind,

176
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:19,062
but it felt like the title
had a special meaning to you.

177
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,691
"What do you believe comes after love?

178
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,932
It felt like the title had

179

a special meaning to you."

180
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,909
For the past five years,

181
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,421
I've thought about a lot of things
while writing this novel.

182
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,383
What do I believe comes after love?

183
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,962
I believe

184
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,340
we can gain an understanding

185
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,009
of what love is.

186
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,261
It feels very ironic.

187
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,972
"It feels very ironic."

188
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,433
Yes, you're right.

189
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,444
It's such a sad irony.

190
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:04,608
Only after love

191
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,660
do we realize what it truly means.

192
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,405
That's why I believe

193
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,075
we're always filled with regret.

194
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,910
Maybe that's why

195
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,329
the deeper our love is,

196
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,089
the bigger our regret becomes.

197
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,889
I don't think we can express
all our feelings by just speaking.

198
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,601
And those feelings are

199
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,271
what you're trying to write, isn't it?

200
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,731
There's something special

201
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,992
about the way you write.

202
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,787
And that's why I like it.

203
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,494
Thank you,

So,

206
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,349
in the end,

207
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,179
the only thing I could do was write.

208
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,766
To understand how she felt

209
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,817
and to take a step

210
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,654
toward her heart once again.

211
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,961
A single moment can last forever.

212
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:27,759
And forever can end in a single moment.

213
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,363
Oh, that's cold!

214
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,037
That's amazing!

215
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,659
- That's enough!
- When I think about her smile...

216
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,541
all I can remember is

217
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,051
the beautiful seasons

218
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,471
and the wonderful times we had.

219
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,567
I can never forget

220
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,994
the perfect smile on her face.

221
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,240
It was the most genuine smile I ever saw.

222
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,326
A smile that hadn't been tainted

223
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,627
by hatred, betrayal, or doubt.

224
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,990

The sun was shining in the sky.

227
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,489
We woke up from our happy slumber...

228
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,903
looked at each other with sleep in our eyes,

229
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,155
and smiled.

230
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,123
It feels like I'm dreaming.

231
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,327
If I am really dreaming...

232
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,462
I don't ever want to wake up.

233
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,833
I'll always be by your side.

234
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,271
I promise you.

235
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,303
We were just as uneasy
as much as we were happy,

236
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:28,807
but as I held Hong on that day,

237
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,734
I was sure that she was happy.

238
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,980
Good evening, gents. Come on in.

239

That was what the two of us

243
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:01,013
tried to believe back then.

244
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,059
You shouldn't have said anything

245
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,444

249
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,037
from a certain point,

250
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,505
her gaze started to wither.

251
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,169
Even when she smiled,

252
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,889
it didn't seem genuine.

253
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,061
Her smile turned number by the day.

254
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,822
It was all my fault in the end.

255
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:10,558

that made her feel lonely.

taken seriously at that time.

00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,349
Okay.

375
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,853
You too, Jungo.

376
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,023
Bye.

377
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,347
There you go.

378
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:27,273
Thank you.

379
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,400
How's your father?

380
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,902
- Is he well?
- Yes.

381
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,744
He's doing very well.

382
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,990
I heard my grandfather

383
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,459
was against you and my father dating.

384
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:49,538
Did you ever hold it against my dad?

385
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,339
No.

386
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,876
I was actually quite glad.

387
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:58,797
He didn't ask me to come to Korea.

388
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,133
Being lonely in a foreign country

389
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:05,137
with only one person to lean on?

390
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,834
I don't think I could've done it.

391
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,692
We were quite different, too.

392
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:18,115
I hope you two make it, though.

393
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:21,119
Thank you.

394
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:27,875
But sometimes...

395
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:34,499
I feel like unfulfilled love would be meaningless

396
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,718
and I get kind of scared.

397
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,176
Sometimes, it takes a lot of time

398
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,811
for you to realize something.

399
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,767
There is no such thing as meaningless love.

400
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,644
Love is a blessing in itself.

401
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:57,947
It doesn't matter what kind of love it is.

402
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:03,619
I only realized that after a long time.

403
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,109
Hello.

404
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,736
Would you like to check out?

405
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:26,839
Yes, please.

406
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,499
Okay, thank you.

407
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:30,596
Please wait a moment.

408
00:41:32,193 --> 00:41:34,505
Excuse me, sir.

409
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,447
These flowers were supposed to be given to you.

410
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:43,568
But, they were handed to another customer yesterday.

411
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:47,338
We do apologize for our mistake, sir.

412
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,359
We're really sorry.

413
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:50,958
Thank you.

414
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,396
- Dad.
- Yes?

415
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,942
Do you really have to follow my account?

416
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:07,569
I thought you wanted more followers.

417
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,821
Yeah, but you're not just "a follower."

418
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,991
What are you trying to say?
Is family not important to you?

419
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,251
No, that's not what I'm...

420
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,964
Hey, Mr. Lee.

421
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,800
Okay.

422
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,637
Can't you just take care of it?

423
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:45,482
Hey, what side of the bed
did you wake up on?

424
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,484
What are you trying to make up for?

425
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,444
Have you lost weight?

426
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,237
Oh, come on. No way.

427
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,031
I never realized you were so small.

428
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,533
Oh, knock it off, will you?

429
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,702
You'll catch my cold if you don't.

430
00:42:57,702 --> 00:42:59,830
Well, I don't actually mind.

431
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,923
Do you not have work today?

432
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:04,918
Rock.

433
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,796
I was on my way home last night,

434
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:11,549
and I got this random warm feeling.

435
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:15,387
So, I'm going to give myself a small gift today.

436
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:16,846
What are you talking about?

437
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:18,848
Were you out drinking again?

438
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:20,433
No.

439
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:23,645
How about a movie date with Mom?
It's been a while.

440
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:25,647
I'm down if you're paying.

441
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,149
Can you see what's on while I go for a run?

442
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:29,867
I'll be back soon.

443
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:43,123
Hey, Lightning.

444
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,216
See you in a bit.

[I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER
HAPPY BIRTHDAY - HONG]

446
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:54,027
Hello.

447
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:55,945
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

448
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:58,664
- Hello.
- Hi, Ji Yun.

449
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:01,910
Okay, Seo U. Let's take a look at your leg.

450
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,536
Okay.

451
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,455
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

452
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,131
Then...

453
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,377
How about this blue?

454
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:12,379
Would the blue make it brighter?

455
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,973
This one does seem a bit too dark.

456
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,558
You know,

457
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,818
I haven't stopped running.

458
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,280
Ever since we broke up,

459
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,325
I wanted to be closer to your heart.

460
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:05,413
So, I just kept running.

461
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:10,681
I ran around Inokashira Park...

462
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,344
and I thought about you.

463
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,839
At first,

464
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,907
it was because I missed you.

465
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:27,596
But as I kept running...

466
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,958
I started to understand...

467
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:38,203
how you must've felt back then.

468
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,781
You were running

469
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:46,654
to get over your loneliness.

470
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:54,363
I thought...

471
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:59,432
that I knew everything about you.

472
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,436
But now I know...

473
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:09,211
that I didn't understand
the most important part.

474
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:18,494
You know what?

475
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:22,489
After we broke up...

476
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,252
I couldn't even run for a while.

477
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:31,253
It's just like you said in your novel.

478
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:34,380
I was the same.

479
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,729
I regret everything I did, too.

480
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:42,563
When we were together...

481
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,138
all I did was complain

482
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,507
and didn't even try to understand how you felt.

483
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,936
I was just the same.

484
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:59,387
I didn't see what was actually important.

485
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,488
I didn't see it until it was too late.

486
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,115
I made you feel...

487
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:12,967
lonely and miserable, too.

488
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,355
No.

489
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,453
It was my fault.

490
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,464
I made you lonely.

No.
