183
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,048
- Are you Korean?
- I am.

184
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,111
I lived in Japan for five years
when I was in elementary school.

185
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,746
So, communication won't be a problem.

186
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,035
And you'll obviously be good at Japanese

187
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,829
since you're a literature major.

188
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,505
Yes, sir.

189
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,167
Not only am I good at Japanese,

190
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,836
but I can speak Korean, too.

191
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,339
So I can serve Korean customers.

192
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,551
We do get a lot
of Korean tourists these days.

193
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,560
Can you speak Korean?

194
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,397
No, I can't speak Korean.

195
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,562
However,

196
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,897
I've had to work to pay for my tuition,

197
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:05,066
so I have a lot of experience.

198
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,652
I need the money
to pay for this semester, too.

199
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,495
That must be tough.

200
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,578
I need to find work so I can make money

201
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,165
to pay for rent each month,
or I'll end up getting kicked out.

202
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,333
And I'm here in Japan all by myself.

203
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,752
Rent...

204
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,837
Yeah, the rent is pretty high around here.

205
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,464
It really is!

206
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,081
And since I'm an overseas student,

207
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:33,050
I can't even apply for a loan.

208
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,890
All right, I've heard enough.

209
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,767
So, you need money to pay your rent,

210
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,061
and you need money for school.

211
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,187
Unfortunately,

212
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,822
we only have one position open.

213
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,320
How about we do it like this?

214
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,706
Why don't you stay for tryouts today?

215
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,327
I'll keep an eye on how you two work

216
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,746
and hire the one who does better.

217
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,674
That's fair, isn't it?

218
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:05,435
All right. Let's do this.

219
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:10,516
[OPEN]

220
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:13,602
Thank you for waiting. Please come in.

221
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:16,221
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

222
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,847
Sorry to keep you waiting.

223
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,974
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

224
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,227
Here you go. One large ramen.

225
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,437
- I'll bring you your rice, too.
- Here you go.

226
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,113
Thank you.

227
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,984
Thank you for waiting.

228
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,653
- I brought the noodles!
- I got it.

229
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,279
One al dente shoyu ramen, ready to serve!

230
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,498
I'm on it. Thank you.

231
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,077
Thank you for waiting.

232
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,370
This way, please.

233
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,873
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you. The food was really good.

234
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,001
Thank you for waiting.

235
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,135
Thank you for waiting.

236
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,560
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

237
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,772
Hey! Menu!

238
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,401
Here you go, sir.

239
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,859
This is our tonkotsu shio ramen,

240
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,987
and this is our tonkotsu shoyu ramen.

241
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,615
The tonkotsu shio ramen is our best seller.

242
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,502
Please take your time
and let me know when you've decided.

243
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,801
Is there a waiter who speaks Japanese here?

244
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,048
How may I help you, sir?

245
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,217
It's uncomfortable to see
so many foreigners these days

246
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,136
waiting tables like this.

247
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,056
In that case, I'll be happy to take your order.

248
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:44,893
Good. You need to think
of what's best for the customers.

249
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,154
You should teach your staff
to speak Japanese properly.

250
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,951
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you

251
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,154
to apologize for what you just said.

252
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,323
What?

253
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,824
You want me to apologize?

254
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,868
Yes, sir.

255
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,120
Please apologize.

256
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,630
I'll take your order once you do.

257
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,570
Have you lost your mind?

258
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,852
You've got some guts, kid.

259
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,526
You can stare at me all you want,

260
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,702
but I'm not going to apologize.

261
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,405
I'm sorry, sir,

262
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,966
but you need to leave.

263
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,802
You're making the other guests uncomfortable.

264
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,271
Well, I've lost my appetite now.

265
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,274
That's all on you, Mr. Waiter.

266
00:20:57,741 --> 00:21:01,203
I'm sorry about how I acted
in front of that customer.

267
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:03,121
I'm sorry, sir.

268
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,664
Don't worry.

269
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,249
I'm sorry that it happened.

270
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,251
It's okay.

271
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,711
You.

272
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:11,512
You'll start tomorrow.

273
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,865
Yes, sir.

274
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:17,018
Here you go.

275
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,849
You did well today.

276
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,775
Thank you, sir.

277
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,497
That must be it.

278
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:47,340
I'm telling you!

279
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,759
What do you mean?

280
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,380
What are you saying?

281
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,090
He came to your rescue.

282
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,758
He wanted brownie points.

283
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:58,718
Don't be ridiculous.

284
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,637
Well, look at you!

285
00:22:00,637 --> 00:22:03,765
You were pretty much forever alone in Korea.

286
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:06,560
But look at what you've achieved
as soon as you came to Japan.

287
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,770
Come on, I was never forever alone.

288
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,232
I mean, have you ever dated anyone
who was half-decent?

289
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,985
One ghosted you,
and one went to the army.

290
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,404
When did you ever snag a catch?

291
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,923
Then there's Min Jun, who's actually not that bad.

292
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,516
But you insist he's just a friend.

293
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,995
Listen.

294
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:28,707
How many times must I tell you?
He really is just a friend.

295
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,751
Sure, whatever.

296
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:34,463
Did he cry when you left Korea?

297
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,465
Poor Min Jun.

298
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:40,302
Trust me. I bet he can't stand
being put in the friend zone.

299
00:22:40,302 --> 00:22:43,813
That's enough.
It's not like you're doing any better.

300
00:22:44,473 --> 00:22:46,266
I feel bad for your knight in shining armor.

301
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,059
Doesn't he need money for school?

302
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,996
I think he got a job
at a food truck across the street.

303
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,148
Which is a relief.

304
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:54,865
A food truck?

305
00:22:58,153 --> 00:22:59,871
Here you go.

306
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,028
[CLOSED]

307
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,995
Sorry for the wait. Thank you for coming!

308
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,325
Thank you.

309
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,001
What can I get you?

310
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:52,541
You're staring at the food truck again.

311
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:53,708
What?

312
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,335
Who, me?

313
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,629
No, I wasn't.

314
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,506
I was just...

315
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:03,017
checking to see if it was raining outside.

316
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:07,639
Hong.

317
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:11,192
- Yes, sir?
- Can you get some hotdogs for us?

318
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:15,988
Yes, sir.

319
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:23,196
- Thank you for your waiting!
- Here we go!

320
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,781
Hong finally passes the halfway line

321
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:27,409
and runs straight into the opponent's territory!

322
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:28,994
Here's the moment we've all been waiting for.

323
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,163
Will Hong finally get to score her first goal?

324
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:32,831
The suspense is real!

325
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:35,041
Now, we've got to ask!

326
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:39,129
Did she really have to go out
with that headwrap on her head?

327
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,839
What a terrible oversight!

328
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,676
She's not as level-headed as she usually is.

329
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,887
She must be feeling nervous.

330
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,972
Perhaps she's not used to playing such games.

331
00:24:48,972 --> 00:24:51,558
Right, that must be it.

332
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:54,277
Thank you. Please come again.

333
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,234
Hello.

334
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:02,910
Hello.

335
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:06,096
It's been a while.

336
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,704
Are you here for some hotdogs?

337
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,331
Oh, yes.

338
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:16,807
Can I have five cheese hotdogs, please?

339
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:17,835
- Five?
- Yes, please.

340
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,553
Five cheese hotdogs.

341
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:30,229
That headwrap looks good on you.

342
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:33,232
Thank you.

343
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:35,310
And you, too.

344
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,570
You look good in your apron.

345
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:41,490
Thank you.

346
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,536
Thank you very much.

347
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:48,990
Here she comes!

348
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,750
Get back to work!

349
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:53,537
Come get your hotdogs!

350
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:55,588
- Great.
- Thanks.

351
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:58,883
Here you go.

352
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:01,962
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

353
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:04,131
Oh, I almost forgot.

354
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:08,468
It's our turn to clean
the shopping district this week.

355
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,762
We've always had the newbies do it.

356
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,639
So, you'll be doing that from now.

357
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,365
It's at 10 a.m. tomorrow.
Do you think you can do it?

358
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,078
Of course. Leave it to me.

359
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:20,439
Good luck!

360
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,114
Yes, sir!

361
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:31,366
The stores of the Kichijoji Prosperity Association

362
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:34,494
work hard to keep the shopping district clean.

363
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:38,957
We meet every morning
to clean up an area of the district.

364
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:41,376
We appreciate your cooperation.

365
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:43,003
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

366
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:45,270
Let's start by taking attendance.

367
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,730
Ichiro's Ramen?

368
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,258
- Here.
- Thank you.

369
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:49,468
Murakami Bookstore?

370
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:51,595
- Here.
- Great.

371
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:53,930
Inubushi's Food Truck?

372
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,099
Inubushi's Food Truck?

373
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,560
Is there anyone from Inubushi's Food Truck?

374
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,570
I'm here!

375
00:27:03,148 --> 00:27:06,568
- Sorry for being late.
- That's okay.

376
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:09,029
- Wasabi Store?
- Here.

377
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,572
Eclin Store?

378
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:11,656
- Present.
- Thank you.

379
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,575
All right. Let's get to work.

380
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:14,910
Can you get this as well?

381
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,544
Over here.

382
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,103
Oh, that's cold!

383
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,240
- Hong.
- What's up, Rock?

384
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,325
You promised only to call in emergencies.

385
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,202
It's actually an emergency right now.

386
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:59,003
Hong!

387
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,374
What's wrong with you?

388
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:04,793
You said you were going to Jeju Island.
What on earth are you doing in Japan?

389
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,753
It's pretty much the same.

390
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,521
It's about as close as Jeju,
and Japan's an island, too.

391
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,341
Come back home right now.

392
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:14,344
If you're done with college,
you should be thinking about working

393
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:16,430
instead of running away
like an adolescent child!

394
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,773
Yeah, I'm not a child anymore,
so I moved out.

395
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:22,894
Are you listening to yourself right now?

396
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:25,814
Stop wasting your time and come back home,

397
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:27,482
or you'll regret all this later!

398
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:28,567
Listen, Mom.

399
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:31,069
It's up to me whether I decide
to waste my time or not.

400
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,279
It's my life.

401
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,116
You don't even know why I came here
and what it is that I want to do, do you?

402
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,827
You're always the same.
You dip your toes in this and that,

403
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:41,204
then quit when things don't work out.

404
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:44,750
I know you ran away
because you're afraid to get a job.

405
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,710
- Mom!
- What?

406
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,095
Am I wrong?

407
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:51,548
No, you're right.

408
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:54,384
I did run away.

409
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,143
I ran away from you.

410
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:16,038
Talk about perfect timing.

411
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,072
I was wondering...

412
00:29:52,484 --> 00:29:57,371
If you're free after work tonight...

413
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,086
do you want to go for a drink?

414
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,895
I see.

415
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,934
So, you might end up staying
in Japan for a while then.

416
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:29,354
I'm not sure yet.

417
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:32,698
I'm trying to get ready
to go to graduate school...

418
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,778
but I don't know if I should stay here

419
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:39,322
or just move on.

420
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:42,083
I'm not even sure if I'll like it here.

421
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:48,790
You should take your time
and think about it while you're here.

422
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,417
That's all I want.

423
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,211
I want to mull it over and take things slow.

424
00:30:53,211 --> 00:30:55,638
But you know,

425
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,725
life sometimes needs time to buffer.

426
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,186
"Buffer"?

427
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:04,931
I mean,

428
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:08,351
it's kind of like putting on the brakes.

429
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:12,446
I see what you mean.
Like brakes that slow you down?

430
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,823
The person who's meant to be on my side

431
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:25,744
can't seem to understand me.

432
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:28,588
They don't even seem to want to try.

433
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:32,049
Has that ever happened to you?

434
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,676
It happens sometimes.

435
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:44,304
And it hurts so much when it does.

436
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,139
It's so frustrating.

437
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:48,691
Why else would I come all the way here?

438
00:31:52,938 --> 00:31:55,482
Oh, by the way.

439
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:58,110
You're a literature major, right?

440
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,987
- Right.
- So am I!

441
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:02,663
No way!

442
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:07,536
We have quite a lot in common.

443
00:32:07,536 --> 00:32:09,663
How so?

444
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:13,291
Well, we both have the same major,

445
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,836
and we're both desperate for work.

446
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:17,254
And...

447
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:19,138
What else...

448
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:21,466
Right!

449
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:23,476
We're both buffering!

450
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,062
You're right.

451
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,362
So, why did you choose literature?

452
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:41,903
I wanted to become a writer.

453
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:45,713
Actually, I feel more comfortable

454
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,265
expressing my thoughts on paper.

455
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:52,463
What are you writing these days?

456
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,418
Well, just this and that.

457
00:32:56,418 --> 00:33:00,338
I just write down whatever comes to mind,

458
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:03,933
but it's nothing to write home about.

459
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:12,434
I think you'll make it.

460
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:14,311
Pardon?

461
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,153
As a writer, I mean.

462
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:20,324
You think so?

463
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:22,827
Trust me.

464
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,455
I just have a feeling.

465
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:35,089
Can I...

466
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,251
really trust your feelings?

467
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,859
If you don't believe me,

468
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,506
then come and see for yourself.

469
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,181
What?

470
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,565
Come on.

471
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:02,275
Let's go!

472
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:03,951
You've got this.

473
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:12,001
Come on, Bonobono!

474
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,712
That's it. You got it!

475
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:31,471
That's too bad.

476
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:34,982
I was hoping it'd be a Bonobono.

477
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:38,228
So, if you got Dai Nee-chan,

478
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:41,481
does that mean your feelings were off?

479
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,984
You know about Dai Nee-chan?

480
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:47,696
Not many people know about that character.

481
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:51,658
She's the older sister of Shimarisu-kun,
who is Bonobono's friend.

482
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:53,535
Oh, no way!

483
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:55,670
You really do know her!

484
00:34:56,413 --> 00:35:00,851
Shall we call it a day?
It looks like you're fresh out of luck.

485
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:03,420
Did you say we're going for another drink?

486
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,922
What? You seem pretty drunk already.

487
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:07,591
I'm totally fine.

488
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:10,510
I haven't even had that much to drink.

489
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,722
You had ten lemon sours.

490
00:35:13,722 --> 00:35:15,864
Hey, this is Choi Hong you're talking to.

491
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,392
What was that?

492
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:18,852
Choi?

493
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:21,605
That's right. Choi Hong.

494
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:23,337
My last name is Choi,

495
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,639
and my first name is Hong.

496
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:30,363
I'm Jungo.

497
00:35:30,363 --> 00:35:32,790
My name's Aoki Jungo.

498
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:35,619
- Jungo.
- Right.

499
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,378
Jungo...

500
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:40,882
Hey, Jungo.

501
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:47,047
Doesn't Dai Nee-chan look lonely to you?

502
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:48,480
You know what we should do?

503
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,510
We should look for her boyfriend!

504
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,804
- Are you talking about Pippo?
- That's right!

505
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:57,390
We need to find Pippo
so they can be with each other!

506
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,692
- All right, then.
- Good.

507
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,444
Come on, Pippo!

508
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:11,488
You got one again!

509
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:13,122
That's amazing!

510
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,254
What's the matter?

511
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:31,675
I could've got Pippo
if I just played one more round.

512
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:36,555
Dai Nee-chan needs to have Pippo by her side.

513
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:39,391
You've got nothing to worry about.

514
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,518
Even if it wasn't for you,

515
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:44,396
they'll always have each other.

516
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:46,364
Their love is everlasting.

517
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,201
Everlasting...

518
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:59,752
Do you believe in everlasting love?

519
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:06,884
That's a difficult question.

520
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:14,475
I mean, it has to exist somewhere, right?

521
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,356
"Somewhere"?

522
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:25,319
I made up my mind!

523
00:37:26,772 --> 00:37:30,317
I'm going to stay here.

524
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:33,953
I want to go and see where that "somewhere" is.

525
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:39,618
By the way,

526
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:42,037
where do you live?

527
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:43,830
Don't worry about me.

528
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,090
I can get home by myself.

529
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,044
Goodbye.

530
00:37:49,044 --> 00:37:51,046
How are you going to get home?

531
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:53,423
I'm going to run.

532
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:55,224
In this rain?

533
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,553
Don't worry.

534
00:37:58,553 --> 00:38:03,316
I'm probably much faster than you.

535
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:12,192
You might

536
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:14,544
have me fooled for a weakling,

537
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:16,880
but I actually run
around Inokashira Park every morning.

538
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,598
I do five laps each day.

539
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,762
There's no way
you can run five laps every day.

540
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:26,306
Hold on. You don't believe me?

541
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,974
Of course not.

542
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:31,353
Do you have any idea
how big Inokashira Park is?

543
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,188
Unbelievable.

544
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm being serious!

545
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,442
Do you want me to show you?

546
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,652
You'll kick yourself.

547
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:42,037
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

548
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,826
Wait! You're way too drunk.

549
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:47,952
Hong?

550
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,670
Hong!

551
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:58,762
She's actually pretty good.

552
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,062
Well, look who it is.

553
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:16,238
If it isn't the resident lunatic.

554
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:20,568
So, tell me.

555
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:23,037
How much did you have to drink?

556
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,327
That's weird.

557
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,830
Did I bump my head somewhere?

558
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,672
Just have some breakfast.

559
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,459
So?

560
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,877
What was he like?

561
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,421
You met him, didn't you?

562
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,138
The hotdog man?

563
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,883
Yes.

564
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,510
I did.

565
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,554
And?

566
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,230
Well...

567
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:57,988
Give me money.

568
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,844
I'm so proud of you, Hong.

569
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:29,478
Me too...

570
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,892
Hey, don't worry about it too much.

571
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,443
You'll see him again
if you two are meant to be.

572
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:40,781
I doubt it.

573
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:03,880
I've never believed in such things.

574
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,174
Rather than believing in fate or miracles,

575
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:10,394
I've always wanted to have faith in myself.

576
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:15,850
Ji Hui thinks it's fate
when coincidences repeat,

577
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,936
but I think that's just wishful thinking.

578
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,356
People who believe in fate

579
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,991
are the ones who hope
for a miracle to happen.

580
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,869
But...

581
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,176
Hey.

582
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,425
Wait! Hong?

583
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:50,935
Stop!

584
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,430
Wait up! Don't go!

585
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,314
Hong!

586
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:00,694
Oh, no.

587
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,200
Are you all right?

588
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,911
No, I'm not.

589
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:20,130
That really hurts.

590
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,261
I'm so sorry about the other night.

591
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:28,097
Don't worry about it.

592
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:33,762
You're a little later than usual today.

593
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:36,348
It's already past 11 a.m.

594
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,308
What?

595
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,025
Have you been...

596
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,645
Thanks to you,

597
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,892
I'm late for school today.

598
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:49,903
Have you been waiting for me all morning?

599
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:55,992
I did it.

600
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:57,710
I finally got it.

601
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:03,875
Is this...

602
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,294
When did you get this?

603
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:10,465
Well, I happened to be in the area yesterday.

604
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:13,760
So, I just gave it a shot,

605
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,812
and this was the first one that came out.

606
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,405
Please be it.

607
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:37,541
Yes!

608
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,422
About time!

609
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:03,609
That was the moment when I realized

610
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:06,896
that fate

611
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:09,065
really did exist

612
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:11,158
in this world.

613
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:19,951
I never felt anything like it before.

614
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:23,538
It was also a moment

615
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:25,714
that I would never get to experience again.

616
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:30,920
Please hand in your work by next week.

617
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,672
All right. That's it for today.

618
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:34,932
Well done, everyone.

619
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:39,603
Please come and ask me
if you have any questions.

620
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:48,070
Jungo!

00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:04,003

- See you!

624
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:29,062
Hold on. You look much happier than usual.

625
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,438
- What?
- That look on your face...

626
00:45:30,438 --> 00:45:32,281
What are you talking about?

627
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,907
I knew it, Hong!

628
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:42,575
You finally scored!

629
00:45:42,575 --> 00:45:44,919
Stop it, you guys!

630
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:48,506
I'll see you tomorrow!

631
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,551
- Bye!
- Have fun!

632
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:55,380
They look so good together.

633
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,841
She's got some moves.

634
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,892
It must be young love!

635
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:31,006
It's so beautiful.

636
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:36,095
How do I say "beautiful" in Korean?

637
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:39,716
It's a bit hard to pronounce.

638
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:41,976
You have to say, "yeppeuda."

639
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,603
Yeppeuda.

640
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,515
That was pretty good!

641
00:46:47,515 --> 00:46:49,525
So, it's yeppeuda.

642
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,784
Yeppeuda.

643
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,214
Hong.

644
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:47,666
Sorry.

645
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,265
That spring was...

646
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,428
the beginning...

647
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:08,687
and end of my spring symphony.

648
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,271
Back then,

649
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,648
I firmly believed
that if I truly loved someone...

[SEOUL, 5 YEARS LATER]

651
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:24,578
...the abundance of the universe
would be there to help me.

652
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,498
That was what I believed.

653
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,838
Everyone knows

654
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:37,633
that love has an expiry date.

655
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:43,764
But I believed

656
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:47,302
things would be different for me.

657
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:49,478
I believed our love would be different.

658
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:58,104
After I broke up with Jungo
and came back from Japan,

659
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,447
I was tormented by the fear

660
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,277
that I would end up destroying myself

661
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:07,072
if I didn't immerse myself in something.

[SODAM BOOKS]

663
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:11,618
I've made some notes on it.

664
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,752
Would you like to take a look?

665
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,540
Mr. Lee, this is the final version.

666
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,501
Okay.

667
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:20,960
Ms. Choi.

668
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,629
This is the final version.

669
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:25,507
We'll go ahead and print it
if you don't find any issues.

670
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,092
Could you take a look?

671
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,968
I'll get back to you after one last read.

672
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:30,811
Sure.

673
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,729
If I knew that
I was going to meet Jungo...

674
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:17,942
I wouldn't have gone.

675
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:24,691
Ms. Choi.

676
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:27,652
- Did you see the snow outside?
- I did.

677
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:30,405
I was stuck in traffic because of it.

678
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:32,115
Right.

679
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,701
If everyone is here,
let's get on with it, shall we?

680
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,244
Yes, ma'am.

681
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:39,539
First, let me show you
the cover design for the reprint.

682
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,583
We've already seen it last time.

683
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,460
Let's move on to the next agenda.

684
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,919
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:48,840
We couldn't decide on the copy
for the cover in our last meeting.

686
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,217
I've narrowed it down to these two options.

687
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:53,178
Let me read them to you first.

688
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:56,689
That's fine. Let's just read it ourselves.

689
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:02,604
Have we still not received
Ms. Park Ji Hui's manuscript?

690
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:07,074
Well, we haven't been able
to get a hold of her since yesterday.

691
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:10,153
All right.

692
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:12,197
I'll try to get in touch with her.

693
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:14,822
Mr. Lee, are you ready for next week's event?

694
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,957
Yes, Ms. Choi.

00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:19,037
Mr. Sasae will get here
by lunchtime tomorrow as scheduled.

696
00:51:19,037 --> 00:51:23,166
Once he arrives, the interview will proceed at 4 p.m.

697
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:27,543
Mr. Lee, can you keep working
with the CEO on the Japanese section?

698
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,589
I know you're busy
with the South American section.

699
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,216
Don't worry about us.

700
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:33,684
Everything's going to be perfect.

00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:40,308
Sir, can we make the color a bit darker?

702
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:42,610
Of course, we can.

703
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,022
This way.

704
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:49,867
- Have we received the first shipment?
- Yes, it's all here.

705
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,780
And the second batch
is arriving in two days, right?

706
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,915
Yes, it'll all get here in time.

707
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,018
When did you get here?

708
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,356
Just now.

709
00:52:19,356 --> 00:52:21,032
What's that?

710
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:24,953
It's a cake.

711
00:52:25,654 --> 00:52:27,531
I was craving for something sweet.

712
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:29,283
How did you know?

713
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:32,752
How do you always know me so well?

714
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:36,681
It's nice to hear
such a lovely compliment,

715
00:52:36,681 --> 00:52:39,935
but it feels like
you're happier to see this than me.

716
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:41,311
How did you know?

717
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:43,613
See? I'm an open book to you.

718
00:52:46,274 --> 00:52:47,359
Hold on.

719
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,319
You didn't forget
what day today is, did you?

720
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:50,862
Today?

721
00:52:50,862 --> 00:52:53,240
Is it Valentine's Day? No, it's not.

722
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,999
No way.

00:52:56,118 --> 00:52:58,078
Is it Cake Day?

724
00:52:58,078 --> 00:53:00,997
It's your mother's birthday today.

725
00:53:00,997 --> 00:53:04,084
You're right! What time is it now?

00:53:04,084 --> 00:53:06,753
Come on, Hong.

727
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:08,130
Didn't you forget last year as well?

728
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,274
But lunar birthdays are so confusing.

729
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:12,901
I forgot to get her something.

730
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:14,469
Let's just go.

731
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:16,520
What? Okay.

732
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:19,933
Min Jun.

733
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:22,227
Can we tell her that this is from me?

734
00:53:22,227 --> 00:53:23,937
Please?

735
00:53:23,937 --> 00:53:27,399
Don't give me that look.
You can't win me over that easily.

736
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:30,085
Please, Min Jun. Can we?

737
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:33,512
Just this once. Please.

738
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,803
Did Jun say he'll be here by 7 p.m.?

739
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,054
Yes, he did.

740
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:42,681
I told you he would be.

741
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:44,933
Why do you have to keep checking?

742
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:48,311
You should've picked him up yourself.

743
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:50,271
What's with the attitude?

744
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:52,948
I just want to make sure there's enough food.

745
00:53:53,858 --> 00:53:57,654
If I ever get a boyfriend,
I'm never going to tell you.

746
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:00,122
Sure. Don't bother.

747
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:02,917
That must be them.

748
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:05,829
Hello, my brother-in-law-to-be.

749
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:07,956
Hey. How have you been?

750
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,667
"Brother-in-law"? That's so weird.

751
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:13,834
Hey, let her be.
She's just practicing. Right?

752
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,213
Hello, Jun.

753
00:54:15,213 --> 00:54:16,256
Come on in.

754
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:19,050
Happy birthday, Mother.

755
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,345
Thanks, Min Jun. You must be hungry.

756
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:25,682
This makes me so happy.

757
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:28,810
This is such a lovely cake!

758
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,730
Didn't you hate birthdays
because it made you feel old?

759
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,794
What's gotten into you?

760
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:35,150
I'm celebrating with my future son-in-law.

761
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:39,154
You have no idea how happy I am.

762
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:42,615
Just wait until you meet yours later.
You'll know exactly how I feel.

763
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:44,617
Can you stop getting ahead of yourself?

764
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:46,286
Why are you and Rock being so weird?

765
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:50,040
No, you're being weird.
We're basically a family now.

766
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,715
That's right.

767
00:54:52,834 --> 00:54:54,085
I'm so sorry.

768
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:56,004
I had to take this call.

769
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,131
So, what did I miss?

770
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:01,968
Don't worry.
You didn't miss anything important.

771
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:03,303
By the way, Hong.

772
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:06,514
- Can I ask you for a favor?
- A favor?

773
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:08,641
Can you go to the airport for me tomorrow?

774
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:11,394
- What?
- I need a replacement interpreter

775
00:55:11,394 --> 00:55:14,773
because Ms. Miyazawa had
something urgent come up at home.

776
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,866
You want me to interpret?

777
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,320
Come on, Dad. I can't.

778
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,823
It's been years since I last spoke Japanese.

779
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:25,492
Why can't you go instead?

780
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,324
You're good at Japanese, too.

781
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,872
Dad's going to Busan for work tomorrow.

782
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:33,541
I just need you to cover for tomorrow.

783
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:36,419
I already made plans
with Min Jun tomorrow.

784
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:38,838
Don't worry. You should go.

785
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:40,890
He needs your help.

786
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:43,726
Okay?

787
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:48,598
That's my son-in-law.

788
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:50,433
- Help yourselves.
- Thank you.

789
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:53,068
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Mom.

790
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,025
I'm sorry.

791
00:55:59,025 --> 00:56:02,112
We'll have to check
on the venues next week.

792
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:03,530
It's okay. I understand.

793
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,367
I'll look for a few more places
for us to check out next week.

794
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,001
Okay.

795
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,139
Min Jun.

796
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:18,712
Yes?

797
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:20,880
Thank you.

798
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,714
Oh, come on.
I told you not to say that.

799
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,772
Whenever you say that,

800
00:56:25,772 --> 00:56:28,324
you sound so distant.

801
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,565
Good night.

802
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:35,861
Go inside. It's cold.

803
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:55,540
You're a lifesaver, Ms. Choi.

804
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,209
I didn't realize you knew Japanese.

805
00:56:58,209 --> 00:56:59,753
Did you study there?

806
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:03,806
No, I lived there for a bit when I was little.

807
00:57:04,674 --> 00:57:08,261
I took classes for a year
and got pretty good grades,

808
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:10,472
but I get nervous when it really matters.

809
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:12,356
I still get stage fright.

810
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,187
He'll be here soon. Shall we?

811
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:18,904
Right, of course.

812
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:32,001
[WELCOME, MR. SASAE HIKARI]

813
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:34,829
I didn't expect him to be so late.

814
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:36,589
Where is he?

815
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:43,095
Yes, Mr. Park.

816
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,549
I'm at the airport.

817
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:49,351
- Excuse me, Ms. Choi.
- Sure.

818
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,035
Time stood still...

819
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:58,421
like a neatly folded piece of paper.

820
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:05,845
If I knew that I was going to meet Jungo...

821
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,057
I would have never come.
