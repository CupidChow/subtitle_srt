86
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:22,004
That's a difficult question.

87
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:29,762
I mean, it must exist somewhere, right?

88
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,100

00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,674
they sound so similar.

00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,509
Isn't that amazing?

111
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,020
Can you believe they're
actually two different languages?

00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,274
Beni?

114
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,487
The letter for "Hong"

115
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,163
Beni...

116
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,997
"Yun-o."

117
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,000
- Yun-o?
- Right.

118
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,136
That's how we say "Jungo" in Korean.

119
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,297
Yun-o...

120
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,966
Yes, Yun-o.

Yes. Go ahead and try some.

154
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,305
Thank you for the food.

155
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,734
It's so good!

156
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,772
We usually get this delivered
when we move to a new house in Korea,

157
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,192
and we give rice cakes as gifts
to the neighbors.

158
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,735
Really?

159
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,988
We apparently used
to give buckwheat noodles in Japan.

160
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,282
I don't think we really do that anymore, though.

161
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,242
- Really?
- Yes.

162
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,876
Why the noodles?

163
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,541
I think the noodles symbolized their wish
to be good neighbors for a long time.

164
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,167
Oh, right!

165
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,919
In that case,

166
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,007
I hope we can stay together for a long time.

167
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,425
Okay, my turn.

168
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,895
I hope we can be together
for a long, long time, too.

169
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,065
Don't move.

170
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,740
Ta-da!

171
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,246

173
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,416
I'm so happy.

175
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,468
Wake up, Yun-o.

176
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,227
You're late.

177
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,765
I'm sleepy.

178
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,441
I'm so sleepy.

179
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,320
No, you need to get up now.

180
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,756
You really need to get up now.

181
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:17,141
You'll be late for class.

182
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,494

from time to time.

I don't think we can express
all our feelings by just speaking.

about the way you write.

who lives overseas.

364
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,729
I'll stay right next to you.

365
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,654
Let's wait here.

366
00:36:05,315 --> 00:36:08,568
It's really pouring it down.

367
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:10,536
It really is.

368
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:20,171
- Beni.
- Yes?

369
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,144
Yun-o.

370
00:36:42,144 --> 00:36:43,979
Yes?

371
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:46,231
Can I ask you a favor?

372
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,442
So suddenly?

373
00:36:48,442 --> 00:36:52,070
Can we stay the night here?

374
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,372
- In Kyoto?
- Yes.

375
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:57,625
There's someone I'd like to meet.

376
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,937
Good evening.

377
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:27,522
Sorry for coming so late.

378
00:37:27,522 --> 00:37:29,483
No, thanks for coming.

379
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,276
But this is so unfortunate.

380
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:35,405
I'm so sorry to tell you this,
but the studio is closed for the day.

381
00:37:35,405 --> 00:37:37,206
My apologies.

382
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,367
I am...

383
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:42,378
Choi Han's daughter, Choi Hong.

384
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:00,931
Kyoto is famous for its cuisine,

385
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:04,442
but I'm not exactly a good cook.

386
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:08,021
I don't know if it'll be to your taste,

387
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:10,565
but please help yourselves and dig in.

388
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:12,025
No, this looks wonderful.

389
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:15,411
Thank you so much for treating us so well.

390
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,578
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

391
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:25,414
I haven't even asked who your friend was.

392
00:38:25,414 --> 00:38:26,832
This is my boyfriend.

393
00:38:26,832 --> 00:38:28,549
My goodness.

394
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,594
You look so good together.

395
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:36,224
We're sorry to just barge in like this.

396
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:40,470
My father gave me your address

397
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,140
before I left to come to Japan.

398
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,935
He told me to pay you a visit
if I'm ever in Kyoto.

399
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:49,570
I see.

400
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:53,024
Your father and I

401
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,944
studied at Doshisha University together.

402
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:59,030
He was an international student
who even managed to become

403
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,241
the editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper.

404
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:05,871
There was no one I respected more
than anyone else in this world.

405
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:08,749
Please, don't let me stop you from digging in.

406
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:09,791
I'm so sorry.

407
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:13,462
I didn't realize I was rambling on for so long.

408
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:14,796
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

409
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:16,430
Here you go.

410
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:23,437
Where are you staying tonight?

411
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:28,018
We're going to look for a place that's nearby.

412
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:31,897
It won't be easy to find one at this hour.

413
00:39:31,897 --> 00:39:35,575
Most places only take reservations these days.

414
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:38,820
You know what?

415
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,155
You should stay here tonight.

416
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:42,908
It's nothing special, but you're welcome to stay.

417
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:45,410
- That won't be--
- Really? Thank you very much!

418
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,796
I've always wanted to stay
at a place like this.

419
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:55,553
Go on. Your food's getting cold.

420
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:13,988
Yun-o, are you asleep?

421
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:22,914
You're so cute when you're upset.

422
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:26,042
I can't stop looking at you.

423
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:49,065
Yun-o.

424
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,360
Are you mad?

425
00:40:55,814 --> 00:40:57,274
What is it?

426
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:00,451
Is it because I wanted
to spend the night here?

427
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:04,531
Yeah.

428
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:06,867
Why?

429
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:10,579
Isn't it nice? We even got to stay for free.

430
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:15,007
Ms. Shizuko offered
to put us up for the night, too.

431
00:41:17,669 --> 00:41:22,056
I think she was just being polite.

432
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:26,720
She was probably surprised
when you took up her offer.

433
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,638
Actually,

434
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,983
she might have even thought
that we were being rude.

435
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:41,784
I'm going back to my side.

436
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:45,037
Don't go.

437
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:56,465
I've been curious

438
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:59,719
about her for so long.

439
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:04,307
I wanted to see what she was like.

440
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,603
Why?

441
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:13,391
Ms. Shizuko was

442
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:16,027
my dad's first love.

443
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,648
Really?

444
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:21,282
Yes.

445
00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:27,288
But, in the end...

446
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:33,252
they had to break up
because my grandfather disapproved.

447
00:42:34,621 --> 00:42:38,633
That's how he met my mom and got married.

448
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:45,389
My mom still sometimes thinks...

449
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:50,061
that he misses being with Ms. Shizuko.

450
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:58,736
She believes that a man
never gets over their first love.

451
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:05,576
Isn't that funny?

452
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,844
What do you think?

453
00:43:24,796 --> 00:43:27,048
Do you think

454
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:29,767
someday, after a while...

455
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:33,729
we'll also end up drifting apart?

456
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:38,442
No.

457
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,407
We're different.

458
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:49,245
There's no way that we'll ever break up.

459
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:54,500
Even if time passes...

460
00:43:55,827 --> 00:43:58,254
the seasons change...

461
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:04,302
and we find ourselves
in a whole new world,

462
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:10,766
we will never be able
to let each other go.

463
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:33,706
<i>Kyoto was...</i>

464
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:42,632
just a place that I chose.

465
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,837
He says that there was no real reason.

466
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:48,505
I see.

467
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,813
My next question is

468
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:55,293
what I was most curious about
after reading the novel myself.

469
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:59,388
Do you still have feelings for that person?

470
00:45:01,685 --> 00:45:04,771
And I'd also like to ask
if you also believe

471
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:07,983
that everlasting love exists in this world,

472
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:10,117
just like the male protagonist.

473
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:18,834
Ms. Choi?

474
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:23,965
"Do you...

475
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,887
still have feelings for that person?"

476
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:42,024
I'm regretting it.

477
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:47,780
For the past five years...

478
00:45:52,235 --> 00:45:55,037
I've never once forgotten about her.

479
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,793
I'm sorry, but could we just take a short break?

480
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:24,942
<i>For the past five years,</i>

481
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:28,696
I've never once forgotten about her.

482
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,741
- Thank you so much for today.
- Thank you.

483
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:41,284
Thank you.

484
00:46:41,284 --> 00:46:44,287
Thank you for today, Mr. Sasae.

485
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:47,666
"Thank you for today, Mr. Sasae."

486
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,418
Thank you.

487
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:52,254
I look forward to tomorrow.

488
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:55,932
A professional interpreter will assist you tomorrow.

489
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:58,093
Mr. Sasae,

490
00:46:58,093 --> 00:47:01,012
it was an honor to meet you.

491
00:47:01,012 --> 00:47:04,190
I hope the rest of your visit also goes well.

492
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:11,857
After you, Mr. Sasae.

493
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:14,700
Yes. Thank you.

494
00:47:57,819 --> 00:47:59,529
<i>That day,</i>

495
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:02,699
<i>she shouted at me with a look</i>

496
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:04,876
<i>that I'd never seen before.</i>

497
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:07,295
<i>That day,</i>

498
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:10,582
<i>a scar was left on my heart.</i>

499
00:48:10,582 --> 00:48:13,509
<i>The scar on my heart read regret.</i>

500
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:16,880
<i>Jungo,</i>

501
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,558
I think you and I should break up.

502
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:36,434
<i>If only I had said something in that moment,</i>

503
00:48:36,434 --> 00:48:39,862
<i>would we still be together?</i>
