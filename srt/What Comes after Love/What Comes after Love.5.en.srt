It wasn't a real answer,

79
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,139
but I stopped asking.

80
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:47,105

- I told you just now. Period.

00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,291
I was waiting for you.

369
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,918
Today...

370
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,711
One of our star writers

371
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,971
suddenly passed away.

372
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:00,787
Sure.

373
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,555
There's always a reason with you, Jungo.

374
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:09,650
And those reasons are more important than me to you.

375
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,980
I actually knew him personally.

376
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,065
I even had drinks at his house once.

377
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:18,986
You could have given me a call, at least.

378
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,030
I couldn't help it. It was so hectic today.

379
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,659
We wouldn't stop getting calls from the press.

380
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,662
Everyone else went to the funeral.

381
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:30,414
I was all by myself at the office.

382
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:33,083
That doesn't mean you can't call me.

383
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,717
Beni...

384
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:37,462
It's not like I was out having fun.

385
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,632
Can't you just say that you're sorry?

386
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,425
Is it so hard to apologize?

387
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,846
Do you even know how I feel right now?

388
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,681
Can't you give me some attention, too?

389
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,941
Why does it always have to be about you?

390
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,936
You could have just apologized.

391
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:56,081
No one will get mad at you for saying it.

392
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,910
Why is it so hard for you to say that?

393
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,819
- Beni...
- What?

394
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:03,787
Am I wrong?

395
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,207
You know it's true.

396
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:10,044
You don't even care about me anymore.

397
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:13,040
How I'm doing these days

398
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,049
or what's been bothering me.

399
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,001
You have no idea, Jungo.

400
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,797
I only just got back from work.

401
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,717
That doesn't mean you can break our promise!

402
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:28,055
Don't you remember we promised
to talk over dinner tonight?

403
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,223
What's the point of making promises?

404
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,682
You might as well do nothing but work.

405
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,020
Why make promises you can't keep?

406
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,105
Why am I the only one who gets worried?

407
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,857
Why do I always have to wait?

408
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,652
This isn't easy for me, either!

409
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,695
Do you think I like living like this?

410
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,948
We see each other at home, anyway.

411
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:47,366
When you're busy,

412
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,194
promises can't always be kept.

413
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:52,279
Why can't you be a bit more understanding?

414
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,054
So...

415
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,597
Are you saying...

416
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,178
that it's all my fault?

417
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,180
Come on. That's not what I--

418
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,682
Please!

419
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:14,484
Can you please just say you're sorry?

420
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,437
Do you know why this is so hard for me?

421
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,732
You always turn me into a bad person
when I deserve an apology.

422
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,360
It's your fault, Jungo!

423
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,989
You were the one
who neglected me and left me alone.

424
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:30,701
How many times do I need to tell you
not to leave me by myself?

425
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:34,337
I'm in a foreign country,
and I'm all alone without you.

426
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,009
Why do you leave me by myself
and make me feel lonely?

427
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,380
Do you know

428
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:15,746
what I heard today?

429
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,264
Did something happen back home?

430
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,232
You know what?

431
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:45,575
Jungo.

432
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,279
I think

433
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,245
you and I should break up.

434
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:56,711
- Beni...
- I can't...

435
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:01,048
take it anymore.

436
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,387
I can't...

437
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,392
live like this anymore.

438
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,512
If you failed to understand her loneliness...

439
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:53,263
doesn't that mean
that your love for has changed?

440
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,773
No.

441
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,696
My love has never changed.

442
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,908
I'm sorry, but you'll have to excuse me.

443
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:18,619
I have to be somewhere.

444
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,035
You're leaving already?

445
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,331
I'm already late for it.

446
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,708
I'm sorry.

447
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,876
Mr. Sasae.

448
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:29,395
I look forward to working with you
at Sodam Books.

449
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:27,271
Hey.

450
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,815
Sorry. Did you have to wait long?

451
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:33,652
My dad was insisting
that I stop by the get-together.

452
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:36,196
Don't worry about it. Did you eat?

453
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,154
No.

454
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,448
What should we get?

455
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,120
How about some shrimp? It's your favorite.

456
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,413
Or scallops?

457
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:45,747
Sure.

458
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:48,257
I'm good with anything you like.

459
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,920
Did something happen at work?

460
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,132
No. I'm just not craving anything.

461
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,598
Okay, then.

462
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:59,490
I'll just order what looks good.

463
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,124
Okay.

464
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,561
This is nice.

465
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,689
It's nice to get out once in a while.

466
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,524
You must be tired these days.

467
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:15,860
Especially with work and the wedding preparations.

468
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,445
I wasn't that busy.

469
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:21,457
And even if I was, it's nowhere as bad as resident doctors.

470
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,297
Listen.

471
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,459
I have some good news.

472
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,628
Good news?

473
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:36,131
I got accepted.

474
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,842
The training program in the states.

475
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:40,559
Seriously?

476
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,650
Yes.

477
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,056
Hong.

478
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,018
Will you come with me to a new place

479
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,444
and start a new life together?

480
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,548
It's a little late, but this is my proposal.

481
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,003
I'm sorry I haven't done it sooner.

482
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,346
And for making excuses for being shy.

483
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,733
Will you marry me?

484
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,411
- Min Jun...
- Hong.

485
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,041
You're all that I need.

486
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,670
I promise you.

487
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:53,799
I'll never make you feel lonely.

488
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,089
Wherever we are,

489
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,217
and whenever it may be,

490
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,143
I promise.

491
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,565
I'll never leave you by yourself.

492
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,200
Are you...

493
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:29,710
Here.

494
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:33,380
Don't cry, Hong. Why...

495
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,719
I didn't think it would be that moving.

496
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,180
I'm sorry.

497
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,061
Min Jun...

498
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,777
I don't know what's wrong with me.

499
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:59,114
I don't mean to be like this.

500
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,498
I'm really sorry.

501
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,296
But I'm not so sure.

502
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:22,012
I was sure that I got over it.

503
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,777
Is that why...

504
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,031
you went to the signing event today?

505
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,246
I was there, too.

506
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,336
Because I was anxious.

507
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,604
If...

508
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:16,226
I told you how I felt about you

509
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,153
before you went to Japan...

510
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:25,743
Would things be different for us now?

511
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,750
Min Jun.

512
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:38,130
Even if we were dating...

513
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:43,294
before I met him,

514
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:46,172
or even if we were married

515
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:49,058
with three children...

516
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:53,221
My heart would drop

517
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:56,448
the moment I see him, just like it did now.

518
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,022
When he leaves,

519
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,989
and you leave me,

520
00:42:04,774 --> 00:42:07,368
I'll be all by myself again.

521
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:15,334
But I can't lie to you
just because I'm scared of being lonely.

522
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,582
Because I genuinely like you.

523
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,716
Because you like me?

524
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,282
Because you genuinely like me?

525
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,744
I didn't know that word...

526
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:57,418
could sound so cruel.

527
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,802
I'm sorry, Min Jun. I have to go.

528
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:40,211
I don't know why I suddenly started to cry.

529
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:44,174
The moment Min Jun proposed...

530
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:50,263
I suddenly thought that I had to fend for myself.

531
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:54,384
Actually, it wasn't just a thought.

532
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:56,685
It was more of a realization.

533
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:01,433
And all of a sudden,

534
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:04,527
I was reminded of the look on Jungo's face.

535
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:09,691
Our love was beautiful

536
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:12,743
because we were reckless and naive.

537
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,660
Our love had come to an end

538
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,875
without a moment to say goodbye.

539
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,049
And his face was grimaced in pain

540
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,885
because of our love.

541
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:55,779
[MR. YOON]

542
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,530
Hi, Ms. Choi.

543
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,532
Mr. Yoon.

544
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:01,159
Are you still having dinner?

545
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:05,830
No, Mr. Sasae seemed tired,
so we wrapped up earlier than we expected.

546
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,793
- I just drove him to his hotel.
- I see.

547
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,295
Thank you for your hard work today.

548
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:13,713
Have a good night.

549
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:16,599
Yes, Ms. Choi. Have a good night.

550
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,063
Excuse me.

551
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,444
Can you tell me which room
Mr. Sasae Hikari is staying in?

552
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:19,112
I'm sorry, ma'am.

553
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:22,115
We can't disclose the room numbers of our guests.

554
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,242
Right. Of course.

555
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:26,710
I'm sorry, ma'am.

556
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,798
Excuse me, ma'am.

557
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:34,294
I can't tell you his room number,

558
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:39,382
but I think he went to the bar
on the first floor earlier.

559
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:41,267
Thank you.
