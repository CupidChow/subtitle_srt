00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:29,928
How did it go, Hong?

4
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,390
Fine. I just got off.

5
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,311
Sounds like you had a tough day.

6
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:41,307
I guess I did.

7
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,818
Must be because I haven't interpreted for so long.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,854
You're off tomorrow, right?

9
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:50,566
I'll be getting off work soon.
Do you want to go for a drink?

10
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:53,611
Sure. I'll call you back later.

11
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,245
Okay.

No.

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,293

19
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,257
Don't worry.

20
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,553
It was nothing.

21
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:56,974
Are you sure?

22
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,685
Yes.

23
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:04,064
I'll call you back.

24
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,523
Why aren't you saying anything?

25
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,361
Just go ahead and say it.

00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:42,287
If I ever ran into you,

27
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,542
I wanted to ask you something.

28
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,370
I wanted to know what you'd say.

29
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,247
But...

30
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:54,584
I don't think I need to ask anymore.

31
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:57,070

36
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:20,260
I don't know where to begin.

37
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,311
There was so much...

38
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,622
I wanted to tell you.

39
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,669
I know...

40
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:36,091
that we've spent too much time
away from each other...

41
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,465
and that there's a huge wall between us.

42
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,516
Whatever I have to say...

43
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:50,397
won't be enough to reach you.

44
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,904
I also know running into you like this...

45
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:01,408
will be the last chance I'll ever get.

46
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,571
That's why I don't want to let it go.

47
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,706
That, I can assure you.

48
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:13,295
I really mean it.

So, please.

57
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,286
Don't say anything.

58
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:02,738
I thought I'd be able to move on.

59
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,994
Actually...

60
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:13,116
I knew I wouldn't be able to.

61
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:17,662
But I really didn't expect that you would last

62
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,588

63
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:26,929

Look how gorgeous these are.

68

Hong doesn't have the figure
for a mermaid dress.

69
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:07,128
Maybe a princess dress
would fit her better.

70
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:09,589
An open-shouldered one
wouldn't be bad, either.

71
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,550
I should go and pick one for her.

72

00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,847

All that stress you've been feeling?

76
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,646
It's all because you need more affection.

183
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,393
Let's go.

184
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:39,833
That was great. Thank you.

185
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,852
You have about an hour
before the next interview.

186
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,487
Would you like me to get you some coffee?

187
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:48,316
Yes, please. Thank you.

188
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,736
- By the way...
- Yes? What is it?

189
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:56,532
Will the lady from yesterday
be joining us today?

190
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,917
Do you mean Ms. Choi Hong?

191
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:02,129
Do you need to talk to her?

192
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:07,335
No. Don't worry about it.

193
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:11,589
Actually, is there a number
where I can reach her?

194
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,050
Her number?

195
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,684
Yes.

196
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,747
I'm sorry.

197
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,393
I don't think I'm allowed
to give you her number.

198
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:26,087
Right, of course.

199
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,731
Do you know where she lives?

200
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,400
I think...

201
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,152
she lived in a district called Bundang.

202
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:36,681
- Bundang?
- Yes.

203
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:42,245
I heard she lived near a lake in the area.

204
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:45,130
That's as far as I am aware.

205
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,050
I see.

206
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,717
A lake...

207
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:02,523
Jungo!

208
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,496
What's up with him?

209
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:21,250
I heard he got dumped.

210
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:26,664
What are you looking at me for?
I broke up with him ages ago.

211
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:27,790
Right?

212
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,736
I thought you two got back together or something.

213
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,547
Some people get back together
after breaking up.

214
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,758
He must be doing well for himself.

215
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:39,302
That must be why he's got no time to write.

216
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:44,974
Here I am, writing every day,
and I barely get anything done.

217
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:47,685
But he's out getting girls all the time.

218
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:50,647
- No wonder he's got no time to write.
- Right.

219
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:54,651
Oh, well. What's the point of writing, anyway?

220
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:57,077
Why can't I be more like him?

221
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,919
Can I have one?

222
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,516
I do feel a bit upset.

223
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:47,495
You didn't have such a hard time
when we broke up.

224
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:49,289
I haven't broken up yet.

225
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,799
Is that how she sees it, too?

226
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:57,463
If you really miss her that much,
shouldn't you try to get her back?

227
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,881
You should do whatever it--

228
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,884
You don't know what you're talking about.

229
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,137
I know enough.

230
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:08,057
I know you probably haven't said anything
or even sent her a message

231
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:11,193
when you obviously miss her so much.

232
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:21,245
Jungo.

233
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:26,458
If you're having such a hard time...

234
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,922
why don't we get back together?

235
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:43,551
I thought you were busy.

236
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:46,095
You're the star of our publishing house.

237
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,389
I felt bad having you here all by yourself.

238
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:52,852
And the project in Korea
was pretty important for the company, too.

239
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:57,065
Everyone's taking really good care of me here.

240
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:59,216
You've got nothing to worry about.

241
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,693
I know, but still.

242
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:05,615
I thought you'd be really excited
if I came to surprise you like this.

243
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:08,709
Could you at least act like
you're happy to see me?

244
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,170
I am happy.

245
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:15,704
I'm leaving on Tuesday for Fukuoka anyway.

246
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:17,922
I'm meeting Mr. Kudo.

247
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,972
So, I'll keep you company until then.

248
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,510
Thanks.

249
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,389
- Send Mr. Kudo my regards.
- Sure.

250
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:33,650
Let's go get some dinner
when you're done with the interview.

251
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,647
Hello. You must be Ms. Kobayashi.

252
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,274
- Yes.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

253
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:43,194
- I'm Lee Min Jae from Sodam Books.
- Pleased to meet you.

254
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:46,805
We've only met in online meetings before.

255
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,517
It's great to finally meet you in person.

256
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,619
Likewise, Ms. Kobayashi.

257
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:54,539
I heard that you've been
taking great care of Mr. Sasae.

258
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,957
Thank you for your assistance.

259
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:58,801
I should be the one thanking you two.

260
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:03,031
Mr. Sasae is a very special person to me.

261
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:06,208
Please keep taking good care of him.

262
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:14,566
This should be better than something thick, right?

263
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:17,778
What?

264
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:21,198
Right.

265
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,403
Let's go with this one, then.

266
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:28,781
Okay. And what about your tie?
Did you have anything in mind?

267
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:32,035
I think you'd look better
in a bow tie than a standard one.

268
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:34,503
Which one should I go with?

269
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,174
- Hey.
- What?

270
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,920
Right.

271
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,757
- I think they're both nice.
- Me too.

272
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:49,719
It's hard to pick something
when he looks good in anything, right?

273
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:53,063
Why do you have to be so good-looking?

274
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,309
Let's go with the bow tie, then.

275
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,938
Do you want to try the second shirt on again?

276
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:02,489
- Sure.
- Great. This way, please.

277
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:13,993
What's going on?
You know this is your wedding, right?

278
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:17,830
Just tell them if you don't like the suit.

279
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,000
- It's not that.
- What is it then? Is it Min Jun?

280
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,126
Hey!

281
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:24,963
How could you say something like that?

282
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:26,965
What?

283
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:30,134
Why are you so angry?

284
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:31,511
Honestly!

285
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,938
Are you ready to try on the dresses?

286
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,254
What's taking you so long? You don't like it?

287
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,151
Can't you at least show us what it looks like?

288
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:48,673
Do you think she fainted because it looked so good?

289
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:51,473
Do I have to put a stop to this wedding?

290
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,978
What are you talking about?

291
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,327
It's just the cheesy comments.

292
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:59,880
I don't know if she can put up with it
for the rest of her life.

293
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,718
- Are you jealous?
- Excuse me?

294
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:14,518
Could you turn toward the mirror?

295
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:18,041
Does it feel uncomfortable?

296
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,009
Well...

297
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,604
Is it supposed to feel like this?

298
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:27,442
It's not exactly your everyday dress.
Most people find it awkward at first.

299
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:29,736
It looks so good, though!

300
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:33,364
It's not easy to pull this one off,
but it looks like it was made for you.

301
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:35,874
You look absolutely stunning!

302
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,002
I'll wait for you outside.

303
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,795
Remember to give her a big smile, okay?

304
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:50,431
Oh, of course.

305
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:04,862
I'm regretting it.

306
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,906
For the past five years...

307
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:15,064
I've never once forgotten about her.

308
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:39,605
It's so pretty.

309
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,298
It's hard trying on dresses, isn't it?

310
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,569
- You must be exhausted.
- No. It was fun.

311
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,720
But the dresses weren't my style. That's all.

312
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,568
It's okay. I didn't like this place either.

313
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:41,284
I'll call a few more places.

314
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:44,711
Let's call it a day and get something good.

315
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,334
We haven't had tripe in a while.
It's your favorite, isn't it?

316
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:51,527
- Tripe?
- Oh, right.

317
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,797
We'll just have to go without you
since you can't handle it.

318
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:58,243
I feel like having a girl's night out tonight.

319
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,919
Is that all right?

320
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:02,930
Well, sure.

321
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,850
You two can go and enjoy yourselves tonight.

322
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,976
Thank you.

323
00:27:06,976 --> 00:27:09,945
- Let me borrow her just for today.
- Okay.

324
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,907
- It's okay. Go.
- Come on.

325
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,703
- See you!
- See you.

326
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,623
This is so good.

327
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:32,835
Don't you think the open-shouldered
one was much better?

328
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:36,631
- It was so pretty.
- My arms are so flabby, though...

329
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:39,050
I'm going on a diet starting tomorrow.

330
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,261
What a joke. You're basically just skin and bones.

331
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,721
Hong.

332
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:45,807
Are you having second thoughts?

333
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,500
- About what?
- The wedding.

334
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,395
I mean, he's handsome, has a great job,

335
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,397
and was like a son when your dad got sick.

336
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:54,124
You got yourself a keeper,

337
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:57,135
but you looked so upset
whenever you tried on a new dress.

338
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,228
It felt like I was at a funeral!

339
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:02,323
Just break it off.

340
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:03,491
What's he got to lose?

341
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:07,419
I bet there's a line of girls
who would die to marry him.

342
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,458
What's with the long face?

343
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,384
I feel bad now.

344
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:30,692
What's with the look?

345
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:38,033
What's wrong, Hong?

346
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,115
Ji Hui.

347
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:45,749
What is it?

348
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:50,295
He's here.

349
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:53,958
He's in Seoul.

350
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:57,052
Who are you talking about?

351
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:00,389
Jungo...

352
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:16,254
Jungo was always on the move.

353
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,108
I've never seen him just sitting around.

354
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:21,452
Not even once.

355
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:26,950
Are you okay?

356
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,584
I'm okay.

357
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:37,877
But even when he was busy,

358
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:41,381
I always wanted to be by his side.

359

I wanted to know everything about him

360
00:29:44,008 --> 00:29:46,177

It's fine.

since we walked home together.

Back then,

I didn't know what it meant.

I simply thought
that was normal for people in love.

how to express my feelings.

536
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:47,233
- We were just meant to be.
- How can you have this without me?

537
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,494
I've still got some left over. See?

538
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,282
Here you go.

539
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:57,626
- Can we get another bottle of soju?
- Sure thing.

540
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,166
Pour me a glass.

541
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,842
Yes, ma'am.

542
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:15,220
It's so nice to get dinner
with just the two of us.

543
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,772
When did we last go on a date like this?

544
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,275
Yun Oh.

545
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:29,025
- "Yun Oh"?
- Doesn't it sound nice?

546
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:34,698
Apparently, that's how your name is
pronounced in Korean.

547
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,583
Your interpreter told me.

548
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:48,795
So, what are you bothered about now?

549
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,088
What do you mean?

550
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:54,266
Well, you seem bothered
by something I don't know about.

551
00:43:56,678 --> 00:44:01,182
But you always know
what I'm thinking about.

552
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:03,526
No, I don't.

553
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:08,030
You're the only one, Jungo...

554
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:12,201
who I could never get a read on.

555
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:22,044
That might be why I feel like I do.

556
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,549
You already know, don't you?

557
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,543
About what?

558
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:33,097
The fact that I'm not just here for work.

559
00:44:34,924 --> 00:44:36,851
The thing is...

560
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,263
I'm actually here

561
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,481
to take you back, Jungo.

562
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,727
I've been waiting

563
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:49,238
for you to fall back in love with me.

564
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:54,994
I've been waiting for five years.

565
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,718
Wait...

566
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,807
Did you...

567
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:22,062
meet her?

568
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:46,830
What is it?

569
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,041
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

570
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,510
Looking at me makes me feel safe.

571
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:55,805
When I look at you...

572
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,063
it's like I'm looking at a lake.

573
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:06,941
A lake?

574
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:12,647
So...

575
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:16,659
How long have I looked like a lake to you?

576
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:22,373
We were just friends, right?

577
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,460
Let's see.

578
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,047
The day you arrived at the airport.

579
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,764
Hong!

580
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:43,428
Welcome back.

581
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:46,814
That's when I thought
I should muster up the courage.

582
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,191
Seriously?

583
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,155
But I looked terrible that day.

584
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,408
I know, right?

585
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:00,411
But, you know what?

586
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:05,950
I must've really missed you
while you were in Japan.

587
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,162
You have no idea how happy I was

588
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:13,215
knowing that you were back home.

589
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:21,716
- Min Jun...
- Yes?

590
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:23,767
I...

591
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:28,022
I might be much worse than you think.

592
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,691
Is that so?

593
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,284
I can't wait to see.

594
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,165
Thank you.

595
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:52,372
The thing is...

596
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:55,257
- I actually have--
- Here.

597
00:47:57,335 --> 00:48:00,763
Eat some food before it gets cold.

598
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,011
Just enjoy the food and drink.

599
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,020
I'd like that for now.

600
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:11,106
One day,

601
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:15,395
you might have a change of heart,

602
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:19,740
and you might even forget
what you were going to say.

603
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,953
They say that feelings change.

604
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:29,458
We constantly change as we live.

605
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,219
You must be exhausted. Get some rest.

606
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,638
What about you, Kanna?

607
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:46,968
I don't think I can sleep like this.

608
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:49,721
I might grab a drink at the bar first.

609
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,181
All right.

610
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:53,099
Well, I'll see you tomorrow then.

611
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,900
Jungo.

612
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,605
Yes?

613
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:03,276
When I see people clinging
to their memories,

614
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:05,744
it makes me feel sad.

615
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:10,207
Sleep tight.

616
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:29,427
Thanks.

617
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:33,682
- Get home safely.
- I will.

618
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:36,601
I know it's a hassle,
but take a warm shower before bed.

619
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:39,145
I don't want you to catch a cold.

620
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:42,232
Okay. I will.

621
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:44,992
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
