(Based on a true story but details have been modified)

3
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:28,901
On the morning of the 23rd,

4
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:32,613
Wind Chill Advisories are in effect for midland and southern inland areas.

5
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:36,283
Today will be our third day in a row with at freezing temperatures.

6
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:39,120
According to the National
Weather Service, Seoul

7
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:41,413
started off the morning
at -14.5 degrees.

8
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:49,046
Hey, Jang-sup!

9
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:52,258
Chief MA's here! I told you to hurry just in case he came!

10
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,717
And this time, it's the real deal...

11
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,219
- What's this?
- Hey!

12
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:56,846
Come on. This one's for sure.
So pay up first

13
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:58,097
Shit, money first!
Now!

14
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:03,018
That social worker discovered the body.

15
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:06,480
And JEONG Myung-sook
has no family or friends.

16
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:08,149
Hey, hurry and wrap things up!

17
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,692
Hey, Chief, how's it going?

18
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,735
Hey, this is my jurisdiction.

19
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:16,198
What a die-hard. He's scouring
every JEONG Myung-sook.

20
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:17,950
Jeez.

21
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:33,799
Here.

22
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,052
It seems she's been dead
for almost a month.

23
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,972
(Basic living security recipient certificate: JEONG Myung-sook)

24
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:44,310
No sign of trespassing,
suicide pills or food...

25
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:49,273
The only one that kept in touch
with her was the social worker.

26
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,569
She stated JEONG never
interacted with neighbors...

27
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:57,907
Seems like the old lady
lived and died alone.

28
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,537
I guess it's her this time.

29
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,289
That JEONG Myung-sook.

30
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:12,421
Hey, Miss BAEK!

31
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,090
Miss BAEK!

32
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:18,385
Finish this up, will you?

33
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:53,212
You wanna mess your hands up?

34
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:54,964
Just for a few more bucks?

35
00:03:57,883 --> 00:04:01,011
- Give it to me.
- You should have gloves on.

36
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:03,222
Hey, I got it!

37
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,984
Shit, I can almost see
your panties.

38
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:22,825
Here, put it on.

39
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:25,536
What for?

40
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:29,039
With those rags, you'll freeze to death.

41
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:32,668
I always wanted to shred that
shit-colored vinyl jacket.

42
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:35,754
I've been waiting for
the right moment, but I won't.

43
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:37,298
It doesn't look cool.

44
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:39,800
Fuck cool for crying out loud...

45
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:45,139
It's badly paid, and
it's god damn frigid winter.

46
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,932
Stop that car wash job

47
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,101
before you freeze to death.

48
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:55,941
Considering all those jobs
you have,

49
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:59,069
I can't believe you won't
get yourself anything decent.

50
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:03,824
Whatcha gonna do with all that
cash? Use it as fucking wallpaper?

51
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,121
Hey, Mr. Smartass.

52
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:12,499
What the fuck?

53
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:13,917
What?

54
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:18,172
Your eyes tell me something's cooking.

55
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:27,264
Your mother was found
dead this morning.

56
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:31,477
The exact cause of death
was not known yet.

57
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,645
We need to do an autopsy,

58
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:37,191
but for now it looks like
she died of lung cancer.

59
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:46,575
She's been dead for a while.

60
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:52,998
Should we cremate her?

61
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,503
Well you're her guardian, right?

62
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:02,674
Guardian...

63
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,344
I...

64
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:09,848
just wanted to see how she died.

65
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:11,892
That's why I'm here.

66
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:14,395
Do as you please.

67
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,072
Jeez...

68
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:13,579
You need to get a new car
to catch the bad guys...

69
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:20,919
Mom, you refused me a college
education I desperately wanted.

70
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:24,631
Then made me stay home
and wash his stupid diapers.

71
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:28,552
I hope you're satisfied
from up there!

72
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:32,473
That I'm a single old maid
dealing with this kind of shit.

73
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,351
She was married once.

74
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,271
Hey, it didn't last long.

75
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:42,107
Shut up, twerp...

76
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:45,152
What's up with your hand?

77
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,946
Did you arrest a criminal again?

78
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,659
- My brother is a detective.
- Shut up.

79
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:55,329
Great detective of violent crimes section.

80
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,831
Hey, Jang-sup.

81
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:03,045
Are you still looking after
that girl?

82
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,674
You just never listen to me.

83
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,596
I may be sick of washing your
filthy undies, but how dare she!

84
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:14,932
You're the only family I've got.

85
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:17,809
A girl with no class or foundation...

86
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:19,853
Who says I'm marrying her?

87
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,105
She has no intention of
marrying me.

88
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,190
How come?

89
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:25,442
She doesn't want you?

90
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:26,735
Forget it...

91
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,821
She must be kidding,
for god's sake...

92
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:32,032
Doesn't she know you're
a detective?

93
00:08:32,074 --> 00:08:34,201
Not everyone can be one,

94
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:39,540
with a sexy face like yours, and 6 feet tall

95
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:41,458
- She doesn't deserve you.
- Shit.

96
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:45,087
She doesn't have a clue.
How dare she...

97
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,922
It tastes like shit.

98
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,341
I can't believe this sells.

99
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:52,094
- Are you coming?
- Spit it out if you think it's shit!

100
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:55,430
Guess what? This round,
I bring something big!

101
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:59,643
JEONG Myung-sook had a criminal record?

102
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,606
The old lady was suspicious, anyway..

103
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:07,442
So, I looked into her information.

104
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:10,862
She spent 6 years in a prison,
and was released in 2007.

105
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,365
Is it him?
Seochang Construction's boy.

106
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,117
Yeah, the asshole...

107
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,953
He was your first suspect, right?

108
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:21,748
JEONG Myung-sook
hit that asshole with a car,

109
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:25,794
to avenge BAEK Sang-ah's case.

110
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,465
You fucking bitch!

111
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:36,221
Chief, she's still in high school!

112
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,433
She's clearly a rape victim,
why can't she claim self-defense?

113
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:42,644
She's just a punk who lived
at an orphanage,

114
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:47,649
while his dad is a Seochang
Construction major stockholder,

115
00:09:47,774 --> 00:09:51,403
and his brother-in-law's an
Uijeongbu District court judge.

116
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:54,615
You think it'll be possible
to indict him?

117
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,460
Let's go.

118
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:11,548
There she is!

119
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,467
Protect her.

120
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:28,690
Let's get married.

121
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,365
I said, let's get married.

122
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,580
Goddamn you.

123
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:47,959
Didn't I tell you it's not in my fate
to be anyone's wife or mom?

124
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,671
Say it twice more and
it'll be the 470th time.

125
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,222
Hey, what's that?

126
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,182
Huh?

127
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:04,434
Are you really leaving for Jeju Island?

128
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,645
Without even discussing it with me?

129
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,271
I'm asking you!

130
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:10,607
What am I to you?

131
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:13,360
Don't I mean anything to you?

132
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:15,946
Jang-sup.

133
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:20,117
The more you get involved,
the worse your life will get.

134
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:22,994
I don't deserve married life.

135
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:26,331
So just go find a girl
good for you.

136
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,961
What am I supposed to do?

137
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:32,754
What should I do to
get you out of this life?

138
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,131
Why don't you stop?!

139
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:37,050
I feel suffocated by the look you give me.

140
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,387
That pathetic, apologetic
face you send at me

141
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,974
For the rest of my life?
Fuck no!

142
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:48,687
And didn't I tell you not to
look for that woman?

143
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,689
What were you expecting?

144
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,651
Shit, I'm sorry that I did,
goddamn it!

145
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:57,404
I'm fucking sorry!

146
00:12:01,616 --> 00:12:04,244
You might be a fucking bitch,

147
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:06,872
But I thought you would forgive her seeing your mom

148
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,206
died that miserably.

149
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:11,001
Fuck you! What the fuck
do you know?!

150
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:14,171
That woman

151
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:17,591
would drink herself sick
and beat me like crazy.

152
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:19,843
And even that wasn't enough
so she abandoned me.

153
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:21,344
That goddamn memory!

154
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:25,932
That held me back and messed up my life.
You were there to see it!

155
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:27,434
What, forgive her?

156
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:34,357
This is it.

157
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,527
Stop butting into my life.

158
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:40,655
I'm begging you.

159
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,326
She must've starved the kid.

160
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:11,121
- Is that her mom?
- I don't know.

161
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,123
Don't stare at them.

162
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,485
I'm sorry...

163
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:44,279
Ma'am...

164
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,741
Don't call me that.

165
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,911
Missus...

166
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,288
Hey.

167
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:58,460
Stop being an ass-kisser
and finish your meal.

168
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,052
Miss BAEK.

169
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:11,681
That's what you call me.

170
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:18,813
For fuck's sake, what am I doing?

171
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,525
I'm KIM Ji-eun.

172
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,114
Nine years old...

173
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:35,455
By the way,

174
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:40,043
how come you're barely
covered every time I see you?

175
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,753
What about your mom
and dad?

176
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,256
My dad... he's the only one in home.

177
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,554
Did your dad do that to you?

178
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,434
Whatever.

179
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:58,561
What do I care? Shit...

180
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,483
Ji-eun.

181
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,611
Why are you here at this hour?

182
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:10,490
Sis... Hi there.

183
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:13,076
I was passing by

184
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:15,370
and I was sure it was her.

185
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,580
She's yours?

186
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:20,875
Well, not quite.

187
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:27,549
She's got weak metabolism and
should watch what she eats.

188
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:32,095
But now she came out and
acts like she's starving to everyone .

189
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:34,931
Sorry for this, sis.

190
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,891
I'll pay for it.

191
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:40,895
KIM Ji-eun? Give her back her clothes.

192
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:43,523
KIM Ji-eun?

193
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:57,180
Let us pray. In hopes of being
filled with the Holy Spirit.

194
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:03,770
Oh Lord... Let us pray
Oh Lord...

195
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:07,482
Look here!

196
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,694
Her dad's an alcoholic
going through rehab.

197
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:14,322
If you just cut off
child support,

198
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:17,075
then how are we to raise
the kid?

199
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,917
No, you don't need to know who I am.

200
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,386
Hey, get it there.

201
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,812
Hey, JOO! What brings you
here at this hour?

202
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:53,444
Sis...

203
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,739
She's not my kid.

204
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,868
It's none of my business.

205
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:03,788
It's nothing like that.

206
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,542
I just don't want you to
get the wrong idea.

207
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,711
Actually,

208
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:13,923
my boyfriend had her with
his ex when he was 20.

209
00:19:14,924 --> 00:19:17,385
I just took her under my wing.

210
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:22,891
I didn't even know he had a kid.

211
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,269
I thought he would wake up
and get a job, right?

212
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:29,105
But when this kept on for years.

213
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:33,276
I couldn't take it anymore and
thought of leaving, but...

214
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:38,156
we just physically grew on
each other

215
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:43,244
Sometimes you feel like
leaving your own kid.

216
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:46,289
So how do you think
it feels

217
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:50,168
raising someone else's kid,

218
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:53,463
right?

219
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:22,450
Joy!

220
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,287
Did you eat, huh?

221
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:27,872
How've you been?

222
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:34,003
This is why a dog's better
than a human being.

223
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,216
KIM Il-gon.

224
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:41,844
The state cut off your kid's
child support.

225
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,350
I can't believe I'm
still in this shithole.

226
00:21:11,874 --> 00:21:13,042
Whatcha looking at?

227
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,838
I said, whatcha looking at?!

228
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:18,506
What...

229
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:20,049
You think I'm easy?

230
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:22,927
Hey.

231
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:24,971
Tell me, You think I'm easy!

232
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:48,870
Just looking at your face
disgusts me.

233
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,346
How do you do?

234
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:50,681
How do you do? Come in, please...

235
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:53,976
Well.. You must be shaken up after being
questioned at the Nambu Precinct.

236
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:56,396
Sorry to bother you again
on the phone...

237
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,688
It's okay.

238
00:22:57,939 --> 00:23:00,483
But to be the first
to find her...

239
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,860
It's tough.

240
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,490
Her last image lingered
on for days. It was hard.

241
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,953
And I keep remembering
the things she used to tell me..

242
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:19,127
When Mrs Jeong lost her husband
and suffered from severe depression,

243
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:24,632
She would beat her daughter
whenever she got drunk.

244
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:28,761
So she blamed herself
for ruining her daughter's life.

245
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:32,640
She was haunted by the memory
for the rest of her life.

246
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:45,486
(Death Certificate)

247
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:48,322
You're her guardian.

248
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:07,568
She beats you?

249
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:13,658
Tell me. JOO Mi-gyeong
did this to you?!

250
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:17,662
No...

251
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:49,443
That chicken, there!
This, that and that.

252
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,877
What the hell am I doing?

253
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:18,598
Just finish it.

254
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,940
Where were you planning to go?

255
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:32,236
I was just hungry.

256
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:39,243
They don't seem to feed you,
do they at least give you money?

257
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:41,787
After they beat me,

258
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:44,832
they give me money.

259
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:52,923
Does anyone know about this?

260
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:03,684
Get up.

261
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:14,820
What?

262
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:18,532
They, the police...

263
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:23,037
They send me back home.

264
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,843
Ma'am. You need to slow down
on the disciplining.

265
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:40,221
Make sure this doesn't
happen again.

266
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:41,681
I'm sorry.

267
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:04,829
Hey, KIM Il-gon.

268
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,206
Don't you know I am going through

269
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:09,083
all kinds of troubles to feed the fucking girl

270
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,793
you have popped out, huh?!

271
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,601
Miss BAEK, is it done?

272
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:29,437
Look, it's still dirty.

273
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,566
Huh? Here and there.
There are still stains.

274
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,613
Oh, okay.

275
00:28:39,905 --> 00:28:43,033
Sorry.
It's my bad. Okay?

276
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:56,338
By the way,

277
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,884
is there anywhere else
you can go?

278
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:06,599
What was I thinking, goddamn it...

279
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:08,893
- Goddamn it.
- Hey!

280
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:17,610
I wasn't cursing at you.

281
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:21,572
I was cursing at myself.

282
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:24,450
Miss BAEK.

283
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:28,537
Do you hate yourself?

284
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:42,468
If you don't have a place to go...

285
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,678
Is there anywhere you want to go?

286
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:52,853
(Nice place to take a kid)

287
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,321
Thank you.

288
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:05,527
About your mom,

289
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:08,072
do you know where she is?

290
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:09,949
Heaven.

291
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:12,409
Heaven...

292
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,537
Anywhere there's no
daddy and me,

293
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:18,666
she said is heaven.

294
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:24,713
Miss BAEK, where's your mom?

295
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:35,474
She's in hell, my mom.

296
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:37,559
Hell...

297
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:50,531
Run from me...

298
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:53,283
as far as you can.

299
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,006
Get up. Let's go home.

300
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:47,004
Didn't I tell you not to
wander around?

301
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:48,422
Come here!

302
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:52,134
What the fuck are you doing?

303
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:55,554
What are you doing?

304
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,813
That's a good boy!

305
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:17,326
Sis...

306
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,537
What the fuck are you doing?

307
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:22,623
You...

308
00:34:23,582 --> 00:34:26,835
- If you lay a finger on her...
- What do you mean?

309
00:34:27,252 --> 00:34:28,253
Who? Me?

310
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:31,256
Is that what you told her?

311
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:35,844
Don't.

312
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:43,519
Hey, who are you to interfere
with my life?

313
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:47,689
You're nothing but
a measly masseuse!

314
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:50,025
If you're not up to
the responsibility,

315
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:52,319
stop meddling in my business.

316
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,245
I'm sure you've never
even raised a dog.

317
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:04,373
If you really want to have her,
then how about $100 grand?

318
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:06,917
Then take her at the price of
$100 grand.

319
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,168
You fucking bitch!

320
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:17,761
KIM Ji-eun.

321
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:21,849
Didn't I tell you to stop
biting your nails?

322
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,019
She has a habit of
biting her nails.

323
00:35:29,148 --> 00:35:31,608
And how did this wound happen?

324
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,366
I fell down.

325
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:40,826
By myself...

326
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,791
Stay here.

327
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:55,215
The next door lady said she
never heard a child crying...

328
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:58,552
And since it's winter vacation,
it'll be weird to ask her school.

329
00:35:58,635 --> 00:36:00,554
But I told you I'm a witness!

330
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:03,682
It'll be a headache
if anything goes wrong.

331
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,768
We have no concrete
proof for now.

332
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:12,357
I know the law, but it's hard to
pass any judgments right now.

333
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:15,861
Come on, even the kid is
denying everything.

334
00:36:15,861 --> 00:36:17,863
Don't make this a big deal

335
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,910
What about her taking
our kid without our consent?

336
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:25,120
Also causing disturbance
at our home?

337
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,956
Shouldn't you include
housebreaking

338
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:32,252
and assault as well as
personal attack?

339
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:34,171
By the way,

340
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:36,423
what's your relationship
to the child?

341
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:39,051
Can you show me any
identification?

342
00:36:39,593 --> 00:36:42,804
If you don't have any on you,
write your ID number here.

343
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:58,570
(BAEK SANG-AH)

344
00:37:05,118 --> 00:37:06,119
Chief.

345
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:07,204
Look...

346
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:14,670
BAEK Sang-ah.

347
00:37:23,929 --> 00:37:26,181
You have a criminal record in ‘99.

348
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:27,224
What is it?

349
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:30,185
Are you okay?

350
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:35,190
I'm with the Joongbu Precinct.
What is it?

351
00:37:37,484 --> 00:37:40,362
How could they beat
such a small child?

352
00:37:44,283 --> 00:37:47,452
The Children's Crisis Center
told me they'll visit her soon.

353
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:49,288
so let's see how things go.

354
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,277
- Where is the kid?
- Over there, sir.

355
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:22,487
It's been 4 days, since he's been buried.

356
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:26,116
The kid's father and father's girlfriend
confessed to the murder.

357
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:41,882
So, are you just going to look away?
Her nails are falling out

358
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:47,137
and she's all black and blue!
Visiting her home just won't do, damn it!

359
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:49,973
Excuse me?

360
00:38:53,352 --> 00:38:56,605
They don't have a slot for her
at the center

361
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:59,358
and they promised
to visit her regularly...

362
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:00,525
Right.

363
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,779
For someone's who's never
owned a dog...

364
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:07,574
I must've been possessed.

365
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:11,495
I shouldn't have interfered.

366
00:39:19,086 --> 00:39:20,879
The kid is fine.

367
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:24,758
Day after tomorrow?

368
00:39:28,428 --> 00:39:30,806
Okay, please come.

369
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:38,897
KIM Il-gon.

370
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:43,402
The center people are visiting,
so keep an eye on her.

371
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:48,115
Until they leave, don't touch her,
okay?

372
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:51,618
It'll be a headache if they find
a new bruise.

373
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,872
Are you feeling sick?
Let's get you into warm clothes.

374
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,751
Oh, it's cold.

375
00:40:13,932 --> 00:40:15,142
Shit!

376
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:24,526
Miss BAEK...

377
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:25,652
Miss BAEK!

378
00:40:26,236 --> 00:40:27,237
Hey.

379
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:28,405
Baeky!

380
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:35,662
I can't believe you're spacing
out in front of cash?

381
00:40:35,954 --> 00:40:36,955
Here!

382
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,875
I threw in your severance pay
as well.

383
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:43,628
It'll be hard to find another
employee like you, Baeky.

384
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:45,297
But you've got Jang-mi.

385
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,798
Who, me?

386
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:49,509
What about me? What?

387
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,471
I knew something smelled fishy.

388
00:40:52,804 --> 00:40:55,765
Are you moving in together
with Jang-sup? Huh?

389
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:58,602
If not, then are you pregnant?

390
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:01,104
I'm late.

391
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:05,192
Joy's here. He had to get away
from daddy, my precious Joy.

392
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:08,153
I though Il-gon became calm,
but I guess not.

393
00:41:08,195 --> 00:41:11,531
KIM Il-gon goes batshit crazy
when he's drunk,

394
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,075
and it drives me crazy.

395
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:18,872
I'll be back in a jiffy.
Thanks for looking after him.

396
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,916
- See ya.
- Okay.

397
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:23,877
What happened?

398
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:26,922
Something happen
between you two?

399
00:41:52,322 --> 00:41:53,323
Don't drink it.

400
00:42:01,373 --> 00:42:03,124
It'll only keep you alive.

401
00:42:22,894 --> 00:42:23,895
Stop it.

402
00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:25,438
Daddy...

403
00:42:26,147 --> 00:42:27,816
Forgive me...

404
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:30,318
It irritates me...
That crying...

405
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,657
I said stop!

406
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:38,118
Hey.

407
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:40,745
What's the use of living
like this?

408
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:41,830
Just...

409
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:43,915
Just fucking die...

410
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:47,544
That'll be better, right?

411
00:42:48,169 --> 00:42:49,462
For us both, right?

412
00:42:49,504 --> 00:42:50,505
Shit!

413
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:54,259
I told her no!
Why the fuck were you born?!

414
00:42:55,093 --> 00:42:56,511
I wish you were dead...

415
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:01,683
I'm sorry for being born...

00:43:39,304 --> 00:43:41,848

Miss BAEK...

424
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:06,349
I placed your mother's
ashes in the charnel house today.

425
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:09,185
She's in a good place,
so don't worry.

426
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:11,604
You know...

427
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:13,898
- Your mom...
- Later

428
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,446
Not now, but later.

429
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:25,827
Okay. We'll talk later.

430
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:34,335

431
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:00,820
Wait.

432
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:03,114
What?

433
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:04,616
Stop the car.

434
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:06,534
Why?

435
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,229
Something's wrong, isn't there?

436
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:35,980
Is it the kid?

437
00:46:38,149 --> 00:46:39,275
Hey!

438
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:50,829
Stop the car!

439
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:55,166
Hey!

440
00:46:58,503 --> 00:46:59,712
Hey, BAEK Sang-ah!

441
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:54,350
Hey, you better watch out!

442
00:49:57,557 --> 00:50:01,728
The number you have dialed is
not available at the moment.

443
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:36,137
Now, let me see.

444
00:50:37,722 --> 00:50:41,309
It stings, right? This'll be quick.
You poor thing.

445
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:43,978
Jeez, what happened?

446
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,238
You're her guardian, right?

447
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,867
Follow me and fill out a form.

448
00:51:28,356 --> 00:51:29,482

Open up! I'm a cop.

453
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:22,451
Open up!
I know you're in there.

454
00:52:25,872 --> 00:52:26,831
Awe, shit!

455
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:31,210
Someone's inside, right?

456
00:52:31,669 --> 00:52:33,671
How should I know?
Huh?

457
00:52:34,255 --> 00:52:36,257
A woman was calling the girl,

458
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,551
pressing the doorbell like crazy!

459
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:39,635
When was that?

460
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:41,470
Did you get to see the woman?

461
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:43,973
Hey! Open the goddamn door!

462
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:46,601
Open it!

00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:47,810
Hey!

464
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,942
Why didn't you open the door!

00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:59,030
You know who I am,
don't you?

466
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:04,285
Hey, what the fuck?

00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:13,794
Hey!

470
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:22,553
Didn't you understand
what I said?

471
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:29,810
If we're caught again,
we're both fucked.

472
00:53:29,852 --> 00:53:33,189
So I told you to keep an eye on her,
you fucking moron!

00:53:58,631 --> 00:53:59,924
Excuse me, boss.

in JOHYUN villa, don't you?

475
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:13,688
Or, did you see someone visited at #204?

476
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:16,899
Hey, stop, stop, stop!

477
00:54:19,151 --> 00:54:20,152
God...

478
00:54:20,278 --> 00:54:22,321
For crying out loud...

479
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:25,992

00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,992

00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,330
I'm...

483
00:56:36,622 --> 00:56:37,915
not educated enough

to teach you anything.

485
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:45,798
And I've got nothing...

486
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:49,218
So I've got nothing to give .

487
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:51,512
But...

488
00:56:53,055 --> 00:56:54,515
I'll stay by your side.

489
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,606
I'll protect you.

490
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:20,040
I'll protect you too.

00:57:46,984 --> 00:57:50,154

What is it that you want?

497
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:37,034
Do you want to raise her?

498
00:58:39,662 --> 00:58:40,621

499
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,750
in my mailbox

500
00:58:45,668 --> 00:58:49,046
I found an envelope with
a savings account book.

501
00:58:51,006 --> 00:58:52,508
I felt so embarrassed.

502
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:58,514
My house entrance she passed
through was narrow and filthy.

503
00:58:59,974 --> 00:59:01,600
The mailbox she stuck

504
00:59:04,853 --> 00:59:07,439
the envelope in
was covered in rust.

505
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:14,697
It was so embarrassing.

506
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:18,200
So...

507
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:23,122
Your mother

508
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:26,667
let you go to save you.

509

510
00:59:57,364 --> 01:00:00,659
was a day she never forgot.

511
01:00:02,077 --> 01:00:06,832
I guess it haunted her
until the day she died.

512
01:00:32,149 --> 01:00:33,651
Doctor! Doctor!

513
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,527

Did you know?

535
01:04:32,764 --> 01:04:35,309
I thought she'd be
better off dead...

536
01:04:36,226 --> 01:04:38,312
The cover up would be
a drag, but

537
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:41,273
I thought it would make you
come around.

538

to one...

away in prison,

center people come.

542
01:05:08,216 --> 01:05:09,676
Why's he acting weird?

543
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:18,977
Didn't you say that woman

544
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:21,813
had a criminal record?

545
01:05:21,813 --> 01:05:22,814
Huh?

546
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,399
I mean

547
01:05:24,816 --> 01:05:28,570
my girlfriend went on
a business trip to countryside,

548
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:30,364
I never told her because

549
01:05:30,447 --> 01:05:32,491
she will worry about it.

550
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:37,204
My child is missing.

551
01:05:39,122 --> 01:05:41,833
I don't get why people have been
bothering me since last night?!

552
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,086
I can't work for crying out loud!

553
01:05:44,086 --> 01:05:47,839
You said a cop dropped by to
check the CCTV footage, right?

554
01:05:47,965 --> 01:05:50,509
The cop took it with him!

555
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,970
What was on it?

556
01:05:55,764 --> 01:05:57,891
The masseuse girl

557
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:02,688
slipped into the alley holding
the kid and disappeared that way.

558
01:06:02,813 --> 01:06:05,649
The kid seemed hurt bad
since she wasn't moving.

559
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:07,901
You know, she had a criminal record.

560
01:06:07,943 --> 01:06:09,444
What's going on?

561
01:06:10,112 --> 01:06:13,657
Once she's identified as the one who
took the kid, then file a report.

562
01:06:15,283 --> 01:06:17,035
That she's been kidnapped.

563
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:38,181
This happened here before

564
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:40,892
with a lady going crazy over
finding the kid.

565
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:42,477
- Yeah?
- Yes.

566
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,649
But it doesn't look like a place
where a kid's been living.

567
01:06:47,774 --> 01:06:51,111
How does your daughter
spend her time playing?

568
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,656
Well, she's always home, so...

569
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:57,367
How tall is she?

570
01:06:57,826 --> 01:06:58,827
Her height...

571
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,582
About this tall?

572
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:07,294
What was she wearing
when she disappeared?

573
01:07:10,338 --> 01:07:13,091
I'm not sure...

574
01:07:21,558 --> 01:07:25,020
Did you do a background check on her?

575
01:07:26,396 --> 01:07:27,397
What?

576
01:07:27,397 --> 01:07:28,523
Attempted murder?

577
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:31,777
The woman who came to ER...

578
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,570
We got a report from here.

579
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,781
Is this her?

580
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:38,992
I found her!
The time's around 22:36.

581
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,330
Hey, BAEK Sang-ah! Pick up the phone.

582
01:07:43,872 --> 01:07:47,167
You'll be arrested, if you run away with the kid.

583
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:51,129
I'm going there right now,
so sit and wait. Okay?

584
01:08:45,684 --> 01:08:46,810
What's going on?

585
01:08:47,853 --> 01:08:51,189
Sorry, but breakfast's not ready yet.

586
01:08:51,481 --> 01:08:53,859
Oh my, and there's a child. I'm so sorry.

587
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,193
Yes, see you again.

588
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:08,832
Done.

589
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:15,213
I'll go to your place to look
for evidence,

590
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:19,301
so promise to explain things
well to the cops, okay?

591
01:09:19,384 --> 01:09:20,385
Good.

592
01:09:21,344 --> 01:09:23,513
- What should I do...
- Get her some food.

593
01:09:23,513 --> 01:09:24,931
And stop making a fuss.

594
01:09:24,973 --> 01:09:26,641
I guess she needs to eat.

595
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:29,561
Have you ever tried
eel stew before?

596
01:09:29,853 --> 01:09:32,689
Should I fry the eel? Jang-sup!

597
01:09:34,733 --> 01:09:38,945
Yeah, I guess you need to find
a way to happiness together.

598
01:09:42,824 --> 01:09:45,911
Her father's filed charges
for kidnapping.

599
01:09:46,328 --> 01:09:50,332
So we need proof that
she's escaped from getting beaten.

600
01:09:50,624 --> 01:09:52,042
I'll go look for one.

601
01:09:52,751 --> 01:09:56,338
So don't think of going anywhere
and just stay right here, okay?

602
01:09:56,379 --> 01:09:58,632
Where's your phone?

603
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,220
Turn yours off

604
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:07,140
and have mine.
I'll call you this way.

605
01:10:09,601 --> 01:10:13,605
So whether we find a solution,
let's see what we can do.

606
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:26,076
Since she's recognized as
an abused child

607
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:28,787
once she enters the
Children's Crisis Center,

608
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:31,873
they won't easily hand her over to an ex-convict.

609
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:32,916
Right...

610
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,668
What's this about?

611
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,752
Nothing.

612
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,922
Okay, thank you.

613
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:42,676
Hey, hey!

614
01:10:43,051 --> 01:10:44,302
You son of a bitch.

615
01:10:44,552 --> 01:10:45,637
What, kidnapped?

616
01:10:45,637 --> 01:10:47,514
You're saying she's been
kidnapped?

617
01:10:47,555 --> 01:10:50,392
- What's going on?
- Where the hell is she?

618
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:54,562
Drop the charges, now!

619
01:10:54,604 --> 01:10:58,566
Or else you and that bitch
will regret you're alive.

620
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:03,363
What's all the commotion?
Is there a fight?

621
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,199
The child on the 2nd floor
has disappeared.

622
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:07,200
The 2nd floor?

623
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:11,579
You mean the kid hanging
from the window yesterday?

624
01:11:14,874 --> 01:11:18,586
I drank too much and called
a chauffeur service yesterday.

625
01:11:18,753 --> 01:11:19,754
And...

626
01:11:20,463 --> 01:11:23,425
I saw a kid dangling
from the 2nd floor.

627
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:25,302
I thought I was hallucinating...

628
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,762
What do you mean
a kid was hanging...

629
01:11:27,846 --> 01:11:31,057
- Here, here, rewind!
- I'm watching it!

630
01:11:36,604 --> 01:11:37,605
What's this?

631
01:11:37,772 --> 01:11:40,025
She wasn't kidnapped,
goddamn it!

632
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,986
- Police?
- We are doomed. Cut it!

633
01:12:01,463 --> 01:12:02,839
(KIM IL-GON)

634
01:12:16,478 --> 01:12:17,479
Sis...

635
01:12:20,148 --> 01:12:22,150
- Something wrong?
- Shut up!

636
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,610
Just shut the fuck up!

637
01:12:26,946 --> 01:12:29,824
I just knew she'd drag me down
one day.

638
01:12:29,991 --> 01:12:32,994
From the day I laid eyes
on her, she was bad luck.

639
01:12:33,078 --> 01:12:36,956
Without her, KIM Il-gon wouldn't
have become so fucked up.

640
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:41,961
Without her, my life wouldn't
have been so desperate.

641
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:56,267
If we get rid of her, no need
to worry about evidence, right?

642
01:12:56,976 --> 01:13:02,190
35-year-old Park was sentenced 7 years for
child abuse resulting in death.

643
01:13:02,315 --> 01:13:04,943
The court found PARK guilty of all
charges, but considered

644
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:08,655
he was a first time offender
and expressing deep remorse for his crimes.

645
01:13:08,738 --> 01:13:09,781
But when the sentence
became public...

646
01:13:09,823 --> 01:13:12,367
He should've
received the death penalty.

647
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:15,954
That it was outrageous to apply death by abuse.

648
01:13:25,672 --> 01:13:28,508
Fucking unbelievable...

649
01:13:38,768 --> 01:13:40,437
As horrible as it is,

650
01:13:40,812 --> 01:13:44,607
nothing can cut family ties
except death.

651
01:13:52,574 --> 01:13:55,326
I guess you really like her.

652
01:13:58,413 --> 01:14:00,081
It's not your fault.

653
01:14:00,915 --> 01:14:05,086
If there is one, it's just that
you two aren't related.

654
01:14:06,963 --> 01:14:08,214
Hello?

655
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:14,721
- Hello.
- Welcome!

656
01:14:37,702 --> 01:14:39,829
- Hey, what brings you here?
- Ah, okay!

657
01:14:39,913 --> 01:14:43,041
- Hey, no! I need to be in there!
- I know!

658
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,255
What a stubborn fuck...

659
01:14:49,589 --> 01:14:52,800
What's with him?
It's not even his case.

660
01:14:52,842 --> 01:14:54,344
I don't know.

661
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:59,432
Hey, where is JOO Mi-gyeong?

662
01:15:01,142 --> 01:15:02,101
Huh?

663
01:15:04,395 --> 01:15:07,774
Do you even know
what your crime is?

664
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:10,235
Do you?

665
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,030
You and that bitch

666
01:15:14,405 --> 01:15:18,576
made it a habit of beating her
with coat hangers, broom sticks.

667
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:22,163
In winter, got her wet and
froze her in the laundry room!

668
01:15:23,122 --> 01:15:24,916
Hey, look at me!

669
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:28,419
This is what you did to your
own kid! Look hard!

670
01:15:28,545 --> 01:15:29,546
Hey, Jang-sup!

671
01:15:29,587 --> 01:15:31,256
Let him talk. Just let him talk!

672
01:15:31,256 --> 01:15:34,551
Whatcha looking at?!
Go! Just fuckin go!

673
01:15:36,135 --> 01:15:37,804
Hey, let me ask you this.

674
01:15:38,555 --> 01:15:40,765
Isn't she your own kid?

675
01:15:41,432 --> 01:15:43,977
Even if it just happened,
isn't she your own kid?!

676
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:46,187
Did you really mean to kill her?

677
01:15:46,854 --> 01:15:49,107
Did you? Huh?

678
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:51,734
She didn't die, did she?

679
01:15:56,322 --> 01:15:57,532
Let go, get out!

680
01:15:57,824 --> 01:16:01,119
I was beaten as a kid,
but did I end up dead?

681
01:16:01,828 --> 01:16:04,205
Where were you all
when I needed help?

682
01:16:04,247 --> 01:16:06,332
So lay off you sons-of-bitches!

683
01:16:10,837 --> 01:16:12,630
Get out.

684
01:16:12,755 --> 01:16:13,756
Get out, out!

685
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:15,717
Get up.

686
01:16:18,553 --> 01:16:19,554
You know...

687
01:16:22,223 --> 01:16:24,767
After growing up around
this shit,

688
01:16:27,437 --> 01:16:31,232
it's unlikely her life's gonna
turn out great, right?

689
01:16:32,692 --> 01:16:33,693
(YOO JANG-MI)

690
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:36,654
Just hang up if I'm not
answering, jeez...

691
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:39,490
Hello?!

692
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:43,244
Hello? Isn't this Jang-sup's
number?

693
01:16:44,495 --> 01:16:45,663
Who's this?

694
01:16:45,913 --> 01:16:47,040
Miss BAEK...

695
01:16:47,248 --> 01:16:48,249
Miss BAEK!

696
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:49,626
She's coming, just wait!

697
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:50,835
Hello?

698
01:16:53,004 --> 01:16:54,255
Hello.

699
01:16:54,464 --> 01:16:58,635
He told me you run a diner.

700
01:16:58,718 --> 01:17:00,678
I'd like to visit your place.

701
01:17:01,137 --> 01:17:03,056
Where's it located?

702
01:17:12,607 --> 01:17:14,817
Something for a cold,
please.

703
01:17:15,026 --> 01:17:16,235
The kind for kids.

704
01:17:16,986 --> 01:17:18,613
What're the symptoms?

705
01:17:18,738 --> 01:17:19,739
Stuffy nose?

706
01:17:19,822 --> 01:17:20,823
Sore throat?

707
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:24,786
Fever and coughing...

708
01:17:25,787 --> 01:17:26,788
Next news.

709
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:31,584
2pm, today, Joongbu Precinct
arrested KIM for imprisonment,

710
01:17:31,584 --> 01:17:34,087
starvation and battery of
his daughter,

711
01:17:34,128 --> 01:17:38,299
while putting out an immediate APB on
KIM's girlfriend, JOO.

712
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:45,765
Didn't I say the kid's okay? How
many times do you have to check?

713
01:17:46,057 --> 01:17:47,892
But isn't this supposed to be
harboring a suspect?

714
01:17:47,892 --> 01:17:49,394
Check to see if anything's wrong.

715
01:17:49,394 --> 01:17:51,604
I want to be paid four times
the regular.

716
01:17:51,646 --> 01:17:52,647
Check her out!

717
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,315
Damn...

718
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:00,863
Welcome.

719
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:04,701
Welcome.

720
01:18:05,493 --> 01:18:07,787
- Have a seat over here.
- Hello.

721
01:18:19,757 --> 01:18:20,758
Miss BAEK...

722
01:18:36,774 --> 01:18:38,151
Uh, sis, how've you been?

723
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:39,736
What brings you here,
officer BAE?

724
01:18:39,736 --> 01:18:41,362
Jang-sup wanted me to
check something?

725
01:18:41,362 --> 01:18:43,239
Jang-sup? But he
already stopped by.

726
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:45,116
Uh, yeah?
There's something else.

727
01:18:45,158 --> 01:18:46,409
Uh, but no one's here.

728
01:18:46,451 --> 01:18:48,953
- What? That's not right.
- No one's here.

729
01:18:50,621 --> 01:18:52,540
Goodness gracious,
where is she?

730
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:56,252
Goddamn it! Didn't I tell you
to keep an eye on her?!

731
01:18:56,544 --> 01:18:57,545
Shit!

732
01:19:00,256 --> 01:19:03,342
- Jang-sup, where you going?
- Did you locate
JOO Mi-gyeong?

733
01:19:03,384 --> 01:19:05,052
- Her location?
- JOO Mi-gyeong!

734
01:19:05,386 --> 01:19:07,513
- Why are you..
- Goddamn it...

735
01:19:12,268 --> 01:19:13,478
Where are you?

736
01:19:13,519 --> 01:19:15,480
Kid! The kid disappeared!

737
01:19:52,266 --> 01:19:54,811
(DET. KANG)

738
01:20:00,608 --> 01:20:04,403
After hanging around with
her, you've gotten bad.

739
01:20:07,448 --> 01:20:10,827
Get out of my life!

740
01:22:16,577 --> 01:22:17,578
Miss BAEK!

741
01:22:35,596 --> 01:22:36,597
KIM Ji-eun.

742
01:22:42,019 --> 01:22:44,522
If you take another step further

743
01:22:50,778 --> 01:22:53,072
I promise I'll never see you again.

744
01:23:15,594 --> 01:23:17,930
Calm down and speak slowly.

745
01:23:18,014 --> 01:23:19,765
You think I can calm down?

746
01:23:19,849 --> 01:23:22,601
Do not just telling me
that you're running away..

747
01:23:22,643 --> 01:23:24,353
Give me the address
you're at now.

748
01:23:24,395 --> 01:23:26,439
- Address?
- Yes the address.

749
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:30,693
Do I look like I have the time?
Get my address yourselves!

750
01:23:30,735 --> 01:23:31,861
It's hard to find..

751
01:23:31,861 --> 01:23:35,489
- Hey! Do your work right!
- We need your address..

752
01:23:36,282 --> 01:23:37,283
Hey, get up.

753
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,331
Hey.

754
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,791
Bring it on.

755
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:47,126
I said, bring it on!

756
01:23:51,756 --> 01:23:52,757
Hey.

757
01:23:53,674 --> 01:23:56,343
What were you gonna
do with the kid?

758
01:23:58,262 --> 01:24:01,182
Were you really thinking of
killing her?

759
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:05,686
You want to take her
under your wing, right?

760
01:24:06,562 --> 01:24:10,941
Yeah, at first I wished her
dead. But not anymore.

761
01:24:11,692 --> 01:24:14,570
She physically grew on me
as I beat her.

762
01:24:16,822 --> 01:24:20,201
If you're thinking of
taking her in, I'm sorry.

763
01:24:20,451 --> 01:24:21,952
I'm not letting her go.

764
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:24,663
I'm keep her for good.

765
01:24:26,582 --> 01:24:27,875
You'll see.

766
01:24:30,544 --> 01:24:31,754
You fucking bitch!

767
01:24:34,882 --> 01:24:36,592
Let go, you fucking bitch!

768
01:24:38,469 --> 01:24:39,470
Let go!

769
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,709
Ji-eun!

770
01:25:42,241 --> 01:25:44,702
You think you're better
than me?!

771
01:25:47,413 --> 01:25:48,414
Ji-eun!

772
01:25:49,123 --> 01:25:50,833
Why are you here?

773
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:53,836
Get in the car, quick!
It's freezing outside.

774
01:25:53,878 --> 01:25:54,879
Get in the car.

775
01:25:55,629 --> 01:25:56,630
What is it?

776
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,449
Hey, BAEK Sang-ah!

777
01:27:07,826 --> 01:27:08,827
Let go!

778
01:27:09,036 --> 01:27:10,871
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Stop, stop it!

779
01:27:10,871 --> 01:27:12,414
- I said, let go!
- Stop!

780
01:27:12,414 --> 01:27:13,415
Let go!

781
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:16,543
Let me go!

782
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:19,129
- BAEK Sang-ah!
- Let go!

783
01:27:19,171 --> 01:27:20,881
Hey, just stop, will you?!

784
01:27:27,054 --> 01:27:28,055
Are you hurt?

785
01:27:33,852 --> 01:27:35,229
The car's over there.

786
01:27:35,271 --> 01:27:36,272
And the kid.

787
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:39,942
I'll take care of things here.

788
01:27:44,154 --> 01:27:45,155
Here...

789
01:27:47,366 --> 01:27:50,911
You don't want her to see you
handcuffed, do you?

790
01:27:57,751 --> 01:27:58,711
I'm sorry...

791
01:28:04,633 --> 01:28:05,634
Just go

792
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:07,136
and be her mom.

793
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:09,513
Even if it's just for a few days.

794
01:28:10,222 --> 01:28:11,181
Go, now!

795
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,690
Hurry and go!

796
01:29:25,589 --> 01:29:27,174
Even if I'm like this...

797
01:29:38,519 --> 01:29:40,229
Will you come with me?

798
01:29:49,321 --> 01:29:50,572
Let's go...

799
01:29:51,365 --> 01:29:52,366
together...

800
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:37,286
(1 year later)

801
01:30:51,842 --> 01:30:55,179
Abused for 3 years, JOO was sentenced 15 years

802
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,973
for child abuse and attempted murder

803
01:30:58,015 --> 01:31:04,146
KIM's father, 30-year-old, was sentenced
10 years by the court..

804
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:06,440
Good morning. Breakfast is ready.

805
01:31:06,523 --> 01:31:11,361
The court found JOO and KIM's guilty of
all charges for several years of child abuse.

806
01:31:11,403 --> 01:31:12,779
Turn it off.

807
01:31:13,864 --> 01:31:14,865
Come here.

808
01:31:22,831 --> 01:31:23,832
Come eat.

809
01:32:44,913 --> 01:32:48,166
Ma'am, don't you see that
‘No Smoking' sign?

810
01:32:52,838 --> 01:32:53,839
Ma'am!

811
01:32:54,047 --> 01:32:55,716
Don't call her like that.

812
