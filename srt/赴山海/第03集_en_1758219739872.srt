1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,500
You won't leave being left at dear Agrin

2
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,540
Assemble the Squad!

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,360
According to the fate of thenoblepedes

4
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,840
who cares for the glorious Grandpa

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,360
Rather, sell it to you

6
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,220
Our Nine-Nose Scourge

7
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,640
will never fail

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,520
Fushan Sea

9
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
Actually, I do these

10
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Just want to be

11
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,480
The sect leader of Huanhua

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,520
what

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,920
Sect leader

14
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
Boss, are you kidding us?

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,760
When did you

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
Have the idea of ​​being a leader

17
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,200
I haven't heard of you before

18
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,000
People always have dreams

19
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
That one

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Brothers in our sacred state

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,080
If a sect leader speaks out

22
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,560
Is it very majestic?

23
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
Is it very powerful?

24
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,600
Boss, you are serious

25
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,440
But Uncle Xiao has been late

26
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
Let your big brother be the leader

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
And in a few days

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,200
Isn't it the day of the Huanhua Sect's birthday?

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,600
This

30
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
It's all very meaningful

31
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,520
Brothers use your wisdom

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,720
Help me analyze

33
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,760
How can I

34
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Let my brother change his mind

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,280
Want to be the leader

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
The most important point

37
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,440
Is the reputation in the martial arts world

38
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,280
Your big brother is now in the well

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,240
High reputation

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,680
We have been doing good deeds these years

41
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,200
Also hidden

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,240
To be in the martial arts world than reputation

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,400
You are indeed different from your big brother

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
It turns out to be famous

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,440
That's easy

46
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Then let's fight

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,600
What a noise

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
What noise

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,920
it is good

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
What I mean is

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,080
Make some acrobatics

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Simple comparison

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,680
For example

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,800
Write some

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
Let people hear the good things

56
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,280
Announcement everywhere

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,480
Let me see me in the world

58
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,600
I am confused

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,800
Not much to say, brothers

60
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,920
You guys now put this in the world

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,240
There are heads, there are faces, there are lives

62
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,440
Write it down for everyone

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,640
Daocheng, let me have a match with them

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,360
Write down

65
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,040
Write it all down

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,880
Are you sure

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,200
Of course

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,200
Come down, come down, come down, come down, come down, come down

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
Don't catch a cold

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,040
Come on, brother

71
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,280
Ann

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,520
What the hell

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,360
Is it so much

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,600
Tang Lao Ya

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,800
This is very unique

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,360
It's very famous

77
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
This is how the old days are like

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,040
What nine heavens and ten earths and nineteen demons

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,920
The world of the Ming and Yang has not yet been built

80
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,120
These people

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,400
There are even better names

82
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,320
Heart-wrenching treasure

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,200
Old duck numbers are famous

84
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,920
So we want to get rid of people first

85
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm afraid of eating the net

86
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,480
We want to quickly get rid of the people

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,880
Unless you kill more demons from the power gang

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,720
Boss Lei

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,320
But didn't you say

90
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
How can we keep our strength

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,280
This is really annoying

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,040
Actually there is another way

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,560
What way

94
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,040
The heavenly general's nerves help Xuanling

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Eight desert heroes are all dead

96
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,960
What the hell is this again

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,520
This is not a ghost

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,320
This is the best treasure of the martial arts

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,400
You mean

100
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
World Hero Order

101
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,920
That's right

102
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,640
World Hero Order

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,520
It was created by Emei, Wudang, Shaolin, and three masters

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,320
Use the food of the heavenly generals overseas to make the second hand

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,600
This rumor

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
The wild boar also took the martial arts blood

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
The Heaven Book of Forgetting Love is also hidden inside

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,640
If the boss can get it

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,480
It can really fill the void

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
This is the Hero Order in the hand of the chief general of the Fairy Pass

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Wu Jie's mother, Old Lady Wu

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,760
Now the whole world is looking for the whereabouts of Old Lady Wu

113
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,920
We want to find the Heaven Book of Forgetting Love in the Hero Order

114
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,800
Where should I find it

115
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,480
behave

116
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,760
Master

117
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,760
Can also do this

118
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,620
It also here

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,880
What happened

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
Go.

121
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,440
What are you guys doing?

122
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,000
It's such a long-term matter, why are you in such a hurry?

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,860
Let's find a good place first.

124
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,680
Where?

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
Let's go, boss.

126
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,240
Hey, hey, hey, hold this, Tang Rang.

127
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,160
Didn't we get a cold?

128
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,920
Let's be happy first.

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,840
Hey, brother, how are we going to decide?

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,880
Let's go, brother.

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,480
We're here, we're here.

132
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,280
It's here.

133
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
Great!

134
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
It's so beautiful.

135
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
It's really beautiful.

136
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Great!

137
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Great!

138
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
This is so beautiful.

139
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
This is so beautiful.

140
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Great!

141
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Great!

142
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Do you like it?

143
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
It's so beautiful.

144
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
It's so beautiful.

145
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Isn't this a fairy?

146
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
It's so beautiful.

147
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Great!

148
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
You're just like me.

149
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Boss, how is it?

150
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
It's a group garden, and it's also called a small garden.

151
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
The guests who come here are extremely talented.

152
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
This scene is really...

153
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
The palace is really high.

154
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Great!

155
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Great!

156
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Great!

157
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Boss.

158
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Boss.

159
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Boss.

160
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Why do you look a little nervous?

161
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Great!

162
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I think...

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Isn't this Mr. Zuo?

164
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Long time no see.

165
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Greetings to all the young masters.

166
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Boss, find me a quiet place.

167
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Okay.

168
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Come on, this way, please.

169
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Let's go, boss.

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Please.

171
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Master, Qingliu.

172
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Coming.

173
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Coming.

174
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
This is so powerful.

175
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
I can't even push it out.

176
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Even if I'm hurt, I can't move.

177
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Even if you want to enter my body,

178
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
you have to risk your life.

179
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Great!

180
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Great!

181
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Great!

182
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Great!

183
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Great!

184
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Great!

185
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Great!

186
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Great!

187
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Great!

188
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Great!

189
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Great!

190
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Great!

191
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Great!

192
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Great!

193
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Boss.

194
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Please give that bag to me for a while.

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Okay, we're going.

196
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Get out of my way!

197
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Get out of my way!

198
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Where are you from?

199
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Someone killed our people and hiding here.

200
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,080
They are not.

201
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,560
Search carefully.

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,280
Move aside.

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,920
Search.

204
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,960
This way.

205
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,560
Move aside.

206
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,000
You can't break in, Shen Wei Yan.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,520
Move aside.

208
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Be careful.

209
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,720
Move aside.

210
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,760
Search carefully.

211
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,520
It's so fast.

212
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,880
Open the door.

213
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,440
Open the door.

214
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
Sorry, buddy.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,320
I borrowed your place to hide.

216
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,480
Sealed the door,

217
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
I'll place it over your head.

218
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,560
The door shall be locked.

219
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,040
Retreat at the curraft.

220
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,280
Out of control.

221
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Out of control?

222
00:12:47,960 --> 00:13:13,040
He is my fuan.

223
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Stop!

224
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Where are you from?

225
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
How dare you interfere with our business?

226
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
The road is uneven.

227
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Help me with the sword.

228
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Go!

229
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Xie Xie!

230
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Help me!

231
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
The memory of the Seven Beads is very weak.

232
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
The magic of the five-star sword is very powerful.

233
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
It's not bad to meet the wind.

234
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Boss!

235
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Are you okay?

236
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
Boss, why are you so fast?

237
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
You finished it all by yourself.

238
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Are you collecting the dead body?

239
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
I see.

240
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Come and see.

241
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
The third young master of the Flower Sword Sect, Xiao Qiushui,

242
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
is doing justice.

243
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Everyone, spread the word!

244
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Spread the word!

245
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
He is Xiao Qiushui.

246
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
He is so powerful.

247
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
It's him.

248
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Xiao Qiushui.

249
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
The Flower Sword Sect.

250
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Shut up.

251
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Kid!

252
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Do you know who you are saving?

253
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
You killed him at once.

254
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I didn't see it clearly.

255
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
You're right.

256
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Who are you saving?

257
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
He is my friend.

258
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
He is crazy.

259
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
I wrote it.

260
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
That's right.

261
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
You're so stupid.

262
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
In this world,

263
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
you're not even a little child.

264
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
You're still a child.

265
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm not a child.

266
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm a child.

267
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
I'm a child.

268
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm a child.

269
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
I'm a child.

270
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm a child.

271
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm a child.

272
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
That's right.

273
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
It's her.

274
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,500
08 لم0

275
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,320
The scar on her arm looks the same as the location.

276
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,420
The whole address should be the same.

277
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,920
Filipin

278
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,640
otte

279
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,680
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. You're hurt.

280
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,080
Who are you?

281
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,280
Let me ask you. Is this jade pendant yours?

282
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,680
Yes.

283
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
I am the Wind Wolf of the Sky Fiend Realm.

284
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,280
You're indeed the one.

285
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,080
This ghost system has finally done a human body.

286
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,680
Brother, human body.

287
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,280
Brother, brother.

288
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Su Xiao.

289
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
Su Xiao.

290
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Su Xiao.

291
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,280
Su Xiao.

292
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,880
Su Xiao.

293
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Sorry. Sorry. I was too excited.

294
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Have we met before?

295
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,880
It's not too late to know each other now.

296
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,280
Here, I'll pour you a glass of water.

297
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,480
Let me ask you.

298
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,680
When did you start practicing swordsmanship?

299
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
What is your favorite thing?

300
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,280
Come, let's drink.

301
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,680
I don't know.

302
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,680
You... you don't know?

303
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,180
You... you got hurt in the head?

304
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Do you know how to use swordsmanship?

305
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,480
How do you know?

306
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
You're so smart.

307
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,920
Do you want to

308
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,880
get some information from me?

309
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,600
Fu Dai met a player

310
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,200
and was forced to activate.

311
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,280
It's possible that

312
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,800
he's dead.

313
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,480
Fu Dai,

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,480
I know you're a good martial artist.

315
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,960
But don't worry.

316
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
I'll keep it a secret for you.

317
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,600
You keep calling me Fu Dai.

318
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,400
What does that mean?

319
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,000
How can I explain it?

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
I can't explain it

321
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,840
to you.

322
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,600
Anyway,

323
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,200
you'll kill the enemy for me

324
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,200
and give me a treasure.

325
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,200
You'll help me come up with a plan.

326
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,680
The most important thing is

327
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
to help me become the leader.

328
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,000
How about it?

329
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you want to protect me

330
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,440
as soon as you see me?

331
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,720
You're willing to do anything

332
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,680
for me?

333
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,520
No.

334
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,720
No?

335
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,360
No.

336
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,800
When I see you,

337
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,560
I feel like you're not long-lived.

338
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,960
That's weird.

339
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:37,560
The

340
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
Are you

341
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,160
still my friend?

342
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
Should I take you as a friend?

343
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,880
I'm not a friend.

344
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,880
Is Fu Dai

345
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,720
still not caught?

346
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,160
Don't worry.

347
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,960
If you don't help me as a friend now,

348
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,160
you'll know what I'm talking about in the future.

349
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,360
But

350
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,080
the most important thing now

351
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,280
is to heal your wound first.

352
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,680
Where's the water?

353
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,680
Pour it yourself.

354
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,240
I'll go find you a doctor first.

355
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,960
The Wind Wolf.

356
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
Xiao Qiusheng.

357
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,960
The wind child's wound is not serious.

358
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,160
But the poison in his body

359
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,880
seems to be the Tianjue Shimao.

360
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,280
Tianjue Shimao?

361
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,000
The poison of the poisonless poison.

362
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,520
Only the same poisonless poison can be cured.

363
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,640
The Power Gang is so ruthless.

364
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,480
Xue Yu's medical skill is very high.

365
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,680
How about you

366
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,360
take him back to the Flower Kingdom?

367
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
He'll change his mind.

368
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,240
His poison

369
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,800
will be released within three days.

370
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,240
It's too late.

371
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,040
Within three days?

372
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,840
Then...

373
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,480
What should we do?

374
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,480
Boss,

375
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
I know a place to go.

376
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,400
Bai Niang Mountain Village.

377
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,480
I heard that their owner

378
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,640
makes a lot of wine.

379
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,560
There's a kind of wine called the most royal wine

380
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,960
that can make people drunk.

381
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,360
It's considered as the poisonless poison.

382
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,640
This method is reliable.

383
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,840
Bai Niang Mountain Village is only half a day's journey from here.

384
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay.

385
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
Then we'll leave now.

386
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,400
Let's go.

387
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,240
No, boss.

388
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,880
Who is that crazy man?

389
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
You saved him.

390
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
Now you're going to cure him.

391
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,640
We should always do

392
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,320
what we should do.

393
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,080
Boss,

394
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,560
you're not right.

395
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,920
Yuhan,

396
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,480
there's no way

397
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,680
to explain so much to you now.

398
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,240
The world is in chaos now.

399
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,320
Boss,

400
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,640
you should find someone to do things for me.

401
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,560
Okay.

402
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Let's not talk about it.

403
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,840
Let's go.

404
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,760
Feng Xiu,

405
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,480
hang in there.

406
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,760
We'll be there soon.

407
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,640
We met by chance.

408
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,840
Why are you so righteous?

409
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,920
How can I explain it to you?

410
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,360
Maybe you won't understand

411
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,800
what I said.

412
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,520
The most important thing now

413
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,640
is to plan our friendship.

414
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,640
Is it so important

415
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,200
to be friends with me?

416
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,640
What do you mean, Feng Xiu?

417
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,640
Is it hard

418
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,560
to live in this world?

419
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,840
It's not easy.

420
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Right.

421
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,160
When I came here,

422
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,760
it was so difficult.

423
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,800
After that,

424
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,960
I had more difficulties.

425
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,880
Now,

426
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,280
I haven't changed a thing.

427
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,400
I've finally realized

428
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,240
what the opportunity is

429
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,760
in this new world.

430
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,480
Qiiruo,

431
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,160
old friends

432
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,440
already take on the sacrifice.

433
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,040
I live in great trouble.

434
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I'm your friend.

435
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Why are you so ungrateful?

436
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Come on, give me five.

437
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Really?

438
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
It's a deal.

439
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Fine.

440
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Xiao Qiu, hurry up, brothers.

441
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
You've worked hard.

442
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
We're almost there, boss.

443
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,000
The

444
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
There are so many people who want to get the power of the emperor.

445
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
This thing is so mysterious.

446
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,040
If you insist, it's like a poison.

447
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
But if you can easily take it,

448
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,040
you can draw a river and make it a beautiful place.

449
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Xiao Qiu.

450
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Tang Rou, you go and take Mr. Feng to find a guest house to rest.

451
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Yu'an Chao, let's go.

452
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Let's go meet him.

453
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Here they are.

454
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Look at my vase.

455
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
This is from the past.

456
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Please excuse me.

457
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Let me go.

458
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I want the gold.

459
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Everyone, listen to me.

460
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,040
There is only one jar of the wine.

461
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,040
My master said that only rare items can be exchanged.

462
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Gold, silver, and house are not rare items.

463
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Why are you so rude?

464
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,040
We've been together for a long time.

465
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Why are you so rude?

466
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
I have.

467
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Who's this?

468
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Look at what he's holding.

469
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
It's a snake.

470
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
A hundred years ago, the snake was killed.

471
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,040
The legendary snake-eating wine

472
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
has long been lost in this world.

473
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,040
But a while ago,

474
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,040
someone found this wine.

475
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Snake-eating wine?

476
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
That's strange.

477
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Go ask your master if he wants it.

478
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Yes.

479
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Yes.

480
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,040
My master loves snake-eating wine.

481
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Please come in.

482
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Wait.

483
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,040
I have this wine too.

484
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,040
What kind of wine do you have?

485
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
It's an ancient wine.

486
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Since it's an ancient wine,

487
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
how did you get it?

488
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
I made it myself.

489
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
You made it yourself?

490
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Of course no one has ever drunk it.

491
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,040
It's also called the ancient wine.

492
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
How dare you come here

493
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,040
and show off your wine?

494
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Steward, my wine is indeed rare.

495
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
If you look at it,

496
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,040
you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

497
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Please show me.

498
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,040
It will take another half day

499
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
to make it.

500
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Steward, he's obviously lying.

501
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
You don't have to waste time on him.

502
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Give me the right to drink.

503
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
After half a day,

504
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
if my wine is rare,

505
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
I'll give the right to drink to someone else.

506
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Steward, if my wine is rare,

507
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
I believe your master

508
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
will be in debt for life.

509
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Wait.

510
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
You can think about it.

511
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Brothers, let's go.

512
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Wait.

513
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Please wait.

514
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
It's only half a day.

515
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
After that,

516
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
I'll let my master

517
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,040
taste your wine.

518
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Then we'll decide

519
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,040
who will be the one to give the right to drink.

520
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Thank you.

521
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Thank you.

522
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Boss,

523
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
you're back to learn how to make wine?

524
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
No, I'm sorry.

525
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Time is running out.

526
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Let's split up.

527
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
I'm going to buy some wine.

528
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
You guys find some

529
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
fine wine,

530
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
porcelain,

531
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
and mint leaves.

532
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Oh, right.

533
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,040
And some sugar and salt.

534
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Fine wine,

535
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
mint leaves,

536
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
sugar,

537
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
and mint leaves.

538
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Mint leaves,

539
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
sugar,

540
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
and mint leaves.

541
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
No.

542
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Boss,

543
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
can we make wine with these?

544
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Go.

545
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Don't be so impatient.

546
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Hello.

547
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Where's the wine?

548
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Over there.

549
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Thank you.

550
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
It's been half a day.

551
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
I think this person

552
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
is a fraud.

553
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
He's a real bastard.

554
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
He wouldn't dare to come again.

555
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
We don't have to wait for him.

556
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
In that case, please.

557
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Wait.

558
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Master,

559
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
the guests are here.

560
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Let them in.

561
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Yes.

562
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Please come in.

563
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Greetings, Master.

564
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Greetings, Master.

565
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,040
You have wine?

566
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Master,

567
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,040
I have a bottle of wine.

568
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Master.

569
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Good.

570
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,040
You deserve the wine.

571
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,040
It's refreshing after drinking.

572
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
It's very romantic.

573
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Master,

574
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
where's your wine?

575
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Master,

576
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
drinking my wine

577
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
from the eye to the mouth

578
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
to the top

579
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
is complete.

580
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Master.

581
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Master.

582
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Master.

583
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Master.

584
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Master.

585
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Master.

586
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Master.

587
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Master.

588
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Master.

589
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Master.

590
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Master.

591
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Master.

592
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Master.

593
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,040
Master.

594
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Master.

595
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Master.

596
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
Master.

597
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Master.

598
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Master.

599
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Master.

600
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Master.

601
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
Master.

602
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Master.

603
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Master.

604
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Master.

605
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Master.

606
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Master.

607
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Master.

608
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Master.

609
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,360
The approximately lighter next to older lapdog

610
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,480
was a dog that was fit for a snow white Trevius.

611
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,580
They do not go out in winter and the cool winter

612
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,040
makes them feel warmer.

613
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:21,260
They go out at night to sleep as before warmun 체 insect

614
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,160
to get Suite PROCABENT FULL SPEED.

615
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,880
They are only defeated atıldı.

616
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
Master.

617
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Master.

618
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,880
What is your name?

619
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Master.

620
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,880
When there is trouble in the world,

621
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,880
there is no hope.

622
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,880
This wine is called no hope.

623
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
Master.

624
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,880
I am drunk.

625
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,880
I dreamt of my family.

626
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,880
I am drunk.

627
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,880
No hope.

628
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,880
No hope.

629
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,880
No. This wine is very good.

630
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,880
If we talk about the taste,

631
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
it is just ordinary wine.

632
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,880
But it is mixed with the sugar water.

633
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,880
The taste changes suddenly.

634
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Especially the last touch of salt and mint.

635
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,880
It is a bold move.

636
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,880
I never thought that

637
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,880
there would be such delicious wine.

638
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Good. Very good.

639
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Wait.

640
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,880
He is just using some tricks to confuse people.

641
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Wine is wine.

642
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
You are adding seven or eight in this wine.

643
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Is it wine?

644
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
The taste of this wine is the taste.

645
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Why bother the taste?

646
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Right? Master.

647
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
You are right.

648
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Grandpa.

649
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Grandpa.

650
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,880
We want to drink too.

651
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Children can't drink.

652
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
You are making it difficult for me.

653
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Master.

654
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
You see.

655
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Children.

656
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
You can't drink too much.

657
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
Come here.

658
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,880
Go.

659
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,880
I will make you another one.

660
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
Good.

661
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Come.

662
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
Try it.

663
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Try it.

664
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Is it good?

665
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
It is good.

666
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
Grandpa.

667
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
What is this?

668
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Grandpa. It is good.

669
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Sister.

670
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
It is good.

671
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
It is good.

672
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
It is good.

673
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
It is good.

674
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
It is good.

675
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
It is good.

676
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
It is good.

677
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Drink more.

678
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Go.

679
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Okay.

680
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Be careful.

681
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Master.

682
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,880
You are...

683
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Dou Ru Yu Qi Lin.

684
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,880
You are so evil.

685
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Your wine can make you feel better.

686
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
But this master's wine

687
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
makes me feel better.

688
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
I thought I made wine

689
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
to the best.

690
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
But I am so bad.

691
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
So I am so bad.

692
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
I never thought

693
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,880
the wine is so rich.

694
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
It is not only that.

695
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I

696
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I am so bad.

697
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,880
May I ask your name?

698
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I am Xiao Qiu Shui from the Sword Sect.

699
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
You are so young.

700
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,880
I am so grateful.

701
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Steward.

702
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Yes, master.

703
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Give the snake snake blood wine

704
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
to this lady.

705
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,880
And give her a thousand taels of silver.

706
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Yes.

707
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,880
The drunk royal power

708
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,880
belongs to Mr. Xiao.

709
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Thank you.

710
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I never thought

711
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
the ink

712
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
can work.

713
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
I thought we would be kicked out.

714
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Boss.

715
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
No wonder you want to buy

716
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
those wide and narrow bottles.

717
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
You want to make wine

718
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
and make it stronger.

719
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
What a pity.

720
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
I didn't drink the ink.

721
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
You like it?

722
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
I will make it for you later.

723
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
Finally,

724
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
we got it.

725
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
This...

726
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,880
You are bad-mouthed

727
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
and you are so shy.

728
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
You are not a good person.

729
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
You are better than me.

730
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
You are a bandit.

731
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Give me the drunk royal power.

732
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
What?

733
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Under the light of day,

734
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
you still want to make it?

735
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Yes.

736
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Be careful.

737
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Boss.

738
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Are you okay?

739
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
I'm fine.

740
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
He has hidden weapons.

741
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Be careful.

742
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Sister.

743
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
Sister.

744
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Why are you here?

745
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Why are you here?

746
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Sister?

747
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Sister.

748
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
I went out with my friend.

749
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
Sister.

750
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
This is Xiao Qiushui.

751
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Come.

752
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
You always go out

753
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
to play with this Xiao Qiushui.

754
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Sister.

755
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Sister.

756
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Qiushui is very nice to me.

757
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Qiushui.

758
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
This is the Tang Fang of Jiajie.

759
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Tang Rong.

760
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,880
I think you are not good at making friends.

761
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Sister.

762
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Why do you want the drunk royal power?

763
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
Step aside.

764
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
Sister.

765
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Qiushui is my friend.

766
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Don't do this.

767
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
Tang Rong.

768
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
You don't have to be in the middle.

769
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
The drunk royal power is here.

770
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Do you have to be quiet?

771
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
Give it to me.

772
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
You fell.

773
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,880
Don't show your face.

774
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Sister.

775
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Qiushui wants the drunk royal power

776
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
to save a friend's life.

777
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
I don't know what sister

778
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
wants to do with the drunk royal power.

779
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
But nothing

780
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,880
is more important than a person's life.

781
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
The Iron and Jade Order

782
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
ordered me to use the drunk royal power

783
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
to knock open and knock out different doors.

784
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
Do you think

785
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,880
someone's life is important?

786
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Tang Rong.

787
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,880
What does she mean?

788
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,880
The Iron and Jade Order

789
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
must be mine.

790
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
I'm sorry.

791
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
I'm sorry.

792
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,880
I'm sorry.

793
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,880
I'm sorry.

794
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,880
I'm sorry.

795
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,880
I'm sorry.

796
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm sorry.

797
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,880
I'm sorry.

798
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
I'm sorry.

799
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I'm sorry.

800
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,880
I'm sorry.

801
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
I'm sorry.

802
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,880
I'm sorry.

803
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
I'm sorry.

804
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
I'm sorry.

805
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,880
I'm sorry.

806
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,880
I'm sorry.

807
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
I'm sorry.

808
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,880
I'm sorry.

809
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I'm sorry.

810
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm sorry.

811
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
I'm sorry.

812
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,880
I'm sorry.

813
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
I'm sorry.

814
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,880
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm sorry.

816
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
I'm sorry.

817
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,880
I'm sorry.

818
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm sorry.

819
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
I'm sorry.

820
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
I'm sorry.

821
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,880
I'm sorry.

822
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,880
I'm sorry.

823
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,880
I'm sorry.

824
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,880
I'm sorry.

825
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
I'm sorry.

826
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,880
I'm sorry.

827
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm sorry.

828
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,880
I'm sorry.

829
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,880
I'm sorry.

830
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,880
I'm sorry.

831
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
I'm sorry.

832
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,880
I'm sorry.

833
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,880
Who and how many love are there

834
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Thousands of years of longing and longing

835
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:39,880
Tears fall like wind and the night is silent

836
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Who and how many love are there

837
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Thousands of years of longing and longing

838
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Tears fall like wind and the night is silent

839
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:07,880
The falling star follows and chases me
