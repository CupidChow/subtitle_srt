Tencent Video presents

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,040
The Love

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,120
Part 2

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,840
Do not ask my love

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,800
to attend your travel

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,640
Many times

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,240
Buy

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,160
But at the last moment

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,040
I am convinced

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,520
No more explanations

12
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,520
I open my eyes

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,520
I want to wait for you

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,520
to come

15
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
to the mountain sea

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Do you feel sweet in your youth?

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Peace, Li Ziyuan

18
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,520
Li Ziyuan invites you to watch the mountain sea

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
Love him beautiful, be proud, self-protect and be active

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Invite you to watch the mountain sea

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:23,340
The

22
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,340
You know

23
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
The one behind the golden and silver front

24
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
Who is behind it?

25
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
Who?

26
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
The god and demon of the power gang

27
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
Fu Tianyi

28
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,340
What if it's him?

29
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Boss

30
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
You always say we have to investigate the justice

31
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,340
You are the most fearless

32
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
I feel like

33
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,340
You've changed more today

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Actually because

35
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,340
Because

36
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,340
I know

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Because the power gang has never been aware of the police

38
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
Boss is worried

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
If we are found

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
They have a reason to attack the police

41
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
So

42
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
You want us to sneak attack, right?

43
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm still a little lucky

44
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Yes

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,340
It seems that it's still Xiaorou

46
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,340
She knows me the most

47
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,340
That's what I'm talking about

48
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,340
You are really the boss

49
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
The thinking pattern is really big

50
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,340
It makes sense

51
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Boss, don't worry

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,340
Before I met you

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,340
We are just three

54
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,340
You are the one who led us to start the justice

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,340
You just want to do it

56
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,340
You make the decision

57
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,340
We listen to you

58
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Ok

59
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,340
Then tomorrow

60
00:03:51,340 --> 00:04:18,320
We will go to the

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
By the way, Tang Ruo

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Maybe you don't want to go to the meeting

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Why

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
Because

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Because

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
I met a fortune teller the other day

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
I calculated one for you

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
You go this time

69
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
There will be danger

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
No

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
No, why are you laughing?

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
I said it's real

73
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Boss

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Boss

75
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
We are not in danger every time

76
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Moreover

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Even if I am afraid

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm not afraid of the rain

79
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
I said you don't have to be so big

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
I'm serious with you

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Boss

82
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Why are you so motherly

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
I'm not being counted by him

84
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Come down and look

85
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Come down

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
I'm not a fortune teller

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,760
Let's continue

88
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,260
Five

89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,780
Four

90
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,780
Three

91
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,100
Two

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,420
One

93
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,380
Stop

94
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,380
Sorry

95
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,380
Just let me have enough

96
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,380
I'm worried

97
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,380
I told you to look

98
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,380
But stock has left

99
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,380
I want 6

100
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,380
Store is open

101
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,420
No

102
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,420
Boss, you two drink tea first.

103
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,420
This bun looks good.

104
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Drink water.

105
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
This weather is too hot.

106
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
What's going on?

107
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
Let me go.

108
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
I'll help you.

109
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Let me go.

110
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
Please spare my life.

111
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,420
Please spare my life.

112
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
I'll give you another day.

113
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Tomorrow noon,

114
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
if you don't hand over the money to the money house,

115
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
I'll burn you down.

116
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,420
Stop.

117
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
What are you doing?

118
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
What?

119
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
You want to get out?

120
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
So what if I do?

121
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
Young Master,

122
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,420
don't do it.

123
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,420
Don't do it.

124
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
If you fight here,

125
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,420
my business will be ruined.

126
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Yes.

127
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Did you hear that?

128
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,420
There's a lot of controversy.

129
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
One day.

130
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,420
Yes.

131
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
One day.

132
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
Let's go.

133
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Let's go.

134
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Are you okay, you two?

135
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Thank you, Young Master.

136
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Tang Rong,

137
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
why don't you go over there

138
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,420
and ask the boss about what's going on?

139
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
Boss, what's wrong?

140
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
Don't mention it.

141
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
We got a family.

142
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
We got a family.

143
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,420
We finally bought a boat

144
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,420
and made a camp.

145
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
In the past,

146
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
we were all

147
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,420
giving gifts to the water and the heaven.

148
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Now,

149
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
we're on the river,

150
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,420
and we're being searched by the money house.

151
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
We just got two years off the war.

152
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
We can make a profit.

153
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,420
The camp can't be managed.

154
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,420
Money house?

155
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,420
Why is it him again?

156
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
Why is the money house so domineering?

157
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
No one in the Wu Ben County

158
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,420
dares to offend the money house.

159
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,420
He told you to live or die.

160
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Yeah.

161
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Here they are.

162
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Han Pi Cui is here.

163
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Let's not talk about it.

164
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Let's go.

165
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Boss,

166
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,420
it seems that your clues were not wrong.

167
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
You're bullying me.

168
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
Boss,

169
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
we have to go to the money house.

170
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Yes.

171
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,420
Are you in such a hurry?

172
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,420
We have to plan it.

173
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Besides,

174
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
we haven't even got the noodles.

175
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
Come on, let's go.

176
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
What plan?

177
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
We don't have time to plan.

178
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Let's go, boss.

179
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
Let's go.

180
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,420
I'm hungry.

181
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
Let's go.

182
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
Boss, this way.

183
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
Sir, we don't have noodles.

184
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
What's going on?

185
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
It's here.

186
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Here, guys.

187
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Here, take it.

188
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
After you go in,

189
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
don't reveal your identity.

190
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Take it all.

191
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Boss,

192
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
we're here to uphold justice.

193
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,420
No need to take it.

194
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,420
Yeah.

195
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,420
Let's go.

196
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
It's late at night.

197
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Take it.

198
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
Well,

199
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
the buns are not comfortable.

200
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,420
I'll go to the hair salon.

201
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
I'll go to the hair salon.

202
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
I'll go to the hair salon.

203
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
I'll go to the hair salon.

204
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,420
You must be careful.

205
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Don't go.

206
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
Don't go.

207
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
You're doing this again, aren't you?

208
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
I see.

209
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
You want to scold us

210
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
like last time,

211
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
and then face the wall alone,

212
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
right?

213
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Boss,

214
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
I'm telling you,

215
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,420
this time, it's definitely not going to work.

216
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
Yeah.

217
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,420
I'm not kidding with you guys.

218
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
Anyway, I'm telling you,

219
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,420
it's very dangerous in here.

220
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
You have to be careful.

221
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,420
Got it?

222
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,420
You must be careful.

223
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,420
There's really nothing we can do.

224
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Let's go.

225
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
What do you mean?

226
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
Where are you going?

227
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Where are you going?

228
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Isn't the door over there?

229
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
Boss,

230
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
make way.

231
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
What...

232
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
What?

233
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Make way.

234
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
What?

235
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Oh my god.

236
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,420
It really can fly.

237
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
How about

238
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
I try it too?

239
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
No way.

240
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
I don't have any of these in the Qing palace.

241
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Who is this?

242
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Who is this?

243
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Who is this?

244
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
Who is this?

245
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
This is the owner of He Han Street today.

246
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:58,120
This is the

247
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
engage�

248
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Who is this?

249
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,420
Are you testing yourself then?

250
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Why did they gather here?

251
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
You know

252
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
who runs this place?

253
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
Isn't Yadi in the F 140,

254
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
Feng Tianyi after all?

255
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
Now you guys know it.

256
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Get out of here.

257
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,420
We're doudn.

258
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
We need to

259
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
get rid

260
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,540
Are we ingredients?

261
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,720
You can't even put it in words.

262
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,800
Break them into pieces

263
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,700
and serve in the

264
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,340
Yes.

265
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:12,560
A warm

266
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,020
player

267
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,700
So in my next nope

268
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
It's not easy to kill in the capital.

269
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,420
Fei Bing.

270
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,860
They are so good at playing chess.

271
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,300
No wonder they are so good at playing chess.

272
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,460
These little guys are pretty good.

273
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,820
Blood.

274
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,820
This is blood.

275
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,780
What?

276
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
What's wrong?

277
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,700
Where isIF?

278
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,660
Wh Polish Mo.

279
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,880
Later.

280
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,500
Okay.

281
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,620
Boss Chuan, where are you going?

282
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,380
Young Hero, you are...

283
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,780
Don't you remember?

284
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,060
Yesterday, you were bullied at the dock.

285
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,740
We brothers helped you out.

286
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,260
It's Young Hero.

287
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,220
It's Young Hero.

288
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,020
He knows nothing.

289
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,020
We've gathered some money

290
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,940
and I'm going to send it to the Gold and Silver Manor.

291
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,740
Yes.

292
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,380
I hope they can let us go.

293
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,260
Yes.

294
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,060
You don't have to go.

295
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,940
Someone has helped you out.

296
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,060
How is that possible?

297
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,620
That's the Gold and Silver Manor of the Power Gang.

298
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,740
Yes.

299
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,500
Don't worry.

300
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,580
No one will bully you anymore.

301
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,340
Thank you, Young Hero.

302
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,980
Thank you, Young Hero.

303
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,740
Go. Go.

304
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,580
Kid.

305
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,820
You asked someone to destroy the Gold and Silver Manor?

306
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,220
Yes.

307
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,460
The Gold and Silver Manor is a waste of money.

308
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,420
It's a waste.

309
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,340
It should be destroyed.

310
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,020
Are you okay?

311
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,820
No.

312
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,340
Young Hero.

313
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,420
Shut up.

314
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,060
The man who jumped from the wind

315
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,820
on the stone of the river bank.

316
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,380
He's the Heavenly Emperor of Heavenly Dragon.

317
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,700
I've been hiding for a long time.

318
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,700
Why haven't I seen him?

319
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,180
The plot is so mysterious.

320
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,020
You go first.

321
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,980
Okay.

322
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,140
Don't move.

323
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,260
Kneel.

324
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,100
Kneel.

325
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,540
Be good.

326
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,660
Kneel.

327
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,540
I didn't expect

328
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,100
the Gold and Silver Manor

329
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,660
would collude with the North Chinese.

330
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,700
But they're too stubborn.

331
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,540
I can't tell where the chief is.

332
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,020
We've been fighting all night.

333
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,180
We still can't find the whereabouts of the Heavenly Demon.

334
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,180
These three young heroes are too powerful.

335
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,820
Did you see that?

336
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,620
They destroyed the Gold and Silver Manor.

337
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,340
Tang Rong.

338
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,260
I have something to tell you.

339
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,060
What is it?

340
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,380
Be careful.

341
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,900
What's wrong?

342
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,940
What's wrong?

343
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,580
Nothing.

344
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,420
Remember.

345
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,860
You must be careful of a man who's wearing an umbrella.

346
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,260
A man who's wearing an umbrella.

347
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,900
You're really superstitious.

348
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,820
Well...

349
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,180
Besides,

350
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,660
it doesn't look like it's going to rain.

351
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,500
Can you be serious?

352
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,580
I'm not kidding.

353
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,340
Remember what I said.

354
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,660
Be careful of the man who's wearing an umbrella.

355
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,660
Do you understand?

356
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,900
Everyone wears an umbrella.

357
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,980
Who am I supposed to be careful of?

358
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,860
You should be careful of the bad guys.

359
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,060
You should have listened to me.

360
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
It's going to rain.

361
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,260
Who's going to wear an umbrella?

362
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,020
Move.

363
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,140
Get them out.

364
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,500
Get them all out.

365
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,020
Get them all out.

366
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,740
It's these bad guys.

367
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,060
Yeah.

368
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,180
Get them all out.

369
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,620
Don't move.

370
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,180
Yeah.

371
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,900
Who are you?

372
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,620
We're the ones who killed Wei Ming.

373
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,780
You're still here.

374
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,420
We're here to tell you the truth.

375
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,500
We're...

376
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,220
You don't need to know our names.

377
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,180
We locked those bad guys in the backyard.

378
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,460
You can take them away.

379
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,220
The gold and silver money house has been occupied by the people.

380
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:10,500
As a small

381
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,260
Where are they?

382
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,740
You have to figure it out.

383
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,940
If you don't tell us now,

384
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,860
when we leave,

385
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,540
I'm afraid you'll be the ones who will be in trouble.

386
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,100
Okay.

387
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,580
I'll take you there.

388
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,500
Oh my god.

389
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,340
He dodged the arrow and TB and we're screwed.

390
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,180
So the Afterfer should go to the

391
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,340
addition center.

392
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,340
Yes.

393
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,580
You remember the last time we met?

394
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,580
What are you talking about?

395
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,420
Besides,

396
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,100
where did I miss that arrow,

397
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,100
the last time we made trouble.

398
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,460
Yes.

399
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,140
Who was that person that shot the arrow?

400
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,140
You guys are so stupid.

401
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,780
What are you doing?

402
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,580
Come on, boss.

403
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Come on, boss.

404
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
The second skill of Explosion Sword,

405
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
Flying Sky.

406
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,340
The third skill,

407
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Golden Flower Leaf.

408
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
The fourth skill,

409
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
Full Moon Star.

410
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,140
Boss,

411
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
I got it.

412
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
I got it.

413
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
I got it.

414
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,140
I got it.

415
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
I got it.

416
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
I got it.

417
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Boss, are you okay?

418
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,140
Are you okay?

419
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
I'm fine.

420
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
So my subconscious

421
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
has memories of your martial arts.

422
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,140
The Flower Swordsmanship.

423
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,140
When did people from Xiao Xi House

424
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,140
dare to fight against our Power Gang?

425
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,140
I heard that you killed my people.

426
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Then you should stay and fill in the form.

427
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,140
Then use it for me.

428
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
You won't say no, will you?

429
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
What do you think?

430
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Of course we don't want to.

431
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,140
You dare to challenge us?

432
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,140
How can you guys be my enemies?

433
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,140
You're the first.

434
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,140
Of course you're not.

435
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
But if we're the first,

436
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
it's not necessarily.

437
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Do you think

438
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,140
you have four people?

439
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
It's not a thought,

440
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,140
but a fact.

441
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
What if I

442
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
let you lose one person?

443
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
One person?

444
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,140
Tan Rong!

445
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
Who's going to kill you?

446
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Are you okay?

447
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Tan Rong.

448
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
Luckily, I have this.

449
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
Right.

450
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Take this.

451
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
It's for defense.

452
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,140
A pair of pants?

453
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
This isn't my horse.

454
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,140
It's tied to the mountain.

455
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,140
No one can trick the people of our clan.

456
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,140
You, remember this.

457
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,140
The four of us

458
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
won't lose a single person.

459
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Then the four of you

460
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
will die.

461
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
Tan Rong.

462
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
Tan Rong.

463
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,140
Tan Rong.

464
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Tan Rong.

465
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
Tan Rong.

466
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140
Tan Rong.

467
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
Tan Rong.

468
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,140
Tan Rong.

469
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
Tan Rong.

470
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,140
Tan Rong.

471
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,140
Tan Rong.

472
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,140
Tan Rong.

473
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Tan Rong.

474
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Tan Rong.

475
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
Tan Rong.

476
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Tan Rong.

477
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Tan Rong.

478
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,140
Tan Rong.

479
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
Tan Rong.

480
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
Tan Rong.

481
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Tan Rong.

482
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Tan Rong.

483
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Tan Rong.

484
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
Tan Rong.

485
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
Tan Rong.

486
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Tan Rong.

487
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Tan Rong.

488
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
Tan Rong.

489
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,140
Tan Rong.

490
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
Tan Rong.

491
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,140
Tan Rong.

492
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Tan Rong.

493
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
Tan Rong.

494
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
Tan Rong.

495
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
Tan Rong.

496
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
Tan Rong.

497
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
Boss.

498
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,140
Boss.

499
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Charge.

500
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Go.

501
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,580
Catch Nie번이 using all of us

502
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,680
Are you all right?

503
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,820
I'm ok

504
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,480
The stone crocodile memos

505
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,120
bear this enough

506
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,420
He's really not weak

507
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,600
Scientific

508
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:43,720
But

509
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,160
take the sword into our weapon and frame it with our sword ammonia.

510
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,660
What a great move.

511
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,400
Definitely put in some efforts.

512
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,140
What呀

513
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,220
Are these Yang Shaping Swords or Baotang Swords?

514
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,660
Stone face?

515
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,420
yes yes

516
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,440
Please rattling

517
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Boss, we won!

518
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
We won!

519
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Tang Rou,

520
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,440
thank goodness you're still here.

521
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Of course I'm here.

522
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
I'm sorry.

523
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm sorry.

524
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
I...

525
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
Mengmeng,

526
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,440
I actually used the Xiao family's martial arts

527
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
to kill this Fu Tian Yi.

528
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Of course it's martial arts.

529
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Otherwise, what else can you use?

530
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,440
I think the Power Gang is not that great.

531
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
If we kill this Iron Man today,

532
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
tomorrow, we can kill all the eight Heavenly Kings

533
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
and the 19 Demon Gods.

534
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
That's right.

535
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Kill them all!

536
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
The eight Heavenly Kings and the 19 Demon Gods?

537
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
That's right.

538
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
The Power Gang is attacking the Power Gang

539
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,440
because they found out we killed Fu Tian Yi.

540
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
That's bad.

541
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Yu'an, Chaoran,

542
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
go get some money

543
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
and block the entrance to the boat.

544
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Tang Rou, go buy a boat

545
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
and get some fuel.

546
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Why?

547
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
What do you mean why?

548
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,440
Hurry up!

549
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Don't waste our time.

550
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Go!

551
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Let's go.

552
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,440
It's really dead.

553
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
I...

554
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
I...

555
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
What did I do?

556
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Go.

557
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Are we...

558
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Are we in the Fire Tribe?

559
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Brothers,

560
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,440
don't think too much.

561
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Before it gets dark,

562
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
please leave the Self-Defense Force.

563
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Let's go.

564
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Go.

565
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Go.

566
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Go.

567
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Go.

568
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
Go.

569
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Go.

570
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Go.

571
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Sir, your food is here.

572
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Okay.

573
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Sir, please enjoy.

574
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Thank you.

575
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Here.

576
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
We should have gone far enough.

577
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
We can finally eat something to rest our mind.

578
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Let's eat.

579
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Brothers, come.

580
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
It's said that

581
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
we are trying to get rid of Wei Wu Lin.

582
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Why is he acting like a thief?

583
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Yes, Boss.

584
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Come here.

585
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Why are you still here?

586
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm afraid of death.

587
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Afraid of death?

588
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
When did we ever fear death?

589
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Yes.

590
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
I've known you for so many years.

591
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,440
This is the first time I've heard you say that you're afraid of death.

592
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Are you sick?

593
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Let's do it together.

594
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Let me ask you.

595
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Kill one devil or ten devils?

596
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Of course, kill ten.

597
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
Yes.

598
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
There's a saying.

599
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,440
Be low-key and don't cheat.

600
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
You're right.

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Look.

602
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Today, the four of us

603
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
killed one devil

604
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
and got lucky.

605
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,440
What if the rest of the power gang

606
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,440
chased after us?

607
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Then we must be done for.

608
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
So

609
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,440
we must hide

610
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,440
and grow our strength.

611
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Finally,

612
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
we must get our revenge.

613
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
When we have the strength,

614
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
we will fight against the power gang.

615
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Then we will kill them all.

616
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Come on, brothers.

617
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Yes.

618
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Brother, please.

619
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,440
It makes sense.

620
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,440
I'm starving.

621
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
I see.

622
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
You want to get your strength back.

623
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,440
You will fight against the power gang.

624
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
You're really good at it.

625
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,440
I admire you.

626
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,440
What do you mean?

627
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
I know.

628
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Boss, we were talking about

629
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
the thing before.

630
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Today is the right time.

631
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Yes, boss.

632
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Today is the right time.

633
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Yes.

634
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Just let him go.

635
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
How can I?

636
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,440
You said it yourself three months ago.

637
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,440
When we are done with the real thing,

638
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,440
we will form the God-bearing Pavilion.

639
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Tang Rou.

640
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,440
God-bearing Pavilion?

641
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Isn't it the Jin family's brother?

642
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Boss, what's wrong with your memory?

643
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,440
You said

644
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
not only to the Jin family,

645
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
but also to the world.

646
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,440
So we form the God-bearing Pavilion.

647
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,440
Today is the day we become the God-bearing Pavilion.

648
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
The original water is really rebellious.

649
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
God-bearing Pavilion?

650
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
It's a name.

651
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
It's a bad name.

652
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
Boss.

653
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
This is...

654
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Boss.

655
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
This is a poison.

656
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Boss.

657
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Is there a needle?

658
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
A needle?

659
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,440
This... this knife won't be rusty, will it?

660
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Why are they so fierce?

661
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
God-bearing Pavilion.

662
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
The moon is the sword.

663
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
God-bearing Pavilion.

664
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Let's live and die together.

665
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Are they really busy?

666
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
What's wrong, boss?

667
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Drink.

668
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Drink.

669
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
It's painful.

670
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
From today on,

671
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,440
we'll live and die together.

672
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
Live and die together?

673
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,440
Yes, boss.

674
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
It's easy to say.

675
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,440
It's not necessary to live and die together, right?

676
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
That's true.

677
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,440
If the day of life and death is really coming,

678
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,440
I'm willing to give this chance to you.

679
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Me too.

680
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Agreed.

681
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Why are you talking so seriously?

682
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Come on.

683
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
Get up.

684
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Get up.

685
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Don't kneel.

686
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
We're serious.

687
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,440
Is it really worth your trust

688
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,440
in Xiao Qiushui?

689
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
I escaped from the gate that year

690
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
and was tricked by a traitor.

691
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
It was my brother who tried his best to lure the traitor away.

692
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
That's why I escaped from the heaven.

693
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
At that time,

694
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
we just met by chance.

695
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Boss,

696
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,440
when I went out with Chaoran,

697
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Haoyong was very hurt.

698
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
You just happened to pass by

699
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
and guarded us for three days and nights in the temple.

700
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
From that day on,

701
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,440
I knew you were my brother who lived and died together.

702
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Boss,

703
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Shenzhou is born for the hero.

704
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
As long as you're here,

705
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
the hero is here.

706
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Yes.

707
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Yes.

708
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Hey.

709
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
The more you talk, the less you get.

710
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

711
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Since you all call me boss,

712
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
that means you trust me.

713
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Then boss,

714
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,440
I'll be responsible for taking good care of you.

715
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,440
So we all have to live well.

716
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
That's right.

717
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
You're right.

718
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
I'm sorry.

719
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
I'll pour you some wine.

720
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,440
I'll pour you some wine first.

721
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
Xiao Qiushui

722
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
is a very good craftsman.

723
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
I can't let them down

724
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
with his identity.

725
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Okay.

726
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
As long as I can complete the task,

727
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
I'll go back.

728
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Before that,

729
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
I'll protect him.

730
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
I'll protect you.

731
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
I'll protect you.

732
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Before that,

733
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I'll protect them.

734
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
You're like a dragon with a huge head.

735
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
You should be a little more careful.

736
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
The flying dragon will start from the beginning.

737
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

738
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Eight.

739
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Eight.

740
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,440
The lung cancer warning is over.

741
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
The next step is to

742
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
officially use the Star Empty to live.

743
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
In addition,

744
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
from now on,

745
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
the difficulty will increase.

746
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Difficulty increases?

747
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,440
How do you know how to increase?

748
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
You can play with me.

749
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Okay.

750
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
I think Tang Rang saved him.

751
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
The lung cancer was wrong.

752
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
If it happens again,

753
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
he'll really die.

754
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
But the strange thing is

755
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
he's still alive.

756
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
He's still alive.

757
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
He's still alive.

758
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
He's still alive.

759
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
He's still alive.

760
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
He's still alive.

761
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
He's still alive.

762
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
He's still alive.

763
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
He's still alive.

764
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
But the strange thing is

765
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
the death of the Fugitian Sect

766
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
has been a great sin for the Xiao family.

767
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
But I've already dealt with the body.

768
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,440
Why would I dream of the Xiao family being destroyed?

769
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Is it still not over?

770
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
No matter what,

771
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
we still have to be prepared.

772
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
We can't let the original owner's grievance happen again.

773
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
If you can become a phantom flower,

774
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
you can enter your own brain.

775
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
The devil will not be able to stop you.

776
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Is that the real thing?

777
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Then am I the phantom flower master?

778
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
The phantom flower master?

779
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Then I can lead the story.

780
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Isn't that a great joy?

781
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
How do I become the master

782
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
to change the story?

783
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:56,140
The explanation of the selection of the

784
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,440
Yang Mi's design is more than the content of my creation.

785
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
It means that the model still retains some of my designs.

786
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Then what about the switch mode I designed before?

787
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
If I remember correctly,

788
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
there is a sword

789
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
that is unbreakable at the bottom of this river.

790
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
The mountain here

791
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
has a white peony with martial arts.

792
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
There is a

793
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
mechanical gatling in the ruins.

794
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
There is also

795
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
the most important thing.

796
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
I have written a book

797
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
about a phantom flower.

798
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
His martial arts are strong

799
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
and he is very obedient to me.

800
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
As long as there is a link

801
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
in these paintings,

802
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
it will be easy to change the story direction.

803
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
If you want to change the story direction,

804
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
you can do it.

805
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
If you want to change the story direction,

806
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
it will be much easier.

807
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Rong!

808
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Yu Han!

809
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
Zuo Qiu!

810
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
Get up! Get up!

811
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Boss,

812
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
are you getting up a little too early?

813
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
What's early?

814
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
The sun is already setting.

815
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Why are you still sleeping?

816
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Boss,

817
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
it's raining.

818
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Are we still going out?

819
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
I told you that this is called sun rain.

820
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I won't get off if it rains.

821
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Hurry up! Let's go!

822
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
Boss,

823
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
look at this.

824
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Take it.

825
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
A sword that can't be cut by a sword.

826
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Isn't this a broken blade?

827
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
And that Jiat mechanism.

828
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
I don't understand.

829
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
It's just a bow.

830
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
What's the most ridiculous thing?

831
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,440
It's the big gray wolf who can teach martial arts.

832
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Hurry up!

833
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Why is this white wolf yellow?

834
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
It's because

835
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
it's a black wolf.

836
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
It's a black wolf.

837
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
It's yellow.

838
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,440
The system is going to increase the difficulty.

839
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
It means

840
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,440
I have to collect all the external patterns I wrote.

841
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,440
If I put in such a powerful NPC,

842
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
it won't leave me.

843
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Boss,

844
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,440
you called us up this early in the morning.

845
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
You haven't told us what we're going to do.

846
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Actually, I'm doing this

847
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,440
to be the sect leader of Huanhua.

848
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Sect leader?

849
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Boss,

850
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,440
are you kidding us?

851
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
I'm sorry.

852
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
I'm sorry.

854
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,440
I'm sorry.

855
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
I'm sorry.

856
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
I'm sorry.

857
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
I'm sorry.

858
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
I'm sorry.

859
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,440
I'm sorry.

860
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
I'm sorry.

861
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
I'm sorry.

862
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
I'm sorry.

863
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
I'm sorry.

864
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
I'm sorry.

865
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
I'm sorry.

866
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
I'm sorry.

867
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
I'm sorry.

868
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
I'm sorry.

869
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
I'm sorry.

870
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
I'm sorry.

871
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I'm sorry.

872
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm sorry.

873
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,440
I'm sorry.

874
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,440
I'm sorry.

875
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
I'm sorry.

876
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
I'm sorry.

877
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm sorry.

878
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
I'm sorry.

879
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
I'm sorry.

880
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm sorry.

881
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
I'm sorry.

882
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
I'm sorry.

886
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
I'm sorry.

887
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
I'm sorry.

889
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I'm sorry.

890
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
I'm sorry.

891
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm sorry.

892
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
I'm sorry.

893
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
I'm sorry.

894
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I'm sorry.

895
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm sorry.

896
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
I'm sorry.

897
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
I'm sorry.

898
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
I'm sorry.

899
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I'm sorry.

900
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
I'm sorry.

901
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
I'm sorry.

902
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
I'm sorry.

903
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
I'm sorry.

904
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I'm sorry.

905
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
I'm sorry.

906
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
I'm sorry.

907
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
I'm sorry.

908
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
I'm sorry.

909
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I'm sorry.

910
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
I'm sorry.

911
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
I'm sorry.

912
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,440
I'm sorry.

913
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440

I'm sorry.

928
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
I'm sorry.

930
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
I'm sorry.

931
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
I'm sorry.

932
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
I'm sorry.

933
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
I'm sorry.

935
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
I'm sorry.

936
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,440
I'm sorry.

940
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I'm sorry.

941
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,440
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,440
I'm sorry.

943
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
I'm sorry.

944
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
I'm sorry.

945
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
I'm sorry.

946
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440

I'm sorry.

951
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
I'm sorry.

952
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440

I'm sorry.

962
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
I'm sorry.

963
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
I'm sorry.

964
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
I'm sorry.
