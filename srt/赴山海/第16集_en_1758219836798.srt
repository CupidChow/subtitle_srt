1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
To be continued

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,100
Five.

3
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,520
It's not coming.

4
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,420
Is it over?

5
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,380
Who do you think you are?

6
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,060
Let go.

7
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,340
I don't want to.

8
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,020
Not anymore.

9
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,980
Qiabai,

10
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,540
don't go.

11
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,140
You'll hurt yourself.

12
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,100
So you can't outrun me.

13
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,320
Who son of a bitch!

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,480
You don't think I'll incite you よ decorim

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
You wanna go that far?

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,500
What are you gonna do?

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,260
You think you can take over,

18
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:15,260
The

19
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,260
You're really good at scheming.

20
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,260
Have you ever done it yourself?

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,260
When will you die?

22
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,260
I'm not interested in fighting with you.

23
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,260
If you want to die a happy death,

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,260
tell me what I want to know.

25
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,260
I don't have time to talk to you so much.

26
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
The one who will die,

27
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,260
if it's practical,

28
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,260
give me the world hero's order.

29
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,260
I will consider giving you a happy death.

30
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,260
Do you dare to kill me?

31
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
Xue Yue.

32
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Brother, where are Qu and others?

33
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
Xue Yue,

34
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
when you go to Hanshan,

35
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,260
you're really the King of Sword.

36
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
Qiu Shui...

37
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
Xia Yi.

38
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Qiu Shui.

39
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,260
What happened?

40
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,260
Qiu Shui didn't give up on Qu Yuan

41
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,360
and didn't give up on the

42
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,260
blind soldiers in Hanshan.

43
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,260
He risked his life to fight against them.

44
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,260
How could this happen?

45
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
Where is Qiu Shui?

46
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,260
Where is he?

47
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,260
Xue Yue.

48
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm going to find him.

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
I will cure him.

50
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,260
Xue Yue.

51
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
Don't be impulsive.

52
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,260
Qiu Shui has been telling us

53
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
to hurry back to the Sword House.

54
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,260
We can't let him down.

55
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Shan'er,

56
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,260
we're not in a sad state.

57
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,260
Now, Kaiyan

58
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,260
is going to the road

59
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,260
according to Qiu Shui's orders.

60
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,260
When he comes back,

61
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
we'll set off immediately.

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Yi Ren is right.

63
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,260
We'll set off immediately.

64
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,260
We can't be late anymore.

65
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
What about Qiu Shui?

66
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Is Kaiyan back?

67
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
No.

68
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
It's a group of people.

69
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,260
They're the soldiers chasing us in Hanshan.

70
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Be careful.

71
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
You're still playing the hero?

72
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
The world's best hero

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,260
has nothing to do with you.

74
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Why are you doing this?

75
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
The best hero is not my business.

76
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,260
And you don't want to get it.

77
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,260
You're tough.

78
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,260
It seems that you're not hungry enough.

79
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm not hungry.

80
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
I'm not hungry.

81
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm not hungry.

82
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
I'm not hungry.

83
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,260
I've been a father and son in the palace.

84
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
How could it be?

85
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
If I hold him back now,

86
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
I may be able to change the direction

87
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
of the story

88
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,260
when I learn the world of flowers.

89
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,260
If you're afraid I'll starve to death,

90
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,260
you have to solve my acupoint first.

91
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
It's almost time to let go.

92
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
I'm afraid it's not the heart of the human.

93
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
Forget it.

94
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
The hero power is useless

95
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
to me anyway.

96
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
How are you?

97
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,260
Are you hurt?

98
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Xiao Yi.

99
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
How are you?

100
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Are you okay?

101
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
How are you?

102
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
I didn't get hurt

103
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
much.

104
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
That's good.

105
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Qu Hanshan

106
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
set up an ambush here.

107
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,260
It seems that

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
there must be a chase.

109
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
It's not easy to stay here for long.

110
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,260
Brother.

111
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
Xu Yu.

112
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Bad news.

113
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
How is it?

114
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,260
I'm afraid that

115
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
An Lü Bang

116
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
knows that

117
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
San Di stole the map

118
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
and changed the place

119
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,260
where he ambushed.

120
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,260
The shortest route

121
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
is blocked by the rocks.

122
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,260
They can't get through.

123
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,260
Some brothers

124
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
are also attacked by them.

125
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
There are bandits and hunters.

126
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
What should we do?

127
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,260
If we come here,

128
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
we can only change the direction

129
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
of the story.

130
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,260
I'm afraid that

131
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
we can't get through.

132
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
I'm afraid that

133
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
if we come here,

134
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
we can only change the direction

135
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
of the story.

136
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
My father and the Dian Cang Sect

137
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,260
have always been friends.

138
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Besides,

139
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
if we change to the northwest,

140
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
we can also avoid the chase

141
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,260
of Qu Hanshan.

142
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
I'd like to ask you to bear with it.

143
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Change to the northwest

144
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
and rush to the Dian Cang Sect.

145
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Yes.

146
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
You haven't finished eating, have you?

147
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Where is the Hero's Order?

148
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
Why are you so angry?

149
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
I mean,

150
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
your cooking is really good.

151
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Why don't you eat?

152
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
You look smart this time.

153
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
I thought you had something

154
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
to do with it.

155
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Why can't I even

156
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
see it?

157
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
It's just a wine bottle.

158
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
I know.

159
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
There's poison in the meat.

160
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
When I designed Qu Hanshan,

161
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
I never thought

162
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
I'd live in this world.

163
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
I don't know what you think.

164
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Did you get kicked by a donkey?

165
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
You brought me back with a whole box of love.

166
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Let me tell you.

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
These poisons

168
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
are nothing to me.

169
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Do you know that this poison is called

170
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
Qi Juedu?

171
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
If you play tricks,

172
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
I'll make this poison

173
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
go deep

174
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
and cut off every vein of your body.

175
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
Actually,

176
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Mrs. Wu

177
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
never told me

178
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
where the Hero's Order is.

179
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Before Mrs. Wu and I

180
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
left,

181
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,260
she asked me to find

182
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
Yan Kuangtu's family.

183
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
She asked me to finish her wish.

184
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
That's all.

185
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,260
That's all I know.

186
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
I'll never see the coffin and never cry.

187
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,260
You've been ruined.

188
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
You're dead.

189
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,260
You're dead.

190
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,260
You're dead.

191
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,260
You're dead.

192
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
You're dead.

193
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
You're dead.

194
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
You're dead.

195
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
You're dead.

196
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
You're dead.

197
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
You're dead.

198
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
You're dead.

199
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
You're dead.

200
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
You're dead.

201
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,260
You're dead.

202
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,260
You're dead.

203
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
You're dead.

204
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
You're dead.

205
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
You're dead.

206
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
You're dead.

207
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
You're dead.

208
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
You're dead.

209
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
You're dead.

210
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
You're dead.

211
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
You're dead.

212
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
You're dead.

213
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
You're dead.

214
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
You're dead.

215
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
You're dead.

216
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Heaven grain.

217
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Heaven grain.

218
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,260
Human grain.

219
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Human grain.

220
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Human grain.

221
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Human grain.

222
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,260
Human grain.

223
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,260
Human grain.

224
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Human grain.

225
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
Human grain.

226
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Human grain.

227
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Human grain.

228
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Human grain.

229
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Human grain.

230
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
Human grain.

231
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Human grain.

232
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
And human grain.

233
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
Human grain.

234
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Human grain.

235
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Human grain.

236
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Oh my god.

237
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Human grain.

238
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
Human grain.

239
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
Human grain.

240
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
Human grain.

241
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,860
I want you to follow them

242
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
so that Shi Wang

243
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,860
can be like Zi Feng Huang

244
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,660
and be the dog of Mount Qu Han.

245
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,060
Yes.

246
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,460
I ordered them to secretly collect the Star Jun Pill.

247
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,860
If they do anything that will cause them to leave the palace,

248
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,460
you can treat them as rebels.

249
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
The Star Jun Pill

250
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,660
It took six hours to torture them with poison.

251
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,860
You are tougher than I thought.

252
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,460
The Star Jun Pill

253
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,660
Liu Sui Feng,

254
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,260
if there is a chance,

255
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,860
I will kill you.

256
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,660
You are useless.

257
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,860
You are not good at martial arts

258
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,260
and you are poisoned.

259
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,260
Even if the Gold Deity of the Grand Tower comes,

260
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,060
he can't save you.

261
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
Don't worry.

262
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,060
I will definitely do it.

263
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Xicheng.

264
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,660
Luo Xian Feng,

265
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm coming out.

266
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,260
The Star Jun Pill

267
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
I thought

268
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,860
it was that useless old soldier.

269
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,260
It's King Jian.

270
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,860
Liu Sui Feng.

271
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,260
I know he is in your hands.

272
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,660
So what?

273
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,060
Give it to me.

274
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,460
I won't settle this with you.

275
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
Settle?

276
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,060
Is it the trick you sent?

277
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,460
You made Zi Feng Huang and Kang Chu Yu

278
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,460
all punish me.

279
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
I haven't

280
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,860
settled this with you.

281
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,060
It seems that

282
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,260
we still have

283
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,660
such a long story to tell.

284
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,660
If so,

285
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,260
don't blame me

286
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,860
for stealing people.

287
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,260
The Black Mountain

288
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,660
The thing that helped me

289
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,060
is on Xiao Qiu Shui.

290
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,860
I just have to let him go.

291
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Liu Wu.

292
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Do you think Xiao Qiu Shui

293
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,660
will stay in the house

294
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,860
and wait for you?

295
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm here.

296
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
I'm here.

297
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm here.

298
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,460
I'm here.

299
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
I'm here.

300
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
I'm here.

301
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
I'm here.

302
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,460
I'm here.

303
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,460
I'm here.

304
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
I'm here.

305
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,460
I'm here.

306
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
I'm here.

307
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,460
I'm here.

308
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
I'm here.

309
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
I'm here.

310
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm here.

311
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
I'm here.

312
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
I'm here.

313
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm here.

314
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
I'm here.

315
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
I'm here.

316
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm here.

317
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
I'm here.

318
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
I'm here.

319
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm here.

320
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm here.

321
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
I'm here.

322
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
I'm here.

323
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
I'm here.

324
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
I'm here.

325
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
I'm here.

326
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
I'm here.

327
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
I'm here.

328
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
I'm here.

329
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,460
I'm here.

330
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
I'm here.

331
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
I'm here.

332
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
I'm here.

333
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
I'm here.

334
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
I'm here.

335
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
I'm here.

336
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,180
Assistant Jiu, do you have them?

337
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
No, I don't.

338
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,480
Do you have the service enlightenment with Yangji?

339
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:56,200
Yangji Flow Weed Rice

340
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Cousin,

341
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,460
Drink some water

342
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
You drink it.

343
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,540
You've been drinking water all day and night.

344
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,380
You can't hold on to it

345
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,020
by just playing tricks.

346
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,740
Today, our Xiao family is in trouble.

347
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,860
Although there are many heroes

348
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,940
who are willing to fight against the enemy,

349
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,180
I didn't expect

350
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,780
that we would be in such a dilemma.

351
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,700
If we can't wait for the reinforcements,

352
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,940
our Xiao Xi House

353
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,180
will be ruined.

354
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,860
Even if we die,

355
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,380
we will lead the disciples of the Xiao family

356
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,100
to fight against the enemy.

357
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,580
Shen Mei,

358
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,900
I'll leave

359
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,580
Meng Shi Di and the others to you.

360
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,660
Don't say such sad words.

361
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,660
Qiu Shui has gone to the Qiu Garden.

362
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,620
He's so smart.

363
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,220
He will definitely come back.

364
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,580
Third Brother,

365
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,020
you're the smartest

366
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,100
among the children.

367
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,780
I know

368
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,980
you won't let me down.

369
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,300
You won't.

370
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,740
I'm sorry.

371
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,020
Why didn't you

372
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,220
see your mother

373
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,420
in person?

374
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,500
The children of the Xiao family

375
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,740
are not only our three children,

376
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,540
but also the disciples of the Xiao family.

377
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
They are all the hope of the Xiao family.

378
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
If we can save them this time,

379
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,420
we won't be afraid of

380
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,860
the future of our Huanhua Sword Sect.

381
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,860
Drink the water first.

382
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,420
You drink it.

383
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,300
Be good.

384
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,980
Are you quipping?

385
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,980
I'm here to make the tea for you.

386
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,900
Thank you, Young Master Goes.

387
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
It's so sweet.

388
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,180
Come on.

389
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,060
don't focus on the

390
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,440
Decline Soul

391
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,860
anymore.

392
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,020
It's enough.

393
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,540
Who knows

394
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,780
that I, Liu Suifeng,

395
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,420
can take care of

396
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,420
everything

397
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,620
but quandoal question.

398
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,180
Among

399
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,980
Corrupt Soul,

400
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
I can't make it clear.

401
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
I deliberately left a few people alive.

402
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Master Liu Fu

403
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
was charged with killing the Wu Lin Sect.

404
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
It's considered as a fact.

405
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Since ancient times, the most vicious

406
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,480
has always been the human heart.

407
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
The snake is here.

408
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Snake.

409
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Snake.

410
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Snake.

411
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Snake.

412
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
It's Liu Xie Feng.

413
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Our hideout.

414
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
He's from the hideout.

415
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Brother,

416
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
the snake venom is extremely rare.

417
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
It's the king of the power gang.

418
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
It seems that the hideout is in danger.

419
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Young Master Zuo Qiu, Young Master Deng,

420
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,980
the hideout is 10 miles up the mountain.

421
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,480
Please go over the small path and go to investigate.

422
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
If there are survivors,

423
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
please help us.

424
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:36,980
Okay.

425
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,480
Brother Xiao,

426
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
you also be careful.

427
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,980
Goodbye.

428
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,480
We'll go too.

429
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Okay.

430
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Brother Liu,

431
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
please go.

432
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Okay.

433
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Go.

434
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Go.

435
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Go.

436
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Go.

437
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Go.

438
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Go.

439
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Go.

440
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Go.

441
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Go.

442
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Go.

443
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Go.

444
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Go.

445
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Go.

446
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
Go.

447
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Go.

448
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Go.

449
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Go.

450
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Go.

451
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Go.

452
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
Go.

453
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Go.

454
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Go.

455
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Go.

456
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Go.

457
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Go.

458
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Go.

459
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Go.

460
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Go.

461
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Go.

462
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
That was me.

463
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Watch out!

464
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Let me take a look.

465
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,440
hasta straight

466
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,500
What about it after Mr. De East

467
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,440
Someone can take away ha ha

468
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,960
You understand

469
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,840
Yes

470
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,560
I want i want

471
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,320
You see

472
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,800
Three hundred plus

473
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,480
You see

474
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,200
We're bilingual

475
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,960
Why do not you treat me like a creep

476
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:08,000
That's what

477
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,320
You'll get me

478
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,920
Tiers of Death!

479
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,100
Online Quaders!

480
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,280
Alan!

481
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,800
Alan...

482
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,400
Don't touch my clothes.

483
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,800
A

484
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,600
T natal power?

485
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,440
Since I wasאנ if in there,

486
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,200
I won't let go of it.

487
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:26,960
Ten thousand years.

488
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,480
I want to use this kind of trick to trap me.

489
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,480
I want to see if your trick is more powerful than my tongue.

490
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Go after him.

491
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Big brother,

492
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,280
someone came again.

493
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,280
Don't you see them?

494
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
只有在表 Loigan

495
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Are you stupid?

496
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,280
What a bravado!

497
00:23:47,520 --> 00:24:06,320
Go to the devil

498
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,080
Hurry up. We're rich.

499
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
We're rich.

500
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,280
We have no money.

501
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,080
We have money.

502
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,080
Let's go.

503
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,080
We have money.

504
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
We're rich.

505
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,880
Bao Si, what are you doing?

506
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,680
We're living.

507
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,480
We're so poor.

508
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,080
We're making money.

509
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,080
You're so fat.

510
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,280
We're living.

511
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,080
We have no money to make.

512
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,680
Yes.

513
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,480
We...

514
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,680
Let's go back to the river.

515
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,280
Wei Yu.

516
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,080
Let's go back.

517
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,080
Let go of my hand.

518
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
My foot hurts.

519
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,480
Young heroes.

520
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,480
You saved me.

521
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,680
Why are you trying to kill me?

522
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,080
Stop it.

523
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,080
We four have been catching corpses.

524
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
We've never caught a living person.

525
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,880
That's right.

526
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,280
We four were born to be dead.

527
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,280
You're dead.

528
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,080
And you're alive.

529
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
You're so bad.

530
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,880
Bad.

531
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,480
Stop talking nonsense.

532
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,080
Throw it back

533
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,280
before anyone finds it.

534
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,080
Yes.

535
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,880
You'll die in half an hour.

536
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:19,880
Then,

537
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
take it back.

538
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,280
Okay.

539
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
It hurts.

540
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Young heroes.

541
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Listen to me.

542
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,480
I need to talk to you.

543
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,880
Here's the thing.

544
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,480
Think about it.

545
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,880
The money earned by living people

546
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,080
is faster than the money

547
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
earned by dead people.

548
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,080
Right?

549
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Impossible.

550
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,480
Impossible.

551
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,480
The government has told us

552
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
that a corpse

553
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,680
can be rewarded

554
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,280
with five million.

555
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,880
No.

556
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,280
Not one million.

557
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,680
If we're alive,

558
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,080
we won't be rewarded.

559
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Yes.

560
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,680
How about this?

561
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,480
I'll reward you.

562
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Who do you think you are?

563
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,480
Right.

564
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,280
Why should I believe you?

565
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,680
Right.

566
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,480
Why should I believe you?

567
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,280
Right.

568
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,080
Why should I believe you?

569
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I think

570
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,880
it's not far from the villa of the flowers.

571
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,880
You can go with me

572
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
and we'll have a good time.

573
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,280
Flowers?

574
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,480
The flowers are in full bloom.

575
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,280
The flowers are in full bloom?

576
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,680
Look at his age.

577
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,880
Is he the third son of the Xiao family?

578
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,480
Xiao Qiushui?

579
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,680
Xiao Qiushui?

580
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,080
Xiao Qiushui?

581
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Right.

582
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,680
Xiao Qiushui.

583
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,480
Xiao Qiushui.

584
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,880
I...

585
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
Xiao Qiushui.

586
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,880
You've got the wrong person.

587
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,680
I'm not Xiao Qiushui.

588
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
Xiao Qiushui's men

589
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
killed San Ying.

590
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,680
He's Xiao Qiushui.

591
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Right.

592
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,080
He killed San Ying.

593
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,680
We're San Ying's brothers.

594
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
The one who killed San Ying

595
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
is our enemy.

596
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,280
Right.

597
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,080
Kill him.

598
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,680
Kill him.

599
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,680
Wait.

600
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,480
Young Hero.

601
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
What are you talking about?

602
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm not Xiao Qiushui.

603
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,280
How could I kill your brothers?

604
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
I don't even have a weapon.

605
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,680
If he didn't kill him,

606
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,280
then he's not Xiao Qiushui.

607
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,480
No.

608
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,280
Then why did he take us to the flower shop

609
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,080
and took a lot of money?

610
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,880
Right.

611
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,880
It's him.

612
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,680
Oh, no.

613
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,680
San Ying of the Lou family is the assistant of Yuan.

614
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,880
He was killed by Xiao Qiushui

615
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,280
when he first appeared in the opening.

616
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,680
According to the timeline,

617
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,480
I haven't come to this world

618
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,680
to be Xiao Qiushui.

619
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,280
Stop.

620
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,880
Stop.

621
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Kill him.

622
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,480
Kill him.

623
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,280
Kill him.

624
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I saved him.

625
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
You killed him.

626
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,280
Then we should save him or kill him.

627
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,080
San, why are you talking nonsense?

628
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,680
I remember.

629
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,480
I remember.

630
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,080
What did you say?

631
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,280
San...

632
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
San Ying.

633
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,680
Right. San Ying.

634
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Hero San Ying.

635
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,280
Everyone is very good at martial arts.

636
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,880
My martial arts is very ordinary.

637
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,080
I ask you.

638
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,880
How can I kill them?

639
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
I don't believe it.

640
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,880
No.

641
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,480
We don't believe it.

642
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,280
Think about it.

643
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,680
How many people are there in San Ying?

644
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,080
Three.

645
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,280
Three against one.

646
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,080
How can they lose to me?

647
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,080
Besides,

648
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
how many of you?

649
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Four.

650
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,880
More people, more power.

651
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
If you don't stand together,

652
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,480
how can you be in a group?

653
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,480
Right?

654
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,880
It makes sense.

655
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,680
It doesn't.

656
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,480
Why?

657
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,080
Can we beat San Ying?

658
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
We can't even beat San Ying.

659
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,080
We can't beat him.

660
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,480
How powerful are we?

661
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
Or are we less powerful?

662
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,480
How powerful are we?

663
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,680
Kill them first.

664
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,480
I won't talk to you.

665
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
It's too complicated.

666
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,880
I will explain it to you later.

667
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
When San Ying died,

668
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,680
I was not in this world.

669
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,280
I'm not Xiao Jiu Shui.

670
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Why do you kill?

671
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,680
I don't know why you are so stubborn.

672
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,080
No.

673
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,880
One year ago.

674
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,480
San Ying died one year ago.

675
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,280
He said he never came to this world.

676
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,680
He looks like a one-year-old.

677
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,680
Am I a water drop?

678
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,280
Stop talking nonsense.

679
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,880
If we listen to him,

680
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
we will be fooled by him.

681
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Right. We will be fooled by him.

682
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:20,880
Third.

683
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,480
Third.

684
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,280
Let's talk about it later.

685
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,080
Let's talk about it later.

686
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,680
Go.

687
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,480
What are you doing?

688
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,280
Don't come over.

689
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,880
You...

690
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,680
Kill him.

691
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,480
Wait.

692
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,880
San Ying

693
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,480
was hurt by Xiao Jiu Shui's men

694
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,080
with his sword, sword and secret weapon.

695
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,880
How can we kill him?

696
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
It's our revenge for San Ying.

697
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,280
You are so annoying.

698
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,880
What?

699
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,280
He has two hands and two feet.

700
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
He cut them all.

701
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,680
It's enough for us four.

702
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,080
He cut them all.

703
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Don't touch him.

704
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
Don't touch him.

705
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,480
No.

706
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,080
Li Ren.

707
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Xiu Yu, be careful.

708
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,880
You are really good at it.

709
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,680
The snake king is not only against you,

710
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,480
but also attacked the Fire King's ancestral hall.

711
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,280
It seems that he is determined

712
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,880
to surrender to the Mountain of Hanshan.

713
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,280
Xiu Yu.

714
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,480
Brother.

715
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,280
Retreat.

716
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,280
Brother.

717
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,080
Brother.

718
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,880
Brother.

719
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Good evening, Your Highness.

720
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,280
Shi Nian.

721
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Protect my brother.

722
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Chief Zhou.

723
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,880
Go.

724
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Shi Nian.

725
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,480
Go, Yiren.

726
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,080
Chief Zhou.

727
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,880
Go.

728
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,880
Come at me.

729
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Go.

730
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,280
Hong Feng Hua.

731
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,680
Why do you kill yourself and me?

732
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,480
You sent your men to investigate the Dian Cang Sect.

733
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,680
But you hid the Dian Cang Sect from us.

734
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,180
Now the Sword King is colluding.

735
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,540
If so, I won't be polite to you.

736
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,260
Little Qiu Shui is still alive.

737
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,660
Young Master, it's safe here.

738
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,920
You...

739
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,560
Ten years...

740
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,120
It took me countless years to make them grow up.

741
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,800
Now we're being sacrificed for each other...

742
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,360
I can't even count on them now.

743
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,160
Xiaoyao clan would live happily ever after.

744
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,920
But now he's about to die,

745
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,800
and now things are like that.

746
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,440
Why?

747
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
WHY?!

748
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Now we have lost Third Brother.

749
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,260
Are you really going to kill our Xiao family?

750
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,460
Eldest Brother.

751
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,060
What did you say just now?

752
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,260
Third Brother is gone.

753
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,460
Qiu Shui.

754
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,060
Isn't he in Fengyue and Yangshang?

755
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,860
Why is Third Brother gone?

756
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,460
I must have heard it wrong, right?

757
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
I heard it wrong.

758
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,860
Right, Eldest Brother?

759
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,460
Eldest Brother.

760
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,660
What happened to Qiu Shui?

761
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,860
What happened to Qiu Shui?

762
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,460
Xue Zhen.

763
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,660
Qiu Shui is dead.

764
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
He's dead!

765
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
That's impossible.

766
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:58,460
The flowers fall, leaving a scar on my face.

767
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,660
The wind blows, the night falls.

768
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,860
I go to see the stars at night.

769
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,060
Why didn't you tell me?

770
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
Xue Yue,

771
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,060
we didn't mean to hide it from you.

772
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,860
Qiu Shui,

773
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,460
he didn't want us to be blinded again.

774
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,660
He didn't believe that he would reveal the truth about me.

775
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:31,460
In the end, Qiu Shui told us to hurry back to Jianluo.

776
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,060
That was his last wish.

777
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,860
Eldest Brother, we can't let Qiu Shui die in vain.

778
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,660
Now,

779
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,460
my parents are in danger.

780
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,860
Second Brother is gone.

781
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,860
The family's important duties are on your shoulders and mine.

782
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,060
You must pull yourself together.

783
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,260
From Indeed and Done

784
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,260
Qingyuan Countain

785
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,860
My head!

786
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,700
Master.

787
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,900
It's the wind.

788
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,860
It's the wind.

789
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,140
It's the wind.

790
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,860
Listen,

791
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,740
we are the people of King Zhu.

792
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,420
Yes.

793
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,460
You are not afraid of us?

794
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,460
Stop pretending to be dead.

795
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,140
I only used my poison to test your pulse.

796
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,020
I won't disturb your speech.

797
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
You are a fool.

798
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,300
You can kill me.

799
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,820
That's right.

800
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,860
Okay.

801
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,340
I'll give you three incense sticks.

802
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,860
If these three incense sticks are all in,

803
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
I'll break their hands and feet.

804
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,860
Wait.

805
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,020
We have four people.

806
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,140
You have to give three incense sticks.

807
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,620
Isn't that one more?

808
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,300
Master.

809
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,940
Master.

810
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,660
You are right.

811
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,060
I'll give you three incense sticks.

812
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,380
You have to give three incense sticks.

813
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,580
You have to give three incense sticks.

814
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,660
You have to give three incense sticks.

815
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,500
This one?

816
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,420
Yes.

817
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,580
What are you doing?

818
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,780
What are you doing?

819
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,700
It hurts.

820
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,340
You.

821
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,260
You have three incense sticks.

822
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,940
This time, we are right.

823
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,780
Why don't you just hit his hands and feet

824
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,140
and force him to go in?

825
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,860
Yes.

826
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,380
Hit him.

827
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:12,940
Yes.

828
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,940
The four of them have nothing to do with this.

829
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,060
Duan's rooms don't have feelings and hatred.

830
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,460
We need to kill those who nuclei.

831
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,700
This can't be.

832
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,500
Master.

833
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,300
If this is the case,

834
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,060
There should be someone else auditioning.

835
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,700
I want to ask you again about

836
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,540
this.

837
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,500
What right do you have to do this?

838
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,700
Young Master Xiao.

839
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,540
I don't think you can see those people facing hardships together.

840
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,740
...

841
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,140
My Buren Rope.

842
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,540
Hurry up, tell me.

843
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,360
Hurry up, tell me.

844
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,060
My legs, hurry up.

845
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,640
Young Master.

846
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,260
They were forced to fight according to your plan.

847
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,180
They died without a plan

848
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,700
because of Being The Honorable King.

849
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,940
Your Highness,

850
00:39:52,100 --> 00:40:04,320
you issue from now of the

851
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,700
King alone.

852
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,460
It is not as you expected.

853
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,580
with Diet Cang faction

854
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,060
and the deceased and the whole Qu久分 Bl menstrual quarters.

855
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,060
can help you find out the whereabouts of the Hero Order.

856
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,060
That's an unexpected life.

857
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
You may leave.

858
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Yes.

859
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,060
Xiao Qiu Shui!

860
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,860
Xiao Qiu Shui!

861
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,860
Xiao Qiu Shui!

862
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
What do you think we should do?

863
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,460
What do you think we should do?

864
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
You're right.

865
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,260
We have really taken

866
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,460
a dead body from the tomb.

867
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,860
It's all your fault.

868
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,460
Everyone, it's all your fault.

869
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
Brother,

870
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,460
don't always touch my thigh, okay?

871
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,060
You're so drunk.

872
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,460
You're even holding a stone in your hand.

873
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
You're right.

874
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,460
Tell me.

875
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,060
Tell me where the Order is.

876
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,060
If Liu Pei Feng

877
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
lights up the incense again,

878
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,460
we'll be beheaded.

879
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,060
Tell me where it is.

880
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,260
Where is it?

881
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,260
Where is it?

882
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,260
No.

883
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,060
Brother, I'll tell you.

884
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,060
I'm really sorry to have caused you trouble.

885
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I really don't know where the Order is.

886
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,260
He said he didn't know.

887
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,060
He said he didn't have the Order.

888
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,060
How about

889
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,860
we break his limbs too?

890
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,060
Even if he doesn't tell us,

891
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,460
we should find a fair way.

892
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,260
Find a fair way.

893
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:38,860
Yes.

894
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
I'll fight till here.

895
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,660
Yes.

896
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,460
I'll fight till here.

897
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,460
Don't.

898
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,460
I'll tell you.

899
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,860
What should I tell you?

900
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,260
Listen to me first, okay?

901
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,660
You're so noisy.

902
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,460
I'm asking you.

903
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,260
What does Liu Pei Feng want?

904
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,660
The Order of Heroes.

905
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
I've told you a thousand times.

906
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,060
I don't have the Order of Heroes.

907
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,660
No.

908
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,060
So what does he want?

909
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,060
I don't have the Order of Heroes.

910
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,460
If I don't have it, he'll kill us.

911
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,460
So I'm asking you.

912
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,460
What are we going to do now?

913
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,260
Let's form a team

914
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
and figure out a way

915
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
to break through the cage

916
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,860
and kill him.

917
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,260
Yes.

918
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:07,860
Brother.

919
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,460
Yes.

920
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,260
Why?

921
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,860
Yes.

922
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,660
You're lying.

923
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,060
No.

924
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,660
No.

925
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:12,860
No.

926
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,460
Anyway, Uncle Heng is dead.

927
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,460
You and I...

928
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,060
You and I are on the same side.

929
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,860
Don't pull me, okay?

930
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,460
I'm dying.

931
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,060
Liu Pei Feng.

932
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,860
Liu Shen.

933
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,860
Have you seen his life?

934
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,260
You can ignore

935
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,260
the lives of the four of them.

936
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,860
What about these people?

937
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,260
Where did you get this demon badge?

938
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,860
What did you do to my family?

939
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,260
It doesn't matter what I did.

940
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
I want to know what you should do.

941
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
The flowers are falling.

942
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,860
How many times have I missed you?

943
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,460
The wind blows.

944
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,260
It's like a song to bid farewell to a thousand songs.

945
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,860
Who can stop the heartbreak?

946
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,460
How many times have I fallen in love?

947
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,860
The sky and the earth are full of my wishes.

948
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,860
The tears fall.

949
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,860
The wind is not broken.

950
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,660
The grey clouds are like dust.

951
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,260
I can't sleep at night.

952
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,060
How many branches are in the world?

953
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,260
Where can I find the grass?

954
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,660
Love and hate are in the past.

955
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,860
The unreachable past is like a horse.

956
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,460
I miss the intersection of time.

957
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,260
I can't get rid of my destiny.

958
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,260
Who can give me a piece of the sword?

959
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,460
What's left of the ten years of love?

960
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,660
The sword is cut off by the sharp sword.

961
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,660
The sword is cut off by the sharp sword.

962
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,060
The flowers are falling.

963
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,460
The flowers are falling.

964
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,260
How many times have I missed you?

965
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,660
The wind blows.

966
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,660
It's like a song to bid farewell to a thousand songs.

967
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,060
Who can stop the heartbreak?

968
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,660
How many times have I fallen in love?

969
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,260
The sky and the earth are full of my wishes.

970
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,060
The tears fall.

971
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:28,260
The wind is not broken.

972
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,260
The flowers fall.

973
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,460
The stars fall with me.

974
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,460
The wind blows.

975
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,660
The flowers fall.

976
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,860
The stars fall with me.

977
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,860
The wind blows.

978
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,060
The flowers fall.

979
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,060
The wind blows.
