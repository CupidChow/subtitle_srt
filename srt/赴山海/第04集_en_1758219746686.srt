00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,260
Speaker Of The 예

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:19,220
Episode 10

3
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,260
Tang Ruo, Vincent is still Obi-Wan,

4
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,260
I guess I can't use up the Drunken Emperor Fist.

5
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,100
Your sister wants the Drunken Emperor Fist

6
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,100
not necessarily for the Drunken Emperor Fist.

7
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,660
Yes, sister.

8
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,980
Don't play tricks on me.

9
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,900
Go.

10
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,140
Boss.

11
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,140
Chaoran.

12
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,860
Yonghan.

13
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,900
Let's go to the Feng Palace to detoxify.

14
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,740
Hold on, this way.

15
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Hold on, this way.

16
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,380
Move from the sing.

17
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,620
I'll make some mijnge for you, sister.

18
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,860
Yok naron.

19
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,660
Yok naron.

20
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,020
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

21
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,980
I have nothing to talk to you.

22
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,820
Fine.

23
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,980
Let's not talk about it.

24
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,660
I'm warning you.

25
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,580
Wu Rou is simple-minded

26
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,900
and ungrateful.

27
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,140
He's calling you

28
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,340
one by one.

29
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,340
I'm afraid you've fooled him.

30
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,820
I don't care

31
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,020
what happened between you two.

32
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,940
But in the future,

33
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,780
stay away from me.

34
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,660
Okay.

35
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,140
You're smart.

36
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,660
I agreed.

37
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,020
But it's not up to me

38
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,420
whether Rou Di follows me or not.

39
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,420
You have to ask him.

40
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,660
Don't worry about it.

41
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,340
You just have to agree.

42
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,980
Your 송 공具

43
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,780
looks quite good.

44
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,460
Only knowledgeable

45
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,100
should know how to do this.

46
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,500
No one has the chance

47
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,580
I don't have a chance to ride the watch.

48
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,900
Look.

49
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,740
How about this three-inch one?

50
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,580
What do you mean?

51
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,940
What do you mean?

52
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,180
Are you scared?

53
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,020
I'm scared.

54
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,260
Let's do it.

55
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,260
Go.

56
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,300
No.

57
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,140
I have more.

58
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,620
A month later,

59
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,420
if you have nothing to do with Roudi,

60
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,660
I'll give you another watch.

61
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,460
You're a villain.

62
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,060
I can only blame the world.

63
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,060
Boss.

64
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,020
Boss.

65
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,420
All right.

66
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,140
I've unzipped Mr. Feng's poison.

67
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,660
Sister.

68
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,140
Give me the rest of the poison.

69
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
Well, sister.

70
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,980
The wine is already drunk.

71
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,460
Are you kidding me?

72
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,060
You can only blame the world.

73
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,140
What are you waiting for?

74
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,100
You're the one who's not in the right mind.

75
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,060
Boss.

76
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,700
Boss.

77
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,380
Boss.

78
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,220
Boss.

79
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,100
Boss.

80
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,180
What are you doing?

81
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,420
I have the same blood and teeth as the silver watch.

82
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,820
It depends on whether you want to eat this bone.

83
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,980
Don't you know how to brew wine?

84
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,020
Give me a bottle of wine.

85
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,820
I'll check it out tonight.

86
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,420
If it doesn't taste good,

87
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,660
you can try it.

88
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,540
Are you all right, boss?

89
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,340
Does it hurt?

90
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,940
Does it hurt?

91
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,940
It's weird if it doesn't hurt.

92
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,740
Tang Rou.

93
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,300
Can you get the rest of the watch

94
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,340
for boss?

95
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,660
It really hurts.

96
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,820
No, boss.

97
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,940
Every secret weapon of our sect

98
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,220
is made up of a sect.

99
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,340
If you don't get it,

100
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,620
you'll be in trouble.

101
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,580
What should we do?

102
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,700
What else can we do?

103
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,940
Let's deal with them.

104
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,580
My colleagues are controlling the dark spirit.

105
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,340
Young Master.

106
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,060
to find out such a traitor.

107
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,140
Is the childe's poison cured?

108
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,940
Otherwise, Ming Zhu will be killed.

109
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,620
You and Zi Feng Huang were close to each other.

110
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,580
But you didn't find out

111
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,300
what was the meaning of the case.

112
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,340
I swear to God that

113
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,660
I'm not a second-rate childe.

114
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,900
If you have any doubts,

115
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,100
just kill me now.

116
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,940
I haven't killed you yet.

117
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,580
Don't say anything.

118
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,900
Zheng Tai Yang.

119
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,540
Where is Madam Wu?

120
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,540
Hand over the Order of Heroes.

121
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,980
I'll spare your life.

122
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,100
Zi Feng Huang.

123
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,260
You've been too much.

124
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,060
I, Cang Le Biao, will fight you today.

125
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,940
Move.

126
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Move.

127
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,820
Yu Xun Feng!

128
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,420
Be more world-renowned and enthroned.

129
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,180
This is the last time you're going to die,

130
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,780
Laser.

131
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,620
So much.

132
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,660
This is the last time.

133
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,180
The last time.

134
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,020
This is the last time.

135
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,180
Come on.

136
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,860
This is the last time.

137
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,940
How could bayonet not work?

138
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,980
Sizu,

139
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,420
this piece of domain

140
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,580
caused you to die.

141
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,580
Father!

142
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Father!

143
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
Let me go!

144
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Give him a little time to get used to it.

145
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Start from his eldest son.

146
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
Father!

147
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,580
Father!

148
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
I didn't take the Hero's Order!

149
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,580
I really didn't!

150
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,580
Father!

151
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Master Liu.

152
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,580
The open-air gate was opened, but no one was here.

153
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,580
They found Lady Wu on the way to the guard post.

154
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
They wanted to take the Hero's Order,

155
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,580
but Lady Wu's shadow sword Zhang Lin was suspicious.

156
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
When they entered the gate, they were lost.

157
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,580
But I heard that Lady Wu was on the carriage of the Sword-Changing Sect.

158
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
Sword-Changing Sect?

159
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
We also found the Hero's Order.

160
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,580
I heard that it was for the people of the North Wilderness.

161
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Where is it?

162
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,580
Zi Feng Huang.

163
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,580
Who bribed you to kill me?

164
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,580
I'm not a murderer.

165
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
I'm just a man.

166
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
I'm not a murderer.

167
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,580
I'm just a man.

168
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
I'm just a man.

169
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,580
I'm just a man.

170
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
I'm just a man.

171
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,580
I'm just a man.

172
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm just a man.

173
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
I'm just a man.

174
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
I'm just a man.

175
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
I'm just a man.

176
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,580
I'm just a man.

177
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,580
I'm just a man.

178
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
I'm just a man.

179
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
I'm just a man.

180
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
I'm just a man.

181
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
How do you know?

182
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,580
How do you know that I'm going to poison you?

183
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,580
You come here to kill so many people,

184
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,580
but you've even evaded my Sí 기다�adas.

185
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,100
Master Liu Wu is cruel and heartless.

186
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,980
But as long as he meets the azoth,

187
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,380
you'll definitely get it!

188
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,780
So

189
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
this azoth

190
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,260
will destroy the world,

191
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,540
and the heavens will Tree of Addiction.

192
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,740
Stop thinking

193
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,300
the one that Qianli Gang wants to kill

194
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,940
There's only one for me?

195
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,020
Who's there?

196
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,220
Your Majesty!

197
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,260
Is that so?

198
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,420
If so,

199
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,460
I will...

200
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,700
Give you

201
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,940
some time to think of the future for me.

202
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,260
Yes, I will.

203
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,660
6thoth of Chu,

204
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,860
Wukong.

205
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,860
4thech of Chu,

206
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,860
I didn't expect that Xiao Qiushui would be so trustworthy

207
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
when he was running away from the pursuit.

208
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Song Mingzhu,

209
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,860
do you know what is the identity of the Flute in this lake?

210
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,860
I've never heard of it.

211
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,860
Could it be some official position?

212
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
Xiao Qiushui is a very good player.

213
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
He's a very good player.

214
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,860
I wonder what Xiao Qiushui is trying to do by calling me that.

215
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
Forget it.

216
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
With this identity,

217
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,860
he can take a step to the King of the Sword and enter the Xiao family.

218
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Princess Consort has put in so much effort to let the Purple Phoenix kill me.

219
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
You mean

220
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
the Purple Phoenix was killed by the King of the Sword?

221
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Who can take the Hero Order

222
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,860
from the Chief of the Flute?

223
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
It's considered a great achievement

224
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
to get the Hero Order.

225
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
But the King of the Sword has always been against me.

226
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,860
If he gets it,

227
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
he will suppress me temporarily.

228
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
It's a pity

229
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,860
that he gave me a good chance.

230
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
Prince Hongfu, Qi Tian, met the boy from the Xiao family.

231
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
I heard that they set up a

232
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
magic circle to break the seal.

233
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
They are full of evil intentions.

234
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
It's really funny.

235
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,860
The martial arts world

236
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
has been dying.

237
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
It's a terrible death.

238
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
They are just a group of

239
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
hypocrites who are busy with their work

240
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,860
but are not good enough to admit their mistakes.

241
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Sooner or later, they will kneel at the feet of the Power Gang.

242
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,860
The Sword Sect of the Flower and Painting Sect is hard to attack.

243
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
With this identity,

244
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,860
it's easy for me to fight with Xiao Qiushui.

245
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,860
The Hero Order will soon be the thing in the prince's hand.

246
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
And then, we will bring the Xiao family's income back.

247
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
We'll see how the King of the Sword will fight with you.

248
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
The Xiao family doesn't deserve to come to my home.

249
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
And there is also the pen and paper.

250
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
I have to find them.

251
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
By the way,

252
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
don't let the King of the Sword know my whereabouts.

253
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Xiao Qiushui is a bit similar to the Chief.

254
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
In the gang,

255
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,860
only the eight kings have seen the true face of the chief and I.

256
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
Even if the eight kings see him,

257
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
they will not admit their mistakes.

258
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
No need to report to me.

259
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Just wait for my news.

260
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Yes.

261
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
I'll go to the place where the flowers bloom and wait for your news.

262
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Boss,

263
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
look at my shoes.

264
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
I think mine are okay.

265
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,860
Thank you for your help.

266
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Brother Feng,

267
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
looking at you,

268
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,860
do you feel better?

269
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,860
I'm fine now.

270
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Thank you.

271
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
What are you talking about?

272
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,860
Our chief was looking for someone called Feng Lang.

273
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
I didn't expect to meet him.

274
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
It's not enough to be ungrateful.

275
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
I'm sorry for my words.

276
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
But you don't care about me.

277
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Thank you for saving me.

278
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,860
If there is a problem in the future,

279
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,860
I will not quit.

280
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
It's easy to say.

281
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,860
What's important is

282
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
whether you treat me as a friend or not.

283
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
Now,

284
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
do you treat me as your best friend?

285
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,860
You are my best friend.

286
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Okay.

287
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
That's good.

288
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
It's a coincidence.

289
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,860
It's a coincidence.

290
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,860
The iron dress department asked someone to find a teacher.

291
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
They asked me to send a letter to give him flowers.

292
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
I happened to be with Brother Xiao.

293
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
You...

294
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
You must have some stomach poison after you got out of prison.

295
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
How about this?

296
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,860
You go back to Huanhua with me.

297
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
I'll find someone to help you

298
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,860
to give you other stomach poisons.

299
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,860
What do you think?

300
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
Okay.

301
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Where is the wine?

302
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
If there is no wine,

303
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,860
no one can leave.

304
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
I'll go to find someone to help you.

305
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
Okay.

306
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,860
Thank you.

307
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
Wait.

308
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
What's wrong, Boss?

309
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
Brother Feng,

310
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
don't be angry.

311
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,860
You were injured

312
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
and got a cold from the water.

313
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
It's serious if you don't take care of it.

314
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
If you want it here,

315
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
eat it now.

316
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
Are you

317
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
Tang Men Tang Feng?

318
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,860
Who are you?

319
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
I'm Feng Lang,

320
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,440
the

321
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
King of Heaven.

322
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
You're the one

323
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,860
who's always drunk.

324
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
I'm telling you,

325
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
you're also involved in this.

326
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Sister.

327
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,860
Wine.

328
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,860
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
Sister.

334
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
You're fooling me.

335
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,860
It's all fake.

336
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
Tang Feng,

337
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,860
I've been putting up with you for a long time.

338
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,860
If it weren't for Tang Rou's sake.

339
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
I'm telling you,

340
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
if it weren't for you,

341
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,860
I would have knocked the door open.

342
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
Keep doing it.

343
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,860
If you can't do it,

344
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,860
then don't sleep.

345
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Miss.

346
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
You went to the door

347
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
to find the jade grain

348
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
and learn about the martial arts world, right?

349
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Maybe I can help you.

350
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
You?

351
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
I'm a little close to the jade grain.

352
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
Give him my jade pendant.

353
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,860
You can give him a chance to open it.

354
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
You want to exchange the jade pendant

355
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
for the jade grain?

356
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
You're a liar, aren't you?

357
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
I was about to go with Brother Xiao

358
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
to exchange the jade pendant.

359
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
If you take it,

360
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,860
you can come to me.

361
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
It's better than

362
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
wasting time here.

363
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Okay.

364
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
The sword-shaping sect is close to the Tang Sect.

365
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
I don't think you can escape.

366
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,860
Wait.

367
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
My friend helped you.

368
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
You should pay him back.

369
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Sister.

370
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
The more you stab, the deeper it gets.

371
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,860
If you don't get up,

372
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
Boss will get hurt.

373
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
Tang Rou.

374
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
It's not good to

375
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,860
be a friend of a friend like this.

376
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
I'll take you home

377
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
after I finish my work.

378
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
Xiyun.

379
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,860
Boss, are you okay?

380
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
You still want to touch me?

381
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
No.

382
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,860
It won't hurt for a while.

383
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Don't worry.

384
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
It's okay.

385
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
It's nothing.

386
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
This jade pendant

387
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
is so beautiful.

388
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
It's so beautiful.

389
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
This jade pendant

390
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
can detect the information of the Jianghu.

391
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
It sounds quite powerful.

392
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Brother Feng.

393
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,860
How did you get to know him?

394
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
It's a coincidence.

395
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
I'm just like you.

396
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,860
We didn't know each other before.

397
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,860
We've become friends now.

398
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
Well.

399
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,860
I have a problem.

400
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I have a problem.

401
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
My brother

402
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
will be the Young Master of Huanhua

403
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
in a few days.

404
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Brother Feng.

405
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
How can I

406
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
take my brother's position?

407
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
You want to be the leader of Huanhua?

408
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
That's right.

409
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
You're much worse than your brother.

410
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860
But there's a rule.

411
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
If the young hero

412
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,860
can get the recommendation of Jianghu,

413
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
he can challenge the one in the top position.

414
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,860
Jianghu's homestay.

415
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Okay.

416
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,600
invite didnt

417
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,860
To see you, hangman.

418
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,860
I have something for you.

419
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,860
Please give me a chance to open it.

420
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,860
It's indeed a skill of a young master.

421
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Since it's a skill of a young master,

422
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
I'll give it to you.

423
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,860
I'll give it to you.

424
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
I'll give it to you.

425
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
I'll give it to you.

426
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
I'll give it to you.

427
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Since the skill of a young master is a friend of yours,

428
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,860
then ask me.

429
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,860
Where is the Heaven-Bringing Book?

430
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
The Xiaos.

431
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
The Xiaos.

432
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
It's true.

433
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,860
Old Madam Wu really is hiding in the Xiaos.

434
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
The Xiaos.

435
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Greetings, Old Madam Wu.

436
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Please sit.

437
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Old Madam,

438
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,860
are you feeling better?

439
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
You two,

440
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
I'm very grateful

441
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
that you let me hide here.

442
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860
I'm not old enough

443
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
to be here.

444
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
Old Madam,

445
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,860
I've received a secret letter from General Wu Jie.

446
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Seven days later,

447
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
General Wu will send someone to Linliang Town

448
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
to fight together.

449
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
At that time,

450
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
I'll send Old Madam to the town quietly

451
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
to meet with General.

452
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
Thank you for your hard work.

453
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
Since Yan Kuangtu

454
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
entrusted me with the Order of Heroes,

455
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
there have been many

456
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
new adventures in the martial arts world.

457
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Even if there are

458
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,860
Master Zhang's people by my side,

459
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
I've been in danger.

460
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Thanks to the Xiaos,

461
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860
they hid me in the Flower of Rebirth.

462
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I'm afraid that

463
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
the Order of Heroes

464
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,860
has been taken by the Dai people.

465
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
Old Madam,

466
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,860
what are you talking about?

467
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
This is the duty of

468
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
the martial arts people.

469
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
The Jianghu can't hide secrets.

470
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
I don't know if the Xiaos

471
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
can hide the remaining seven days.

472
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Old Madam,

473
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Jianghu is a place of wind and rain.

474
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Jianghu is a place of solitude.

475
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,860
You don't need to worry.

476
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
We'll arrange

477
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,860
everything.

478
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
You're grounded.

479
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,860
But you're making trouble outside.

480
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
It seems that I'm being too easy.

481
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,860
You're forcing me

482
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
to teach you the martial arts.

483
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Come on, roll up your ass.

484
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Right. Right. Right.

485
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
I'm going out to avoid trouble.

486
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,860
I have something to do.

487
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,860
You? What is it?

488
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,860
To do good deeds?

489
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,860
You do good deeds?

490
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,860
You're good at it.

491
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,860
I'll make you do it.

492
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,860
Dad, don't do it.

493
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
Look, people don't do good deeds.

494
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,860
Really?

495
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,860
You're really good.

496
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
I'll help you.

497
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
What are you fighting about?

498
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,860
What are you fighting about?

499
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Enough.

500
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
What are you doing?

501
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,860
I'll teach him.

502
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,860
You're beating him again.

503
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,860
Your sister

504
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,860
has picked some earthworms in the back hill.

505
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,860
I've told the kitchen that I've cooked some chicken soup

506
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
for your friends.

507
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,860
What are you waiting for?

508
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,860
Go to the kitchen and help.

509
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
Hurry up. Hurry up.

510
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
Where are you going?

511
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
I'm teaching her.

512
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
You're hurting her again and again.

513
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
You're making her more and more bold.

514
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,860
You don't know the situation.

515
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
This time, there's really no trouble.

516
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,860
I told Yu Han and the others to go back to Guanglongzhou.

517
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,860
But look,

518
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,860
it's a common custom to kill animals.

519
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
Do you remember

520
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
you went there every year when you were young?

521
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
And the ginger you dropped

522
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
was caught by me.

523
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
Don't mention my ginger when you were young.

524
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
I'll drop it when it's time.

525
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,860
Am I still good?

526
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Do you know that his sword is gone?

527
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
A swordsman's sword is gone.

528
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
What does it look like?

529
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
I'll teach him.

530
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
Who told you to stand up?

531
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
I told him to stand up.

532
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
You...

533
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Get out of the way.

534
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
Let him stand up, okay?

535
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Get out of the way.

536
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Get out of the way.

537
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Yang Bi, hit me.

538
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
You...

539
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
You...

540
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Don't think I dare not.

541
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Brother.

542
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Brother.

543
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
You're here.

544
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,860
You're teaching your son.

545
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
We haven't seen you for a long time.

546
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
It's not a big deal

547
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
to be young and vigorous.

548
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Uncle Xiao.

549
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
Okay, Brother Xiao.

550
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
Let's go have a drink.

551
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
That's the right thing to do.

552
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,860
Brother, calm down.

553
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
The birthday gift of the leader of the Flower-chilling Sect

554
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
There's a lot of work to do later.

555
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,860
Qiushui, come on.

556
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Come on, say thank you to uncle and uncle.

557
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Then we'll go down first.

558
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
What are you waiting for?

559
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Go.

560
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
Mother.

561
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
I want to be the leader.

562
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
Qiushui.

563
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
What are you talking about?

564
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
You want to fight with your brother?

565
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
Don't mess around. Get down.

566
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,860
Qiushui.

567
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Did you hear that?

568
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
You made me angry again.

569
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Wan Bi.

570
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Wan Bi.

571
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860
Wan Bi.

572
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,860
I'm Qiushui.

573
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
I want to be the leader of the Flower-chilling Sect.

574
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
It's good that you're here.

575
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
Can you recommend me?

576
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Qiushui.

577
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,860
What I said is not a joke.

578
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Please give me a chance.

579
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Please give me a chance.

580
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Please give me a chance.

581
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:34,300
You're a child with a sense of

582
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,860
Please give me a chance.

583
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Give me a chance.

584
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
Qiushui, it's not my wish.

585
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
But one person

586
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
is really wise.

587
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Uncle Kang will believe you in five years.

588
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
I'm sure you can challenge.

589
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Five years.

590
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,860
Stop it.

591
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Qiushui.

592
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
You stop it.

593
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,860
Hurry down.

594
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,860
We have something important to discuss.

595
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Think about it.

596
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
Qiushui.

597
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Get up.

598
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,860
Let's go.

599
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
We're going down.

600
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,860
We'll talk about it later.

601
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Let's go.

602
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
You're so naughty.

603
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,860
You're making fun of me.

604
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,860
Hurry up.

605
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Come on.

606
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,860
What's going on?

607
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Are you hurt?

608
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
I'm fine.

609
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,860
Mom, it's really nothing.

610
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,860
Mom.

611
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,860
I won't make you angry in the future.

612
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
I won't fight around.

613
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
Is mom angry with you?

614
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
She's angry with you for your ability.

615
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
You're in the martial arts world.

616
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,860
It's normal to fight.

617
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
But ability will kill you.

618
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,860
My son.

619
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,860
You're hurt.

620
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
You have to learn to shout.

621
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,860
You have to learn to run.

622
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,860
You can't be a fool.

623
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,860
I remember.

624
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Don't worry.

625
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I'm fast at escaping.

626
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
If I didn't think of it.

627
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,860
Qiushui didn't have this idea.

628
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,860
Although it's unreliable.

629
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
But mom likes it.

630
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
Sorry.

631
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
I forgot.

632
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
It's okay.

633
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,860
You must be hungry.

634
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
I'll make you noodles.

635
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,860
Wait.

636
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,860
Mom.

637
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,860
I must change the ending of the Xiao family.

638
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,860
You're sick when you were a child.

639
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,860
You like this most.

640
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,860
Eat.

641
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
Lin Ming.

642
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
Come.

643
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,860
Eat noodles.

644
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
Eat noodles.

645
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
What's wrong?

646
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Is the noodles I made delicious?

647
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,860
I haven't tasted this for a long time.

648
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,860
Silly boy.

649
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
I just made it for you last month.

650
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
If you like it.

651
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
I'll make it for you every day.

652
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Thank you.

653
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
I'll make it for you every day.

654
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
I'll make it for you every day.

655
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,860
I'll make it for you every day.

656
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
Thank you.

657
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
I've ordered the kitchen.

658
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
Tonight.

659
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,860
Let's have a big meal.

660
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Okay.

661
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,860
You want to be the headmaster.

662
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Eat.

663
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,860
I'll eat.

664
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
This is indeed a military elixir.

665
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Take the military elixir.

666
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
No.

667
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
No.

668
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,860
It's violent.

669
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,860
More than ten years ago.

670
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,860
Baicao Valley.

671
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,860
Created this.

672
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,860
Trying to give it to the people of the north.

673
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
To make a big deal.

674
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
We.

675
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Join hands.

676
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,860
We'll destroy it.

677
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,860
And destroy the military elixir.

678
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,860
I didn't expect.

679
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
So many years have passed.

680
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,860
And someone made this.

681
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,860
It must be Baicao Valley's idea.

682
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,860
If the north gets this kind of evil thing again.

683
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,860
It will cause a big scene.

684
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,860
I think.

685
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,860
We should send some people.

686
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
To check it out.

687
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
I remember the Xiao family has a villa in Guangling.

688
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
Then please make a plan.

689
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I'll arrange it tomorrow.

690
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Boss.

691
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,860
Uncle.

692
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Uncle.

693
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,860
Thank you.

694
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,860
I'll tell you.

695
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,860
Especially this fried meat.

696
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,860
I think you're wrong.

697
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Every dish made by aunt.

698
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,860
You're sweet.

699
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,860
Eat more.

700
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,860
My father.

701
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Has been in charge of our family since childhood.

702
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
I'm worried.

703
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,860
Thank you for your good friends.

704
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Follow him.

705
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Come on.

706
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
Uncle.

707
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Is it a compliment?

708
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860
It's the style.

709
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,860
Drink.

710
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
You should be young.

711
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,860
Thank you.

712
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
You try it.

713
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
I'll do it myself.

714
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Feng Lang.

715
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,860
I heard from the iron clothes department.

716
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,860
You helped him a lot.

717
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
You're a talent.

718
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Come on.

719
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,860
Cheers.

720
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,860
You're here again.

721
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
I heard you're good at archery.

722
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
You're good at archery.

723
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
You're good at archery.

724
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
You're good at archery.

725
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
You're wrong.

726
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Jiangnan has a lot of water.

727
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,860
It's not as good as Pianzhou.

728
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Qiushui.

729
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,860
Look at my mother.

730
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,860
She's too old.

731
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
Her memory is so bad.

732
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
She's so heavy.

733
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Mother.

734
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,860
It's the hair.

735
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
It's so rare.

736
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
I don't know why the power gang

737
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
would do this to Mr. Feng.

738
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,860
I told brother Xiao before.

739
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
I saw something I shouldn't have.

740
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
Have you heard

741
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
about Changle Escort's destruction?

742
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
The news of the last few days

743
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
has spread in the capital.

744
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,860
I was there on the day

745
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,860
of the destruction.

746
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,860
I wanted to go to Changle Escort

747
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,860
to find the escort.

748
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,860
But I didn't expect

749
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
to meet the power gang's brother.

750
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,860
I escaped,

751
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,860
but I was poisoned.

752
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,860
I heard that

753
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Liu Suifeng of the power gang was there.

754
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,860
He's really hard to deal with

755
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,860
if he can survive under this devil.

756
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
It's not easy.

757
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,860
Feng,

758
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,860
what escort did you get

759
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
from Changle Escort?

760
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
My master asked me

761
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,860
to give it to Tie Yi.

762
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,860
I didn't escape by chance.

763
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
But I heard that

764
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,860
the power gang was looking for

765
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,860
an important person.

766
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,860
I wonder if you heard

767
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
about the power gang's destruction?

768
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
I didn't hear about it.

769
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,860
The important person

770
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,860
in Changle Escort

771
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,860
is also in Jinzhou?

772
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Auntie, the people in the capital

773
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,860
are very busy. Have you heard

774
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,860
about the important person?

775
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,860
I haven't heard about it.

776
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
The people in the world

777
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,860
are not important.

778
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,860
Today, we should drink to our heart's content.

779
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Yes, drink to our heart's content.

780
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,860
Drink to our heart's content.

781
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,860
Come on, let's drink.

782
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,860
Cheers.

783
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,860
Thank you for your hospitality.

784
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,860
Thank you.

785
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,860
The flowers are falling,

786
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,860
how many times have I been missing you?

787
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,860
The wind blows, the leaves fall,

788
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,860
like a song that says goodbye to thousands of songs.

789
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,860
Who can I fall in love with?

790
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,860
How many times have I fallen in love?

791
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,860
The sky is dark, the moon is bright, how many times have I been in love?

792
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,860
The wind is cold, the leaves fall,

793
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,860
like a song that says goodbye to thousands of songs.

794
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,860
The dust is falling, the leaves fall,

795
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,860
like a song that says goodbye to thousands of songs.

796
