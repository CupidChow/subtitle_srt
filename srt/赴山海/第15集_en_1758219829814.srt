1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
To be continued

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
Let the blood flow in the rain

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,920
The sword has never been changed

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,720
Thousands of years have passed, I have grown up

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:49,440
I want to wait for you to come

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,720
The wind is not strong

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,720
The waves are strong

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Break through the sky and go to the end

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Let the city and river be together again

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,720
The sword is cut into the sea of people

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,720
The end of the dark night is in the middle of the night

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,720
I don't forget this time

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Let the blood flow in the rain

14
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,720
The sword has never been changed

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Thousands of years have passed, I have grown up

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,720
I want to wait for you to come

17
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
The first mouth is so cool

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Son, forgive me

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,720
I can only tell you the truth in this way

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
I lied to your father

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,720
In fact, there is not much left of the water in the stove

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,720
After discussing with your uncle

23
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,720
We decided to leave the opportunity to you young people

24
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Mother

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Mother, I am afraid I can't wait for you to come back

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,720
I just hope you can find your brother and sister smoothly

27
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,720
In the future you four people live well

28
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,720
In the future you four people live well

29
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,720
You will become the Xiao family

30
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
You will become the Xiao family

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,840
In the future,

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,960
you'll be the most powerful person

33
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,880
of the Xiao family.

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,360
I'll be proud of you

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,720
and your parents' spirit.

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,320
By the way,

37
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,160
I'll tell you something secretly.

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,880
Don't tell your brother or sister.

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,160
Actually,

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,280
I...

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,840
Actually, you're the most handsome son

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,880
in my heart.

43
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
Sun Huishan.

45
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm Jue Ping.

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,840
I can't hold on for long.

47
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,480
Excuse me,

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,640
I'm not water refineries.

49
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,280
I'm Jue Li assumptions of people and Indonesia

50
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,600
but I won't retreat.

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,840
Brother

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,220
What should we do?

53
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,320
Brother

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,440
Brother

55
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,660
Brother

56
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,980
Akeqi

57
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,100
save my parents

58
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,720
We don't have enough money

59
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Father and mother, they are sorry.

60
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Why did mother write such a letter?

61
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Could it be that they...

62
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
We will set off now.

63
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,720
We will definitely have time to meet up at the city at night.

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Xu Yu is right.

65
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Hero Xue has already called for the medical exam of Guang Ling.

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
We will set off as soon as we meet.

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Big Brother, we are too late.

68
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
We really can't be late anymore.

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Qu Anshan will never be able to help us.

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
If you don't go there now,

71
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
father and mother,

72
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,720
they will really die.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Shut up.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
You are saying such a dirty thing.

75
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Guang Ling has already agreed to return to the capital.

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Why are you still not willing to believe Hero Qu?

77
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I really didn't say anything.

78
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,720
I really know the future of the Qin Realm and the world.

79
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Qin Gang.

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Third Brother, what are you talking about?

81
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,720
You have violated the human society and are now in a state of emergency.

82
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
The punishment for the lung blood test is about to begin.

83
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Your life is about to be destroyed.

84
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Jia Ruo.

85
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Jia Ruo.

86
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I fell into this painting book by accident.

87
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I can know the ending of the story.

88
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
I can also know everything.

89
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,720
If I say this, can you understand?

90
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Qiu Shui, what are you saying?

91
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I really didn't say anything.

92
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I just want to save Ding Ling.

93
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Enough! You are the one I gave up.

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
I have always hoped that you will grow up quickly.

95
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,720
One day, you will be able to help me and the Xiao family.

96
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
But you!

97
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Look at what you have been doing and saying!

98
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Big Brother.

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Big Brother.

100
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Qiu Shui.

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Big Brother, don't let Qu Anshan go back to the capital.

102
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,720
I swear by my life that he is the King of the Fist Gang.

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,720
When you meet him,

104
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
bring him to the Palace.

105
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,720
By then, I will definitely prove it to you.

106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Big Brother, I beg you.

107
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I beg you.

108
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Big Brother,

109
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I won't take my parents' lives as a joke.

110
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,720
If Qu Anshan is really reliable, why would I be afraid of this?

111
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Big Brother.

112
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Big Brother, I have never begged anyone for this.

113
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,720
It wasn't easy for us to get Guang Ling's help.

114
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Big Brother, this time,

115
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
if I can't prove that Qu Anshan is the King of the Fist Gang,

116
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I will die in the name of atonement.

117
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Stop using your life as a joke!

118
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,720
I asked you to live well, but you forgot.

119
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Third Brother, I trusted you once before.

120
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
But the result...

121
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
The Xiao family is in danger now.

122
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
There must be no mistakes.

123
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
You should recuperate first.

124
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Miss Tang.

125
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Where is Qiu Shui?

126
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Big Brother was interrupted by Qu Anshan's scoundrel.

127
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
He used up all his martial arts.

128
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
He is resting in his room now.

129
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
You are sleepy.

130
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Very good.

131
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
How did you get hurt like this?

132
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Qu Anshan, how dare he...

133
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
How dare he...

134
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
It's nothing.

135
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,720
I just accidentally got hit by Qu Anshan's scoundrel.

136
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,720
I'm sorry. I couldn't help you.

137
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,720
This is the first time I heard Miss Tang say sorry.

138
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
This isn't your problem.

140
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,720
How about you do me a favor with your lucky star?

141
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Why so detailed?

142
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
You see, I'm hurt so badly.

143
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Do me a favor with your star

144
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
so that I can protect myself.

145
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,440
Yes.

146
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,580
Really?

147
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,080
I'm flattered.

148
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,220
Thank you.

149
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,220
Can I help you?

150
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:44,680
The poison constitutionally forms a Staraches-Camp p stimulative

151
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
to help her.

152
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,320
Brother,

153
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm afraid that won't work.

154
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
Why not?

155
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
Tang Zheng must protect

156
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,520
his sister

157
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
no matter what he tells us.

158
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,760
Go.

159
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,960
Yes.

160
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
That man is hidden

161
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
15 miles away from Xiangnan Court.

162
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,880
I wanted to find him

163
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
but I was afraid that I would be stupid

164
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,160
and couldn't escape from that bloodhound.

165
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
It's not too late.

166
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,800
I'll go now.

167
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,560
Go.

168
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Don't let anything happen

169
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
before I come back.

170
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,840
Wait for me.

171
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,520
Miss Tang.

172
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,760
Brother,

173
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
how do you feel?

174
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,200
Miss Tang,

175
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,320
as you expected,

176
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,240
you're back.

177
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,800
But

178
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
you're badly injured.

179
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,400
Don't worry too much.

180
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,480
She's alone in the Tang family.

181
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,360
Besides,

182
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,480
we can't let her be bullied.

183
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Besides,

184
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,800
I promised Tang Rou

185
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,840
to take care of her sister.

186
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,640
If I can't do that,

187
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,840
if I meet her in the underworld,

188
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,560
how can I explain to her?

189
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,880
Brother,

190
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
what are you talking about?

191
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,560
You said

192
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,640
you can leave without a trace.

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,160
You can't lie to me.

194
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,040
Don't worry.

195
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
You won't believe me.

196
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,920
Come on.

197
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,160
Drink the medicine.

198
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,800
Produce station is초

199
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,080
May I get in?

200
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,920
Sorry, Miss Tang.

201
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,280
They will accompany you till nightfall.

202
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,400
When the mechanism is removed,

203
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,920
don't go back to the Hall of Mirage

204
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,080
or the Palace of Merit.

205
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,920
Boss hopes you can return to the Hall.

206
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,480
Xiao Qiushui?

207
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,400
What does he want?

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,720
Miss Tang,

209
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,240
see you later.

210
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,640
Don't go.

211
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,760
Watch her.

212
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,400
Yes.

213
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,920
Untie me.

214
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,080
I didn't expect

215
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
to be a hero

216
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,240
in this world.

217
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,440
But I finally have no chance.

218
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
My parents and friends

219
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,160
have long been

220
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,600
not the children of the book-writers.

221
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
My parents gave me hope.

222
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,600
Even if I die,

223
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,120
I will expose the true face of Qu Anshan.

224
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,040
Even if I can't go back to the real world,

225
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,680
I will still be there.

226
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,600
The Book of Book-writers

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,120
I don't know why he left

228
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,360
Qiushui alone in the villa.

229
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,200
He is a good man.

230
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,480
It's inconvenient to travel with Qiushui.

231
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,320
It's better to let him stay

232
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
and recuperate.

233
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,040
Qiushui is seriously injured.

234
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
It's good to save him from the rush on the way.

235
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
The Book of Book-writers

236
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,000
Hero Qu,

237
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm on behalf of the Xiao family.

238
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
Thank you for your help.

239
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,160
I've been loyal to the Qu Han Mountain for my whole life.

240
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,840
I've long hated the Power Gang.

241
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,160
How can I not save the Xiao family?

242
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,600
Except for the five tigers in Guangling,

243
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,720
waiting for the medical workers,

244
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,440
all other sects are on their way

245
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,920
to meet at the tea house outside the village.

246
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,520
Now the sister Xueyue

247
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,080
is waiting at the tea house.

248
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,480
It's dangerous now.

249
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,240
Hero Xiao, let's go now.

250
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,040
Please.

251
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,280
Please.

252
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,640
Please.

253
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,280
Brother, it's Qiushui.

254
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,880
Qiushui?

255
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,840
This...

256
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,600
Hero Qu,

257
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,240
it seems that my third brother

258
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,680
has been waiting here for a long time.

259
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,000
He came to send you off.

260
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,720
Let's go.

261
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,040
Third Brother, why are you here?

262
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I'm here to see you.

263
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm here to see you.

264
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm here to see you.

265
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm here to see you.

266
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm here to see you.

267
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Why are you here?

268
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,160
You're injured.

269
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,480
Why are you here?

270
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Xue Hanshan

271
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
didn't take the risk to take care of the Xiao family.

272
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,800
My third brother

273
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,720
came to apologize to him.

274
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,280
Hero Qu,

275
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,600
before this,

276
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,280
I was indeed wrong.

277
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
I'm sorry.

278
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,600
Hero Qu,

279
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
it seems that my third brother

280
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
really remembers your help.

281
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,880
Now he knows his mistake.

282
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,080
He came to apologize to you.

283
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,040
Look.

284
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,360
This is quite unexpected.

285
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,360
Are you all right?

286
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,280
Hero Qu,

287
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,240
I really came here to apologize to you.

288
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,640
I came here to apologize to you.

293
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Before this,

294
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,120
I was indeed wrong.

295
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,520
But,

296
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
there's one thing

297
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,080
I want to talk to you alone.

298
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,120
It's about the Hero Order.

299
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,880
Brother,

300
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
what's wrong with my third brother

301
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,920
saying that again?

302
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,720
Brother.

303
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,520
Second Brother.

304
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,280
Please,

305
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,680
I'm sorry.

306
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,680
Hero Qu,

307
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
What do you want to say?

308
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,480
Disgusting.

309
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,280
What do you want to say?

310
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
Say it.

311
00:21:33,680 --> 00:22:01,280

Stone

315
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,500

The Blood-Gun Sword?

Good brothers

384
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Boss, I am here

385
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Boss

386
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Boss

387
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Third brother

388
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Boss

389
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Third brother

390
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Third brother

391
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Third brother

392
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
Qiu Shui

393
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Qiu Shui, the noodles are ready

394
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Let's eat

395
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Why are you still standing?

396
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
The noodles are about to cool down

397
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Qiu Shui

398
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Mom made your favorite noodles

399
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Come on

400
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,680
Qiu Shui

401
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Such delicious noodles

402
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
If you don't eat, I will eat

403
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Qiu Shui

404
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Qiu Shui

405
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
It's time to practice

406
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Big brother

407
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Big brother, good sword skill

408
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Boss, the magic is getting better

409
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Boss, take care of my sister

410
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Who needs your care?

411
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Qiu Shui

412
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Qiu Shui

413
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Qiu Shui

414
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Qiu Shui

415
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
Qiu Shui

416
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Qiu Shui

417
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Qiu Shui

418
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Qiu Shui

419
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Come on

420
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Qiu Shui

421
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Qiu Shui

422
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Don't go, Qiu Shui

423
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Qiu Shui

424
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Qiu Shui

425
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Qiu Shui

426
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Qiu Shui

427
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Qiu Shui

428
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Third brother

429
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Third brother

430
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Third brother

431
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Boss

432
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Qiu Shui

433
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Third brother

434
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Brother

435
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Qiu Shui

436
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Third brother

437
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Third brother

438
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Third brother

439
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Boss

440
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Third brother

441
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Third brother

442
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
The leaves fall

443
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,680
The sound of the birds is quiet

444
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
The wind is quiet

445
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
The song of farewell

446
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Who is the one who loves

447
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,680
The sky is bright and the moon is bright

448
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,680
The tears fall and the wind is not strong

449
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Big brother

450
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I didn't expect third brother to die

451
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Third brother said

452
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,680
The arrow can't hold on for long

453
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
This time

454
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Let's listen to third brother, okay?

455
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Big brother

456
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
We have found out the true face of the evil king

457
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,680
I'm afraid he will have other actions

458
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Before he breaks down

459
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
We have to catch him

460
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
It's not good

461
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
But

462
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Big brother

463
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
You stay here for the time being

464
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I'll take a pair of horses to the arrow

465
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Separate actions

466
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
It's also good to distract the arrow king

467
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Be sure to guard the arrow

468
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Only guard the arrow

469
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,680
I can rest in peace only under the nine circles

470
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
I have to save the Xiaos

471
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
I will go back to the big brother's hospital

472
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Yes

473
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
The reason why third brother did all this

474
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Is also to let us

475
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Can return to the source and save parents

476
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Uncle Liang

477
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
You take people immediately

478
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Otherwise, hide the third young master

479
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Don't worry about the big young master

480
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
Second brother

481
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,680
Then we will split up

482
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Go to the water

483
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
The rest of the people will return to the source with me

484
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Yes

485
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Go

486
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Go

487
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Miss Chao

488
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
What happened

489
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Third young master told me before

490
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,680
If Miss Tang comes back to her

491
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
I'll give you these things

492
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Miss Tang

493
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Tang Fang

494
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Sorry

495
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
I fired you

496
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Old Mrs. Wu

497
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Helped me find the relatives of Yan Kuantu

498
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Unfortunately

499
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
I can't finish it

500
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
If you see the old lady

501
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Help me give this golden cup back to her

502
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
And Zhang Lingyi

503
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
The dagger for me

504
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
You tell the elder

505
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
I am Xiao Qiushui

506
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I didn't give her a person

507
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
Okay

508
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Don't say so much

509
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
The most important thing now

510
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
You all have to live well

511
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Don't revenge me

512
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
The world is full of hatred

513
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
You liar

514
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,680
I won't cry for you

515
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
You are too early to get up

516
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
If I had just pulled you

517
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
You fell into the river

518
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
My mother said

519
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Unless this person is my husband

520
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
No exception

521
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
When the news of the blood is up

522
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I will be back

523
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
I will be back

524
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
I heard that there will be a day

525
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
I can find Wang Qin Tian

526
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I will tell you where to go

527
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,680
I don't know how many times I have been flying

528
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,680
I am like a dream

529
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
All the past lives are waiting for the next

530
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,680
I will sing a song to find this song

531
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
The road is long

532
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
The love is short

533
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
The flowers fall into the sky

534
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,680
The heart is like a jade

535
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
You are so beautiful

536
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Uncle Liang

537
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
You said that the blood thief is not dead

538
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Where is he hiding now

539
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Miss Tang

540
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
You want

541
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Absolutely not

542
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
The young master told you

543
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
You can't revenge

544
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
If something happens to you

545
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
The young master's body is not cold

546
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Will die without a clear mind

547
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
I don't care if he is clear

548
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
I know you are for the young master

549
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Revenge is hard

550
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,680
But the young master doesn't let you revenge

551
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
For your own good

552
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
For your own good

553
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
You should understand him once

554
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Did he understand me

555
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
I

556
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,760
Mr. Li

557
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:46,680
Anyone

558
00:37:46,680 --> 00:38:05,020
Go to the

559
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,620
He should be in that direction.

560
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,940
Xia Qiushui,

561
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,380
you're the star in the sky again.

562
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,060
emptiness

563
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,300
Memories flash by

564
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,780
but we ever

565
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,420
we ever

566
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
Uncle Liang, Uncle Liang

567
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,220
what's wrong with him

568
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Young Master

569
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
The Wolf of the Deceased

570
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
The Wolf of the Deceased

571
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,020
No

572
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
You are not the Wolf of the Deceased

573
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,020
I am still thinking

574
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,020
When will you recognize me as the Wolf of the Deceased

575
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,020
The Wolf of the Deceased

576
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,020
Liao Suifeng

577
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
We first met in the Qufang Yuan

578
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,020
If I am not your friend

579
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,020
I am not so easy to escape the hunt of King Jian's Qu Hanshan

580
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,020
It's not so easy to track the whereabouts of the Hero's Order

581
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,020
But

582
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,020
I didn't treat him badly

583
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
He is so heartless

584
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
He has no way to suffer

585
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
You are so disgusting

586
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,020
You'd better not act rashly

587
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
You were hurt by King Jian's Qu Hanshan's blood

588
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,020
If I didn't give you the Black Emperor's Life-saving Pill

589
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
You would have been heartbroken

590
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,020
and would have been punished by heaven

591
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,020
You still pretend to be a good person

592
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
You are so despicable

593
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
Where is the Hero's Order?

594
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,020
You used my trust to get into the Xiao family

595
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,020
Now you are in danger

596
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,020
Now I am in Guanglingqiu

597
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,020
Now I am in Guanglingqiu

598
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,020
I am framed by the disaster

599
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,020
You did it, right?

600
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,020
Yes

601
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,020
All your actions are in my plan

602
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,020
The only thing I didn't get

603
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,020
is that you are so desperate to get the Hero

604
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,020
You want to sacrifice yourself and attack

605
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,020
to get the impossible hope

606
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,020
You are really good at scheming

607
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,020
Have you ever thought about

608
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,020
when you will die?

609
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,020
I am sorry

610
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,020
I am sorry

611
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,020
