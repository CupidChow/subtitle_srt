1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,800
I'll take you to save General Wu.

2
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
Gui Xun

3
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,400
Pl representing the northern bl viaje.

4
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,080
General Wu, what shall we do?

5
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,880
Send a message to General Yi of the Imperial Court.

6
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,920
Tell him that the Immortal Pass is in danger.

7
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,760
Yes.

8
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,920
The West and the North are in panic.

9
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
They have agreed to negotiate.

10
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,160
Why do you betray your trust?

11
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,560
You are just doing it.

12
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,840
The unnamed person is also worthy to talk to me.

13
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,200
The one who is promised to me is Wu Jie.

14
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,040
Now that he is not here,

15
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,360
the agreement will not be broken.

16
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
The general has not returned.

17
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,280
The military order has not been issued.

18
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
What should we do?

19
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,800
Behind the Immortal Pass is the fatherland of Daxi.

20
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,600
It is the home of you and my parents.

21
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Even if you die,

22
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,280
you can't let the North Emperor enter the Pass.

23
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,080
You must keep guard at the gate.

24
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,360
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

25
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,040
Kill!

26
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Kill!

27
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
wear out

28
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,280
kill

29
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,480
General!

30
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,600
Where is General Wu?

31
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,400
He's still fine.

32
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,680
We won't know until some time later.

33
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,440
Qiu Shui.

34
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Ever since you entered this water village,

35
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,200
you've been sending him to the Yellow Spring.

36
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,760
Don't you think you're very capable?

37
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,680
I want to be a hero who can save the country and the people.

38
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,760
Today, I'll tell you

39
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
that you can't do anything.

40
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,640
Where is General Wu?

41
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Do you think you can defeat me?

42
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,280
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.

43
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,280
Tell me where General Wu is.

44
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
What's the hurry?

45
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
You don't have much time left for General Wu.

46
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
If you defeat me,

47
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
I'll tell you.

48
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
The last battle is over.

49
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
You can't go back.

50
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
I'm going to kill you.

51
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
I'll kill you.

52
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
General Wu.

53
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
You don't have to kill me.

54
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I'll kill you.

55
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
I'll kill you.

56
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I'll kill you.

57
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
I'll kill you.

58
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll kill you.

59
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
I'll kill you.

60
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
I'll kill you.

61
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
I'll kill you.

62
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
I'll kill you.

63
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
General, the gate was broken.

64
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
We'll go back to the inner city.

65
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Kill.

66
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Kill.

67
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Kill.

68
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Kill.

69
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Kill.

70
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Kill.

71
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Kill.

72
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

73
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Your time is up.

74
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Your time is up.

76
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760

Your time is up.

78
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760

Your time is up.

80
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760

81
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Your time is up.

82
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Your time is up.

84
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760

Your time is up.

86
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

87
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Your time is up.

88
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760

89
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Your time is up.

90
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760

91
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Your time is up.

92
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

93
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Your time is up.

94
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760

Your time is up.

96
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760

Your time is up.

98
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760

Your time is up.

100
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760

Your time is up.

102
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760

Your time is up.

116
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Your time is up.

118
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

119
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Your time is up.

120
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

121
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Your time is up.

122
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

123
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

124
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Your time is up.

125
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760

127
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760

Your time is up.

129
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Xiao Kaiyin.

130
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,880
Go!

131
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,100
Hurry.

132
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,100
Go back.

133
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,160
Xiao Qiushui,

134
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,520
I won't tell you

135
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,840
if you want to save General Wu.

136
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,040
What can you do to me?

137
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,840
Kill General Wu.

138
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Father.

139
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Kaiyan.

140
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Kaiyan.

141
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Father.

142
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Kaiyan,

143
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
you're the most stable

144
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
among the three children.

145
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,920
With you in the Flower of Illusion,

146
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,840
I can rest assured.

147
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
Father.

148
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Kaiyan, why are you back so late?

149
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,840
Are you hungry?

150
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,680
What do you want to eat?

151
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,880
I'll make it for you.

152
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,080
Brother.

153
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,920
Kaiyan,

154
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,720
I've asked for a good sword.

155
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Come and have a look.

156
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,040
Brother.

157
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Kaiyan,

158
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,160
we agreed to fight together.

159
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,680
Let's go now.

160
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,960
Xiao Qiushui.

161
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
Xiao Qiushui.

162
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,080
You're greedy for the Mirror

163
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,280
and use your power

164
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
to kill so many innocent people

165
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,840
in the name of the Fire Tribe.

166
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,920
Only when you have no me in your heart

167
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,320
can you reach the end of the world

168
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,240
and make others suffer

169
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,360
so that you can feel the life.

170
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,960
You only see yourself.

171
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,080
How could you misunderstand

172
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,560
that the highest level of forgetfulness

173
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,600
is the love of friends.

174
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,000
Qiushui.

175
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,640
I saw

176
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,080
the snow.

177
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,400
Brother.

178
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,080
This is the last time I call you.

179
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm the only one left in the Xiao family.

180
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
I'm sorry

181
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,880
for what you did.

182
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,120
I'll go to Tianbu for you now.

183
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,760
Tell me.

184
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,200
Where is General Wu?

185
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,080
Tell me.

186
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,880
Where is General Wu?

187
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,680
General Wu.

188
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,040
He's...

189
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,200
He's...

190
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Yes.

191
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,600
It's been fixed.

192
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,520
The Immortals' March

193
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,000
is now in Nanzhou in the North.

194
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,440
No matter what you do,

195
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,160
you only have one way out.

196
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,040
We will present our dead to the show

197
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,480
We will kill all of you!

198
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,080
You are just

199
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,520
a bunch of scoundrels!

200
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,080
You scum!

201
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
Get out of Daxi!

202
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,920
Get out of Daxi!

203
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
Get out of Daxi!

204
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
Get out of Daxi!

205
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,840
You are just a bunch of scum!

206
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,360
Daxi Emperor

207
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
will be cut off from the city

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,200
to keep the city safe.

209
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,200
Will anyone come to save you?

210
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,640
If you don't move,

211
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,440
I will kill all of you!

212
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280

214
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,320
to guard the country.

215
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,880
I want to see

216
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
whether Daxi's martial arts are powerful

217
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,000
or my best martial arts

218
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,360
are better.

219
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,280
Go!

220
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,480

221
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,480
General!

222
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
It's the general!

223

All soldiers, listen這是

From Li Chen Zhou

267
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,080
Let him return to General Wu at all costs.

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Your Majesty!

269
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200

Your Majesty!

274
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
The late official has been killed.

Wu Jie defeated the Northern Imperial Army.

276
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,480
The general of the Northern Imperial Army,

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,040
He Lian Yan, was killed by an ambush.

278
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,280
The Northern Imperial Army was defeated.

279
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,360
They didn't let me go to Central Plains for 50 years.

280
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,880
That's great.

281
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
That's great!

282
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,960
Pass my order.

283
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,440
Reward Wu Jie and the front line soldiers.

284
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,160
Yes.

285
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,960
Wait.

286
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,000
And Chen Zhou.

287
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480

Your Majesty.

289
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,640
The chief of the Li family, Tan Yu Jing,

290
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,240
was killed on the way to General Wu.

291
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,760
What did you say?

292
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,800
Chen Zhou...

293
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,920
The

294
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,800
speech of commanders of Northern Imperial Army

295
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
is still unknown.

296
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,680
And I'm thinking about

297
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,000
whether we can

298
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
classify our booty

299
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,040
to extremely explains or not.

300
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,320
Messengers among the mountains and rivers

301
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,080
who were from the Western States

302
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:46,720
might know

303
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,680
what other remained of their dessines.

304
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,680

305
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,920

I've ever done

365
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,960
to know you.

366
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,880
Why are you playing with me?

Let's play.

370
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,080
Your family doesn't allow you to marry.

371
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,480
Do you want to marry?

372
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,320

00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,240
The car on the left is going to marry.

377
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,200

Yes.

380
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,080
What's wrong with the name Qu?

381
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,880
I don't envy him.

382
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
We have five coffins.

383
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,080
We'll go to the five coffins together.

384
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,600

Five coffins.

389
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,880
Five coffins.

390
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,840
Boss, no more show.

391
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,560
Really.

392
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,120
Come on.

393
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,560
Drink more.

394
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,280
Boss, Miss Fang.

395
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,360
There's wine in the morning, and it's drunk.

396
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:34,960
I'll toast you.

397
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,360
Come on.

398
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,080
Come on.

399
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,360
Right.

400
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,720
I toast you.

401
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,480
Cheers.

402
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,960
I made the river

403
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,800
I believe that

404
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,360
they are all

405
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,720
the heroes of the show.

406
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,200
Brother Qiushui.

407
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,120
Miss Tan,

408
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,680
I propose a toast to you two.

409
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
I wish you

410
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,760
a happy drink.

411
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,240
I'll drink it.

412
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,880
Cheers.

413
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,920
Brother Qiushui,

414
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
it's such a good day.

415
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,440
Let's sing a song together.

416
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,000
OK.

417
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,920
Brothers.

418
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,600
Let's sing together.

419
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,840
Sing.

420
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,600
Let's sing together.

421
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,320
OK.

422
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,200
The blue sea is small,

423
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,520
the two shores are rough.

424
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,120
Several concubines on this journey by the river.

425
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,600
Heaven is sweet,

426
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,280
history is bitter.

427
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,700
Who cares whoittering under theils of March?

428
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,640
Volcan.

429
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:24,240
I never meant to say this

430
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,120
So you didn't treat me well?

431
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,280
I didn't treat you badly.

432
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,820
you get to see the broad world through your eyes

433
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,380
yes

434
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,860
you need to go

435
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,380
that's why we have this Souvenirs

436
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
this is the case

437
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,020
have you ever been to it?

438
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,380
I am

439
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,580
it's so beautiful

440
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,680
my name ignored

441
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,780
the circle of life

442
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
Wijin Temple

443
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,880
wonderful waves

444
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
nom valorous

445
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,180
korom

446
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
we have wood

447
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Lalalalalalala

448
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:46,820
Lalalalalalala

449
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:53,260
Terre Tr sure is so Cerebris

450
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
Introduced by my son

451
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:44,360
The

452
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,060
So many

453
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,820
Love is a wound, hate is a wound

454
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,140
Falling into the cocoon

455
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,620
Really hope

456
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,860
No need to be a big

457
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,140
I don't care about the wine

458
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,940
Love is a wound, hate is a wound

459
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,060
How are you doing in the sea

460
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,580
From the mountains and seas

461
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,180
Qiu Shui, you know

462
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,220
The consequence of using the 15th layer of the Heaven's Book of Forgetting Love

463
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,380
Although it can explode

464
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,780
The power that exceeds several times

465
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,140
It's unbearable

466
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,420
But it's a momentary exhaustive of energy

467
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,620
Soon the meridians will be damaged and the energy will be depleted

468
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,780
Is it his life to pay for it?

469
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,540
The wind blows like a red leaf

470
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,500
The wine is more beautiful than the sword

471
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,300
Really beautiful

472
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,500
Sighing for the reason and sighing for the love

473
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,620
Like a red longan

474
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,900
Life is like a test

475
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,020
The world is like a

476
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,940
I'm curious about the past

477
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,540
The moon and the duck are hard to say

478
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,340
Continuous longing

479
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,460
Obviously, after investigating the river

480
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,860
Confirmed Li Nan's spy behavior

481
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,740
He was ordered by the spy organization outside the country

482
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,580
Steal the national secret

483
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,940
Unfortunately, I haven't waited for the criminal punishment

484
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,340
He died a few days ago

485
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,660
The water is like a test for the heaven

486
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,340
Love is a wound, hate is a wound

487
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,700
How are you doing in the sea

488
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,460
The war is hopeless, no need to be a big

489
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,740
The wine is more beautiful than the sword

490
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,460
Love is a wound, hate is a wound

491
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,660
How are you doing in the sea

492
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,260
The wind and the sea are like a cloud

493
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,820
The wind and the sea are like a cloud

494
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,340
The wind and the sea are like a cloud

495
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,220
It's better to be like the wind

496
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,260
Crossing the sea of ​​darkness and darkness

497
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,740
Only eating the world has never been far

498
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,260
It's better to be like the wind

499
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,540
Crossing the sea of ​​darkness and darkness

500
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,340
Only eating the world has never been far

501
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,060
It's better to be like the wind

502
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,140
Crossing the sea of ​​darkness and darkness

503
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,620
Only eating the world has never been far

504
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

505
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

506
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

507

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

510
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

511
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

512
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

517
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

523
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

524
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

525
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,340
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

532
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
Who can break the spell of love?

533
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
How many loves do you have?

534
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,340
The more you love, the more you care.

535
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:47,340
The more you cry, the more you love.

536
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:59,340
The more you fall, the more you love.
