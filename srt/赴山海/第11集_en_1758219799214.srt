1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not a good singer.

2
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not a good singer.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm not a good singer.

4
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not a good singer.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not a good singer.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not a good singer.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not a good singer.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not a good singer.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not a good singer.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not a good singer.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not a good singer.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not a good singer.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm not a good singer.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not a good singer.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm not a good singer.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not a good singer.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm not a good singer.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not a good singer.

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not a good singer.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not a good singer.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm not a good singer.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not a good singer.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm not a good singer.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm not a good singer.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No.

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,320
Miss Qing.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,280
Xiao Qiushui hunted on men all over the place.

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
I'll get the Order of Heroes for the sake of Xiao Qiushui.

29
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,600
I must get the Order of Heroes out of his mouth.

30
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
Who are you?

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,920
Didn't Tang Fang tell you?

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm the one who is called the good sister in Tang Sect.

33
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,280
He asked me to entertain you.

34
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,520
What did you give me?

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,600
Even a master of martial arts

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
can take this special pill.

37
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,960
You must be obedient.

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,360
The Order of Heroes

39
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,440
and the secret of your unreliable son

40
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
are all out.

41
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,960
You must become a good sister.

42
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Do this.

43
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,840
Go to see aunt Wang.

44
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,440
Go with me and with Yang Yang.

45
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Go with him.

46
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,160
Brad!

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,560
These immortal creative flowers...

48
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,340
Who would be more beautiful...

49
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,940
哪兩個是比你美的?

50
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,660
你

51
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
It's more ugly than her.

52
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
What?

53
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,660
I was scared.

54
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
I was scared to death.

55
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
You!

56
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
A'Qing!

57
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
Stop!

58
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Is the Hero's Order of Wan Chu there?

59
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,660
I don't know.

60
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
Is the Hero's Order there?

61
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,660
Xiao Qiushui, I'm asking you.

62
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Where is the Hero's Order?

63
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
It's in the Hall.

64
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Brother, that's impossible.

65
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
I've searched both of his bodies.

66
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
There's no Hero's Order.

67
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Xiao Qiushui.

68
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Xiao Qiushui!

69
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,660
I'm asking you.

70
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
Where did you hide the Hero's Order?

71
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Didn't you say it just now?

72
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,660
This Hero's Order...

73
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
was buried in the Hall.

74
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,660
I only remember it was in here.

75
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,660
It seems that this kid left a hand before entering the Hall.

76
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Let's go.

77
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
Let's go.

78
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Stupid kids.

79
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Luckily, I was prepared in advance.

80
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
Miss Tang.

81
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,660
If I don't get poisoned by your poison,

82
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,660
is there any way to solve it?

83
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
I trust you.

84
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
I'm here.

85
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
This is the poison pill.

86
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
This is the treasure of the Hall.

87
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
It can be used to poison people.

88
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,660
But it only works for two hours.

89
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,660
The Hall never mentioned

90
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
that there was such a villain in the Hall.

91
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
I wonder how he is now.

92
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,660
Miss!

93
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Miss!

94
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
Are you okay, Miss?

95
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm fine.

96
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
It's said that we almost

97
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
dug up the whole tree.

98
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
There is no Hero's Order.

99
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
Could that kid be lying to me?

100
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Impossible.

101
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
He can't be lying.

102
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Little Qiu Shui, are you okay?

103
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm fine.

104
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Luckily, I have the poison pill you gave me.

105
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
Let's go.

106
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Little Qiu Shui!

107
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
Little Qiu Shui,

108
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
how dare you lie to us?

109
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
I didn't.

110
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,660
Did you dig up anything?

111
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Sister, you don't have to

112
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
die with that kid.

113
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,660
Please,

114
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,660
please.

115
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
I will always be soft on you.

116
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Brother!

117
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,660
Is there something wrong with him?

118
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Please forgive me

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
for offending you.

120
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Actually, you are a hero.

121
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
Why can't you protect yourself?

122
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
I can lead you to meet my old lady.

123
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
With her experience in the martial arts world,

124
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
I can help you

125
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,660
to use the Hero's Order

126
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
to solve the family's problem

127
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
and stop the evil.

128
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,660
But tell me the truth.

129
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
The Hero's Order

130
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
was really taken away by the Power Gang.

131
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
I don't know.

132
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,660
You still don't want to tell the truth.

133
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,660
How do you know I'm lying?

134
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Let me ask you.

135
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
Is it the Power Gang

136
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
who told you

137
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
they didn't get the Hero's Order?

138
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Did you really have a relationship with the Power Gang?

139
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Shi Qingmei,

140
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
how dare you question me?

141
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
You went to the Xiao family

142
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
just to get the Hero's Order.

143
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Little Three,

144
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
he went to the Xiao family

145
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
just for this purpose.

146
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
You didn't notice it, did you?

147
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Shi Qingmei,

148
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,660
I've sent the news

149
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
that you brought an outsider to the Tang family

150
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
to the inner courtyard.

151
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Why didn't you go to the uncle to find you?

152
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Could it be that the uncle was seriously injured

153
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
and was in a coma?

154
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
It's hard to know about the Headquarters.

155
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,660
You should beg me.

156
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Let me marry you.

157
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
I will leave a way for the Headquarters

158
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,660
in the future.

159
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
My father's inner strength is very strong.

160
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,660
It's no surprise that he is closed to the cultivation.

161
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
If you have the guts,

162
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
you can break into the door of the Headquarters.

163
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,660
I want to see

164
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,660
if my father will let you come out.

165
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
If you don't have the guts,

166
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,660
just shut up and get out of the way.

167
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
You...

168
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,660
One more thing.

169
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,660
I heard so much from you.

170
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
You and them

171
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
are so entangled.

172
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,660
You are so insincere.

173
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
You should have been.

174
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Otherwise, how can you give yourself a way out?

175
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Slow down.

176
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
Today, you came to the Tang family.

177
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
Then follow their rules.

178
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Look behind you.

179
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
Run.

180
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Go.

181
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Go that way.

182
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Xia Qiongshui.

183
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Why are you here?

184
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,660
Sorry.

185
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Since the construction,

186
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
I've been planning to follow you

187
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
to find the Heaven-fearing Tree.

188
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,660
But you trusted me so much

189
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
that you treated me as a friend.

190
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
I brought you to the Tang family

191
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
because I wanted to help you

192
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
solve the problem of the Xiao family

193
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
and repay your kindness.

194
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
In fact, it's just for a little bit of self-willing.

195
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Tang Fang.

196
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
I don't know where the Heaven-fearing Tree is.

197
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
But if I can find the Wild Fire map,

198
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
maybe I can ask

199
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,660
where the Heaven-fearing Tree is.

200
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
When I solve the problem of the Xiao family,

201
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
I can find the Heaven-fearing Tree

202
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
one day.

203
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660
I will tell you the whereabouts.

204
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
Thank you.

205
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Over there.

206
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
Go.

207
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
I can't move.

208
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Stop.

209
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Get out of the way.

210
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Be careful.

211
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
It's flying over.

212
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
The clothes are open.

213
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,660
It's open.

214
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Stay inside.

215
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Don't look.

216
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
You want to fight again?

217
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
I swore

218
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,660
if other men saw my body,

219
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
I would kill them.

220
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
But you...

221
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
You're being too hasty.

222
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
If I hadn't pulled you just now,

223
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
you would have fallen into the river.

224
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
My father was not the master of the family.

225
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,660
The scoundrels from other sects always bullied us.

226
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
One day,

227
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
they broke into the theater

228
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,660
while I was taking a shower.

229
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
My mother killed them all.

230
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
From that day on,

231
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
I swore

232
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
I would practice martial arts.

233
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
If a man saw my body again,

234
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
he would kill them.

235
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
You should know the situation.

236
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
It's a good thing that the two of you did it on purpose.

237
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
But I was the one who saved you.

238
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,660
My mother said

239
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,660
unless this man said he was my husband,

240
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
it would be a no-no.

241
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Are you kidding me?

242
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
It's true.

243
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Don't think too much.

244
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Let me ask you.

245
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,660
There are many flaws

246
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
in your childhood.

247
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660
If someone accidentally saw your body,

248
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
and didn't see it clearly,

249
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,660
wouldn't you kill him?

250
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
Who knows if it was an accident or on purpose?

251
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660
I did it on purpose.

252
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
I will never go back on my word.

253
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
What logic is this?

254
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
I asked you so many questions.

255
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Let me ask you.

256
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Didn't you treat me as a friend?

257
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
You want to kill your friend?

258
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
I told you.

259
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
I must kill him.

260
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
I don't want to fight with you.

261
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
You'd better step aside.

262
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
No.

263
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
I will.

264
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
Well,

265
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,660
I've been in there for a long time.

266
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,660
I can't listen to it anymore.

267
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
You don't want to die, do you?

268
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
You don't want to kill, right?

269
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
There's another way.

270
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
You can marry him.

271
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Miss,

272
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
I don't think you want to do it here.

273
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
You can't stay on my boat

274
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,660
for the rest of your life.

275
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
I'll marry him.

276
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
He's right.

277
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
If you want to live,

278
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
there's only one way.

279
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
Marry me.

280
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Stop it.

281
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Marriage is not a game.

282
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
Why do you want to marry me?

283
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Anyway, I can't break my promise.

284
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
I have a lot of things to do later.

285
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,660
I can't kill you for now.

286
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
But I just thought of it.

287
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
I need someone

288
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
to help me break into

289
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,660
the Wanxiang Town of Qianluo.

290
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,660
So I can get rid of Tang Song's entanglements.

291
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Otherwise, I have to...

292
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
I can help you with what you said.

293
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
But you're right.

294
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
I promised Roudi.

295
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660
Is it hard to break into

296
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Wanxiang Town of Qianluo?

297
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
I'll die anyway.

298
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
If you can come out alive,

299
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
we can complete the ceremony

300
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
of the wedding ceremony.

301
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
I'll just get rid of you then.

302
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
Don't say that.

303
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
It's settled.

304
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
I've ruined your good deed.

305
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
This money is

306
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
as a gift for you.

307
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
I wish you a happy wedding.

308
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
I wish you a happy marriage.

309
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
And a son soon.

310
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Don't be happy.

311
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
It has nothing to do with you.

312
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
You have to go to Guangling.

313
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
How can I go?

314
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Do you have a map?

315
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Here.

316
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,660
Map of the well?

317
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
These red spots

318
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
should be the Dark Lord.

319
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
I'll go to Tang Song.

320
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,660
I've been looking for you,

321
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
but I haven't seen you.

322
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
I just saw him

323
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
lock this in the drawer.

324
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
I heard him say

325
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
he spent a lot of time

326
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
and effort

327
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
to remember all the sites

328
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,660
of the Power Gang.

329
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I guess the schools

330
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
of these red spots

331
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
have already

332
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
surrendered to the Power Gang.

333
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
Look.

334
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
These sites

335
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
are on the way

336
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
to Guangling.

337
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I didn't expect

338
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
the Five Tiger Sect,

339
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
the Tang Lang Sect

340
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,660
and the Wuyi Sect

341
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
to all belong to the Power Gang.

342
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
If there are these blocks,

343
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
I'll be held back

344
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
from the construction of the well.

345
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Or I'll get out of the way.

346
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,660
If I can't get out of the way,

347
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,660
I'll have to find a way

348
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
to clear up the obstacles.

349
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,660
It's settled then.

350
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
It's a deal.

351
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
Once the construction is over,

352
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
you'll go to the town.

353
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
Otherwise,

354
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
I'll kill you.

355
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,660
I'll have to

356
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,660
think about it.

357
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,660
You don't have to think too much.

358
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
Everything is as it should be.

359
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
Let's go.

360
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
The news said

361
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,660
that Xiao Qiushui and Tang Fang

362
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
went to Guangling

363
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
with the World Heroes Order.

364
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,660
Brother is going to

365
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,660
spread the Order of Heroes.

366
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
They want to

367
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
escape from me.

368
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,660
It's not that simple.

369
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Once the news is out,

370
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,660
the people in the martial arts world

371
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
will find Xiao Qiushui.

372
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
I'll see

373
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
how long he can live.

374
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
Brother.

375
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
Xue Yu?

376
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
You can leave now.

377
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Is there a letter

378
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
from the Jindu Sword House?

379
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
What did father say?

380
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,660
It's all the message

381
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,660
from the Jindu Sword House

382
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
to report the safety of the people.

383
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
Father didn't reply.

384
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
I'm afraid that

385
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
the clues and evidence

386
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
in the village

387
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
will be cleared

388
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
after a while.

389
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Why don't we

390
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
go to the village again?

391
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
We can check the evidence

392
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
and leave the evidence.

393
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
Okay.

394
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
The Jindu Sword House

395
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
This is the herb used for making pills.

396
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Maybe it can be used

397
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
to detoxify the villagers.

398
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
The Jindu Sword House

399
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
How's it going?

400
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Are you hurt?

401
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
Wait.

402
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Check your brother.

403
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Kaiyan.

404
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,660
He's been suffering from internal force.

405
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
He's fine.

406
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Kaiyan.

407
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Brother.

408
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
I'm...

409
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Are you okay?

410
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
I'm...

411
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,660
If I didn't come in time,

412
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,660
you would have been dead.

413
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
I've told you many times

414
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
not to act without permission.

415
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
The man in black

416
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
must have come to clear the evidence.

417
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
We can't just sit around and do nothing.

418
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
I've told you

419
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
to focus on the overall situation

420
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
and the Xiao family.

421
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Even if you get the evidence now,

422
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
what's the point?

423
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Will the Power Gang

424
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
talk to us?

425
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660
In the end,

426
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,660
we'll just put the Xiao family

427
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,660
in the face of the Power Gang.

428
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
Brother.

429
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
I just found this.

430
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
This white-flower snake snake grass

431
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,660
is very similar to the flower-flower grass in the warehouse.

432
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Those villagers are crazy about poison.

433
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Maybe it has something to do with this.

434
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
Brother.

435
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
Xue Yu is also a doctor.

436
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
He saves people's lives.

437
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
But it was too simple just now.

438
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
That man was very strong.

439
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,660
It's a matter of our lives.

440
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
From now on,

441
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
we'll wait for father's news

442
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
and listen to his arrangements.

443
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
I know you're a good person.

444
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
But if you make any decisions later

445
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
or anything happens,

446
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
you'd better discuss it with me.

447
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
I'm not just your big brother.

448
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
I'm also the leader of the Flower-Bringing Sect.

449
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
I didn't expect that according to your plan,

450
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
you could clear out the two power gangs

451
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
and get out of there.

452
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,660
Then this time,

453
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,660
the only way back to the garden

454
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
can be saved.

455
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
According to the time

456
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,660
that the old lady sent people to send letters,

457
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
I should have returned from Guangning

458
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
to the capital in the past two days.

459
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Unfortunately, we didn't see anything

460
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
along the way.

461
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
I'm afraid something bad has happened.

462
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,660
How about this?

463
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Let's go buy a horse

464
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,660
and go to Guangning again.

465
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
They're all snails and mules.

466
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,660
They can't run fast.

467
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,660
Brother, what do you want?

468
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,660
Buy a donkey or a horse?

469
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
That's a good horse.

470
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
You have a good taste.

471
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
This horse is very good.

472
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
It can run for thousands of miles.

473
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
It's just a little more expensive.

474
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,660
Where did you get this good horse?

475
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
I bought it naturally.

476
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,660
The military seal on the horse's leg is still there.

477
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,660
Tell me honestly.

478
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,660
Where did you get this horse?

479
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
It doesn't matter if you don't say it.

480
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
Then we can only report it.

481
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,660
I'll say it. I'll say it.

482
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,660
That horse

483
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
said he passed by here yesterday.

484
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
He saw this military seal died here.

485
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
He will take that horse away.

486
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Go.

488
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Come.

489
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
This is the letter

490
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
from Mrs. Wu to the brothers in Guangning.

491
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
It's so tight.

492
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
No.

493
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
I'm afraid

494
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
they don't know

495
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
what's going on now.

496
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
So

497
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
I have to go back and meet with my brother first.

498
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
The pass in front

499
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
is the border between Chuanji and Guangning.

500
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,660
It seems that you have taken over the stronghold of the Powerful Gang.

501
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,660
It's not easy to break through the ground.

502
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
There is a place under the pass.

503
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,660
It's not under the control of the Powerful Gang.

504
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Let's go there first.

505
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,660
It's rainy and water is plenty during this season.

506
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
I'm afraid there are fewer boats

507
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
with more water.

508
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
I have to find a way to try.

509
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,660
Ancient favored nation and the land of loyal subjects

510
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,860
Henan

511
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,660
Oh, the wild imperial saying is so rude.

512
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,660
The people have already entered the Tang Gate.

513
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Fortunately, they still can't get out.

514
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,660
Tang Song even said that the Hero Order is on Xiao Qiu Shui.

515
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,660
I'm afraid that there are already a lot of people in the pugilistic world who have killed Xiao Qiu Shui.

516
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,660
I'll go and help you kill this Tang Song who is not good enough to do things.

517
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,660
There are more important things that need to be done.

518
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,660
Xiao Qiu Shui is saying goodbye to Old Madam.

519
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,660
Old Madam once reprimanded others to talk to her alone.

520
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,660
So this Hero Order is very likely to be in her hands.

521
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,660
From now on,

522
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,660
the one who can bring Xiao Qiu Shui to power and help her

523
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,660
will be granted my order.

524
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
But the order is a childe's trust.

525
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,660
How can she just fire a childe?

526
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,660
The chief once said that

527
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,660
giving this order will make the childe be taken in.

528
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,660
I don't believe you will use it again.

529
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Don't worry.

530
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,660
At the worst, before people say anything,

531
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
I'll just kill them.

532
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,660
Xiao Qiu Shui can't find the source of the water in the well.

533
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,660
The assassin is in a hurry to go to the Gua Ling.

534
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
You hurry over now.

535
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Yes.

536
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Tang Feng,

537
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,660
are you still following Xiao Qiu Shui?

538
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,660
Exactly.

539
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Gua Ling

540
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,660
Brother Feng!

541
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
This is the rice cake I stole from the kitchen.

542
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,660
Hurry and eat it.

543
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Don't let them find out.

544
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,660
The place where the Light Soul Feather Sword was found

545
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,660
is the place where the Light Soul Feather Sword was found.

546
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,660
The runaway wind is also in the light.

547
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,660
Feng'er.

548
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,660
Sir.

549
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Take care. Come again when you have good food.

550
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,660
Here, the movie test.

551
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
The situation is urgent and the time is tight.

552
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Go and take a look around.

553
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
See if there are any guest houses.

554
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,660
I'll also go over there and see if there are any other ships.

555
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,660
Make sure to hide tomorrow.

556
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,660
Send the ship to leave.

557
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,660
Be careful.

558
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,660
Father, mother, are you all well?

559
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
Wait for me to come back.

560
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,660
I will definitely return as soon as possible.

561
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Boss.

562
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,660
Is there any other crossroads or ships nearby?

563
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
No.

564
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Thank you.

565
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Young Master.

566
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
I heard that you were looking for a guest house.

567
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,660
There is a crossroads guest house nearby.

568
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
There are two kids who don't do business.

569
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
I'm afraid your friend will be fooled.

570
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Be careful.

571
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Is there anyone?

572
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
Boss.

573
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Is the boss here?

574
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Yes.

575
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Does the guest live alone?

576
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
You are the boss?

577
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Yes.

578
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
I'm the boss.

579
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
Did you change your guest house with a bullpen?

580
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,660
It's dirty and smelly.

581
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
And it smells like cow shit.

582
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Can you live in it?

583
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Sir.

584
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
This shop is usually very small.

585
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
It's a little bit messy.

586
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

587
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
I'll clean it up for you now.

588
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,660
Don't clean it up.

589
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
I can't live here.

590
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
It's easy to come in.

591
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,660
It's not that easy to leave.

592
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
Boss.

593
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Boss.

594
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
You are so good at acting.

595
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Of course.

596
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
The girl from Tang family

597
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
is so good at playing the secret weapon.

598
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,660
She is not as good as you.

599
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
She is so good at it.

600
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,660
There is no one in this world who I can't get.

601
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
But to be honest.

602
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
Isn't Xiao Qiushui

603
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,660
with the girl from Tang family?

604
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
Why hasn't she appeared yet?

605
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Don't worry.

606
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
Xiao Qiushui

607
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,660
must come to save this girl from Tang family.

608
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
We are waiting here.

609
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Yes.

610
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
Let's do it.

611
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
We'll be the first to be caught.

612
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,660
Cao Cao is here.

613
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Let's go.

614
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
Hurry up.

615
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,660
Hurry up.

616
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Hurry up.

617
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Hurry up.

618
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Hurry up.

619
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Who are you?

620
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,660
I'm Iron Star Moon.

621
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Iron mouth, Qiu Nangu.

622
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Did you hear that?

623
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Where is that girl now?

624
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
You are here to save that girl.

625
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Are you Xiao Qiushui?

626
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
OK.

627
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,660
So you want to catch Xiao Qiushui.

628
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
Not us.

629
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
It's the Power Gang.

630
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
Liu Suifeng of the Power Gang

631
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
has come up with a plan.

632
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
If anyone catches Xiao Qiushui for her,

633
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
he will exchange it for a token.

634
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
This token is very useful.

635
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,660
We want to join the Power Gang.

636
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,660
But he doesn't dare to refuse.

637
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,660
So you want to ask Liu Suifeng

638
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,660
to join the Power Gang.

639
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,660
Liu Suifeng is a big bait.

640
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
But we have already

641
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,660
made a deal with the King of Sword of the Power Gang.

642
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,660
Although we haven't met,

643
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,660
we can't be the stronghold.

644
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,660
We are talking about loyalty.

645
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,660
Yes, loyalty.

646
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,660
If we give Liu Suifeng

647
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,660
to the King of Sword,

648
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,660
he will be happy.

649
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
I asked him.

650
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Why did you give him everything?

651
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,660
You are so...

652
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,660
You say it first.

653
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,660
Are you Xiao Qiushui?

654
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,660
Come on, stand up.

655
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,660
That was a heavy blow.

656
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,660
I'm embarrassed.

657
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,660
But you are wrong.

658
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,660
I'm not Xiao Qiushui.

659
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,660
You say you are not.

660
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
What evidence do you have?

661
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
Because I have a name.

662
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,660
I'm Xiao Donghuo.

663
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,660
Wait.

664
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,660
Wait.

665
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
Xiao Donghuo.

666
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Your name...

667
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
You know him, right?

668
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
I do know him.

669
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,660
He is a distant relative of mine.

670
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
Only the girl I was caught with

671
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,660
knows where Xiao Qiushui is.

672
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
She is not Xiao Qiushui.

673
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,660
Why should she be with you?

674
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,660
To be honest,

675
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,660
they are in a fight.

676
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
So she wants to ask me for help.

677
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,660
She wants to teach Xiao Qiushui a lesson.

678
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,660
So if you want to find Xiao Qiushui,

679
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
you must ask her.

680
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
We got news from the Jianghu.

681
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Xiao Qiushui is taking the Order of Heroes

682
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,660
to Guangling.

683
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
We didn't catch Xiao Qiushui.

684
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,660
But Xiao Donghuo came.

685
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
No.

686
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,660
He is trying to catch us.

687
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
You...

688
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Heroes are precious.

689
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
If Xiao Qiushui knew that

690
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,660
Xuanli Gang is so poor,

691
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,660
he would have been far away.

692
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Hero of Rui Zhi,

693
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,660
come here.

694
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,660
Tell me your opinion.

695
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
You have a good taste.

696
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,660
I poisoned the wine.

697
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Stop drinking.

698
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
But you are right.

699
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
The girl is not in our hands.

700
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
If you don't tell me the truth,

701
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
I will kill you.

702
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,660
No.

703
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,660
No need.

704
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
No need.

705
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
I will tell you.

706
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
The girl has been handed over to us

707
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,660
to help us to set up the King of Swords.

708
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,660
That's the power gang's

709
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
one-way magic.

710
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
We want to give the girl to the King of Swords.

711
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,660
Tell me the truth.

712
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
Of course it's true.

713
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
If you don't believe me,

714
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,660
stab me with that sword.

715
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Don't stab my brother.

716
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Tian, don't be silly.

717
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Shao Xia, you have to stab me.

718
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
You stabbed me,

719
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,660
you know it's true.

720
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Stab me.

721
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Stab me.

722
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,660
My brother is healthy.

723
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,660
Don't stab him.

724
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
Enough.

725
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,660
Stop arguing.

726
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,660
You did a stupid thing.

727
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
How stupid?

728
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
If the one-way magic

729
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,660
knows the whereabouts of the water,

730
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,660
then it will definitely

731
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
give the water to the sword.

732
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
If so,

733
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
then your credit

734
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,660
will be stolen by it.

735
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,660
He is right.

736
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,660
The most important thing

737
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,660
is to find the one-way magic first.

738
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Then,

739
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,660
we can find the Tang Gang

740
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,660
without any doubt.

741
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,660
Dachiu,

742
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
he doesn't agree with me or you.

743
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,660
He even gives us

744
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
a way to come up with ideas.

745
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,660
I like him.

746
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,660
I can befriend him.

747
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,660
Since it's a friend,

748
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
this girl is so important to him.

749
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
We have to help him find her.

750
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
Okay.

751
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,660
Dong Hua,

752
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
we will help you

753
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
with this.

754
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Let's go together.

755
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
Young Master,

756
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,660
I got the news.

757
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
The people of King Jia took the Tang Fang.

758
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,660
Where is Xiao Xiu?

759
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,660
Where is he?

760
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
In King Jian's eyes,

761
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,660
he has been

762
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
pulled by King Jian.

763
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,660
He hasn't found

764
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,660
Xiao Xiu yet.

765
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,660
But I guess

766
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,660
he must go to find the one-way magic.

767
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,660
Then it must be

768
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,660
Wei Zheng, Guang Lin,

769
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,660
the one of the three mountains,

770
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,660
and Xu Hanshan.

771
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,660
I have already asked people

772
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,660
to inquire about

773
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,660
Miss Tang Fang.

774
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,660
Tang Fang and the world's heroes

775
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
must not

776
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,660
talk about it again.

777
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,660
I understand.

778
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Miss Tang Fang

779
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,660
is a young man.

780
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,660
Her power is weak.

781
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,660
I'm sorry.

782
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,660
Go and do your work.

783
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,660
Yes.

784
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
The flowers fall,

785
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,660
how many years have passed?

786
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
The wind blows,

787
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,660
like a song,

788
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,660
farewell, ten thousand songs.

789
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Who can stop the love?

790
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,660
How many years have passed?

791
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,660
The sky is bright, the moon is bright.

792
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,660
The tears fall,

793
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,660
like a song,

794
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:57,660
farewell, ten thousand songs.

795
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
The grey mist

796
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,660
is like a sand.

797
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,660
I can't find my dream in my dream.

798
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,660
How many branches are in the world?

799
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,660
Where do the grass grow?

800
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,660
Love and hate are in the past,

801
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,660
but the grudge is in the present.

802
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:40,500
The fragments are embedded in the

803
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,100
ATMs.

804
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,660
by the cost of the souls.

805
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,900
Why is there music,

806
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,660
metaphor,

807
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,700
properly-wrote dialogues,

808
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,700
Who can tell the difference between love and hate?

809
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,500
The more I dream, the more I feel.

810
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:34,900
The more tears fall, the more I can't break free from them.

811
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:44,700
The more I fall, the more I fall for you.
