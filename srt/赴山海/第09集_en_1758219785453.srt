1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Break through the abyss of light

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let this city and river be buried in the sea of stars

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let the sword of light cut off the love

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let the end of the dark night be the middle of the night

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So that we won't forget this 100

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let this big cloud of snow and ice be the edge of the snow

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The sword of the hero has never changed

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let the millennia be born and I will bloom

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let the hero be born and I will bloom

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let the hero be born and I will bloom

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let the hero be born and I will bloom

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let the hero be born and I will bloom

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let the hero be born and I will bloom

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let the hero be born and I will bloom

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to wait for you, even if the sky is bright

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Boss

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In the next life

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We are brothers

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Tang Rou

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Tang Rou

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Tang Rou

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Tang Rou

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Tang Rou

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why is this happening?

32
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why did I save Tang Rou

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But she died here

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why can't I stop all this from happening?

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The tears fall and the wind is not moving

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The ashes are covered with dust

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A dream that is hard to find in the world

38
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How many branches are in the world?

39
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Where is the grass growing?

40
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Love and hate are quick to come

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The grudge is so deep

42
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But the unending love is like a horse

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Miss Tang Fang

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you for taking care of me all this way

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I asked for this carriage and horse for you

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The weather is hot

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Young Hero Tang Rou

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You should return to Tang Gate as soon as possible

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Madam

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Can you send someone to take me

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to send Tang Rou back to Tang Gate?

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have to finish something in my family

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I need to be late for a few days to get back

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If so

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Xiang Yue

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Mo Xiao

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm here

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm here

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm here

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm here

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm here

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm here

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm here

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm here

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do as Miss Tang says

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Tang Rou

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We are still brothers

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Madam

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Young Master Feng is awake

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's go and have a look

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
How is Feng Lang?

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He is not badly injured

74
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But he avoided the poison

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It doesn't matter

76
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But the wound on his chest

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is injured by internal force

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The lung and lung are also injured

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He hurt his heart with internal force

80
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The lung and vein are broken

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Madam

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why is this happening?

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why is this happening?

85
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Young Master

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't move

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's useless

88
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Feng Lang was seriously injured when he was young

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Although he was cured by a master

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
he also got old

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He just got out of the internal battle

92
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He should have been on my old wound

93
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What kind of master was cured?

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's find someone to find him

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That senior

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He is stubborn

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He believes in loneliness

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
After he cures me

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
he will be clear

100
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and forgive me

101
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Even if I have to find him

102
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
he won't save me

103
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Feng Lang

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Can you ask that senior's name?

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If he is also a man of the martial arts

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I may have a way

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That senior

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is a master of the Great Yin

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He was able to save me

110
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But he died

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Now no one knows

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
where he is

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Xiao Jiabi injured me several times

114
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If his life is over

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Feng Lang was seriously injured

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If he doesn't recover

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't bear it

118
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I have a favor to ask.

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please speak.

120
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Please take the World Hero Order with you.

121
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,000
Take Young Master Feng to the martial arts world to find Da Yin.

122
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
With the Hero Order,

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
the righteous sects of the martial arts world will always help each other.

124
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
We will find him together.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
I can't. I can't.

126
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,600
Old Madam.

127
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Feng Meng protected Old Madam.

128
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,400
How can I leave this order to myself?

129
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,800
The World Hero Order was formed by the three sect leaders of Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei.

130
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
They were all together to form it.

131
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Its purpose is to save the nation and the people,

132
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
and to help the good and the evil.

133
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,400
Over the past ten years,

134
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,600
it has caused a lot of chaos.

135
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,800
Now, it can use the Hero Order to save people's lives.

136
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,000
This is the meaning of the Hero Order.

137
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Am I right?

138
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Yes.

139
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Young Master Feng, your dream is about to die.

140
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Hero Zhang, are you willing to help me?

141
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I will do as you say.

142
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
You can't delay your life.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,400
Hero Zhang, let's leave after noon.

144
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,600
Feng Lang, thank you for saving my life.

146
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Thank you, Old Madam.

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If so, you can rest here.

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
Let's not disturb each other.

149
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Let's go.

150
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,200
Old Madam.

151
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I am willing to go with Hero Zhang to send Young Master Feng.

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,200
In order to protect Old Madam,

153
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I admire your kindness.

154
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,800
So I hope I can do my best.

155
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
Moreover, I am a woman.

156
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
I can take care of patients more carefully.

157
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,400
I can help Hero Zhang a lot on the way.

158
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,800
Since you are willing to help, that's even better.

159
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
Let's go together.

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Miss Tang.

161
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,200
Your mind is simple and you are not good at making false promises.

162
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
You are a kind lady.

163
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,800
No matter what, you must protect your heart.

164
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
Father.

165
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Did the injury happen?

166
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Father was seriously injured by the Yan Kuan Tu in the Wuxing Mountain.

167
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Now, there is no other way.

168
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Maybe only...

169
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Father is saying that he can forget the Heaven Book.

170
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Forgetting the Heaven Book can be a good thing.

171
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,800
But Yan Kuan Tu has been in the netherworld for a long time.

172
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Where can I find him?

173
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,800
It's not necessary that you must find Yan Kuan Tu.

174
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Yan Kuan Tu.

175
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,200
If he forgets the Heaven Book and re-enters the netherworld,

176
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,400
as long as it's the Yichao不同men of the Jianghu clan,

177
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
he will know it.

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
Father.

179
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,200
I will find the qi and weapons of the netherworld.

180
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Open the Yichao不同men.

181
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
Ask for the Yichao differentmen.

182
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Fang Er.

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Our Tang clan

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,800
must follow the rules of the weak and the strong.

185
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Father is the master of the family.

186
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,600
We are respected only when we work together.

187
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
If the news of father's injury is leaked out,

188
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Zhang Fang will be dead.

189
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Fang Er.

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Thank you.

191
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Only by finding the Heaven Book

192
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
and healing father's wound,

193
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Zhang Fang will have hope.

194
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Miss Tang.

195
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Let's go to the back room.

196
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,400
We will meet in the Feng's tent later.

197
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,400
I can't die in a moment.

198
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Brother.

199
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,000
You don't have to stay here all the time.

200
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,200
I should have protected Pang Rou.

201
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,800
But she died because of me.

202
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Feng.

203
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,600
I just think you and I have some kind of connection.

204
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,400
But you don't have to risk your life to save her.

205
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Don't worry.

206
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Since you call me Fudai,

207
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,400
I will try to survive.

208
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
When you need me,

209
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,200
I will give you a big blessing.

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,600
Boss.

211
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Boss.

212
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Chao An said he would avenge Tang Rou. I can't stop him.

213
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,600
Have a good rest.

214
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Haoran.

215
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,200
Stop.

216
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Boss, don't stop me.

217
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
I want to avenge Tang Rou.

218
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,000
How?

219
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Kill her.

220
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,800
I will kill her if I have the right.

221
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,600
And then?

222
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,600
I don't know the consequences.

223
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,200
And then I see you killed by the evil.

224
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Do you have a brother?

225
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,600
But boss, I don't believe it.

226
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,800
Get up.

227
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,600
Get up.

228
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,200
I don't believe it either.

229
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,200
When I met you,

230
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,000
you said

231
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,200
you would protect everyone.

232
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,000
But you didn't do it.

233
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,800
Brothers,

234
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
impulsiveness is useless.

235
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,800
The only thing we can do

236
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
is to get rid of this enemy.

237
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,400
To avenge the dead

238
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,000
and Tang Rou.

239
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Boss,

240
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,400
the power of the Power Gang is too big.

241
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
We want to avenge.

242
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,600
How to do it?

243
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,000
How long do we have to wait?

244
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
I know it's hard.

245
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,400
But I will do it.

246
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
Boss,

247
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,800
I believe you.

248
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
I believe you too.

249
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,400
We trust the Hu Yuan and Xiao family.

250
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,800
The sooner we solve the problem,

251
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,400
the sooner we can kill the Power Gang

252
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,200
and avenge Tang Rou.

253
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

254
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
The sea is white.

255
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
Although it's far away,

256
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,000
we have to go through thick and thin.

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,600
I will go back now.

258
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,200
I beg my father.

259
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Uncle Qu Yanchi is also on the road.

260
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
I will go to the Qu family to ask for help.

261
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
The Qu family can also

262
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,000
call some friends from the Jin family.

263
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Boss,

264
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
this is my favorite wine.

265
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
You drink it.

266
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Take care of yourself.

267
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,600
Okay, brothers.

268
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Be careful on the road.

269
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
In case you meet

270
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,000
Kang Chu Yi again.

271
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
This guy is really

272
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,400
a cruel man.

273
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
He even did the evil of the Power Gang.

274
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
We called him

275
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Uncle Kang for so many years.

276
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
The family's chief said that

277
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,800
he did everything to stimulate

278
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,600
the power of Han Hao Shi in the sword of the official.

279
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
He worked hard to build the ice and cold heart.

280
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
He is as cold as ice.

281
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
He even asked me to go to his heart.

282
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
I will go to his heart.

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,860
I will go to his heart to make a

284
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,200
great achievement.

285
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,600
Boss, let's keep it.

286
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's go now.

287
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Let's avenge Tang Ruo.

288
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,000
Boss, take care.

289
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,600
Take care.

290
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Take care.

291
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,400
The family's chief said that he did everything to stimulate

292
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,600
the power of Han Hao Shi in the sword of the official.

293
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,200
He worked hard to build the ice and cold heart.

294
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
He is as cold as ice.

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,200
The wound is not deep,

296
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,600
but it's okay to avoid the medicine.

297
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,400
But the wound on the chest

298
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
is caused by internal force.

299
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,600
The lung is not deep.

300
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,400
The wound on the chest is not deep.

301
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,600
The wound on the chest is not deep.

302
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
The wound on the chest is not deep.

303
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,200
The wound on the chest is not deep.

304
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,000
The lung is broken.

305
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,800
Let you treat the illness first.

306
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,600
I will find another chance to see the hero.

307
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Old Madam will understand this.

308
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I heard that this is made by a clever general.

309
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
There are two layers.

310
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The inner layer is the relic.

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The outer layer is the water of the gold.

312
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
If it's not this trick,

313
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,800
the Hero Order of the World

314
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,000
will be taken by someone last night.

315
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,000
Prime Minister Zhang,

316
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
you... you are going to see this now?

317
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I fought yesterday.

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
I was afraid that the box would be damaged.

319
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
If I break the water of the gold,

320
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,000
I will be in trouble.

321
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,200
The water of the gold will destroy the Hero Order.

322
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
The heavenly general's mind is like a magic circle.

323
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,200
He defeated the eight-heroes.

324
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,400
This is...

325
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,400
This is the Hero Order of the World.

326
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Leave it to me to take care of it.

327
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
You are pretending to be injured.

328
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
The wound on Prime Minister Zhang's chest

329
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,800
is not that serious.

330
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,400
Old Madam is kind.

331
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,800
I have been watching you.

332
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
It's really you.

333
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,200
So what?

334
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
知道.

335
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,000
Whatever.

336
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What are you doing to her?

337
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
What did you do to her?

338
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
Nightmare Jialuo incense.

339
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Who are you?

340
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Who are you?

341
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Fifteen years ago,

342
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Zhang Da Xia was one of the people

343
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
who destroyed the Baicao Valley.

344
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
It seems that I'm right.

345
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Zhang Da Xia,

346
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
it's been fifteen years.

347
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
You should pay back

348
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
this debt.

349
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Ten years ago,

350
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I took this girl away.

351
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I'll take care of the rest.

352
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
What's wrong with Tang Fang?

353
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
She's not here.

354
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
She's not here.

355
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
She's not here.

356
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
She's not here.

357
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
What's wrong with her?

358
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
She's just a sleeper.

359
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Why are you getting up?

360
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I'm feeling better.

361
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Aren't you happy?

362
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
You're feeling better.

363
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Happy.

364
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
You're not happy.

365
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
You're just a cold-hearted man.

366
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
You're a broken-minded man.

367
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
So,

368
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
you've been acting.

369
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Yes.

370
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
Little

371
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm here to take the world's heroes

372
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
for the Power Gang.

373
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
No wonder you said

374
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
the world is full of interests.

375
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
So, you've been bribed by the Power Gang.

376
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Little,

377
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
do you really think

378
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm hiding it from you?

379
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
You've been calling me a lucky man.

380
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Are you satisfied with this luck?

381
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Disgusting.

382
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
The people of the Xiao family

383
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
are all evil.

384
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Your father, Xiao Xi Long,

385
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
is the real evil man.

386
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Nonsense.

387
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
My father is a man of light and light.

388
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
He's willing to sacrifice himself

389
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
to protect the world.

390
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
But you

391
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
are not qualified to judge my father.

392
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
You're a righteous man.

393
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
You've done

394
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
so many dirty things.

395
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
You don't know it at all.

396
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
You're a man of evil

397
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
and a man of evil.

398
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
A man of evil?

399
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
You really think

400
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
there's a meaning in this world?

401
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
You poisoned me in the Spirit-Body Formation.

402
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I just want you to see

403
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
whether the martial arts world

404
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
is built on power

405
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
or will.

406
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
By then, you'll know

407
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
that the Xiao family,

408
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
your parents,

409
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
and your father

410
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
are so laughable and pitiful.

411
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
You're a man of light and light.

412
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
You're a man of light and light.

413
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
You're a man of light and light.

414
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
You're a man of light and light.

415
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
You're a man of light and light.

416
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
You're a man of light and light.

417
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
You're a man of light and light.

418
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
You're a man of light and light.

419
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
You're a man of light and light.

420
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
You're a man of light and light.

421
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
You're a man of light and light.

422
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
You're a man of light and light.

423
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
You're a man of light and light.

424
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
You're a man of light and light.

425
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
You're a man of light and light.

426
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Go. Go.

427
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Young Master,

428
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
General Wu's soldiers are coming.

429
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,120
Luckily,

430
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,280
I didn't...

431
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,040
I didn't fail you.

432
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm so grateful.

433
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,800
Xia Qiushui.

434
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
Xia Qiushui.

435
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,120
Xia Qiushui.

436
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,600
Xia Qiushui.

437
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,560
Young Master.

438
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,280
If you want to vent your anger,

439
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,800
I'll find a chance

440
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
to kill them for you.

441
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,280
Remember this.

442
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
If you dare to hurt Tang Feng,

443
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,080
I'll kill you.

444
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,200
Young Master, please forgive me.

445
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,880
I didn't know

446
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,040
that you were so important.

447
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,760
I'll order everyone

448
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,800
not to touch you.

449
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,440
Xia Qiushui.

450
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
I'll spare your life today.

451
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,640
When you see

452
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,040
the mortal realm,

453
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,640
will you believe

454
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:28,260
your

455
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,280
In it,

456
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,760
have a try.

457
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
Okay.

458
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,960
I know you don't like the bitter taste of the stone ball.

459
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,560
But this time, you used the Gui She Lei Zhe skill

460
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,600
to half-fail to be injured

461
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,960
and hurt your body.

462
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,000
You should take it.

463
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,920
It will heal faster.

464
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,600
Song Ming Zhu.

465
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,920
Just do what I told you to do.

466
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,360
Don't worry about what shouldn't be.

467
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,280
Don't worry.

468
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,720
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,280
I'm sorry.

470
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm sorry.

471
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,640
I'm sorry.

472
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,240
I'm sorry.

473
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,880
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,280
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,680
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,680
Don't worry.

480
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,440
I'm good.

481
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,680
It's not done now.

482
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,640
There is still another way to protect you.

483
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,520
It's not done.

484
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
Don't be so suspicious of me.

485
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,920
I...

486
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,640
I have against those who are against me

487
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,000
and someday end up fools,

488
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,840
or else they will forget

489
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,240
that me, Liu Sui Feng, is the vice chief.

490
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,520
Go back.

491
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,000
You dip in addiction of drinking as well.

492
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,160
Greetings, Madam!

493
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,680
A month ago, the court issued a decree

494
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,600
that the wronged general failed to guard the Pass.

495
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,480
He was locked up in the Pass.

496
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,040
We are all the old general's men.

497
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,880
We are qualified to lead the army

498
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,480
and the army horses into the mountains.

499
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,840
Get up.

500
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
Yes.

501
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
We are the soldiers of the Western Regions.

502
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,880
How can we betray the army?

503
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,200
General Wu is here.

504
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,880
We are the archers of the Western Regions.

505
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,160
But General Wu is not here.

506
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,240
They will turn us into a mess.

507
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,440
Once we are separated,

508
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,400
the imperial enemy's elite soldiers will cease to exist.

509
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,040
Only the old lady can save the general.

510
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,120
Only the Western Regions can have hope.

511
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,240
How can we get the emperor's order?

512
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,720
Old lady, you are the one who is in charge.

513
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,120
As long as you go to sleep,

514
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,320
you will have a chance to make the general the only one.

515
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,640
I am ready to wait for General Wu to make a move.

516
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,600
We are waiting for General Wu to make a move.

517
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,000
I need you to leave theль

518
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,160
to have a second chance when you are captured by the Reporter.

519
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,440
Kill him.

520
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,440
Why are you so patient with your Aryan in the palace?

521
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,360
I feel that various resources

522
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,560
will correspond with us in pursuing higher rewards.

523
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,600
Your Majesty Fu of Hanorian Kingdom

524
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
will pass through the wait list.

525
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
I will be responsible for it.

526
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,240
Cao Rang.

527
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,360
Cao Rang.

528
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,880
Your sister will be fine.

529
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,960
Your sister will be fine.

530
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,160
You will be fine.

531
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,440
I'm here.

532
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,720
I'm fine.

533
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,200
How is she?

534
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,280
Madam.

535
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,400
She's not hurt,

536
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,560
but she's not in the drug sea.

537
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
She will recover in a few days.

538
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,720
Madam.

539
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,480
Mr. Zhang...

540
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,160
Luckily, Mr. Zhang's heart is out of the blue.

541
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,320
He's at least alive.

542
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,880
But I'm afraid that

543
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,480
he won't be able to take the sword again.

544
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm afraid that

545
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,320
he won't be able to take the sword again.

546
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,400
I'm afraid that

547
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,960
he won't be able to take the sword again.

548
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm afraid that

549
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,560
he won't be able to take the sword again.

550
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
I'm afraid that

551
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,160
he won't be able to take the sword again.

552
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
I'm afraid that

553
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,560
he won't be able to take the sword again.

554
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
I'm afraid that

555
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
he won't be able to take the sword again.

556
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm afraid that

557
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,480
he won't be able to take the sword again.

558
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm afraid that

559
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,960
he won't be able to take the sword again.

560
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm afraid that

561
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,360
he won't be able to take the sword again.

562
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
I'm afraid that

563
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,960
he won't be able to take the sword again.

564
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I'm afraid that

565
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,360
he won't be able to take the sword again.

566
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
I'm afraid that

567
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,760
he won't be able to take the sword again.

568
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,080
I'm afraid that

569
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,840
he won't be able to take the sword

570
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
again.

571
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
I'm afraid that

572
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,360
he won't be able to take the sword again.

573
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,400
The thing that's the mostól

574
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,960
is to complete the task as you have.

575
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
I'm afraid that

576
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,320
he won't be able to take the sword again.

577
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,720
Who's so bold?

578
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Oh,ر

579
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,520
Our master Bi Guan.

580
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,920
Who is so bold

581
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,200
to touch the OK화�.

582
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's me.

583
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,040
I'm here because I have something to tell you.

584
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,960
I'd like to ask you to help me with my investigation.

585
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,960
When I was investigating the Hero's Order,

586
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,320
the King of the Sword was a guest in the Spirit-gathering Formation.

587
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,960
The Iron-Blooded Demon, Yan Guigui,

588
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
came out of nowhere

589
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,760
and messed up my plan.

590
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
I want to know

591
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,800
if the King of the Sword

592
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,360
intends to oppose me.

593
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,960
I'm here to help you.

594
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
Did you get the King of the Sword's order

595
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,200
to make you bet on me in the Spirit-gathering Formation?

596
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,480
And you made the Iron-Blooded Demon, Yan Guigui and Kang Chu Yu

597
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,720
come up with a plan to take the Hero's Order from Madam?

598
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,120
I...

599
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,720
I...

600
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,560
It has nothing to do with the King of the Sword.

601
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,120
It's me.

602
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,040
The order in the gang

603
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,520
must be passed down

604
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,560
by the chief or deputy chief.

605
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,160
Xu Xiu Shan,

606
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,120
do you know your crime?

607
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,800
The gang rule says

608
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,920
that the King of the Sword must be the one to enter the Hall.

609
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,240
The deputy chief

610
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,680
has already sent the messenger

611
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,040
to break the rule.

612
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,120
It's a change of heart.

613
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,040
That's right.

614
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,480
We are all brothers in the gang.

615
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,040
The Demon King doesn't need to fight.

616
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm the one who breaks the rule.

617
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,040
Only the King of Heaven can enter the Hall.

618
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,040
It's about the living.

619
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,280
It doesn't matter if he's dead.

620
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,320
Deputy Chief,

621
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,160
the King of the Sword is the leader after all.

622
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,680
Should we

623
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,520
talk about it later?

624
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,320
According to the ancient scriptures,

625
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,600
the King of the Sword is still alive.

626
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,360
As the deputy chief,

627
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
I should do my duty

628
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,760
for the King of the Sword.

629
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,760
Even if I commit an unforgivable crime,

630
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,880
according to the gang rule,

631
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,480
I'll only be in the private prison for half a month.

632
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,120
That's just one of the reasons.

633
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,520
Second,

634
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,400
your subordinate, the Iron Fist God Fu Tian Yi,

635
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,920
has been hiding his talent in the Gold and Silver Manor.

636
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,160
Third,

637
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
outside Xiangyang City,

638
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,400
the Purple Phoenix

639
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,720
conspired with others

640
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,120
to poison me and assassinate me.

641
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,160
You can't get away from the Purple Sword today.

642
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,520
Liu Sui Feng,

643
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,800
the Purple Phoenix is your subordinate.

644
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
How dare he do that to me?

645
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,400
The eight kings

646
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,520
have convinced the chief to give him the golden thread.

647
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,480
It's better to die.

648
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,440
If you kill him,

649
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,280
you'll be forced to die.

650
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,040
The one who breaks the barrier will be badly injured.

651
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,520
The rest of them can be killed.

652
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,720
You think

653
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,320
I can't do anything to you,

654
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,720
so you're so arrogant.

655
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,800
But don't forget,

656
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,640
you can kill anyone

657
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,520
but me.

658
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,560
Greetings, Chief and Madam Chief.

659
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,400
Chief is hiding from the officials.

660
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,720
You can't hear the noise.

661
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,440
Don't you know that?

662
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,920
Chief, Madam,

663
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,640
Liu Sui Feng has been arrogant and arrogant these years.

664
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,840
Now he's even falsely accusing me.

665
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,200
Please investigate it.

666
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,640
I heard what you said just now.

667
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,240
You know the rules of the gang.

668
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,720
You can't say anything

669
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,040
because you know the rules.

670
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
You can't do anything

671
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,080
because you know the rules.

672
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,640
I have my own evidence.

673
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,320
Get up.

674
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,600
Thank you, Chief.

675
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,240
This letter

676
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,600
is a secret letter from Fu Tian Yi.

677
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,880
It says

678
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,880
Liu Sui Feng secretly colluded with

679
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,120
the 12 Lian Huan Wu waterway.

680
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,280
But not long after,

681
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,600
Liu Sui Feng took the other person's hand

682
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,120
and killed Fu Tian Yi.

683
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,560
Now he's even falsely accusing him

684
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,960
of colluding with the enemy.

685
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,880
It's clear that Liu Sui Feng

686
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,200
wants to get rid of him

687
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,960
and get the power of the gang.

688
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,720
Chief,

689
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,920
it's Rong Jin.

690
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,040
I never did it.

691
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,840
Qu Xiu Shan.

692
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Yes, sir.

693
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,160
In this letter,

694
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,920
you're talking to yourself.

695
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,280
You're not a threat.

696
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,600
Yes.

697
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,360
Sui Feng.

698
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,800
Chief.

699
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,320
You don't have to blame Xiu Shan

700
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
for the incident between Zi Feng Huang and Fu Tian Yi.

701
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,800
Yes.

702
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,160
I have something to ask you.

703
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,880
You took someone to surround the Xiao Jian Lu.

704
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,400
It's a big problem.

705
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,160
It's hurt a lot of people.

706
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,680
What's the matter?

707
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,960
Chief.

708
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,480
It's for

709
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,880
the Order of Heroes.

710
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,760
When I found out that

711
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,400
Mrs. Wu was in the Xiao Jian Lu,

712
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,920
I didn't have time to

713
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,440
pass on the message to you.

714
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,240
So I asked someone to surround the Jian Lu.

715
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,360
But I didn't get it.

716
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,400
Where is the Order

717
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,080
now?

718
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,600
.

719
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,300
vegetables

720
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,520
act

721
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,560
again

722
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,060
to

723
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:39,960
treat

724
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,500
it

725
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,520
Said

726
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,360
Not

727
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,520
we

728
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,800
can

729
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
You're a bastard!

730
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
You've killed too many people.

731
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
You can't have this order.

732
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
You don't accept it?

733
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Even if you 16 sects go together today,

734
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,160
you'll only lose a few more bodies.

735
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
Fine.

736
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
I'll show you a trick today.

737
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
I'll show you a trick.

738
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,160
If anyone can take the Order of Heroes from me,

739
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
I'll respect him as a man.

740
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Not only will I give him the Order of Heroes,

741
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,160
I'll also give you the Heaven's Love Book.

742
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,160
If you can't defeat me,

743
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,160
you'll have to listen to my order from now on.

744
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
The moon is about to set.

745
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,160
The road of life is long.

746
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,160
The past is left behind in the rain.

747
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,160
It's like a dream.

748
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,160
The earth is heavy.

749
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,160
The city is always the same.

750
