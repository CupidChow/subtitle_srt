The light is everywhere.

11
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,880
I can meet you

12
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,400
where even the brightest yellow moon is.

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,200

Tong Jiaxin!

16

You're worse than your father!

17
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,840
You can't kill him!

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,100
You can't!

19
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,900
Please watch Fushan Sea.

20
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,180
The tea is from the fairyland and Chinese tea.

21
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,180
Please watch Fushan Sea.

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,860
The sea is full of love.

23
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,780
The six-flavor jewelry.

24
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,500
Please watch Fushan Sea.

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,860
The eight-patterned pattern.

26
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,980
Experience the Zhou Songhua.

27
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,380
The Asian-style micro-diamond eye cream.

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,980
Please watch Fushan Sea.

29
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,140
Miss Hongxiao.

30
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,500
Someone is looking for us.

31
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,940
We can't let them go.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,300
Hide here.

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,900
What did Young Master San say?

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,380
Who knows your family is being surrounded?

35
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,980
I heard that your family

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,780
is doing a great thing for the country and people.

37
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm a woman of high status.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,580
I'm happy to do my best.

39
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,860
Thank you.

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,620
For what?

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,900
Wang Xiao said

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,540
you're a regular here.

43
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,060
I should help you.

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,980
I...

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,180
I'm not.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,620
Young Master San, don't misunderstand.

47
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,780
Young Master San came here

48
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,020
for these girls.

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
When we meet the scoundrels,

50
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,460
only Young Master San treats us as people

51
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,940
and helps us vent his anger.

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,460
We all appreciate his kindness.

53
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,020
That's what we should do.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,340
By the way,

55
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,820
it's too remote here.

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,580
It's not safe.

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,340
I'll take you to another place later.

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,700
How can we get out of the town now?

59
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,740
I'll take you to the other place.

60
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,980
I'll take you to the other place.

61
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,420
How can we get out of the town?

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,940
Get out of the town?

63
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,460
The people here have blocked the way.

64
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,660
We need to find a way to get out of the town.

65
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,580
By the way,

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,460
someone ordered oranges outside the town today.

67
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,260
They want you to go to Zhu Xing.

68
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,740
Unless...

69
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,780
Unless what?

70
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,820
Unless you can move into the town.

71
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,820
No.

72
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,380
Absolutely not.

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,740
That's hard.

74
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,180
How about we go to the night house?

75
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,580
The cars there are very smelly.

76
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,300
They won't check it seriously.

77
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,580
You may get out of the town with this car.

78
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,780
I'll go ask around.

79
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,860
How about...

80
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,860
Don't you have a lot of ideas?

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,260
Can we change the car

82
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,980
into the night car?

83
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
We don't have time.

84
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,900
The camp is changing.

85
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,500
Madam doesn't know it yet.

86
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,020
I have to get out of town as soon as possible

87
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,220
to find her.

88
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,100
Young Master.

89
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,220
I've searched the whole land

90
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,460
that came out of the Xiao family.

91
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,020
But I can't find her.

92
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,620
I wonder where she is now.

93
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,500
Don't bother.

94
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
There are many things

95
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,860
that are different in the Xiao Qiu City.

96
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,020
I've been to her whereabouts.

97
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,820
You won't find her.

98
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,540
I was stupid.

99
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,980
What should we do next?

100
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,540
There are people from the King of Jian everywhere.

101
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,940
Why do I think

102
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,580
she's fighting with me in the Flower Division?

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,580
She's hiding outside

104
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,820
and wants to be the queen.

105
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,860
But Xiao Qiu Water

106
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,540
hasn't met with Madam.

107
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,900
Why is the King of Jian

108
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,020
so confident?

109
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,780
She's not moving

110
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,620
but shooting here.

111
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,500
It means Xiao Qiu Water is right.

112
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,780
Madam has a secret place.

113
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,660
There are many secret places in the gang.

114
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,060
It's better to die than to hide.

115
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,100
There are many ways.

116
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,500
Only Qiu Bo has a secret place in the Xiao family.

117
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,540
It's the Unknown Man.

118
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,860
The Unknown Demon?

119
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,020
In recent years,

120
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,860
the people under the King of Jian

121
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,700
only know the Unknown Demon

122
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,860
and his identity.

123
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,580
You keep following me.

124
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,700
Xiao Qiu Water

125
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,220
will bring me and Madam back together.

126
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,020
By then,

127
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,460
the Unknown Demon will also appear.

128
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,260
I want to see

129
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,900
who the Unknown Demon is.

130
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,940
What's the situation?

131
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,860
You've been eating for so long.

132
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,380
There are people searching outside.

133
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,860
I have to be careful.

134
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,220
What's the use of writing these sects?

135
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,300
My mother said

136
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,100
these sects

137
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,460
have a good relationship with the Xiao family.

138
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,740
After I sent Madam Wu away,

139
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,380
I asked them for help.

140
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,020
This world is also dangerous.

141
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,500
I believe

142
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,940
they will help us.

143
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,140
Don't be too optimistic, Brother Xia.

144
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,420
I'm not.

145
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,460
I'm not.

146
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,340
In the past,

147
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,620
people only want two things.

148
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,660
Power and interests.

149
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,540
If interests are the same, they are friends.

150
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,180
Now, the Power Gang

151
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
can give the tribe benefits.

152
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,660
Then, the friends of Flower

153
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,980
will become friends of the Power Gang.

154
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,980
Are you saying they will die in vain?

155
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,700
The world is in a mess.

156
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,140
The power is not here yet.

157
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,580
The world is in a mess.

158
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,620
It's always been like this.

159
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,980
5000 siblings.

160
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,700
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,620
This afforded by others.

162
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,660
Wrong,

163
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:49,760
is

164
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,820
the carried sword.

165
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,440
But, there are

166
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,240
many people like that.

167
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,500
When the water dries,

168
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,220
I'll have us potatoes again.

169
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,700
I don't know.

170
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
is the foundation of the pugilistic world.

171
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Why don't we make a bet?

172
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Let's see

173
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
if the pugilistic world is built on power

174
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
or on will.

175
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Okay.

176
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I'll bet with you.

177
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
What do you want to bet on?

178
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
The winner

179
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
can take away the other person's favorite item.

180
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Favorite item?

181
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Whatever you say.

182
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
I just want to use something that scares people

183
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
to wake you up.

184
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
If you don't like it,

185
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
then I'll change it.

186
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
No problem.

187
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
I'll bet with you.

188
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
But you've decided.

189
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
That's the only way.

190
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Young Master.

191
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Oh no.

192
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Master Zhang just told me that the car broke down.

193
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
We can't leave the town tonight.

194
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
But we have to leave the town tonight.

195
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
How about this, Hongxiao?

196
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Go and find me a black cloak

197
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
and get me a carriage.

198
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
How do you want to leave the town?

199
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
It's up to you.

200
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Since the people of the Power Gang are looking for us,

201
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,700
why don't we be the people of the Power Gang?

202
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
This...

203
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Don't worry.

204
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
What are you going to do?

205
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Before this, Tang Rou and the others

206
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
helped me write a lot of people

207
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
who are famous in the martial arts world.

208
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
I found that the Power Gang

209
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
has not only a large number of people,

210
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
but also a lot of people.

211
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
And they are all dressed up.

212
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
They are not united.

213
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
So,

214
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
in my speculation,

215
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Li Chen Zhou, Zhao Shirong, Liu Suifeng,

216
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
these three people

217
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
know that they are not really together.

218
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
What?

219
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
You want to be Li Chen Zhou?

220
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Wrong.

221
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Li Chen Zhou is high up.

222
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
How could he come here?

223
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,700
I want to be Liu Suifeng.

224
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
No wonder.

225
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
If I remember correctly,

226
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Liu Suifeng

227
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
also has a white fan.

228
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Excuse me.

229
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
But Liu Suifeng's subordinate,

230
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
Song Ming Zhu,

231
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
just came in.

232
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Aren't you afraid of being hit by him?

233
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I know that you are not good at observing.

234
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Let me ask you.

235
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Who are following us all the way here?

236
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Did you think about it carefully?

237
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
The people who are chasing after us,

238
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
their clothes and colors are not the same.

239
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Then who are you going to let me be?

240
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Zhao Shirong.

241
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
No.

242
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,700
You are changing your mind again.

243
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Why are you not Zhao Shirong,

244
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,700
and I am Liu Suifeng?

245
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
What's your memory?

246
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
You and the Power Gang have been married.

247
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
You shouldn't show up.

248
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
You just have to stay in the carriage

249
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
and don't come out.

250
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Don't worry.

251
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I will never let you wear a girl's dress.

252
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I will never let you wear a girl's dress.

253
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
You have been walking in the martial arts world for so many years.

254
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
You know them a little bit.

255
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
You know them a little bit.

256
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
Don't say anything bad about them.

257
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Use the fan well.

258
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Stop.

259
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Didn't you hear me?

260
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Everyone is not allowed to leave the station.

261
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
You are such a dog.

262
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,700
You dare to stop the carriage?

263
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Who said anything bad about it?

264
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
A fan.

265
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I am a basket.

266
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Could it be

267
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Master Liu Fu?

268
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Is the lady master in the carriage?

269
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Is this what you should ask?

270
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
I don't believe it.

271
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
I was just ordered to guard here.

272
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
I can't be careless.

273
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
I don't believe it.

274
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
I don't believe it.

275
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
I don't believe it.

276
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
I don't believe it.

277
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
I can't be careless.

278
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,700
There are few people in the gang who have seen you and Master Liu Fu.

279
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Could you show me the card of Master Liu Fu

280
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
and give me a wish?

281
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
I think you are really a dog.

282
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
I

283
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
have seen your back

284
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
in the gang many years ago.

285
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Did you Console my mom perornally?

286
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,700
You didn't criticize us

287
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
if I don't praise you

288
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
for refusing to give the maids

289
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
the help you give

290
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
at妳why.

291
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
I

292
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
married you before my wife died.

293
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
I

294
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
killed women

295
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
and left them to do nothing.

296
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,460
Get out of the way.

297
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,180
I deserve it.

298
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,900
Get out of the way.

299
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,940
Xingli.

300
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,940
Thank you.

301
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,180
If you meet Miss Hongxiao again,

302
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,660
please return this dress to her.

303
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,300
Okay.

304
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,660
We should thank the young hero first.

305
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,820
Otherwise, we really don't know

306
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,540
when we will be trapped in this cold town.

307
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,140
Young Hero, we'll leave now.

308
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,100
Goodbye.

309
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,260
Brother, let's go too.

310
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,500
I just saw you use

311
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,620
Zhao Shirong's Liuyin Water Embroidery.

312
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,140
What? You know how to make a tent?

313
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,020
It's just a trick to scare people.

314
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,900
You've been teaching me to make a tent.

315
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,060
You should learn some rare tricks.

316
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,460
It's getting late. Let's go.

317
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,380
Is it so windy?

318
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,940
No.

319
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,380
It's important to meet Madam first.

320
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
I wonder if Brother is here.

321
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,780
Once it's over,

322
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,820
I'll tell Brother to come back with Shi Ning

323
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,700
to help me.

324
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,180
It's so slow.

325
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,900
I thought you were caught.

326
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,700
We took great efforts to get out.

327
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,380
How is it?

328
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,500
Have you met Madam?

329
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,820
We've been waiting for a day.

330
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,820
She's been coming and going.

331
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,860
We only found the person who helped her.

332
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,580
Have you found the person?

333
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,220
She left a letter and changed the location.

334
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,460
She said she wanted me to bring Madam

335
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,380
to meet them.

336
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,580
Where should we go now?

337
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,820
They will definitely leave a mark on the way.

338
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,380
As long as we find the secret code,

339
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,460
we may find Madam.

340
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,660
Let's go.

341
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,580
Go.

342
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,760
Don't be afraid.

343
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,720
He Arrived at a coma

344
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
because he was too puke.

345
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,960
Luckily, he regained consciousness temporarily.

346
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,040
You did a good job.

347
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,300
Don't be afraid.

348
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,380
We're from the Fermented ends.

349
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,060
Tell me this.

350
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,860
What happened here?

351
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,100
They are making elixir here.

352
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,660
They are trying to test us.

353
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,220
If we don't obey, they will kill us.

354
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,900
If we obey and take their elixir,

355
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,220
they will all...

356
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,180
They will go crazy.

357
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,340
They will die of poison.

358
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,700
What is the elixir?

359
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,860
I just know that

360
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,740
taking their elixir

361
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,140
will not make me feel sleepy

362
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,900
and will make me violent.

363
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,860
It is indeed the elixir of the Lord.

364
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,740
What kind of people forced you to make elixir?

365
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,020
Could it be from the North?

366
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,900
No.

367
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,180
It's...

368
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,900
It's from the martial arts world.

369
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,500
I saw their badges

370
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,140
with the pattern on the top.

371
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,260
The pattern on the top?

372
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,420
Brother,

373
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,300
is it the Box of Power?

374
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,260
Is there anyone who still exists?

375
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,300
This...

376
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,660
Don't worry.

377
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,260
My sister is very clever.

378
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,900
She can definitely help you.

379
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,180
Save the Heroine.

380
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,820
Please save us.

381
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,020
Don't worry.

382
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,540
We should be there soon.

383
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,500
Let's go.

384
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,140
Yiren, Kaiyan, Xueyu.

385
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,060
Sister Xiao Yi.

386
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,140
Xiao Yi, why are you here?

387
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,860
I know you came to Guangling.

388
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,300
So you are here to meet us.

389
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,500
We have been apart for three years.

390
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,340
Are the elders, brothers and sisters of the Nangong family

391
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,340
doing well?

392
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,180
They are all fine.

393
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,340
Yiren,

394
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,300
you have worked hard on your journey.

395
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,620
If I can find out

396
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,180
the elixir of the Lord this time,

397
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,620
it's nothing.

398
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,660
But this time,

399
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,980
it's a bit urgent.

400
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,940
Let's go inside first.

401
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,940
Yiren,

402
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,900
I think we should just forget it.

403
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,860
Now in the pugilistic world,

404
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,740
who dares to offend the Box of Power so easily?

405
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,460
If we keep chasing after them,

406
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,340
we will be burned by fire.

407
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,020
But I came here

408
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,180
because the Xiao family

409
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,820
is responsible for finding out the truth.

410
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,300
We can't just give up.

411
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,500
Yes.

412
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,420
But it's not wrong to do it with your own strength.

413
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,980
We should

414
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,060
take the matter of the pugilistic world as our responsibility.

415
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,580
But after all,

416
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,500
it's the Box of Power.

417
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,860
Yiren,

418
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,100
why don't you ask your father?

419
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,740
The elixir of the Lord is important.

420
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,100
It's not good for the elixir

421
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,500
if you easily defeat the enemy.

422
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,180
You can send the elixir back to the Box of Power immediately.

423
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,940
After discussing with your father,

424
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,060
you can make a decision.

425
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,860
Okay.

426
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,060
Young Master San.

427
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,900
Are you all right?

428
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,660
Boss.

429
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,620
You're finally here.

430
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,020
We found out that the Lianliang Town was occupied by the Box of Power.

431
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,780
We had to find this broken house.

432
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,420
I was worried that you wouldn't find it.

433
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,740
I told you

434
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,460
Qiu Shui wouldn't miss my mark.

435
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,220
What?

436
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,380
You just do whatever he says.

437
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,820
You didn't even tell me.

438
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,780
Sister.

439
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,780
I mean,

440
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,660
I believe in your martial arts

441
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,380
and the plan of Boss.

442
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,020
Isn't it all good?

443
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,060
All right, stop talking.

444
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,100
I got the letter from Tongfu Inn.

445
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,940
I have to see Lady Wu immediately.

446
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,100
I'm leaving now.

447
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,140
Qiu Shui.

448
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,380
I just found this place with Jie Sheng.

449
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,620
I'm late.

450
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,340
Uncle Kang.

451
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,780
Luckily, Qiu Shui

452
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,060
brought a letter to the Lianliang Town.

453
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,980
Otherwise,

454
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,820
I'm afraid that he will miss the meeting.

455
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,900
How is the Xiao family now?

456
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,420
When General Wu's troops arrive tomorrow,

457
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,860
I'll go to the Jianghu to save them

458
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
and go back to the Xiao family.

459
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,060
Don't worry, Lady Wu.

460
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,620
I'll take the time.

461
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,860
That's good.

462
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,460
Good.

463
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,660
The people who came out of the Xiao family

464
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,220
are finally here.

465
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,180
Lady Wu.

466
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,460
The letter says

467
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,140
the meeting place is not far from here.

468
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,340
It's half past midnight.

469
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,420
Why don't we go there?

470
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,820
Since it's not far,

471
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,140
we've been tired for days.

472
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,820
Why don't we take a break first?

473
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,220
All right.

474
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,620
Qiu Shui.

475
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,580
When everything is over tomorrow,

476
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,060
Uncle Kang will take you to the Qiu Garden in person.

477
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,660
Thank you, Uncle Kang.

478
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,220
Kang Da Xia, Third Young Master.

479
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,100
The porridge is ready.

480
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,980
Bring it to the people inside first.

481
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,180
How is the knife?

482
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,940
Take a look.

483
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,820
It's fine.

484
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,940
It's not too sharp.

485
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,900
It's not too sharp.

486
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,900
It's not too sharp.

487
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,980
It's not too sharp.

488
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,060
It's not too sharp.

489
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,100
It's not too sharp.

490
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
It's not too sharp.

491
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,340
It's not too sharp.

492
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
It's not too sharp.

493
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,820
It's not too sharp.

494
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,100
Madam,

495
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,740
Master Zhang, have some porridge.

496
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Master Zhang,

497
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,220
it's been a long journey.

498
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,900
You've worked hard.

499
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,460
Thank you, Madam.

500
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
There's something wrong with this car.

501
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,780
Changcai!

502
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,700
Lady Wu.

503
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,980
Are you all right?

504
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,780
I'm fine.

505
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
You're all hit by the soft gold umbrella.

506
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,820
Let's see how long you can hold on.

507
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,100
Uncle Kang, you...

508
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,500
What's the time?

509
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,940
Why are you calling me uncle?

510
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,940
You're really good at it.

511
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,900
You're from the Power Gang.

512
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,900
You're so good at it.

513
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,540
You're so good at it.

514
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,740
You're from the Power Gang.

515
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,740
You're so good at it.

516
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,700
You're so good at it.

517
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
You're so good at it.

518
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
You're so good at it.

519
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,700
I've been trying to solve the problems for the Gang all these years.

520
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,780
I have to care about my reputation.

521
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,980
I've been trying to get the best of it.

522
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,020
Otherwise,

523
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,500
how could I let you take the lead?

524
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,540
I even recommended you to be the Young Master.

525
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,900
Xiao Qiushui,

526
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,940
I must kill you today.

527
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,420
To thank you for your hatred.

528
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,500
Do you really think that the two of you

529
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
can kill all of us

530
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,420
without me?

531
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,100
Who said we only have two people?

532
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,580
Be careful!

533
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,860
Take Madam away first.

534
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,660
I'll stop them.

535
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,420
Okay.

536
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,060
Go.

537
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,380
What's this?

538
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,100
Who's the devil riding the horse?

539
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,700
It's the evil Yan Guigui.

540
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
He only knows the beast.

541
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,140
He's not fake.

542
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,580
My god!

543
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,940
Hold Seat.

544
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,500
Okay.

545
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,060
Take Madam away.

546
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:28,040
The

547
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,440
Old Madam.

548
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,140
It's Song Mingzhu.

549
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,540
He took the old lady's bag.

550
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,640
I'll go get her.

551
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Feng Lang.

552
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,440
Young Hero!

553
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,540
Don't go after him!

554
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,940
Actually, this Hero's Order

555
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,640
is in the Nian Yuan's box.

556
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,040
It can't be triggered.

557
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,740
It can trigger the Hero's Order.

558
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,740
The killing is too heavy.

559
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,040
The Hero's Order...

560
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,640
can trigger it.

561
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,640
Old Madam.

562
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,940
What's most important is that you're fine.

563
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,040
Boss.

564
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,340
I'll go after him.

565
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,840
Be careful!

566
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,240
Go!

567
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,440
Young Hero.

568
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,140
In the box of the Nian Gui Gui,

569
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,040
there are actually two people.

570
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,940
I've been doing this for ten years.

571
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,640
Thank you for killing my brother.

572
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,240
I can finally be the leader.

573
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,640
Brothers.

574
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
You guys protect Old Madam.

575
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,640
You two want to kill me?

576
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,940
You don't think of me?

577
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
That's right.

578
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,340
I see you. You're far worse than your brother.

579
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,140
Let's go.

580
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,740
Old Madam is more important. Let's go.

581
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,940
Young Master.

582
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,340
It's really the Nian Yuan box.

583
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,940
The one I just took was like this.

584
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
It's really the Nian Gui Gui.

585
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,140
It's really the Nian Yuan box.

586
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
It looks like this.

587
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,040
It looks like the box has destroyed the Hero's Order.

588
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,940
Old Madam's good strategy

589
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,140
won't tell us how to open the box.

590
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,840
So, you're going to lie to Old Madam

591
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,240
and open it yourself?

592
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,140
Young Master!

593
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,140
I've always been unrelated to you.

594
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,740
I'm the deputy chief Bat cement official of whoever types the tonight's plan.

595
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,740
Fatty Ling Old Lady.

596
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,740
Please believe in me.

597
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,540
I can even be Mao Bai's main 씻C alsid.

598
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,700
Young Master,

599
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,500
are youaudio gotta rent the box.

600
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,540
Stop there!

601
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,940
Old Madam!

602
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,340
Song Qiu.

603
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,060
Do you want to...

604
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,380
kill another person?

605
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,460
Let you think about it.

606
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,580
You!

607
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,020
Kang Chu Yu, stop!

608
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,740
Brother! Sister!

609
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,940
Kang Chu Yu,

610
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,700
you are really a despicable person.

611
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,580
My father has known you for many years.

612
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,860
But you are still a despicable person.

613
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,900
Tell me.

614
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,740
What did the Power Gang give you?

615
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,740
Before I became famous,

616
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,500
I was the demon of the Power Gang.

617
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,980
I was just hiding my identity.

618
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,500
I didn't want to be exposed.

619
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,100
You are the demon of the unknown?

620
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,020
Although I am unknown,

621
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,460
I am famous.

622
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,860
Whoever the gang needs me,

623
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,580
I am.

624
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,300
You don't even dare to use your name.

625
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,420
You are a hero who has been pretending for many years.

626
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,580
It's really funny.

627
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,380
Whatever you say,

628
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,260
I only want the Hero Order.

629
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,540
Where is it?

630
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,500
Where is it?

631
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,500
Where is it?

632
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,260
Tell me where it is!

633
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,020
Stop it.

634
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,820
The Hero Order was taken away by Sun Ming Zhu.

635
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,980
He left you to lead the attack alone.

636
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,860
The demon of the unknown Kang Chu Yu

637
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,540
will be sent to the north and south tomorrow.

638
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,220
That's not necessarily the case.

639
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,140
As long as you all die here today.

640
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,300
I am still unknown.

641
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,140
Kang Chu Yu.

642
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,740
You dare to speak up when you are about to die?

643
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,700
Then at this moment,

644
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,380
I will kill your friend first.

645
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,220
Wait.

646
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,740
The Hero Order is here.

647
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,740
Don't hurt anyone.

648
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,580
Why are you hurt?

649
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,380
I'm fine.

650
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm fine.

651
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,220
Father,

652
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,740
you almost killed me.

653
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,580
Father.

654
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,180
Father.

655
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,320
Jing Xiu!

656
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,980
Jing Xiu!

657
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,940
Jing Xiu!

658
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,260
Jing Xiu!

659
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,180
Heh!

660
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,980
Let's go together.

661
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,020
Brother!

662
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,660
Tang Rou, face the enemy!

663
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,740
Madam, I'm here.

664
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,740
Tang Rou.

665
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,980
Tang Rou. Tang Rou.

666
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,340
Tang Rou.

667
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,180
Jin Sheng.

668
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,140
Don't let these two evil men go!

669
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,820
Shoot!

670
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,260
unclear

671
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Run. Run.

672
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,780
Jin Sheng.

673
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,180
Run!

674
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,100
Tang Rong.

675
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,580
Tang Rong.

676
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,940
Tang Rong.

677
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,980
Xia...

678
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,380
Old Tang.

679
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,740
Mr. Feng.

680
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,500
Brother.

681
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,740
How is Feng Lang?

682
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,820
He needs treatment.

683
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,620
Tang Rong.

684
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,540
Tang Rong.

685
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,460
Tang Rong.

686
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:20,940
Tang Rong.

687
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,700
Tang Rong.

688
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,660
Sorry for your loss.

689
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,300
Lady Wu.

690
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Save Brother Rou.

691
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,780
Yes.

692
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,740
Lady Wu.

693
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,020
Young Master Tang Rong

694
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,660
was cut off his heart by a sword.

695
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,820
He's helpless now.

696
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,900
choosing a wife.

697
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Old older sister.

698
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,700
My lord.

699
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,940
My lord.

700
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Xia.

701
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,900
Tian.

702
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
Sister.

703
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,580
Why are you so stupid?

704
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,860
Why did you take that sword?

705
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,740
Sister.

706
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,300
I can save my friend.

707
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,180
I'm very happy.

708
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,220
I just made you angry again.

709
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,300
You...

710
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,460
How can I explain to my father?

711
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,140
They are like a rock.

712
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,140
These years,

713
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,860
we've been looking for the guards.

714
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,460
We're thinking of saving our lives.

715
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,540
We can make more friends

716
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,860
so that they can contribute to him.

717
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,780
That's all

718
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,260
I want to say to you.

719
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,780
Sister.

720
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,540
Sister.

721
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,740
From now on

722
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,060
I leave you alone.

723
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,780
When it about past mal hidous,

724
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,220
i've thought of it back.

725
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:15,360
Why is it always

726
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,760
Who will love someone?

727
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,480
The sky is bright and the moon is bright.

728
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:31,120
The tears fall and the wind is not strong.

729
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,880
Darong.

730
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,640
What are you talking about?

731
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,280
You will be fine.

732
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,320
You will be fine.

733
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,560
How many branches are in the world?

734
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,760
Where are the grass and the grass?

735
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,040
Love and hate are so fast.

736
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,400
Do you remember when we first met?

737
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,000
I asked you where we met.

738
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,600
You said the bridge is like water.

739
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,280
The deep and shallow.

740
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,000
I only saw the bridge.

741
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,160
I only saw the bridge.

742
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,840
I don't want to be punished by you.

743
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't want to be punished by you.

744
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,720
You can't change me.

745
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,200
I understand these principles.

746
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,840
I am grateful.

747
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Darong.

748
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,880
If I go to the end of the world.

749
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,640
Who will love someone?

750
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,120
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,880
I failed to protect you.

752
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,240
I'm sorry, Darong.

753
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:49,000
What are you talking about?

754
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,280
You protect the world in our heart.

755
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,600
After I leave.

756
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,800
I have one thing to ask you.

757
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,080
Say it.

758
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:13,200
I will do anything for you.

759
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,040
My sister.

760
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,760
My sister is a sharp-tongued and heartless person.

761
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,720
In the future, let her be.

762
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,000
Take care of her for me.

763
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,600
What are you doing?

764
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,320
I can take care of myself.

765
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,640
Okay.

766
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,960
Okay.

767
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,720
The deep and shallow.

768
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,280
So good.

769
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,000
Twenty years later.

770
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,120
I become a human.

771
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,880
Shenzhou.

772
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,280
It should be all fake.

773
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,720
If from now on.

774
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,840
Every part of us in the world.

775
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,680
I came with you.

776
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,800
As long as Shenzhou is here.

777
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,040
We will be together forever.

778
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,560
Tears fall like wind.

779
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,360
No way out.

780
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,680
The grey fog.

781
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,520
The dust.

782
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,720
The dream in my eyes.

783
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,120
How many branches.

784
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,000
The world.

785
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,840
The grass.

786
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,720
The farm.

787
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,200
The monk.

788
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,600
Love and hate.

789
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,520
The grudge.

790
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,440
The rain.

791
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,560
The unbreakable bond.

792
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,320
The time we missed.

793
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,040
The fate we can't break.

794
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,760
Who gives a sword.

795
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,560
What's left of the ten years.

796
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,320
The sword is cut off by the sharp sword.

797
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,560
The sword is cut off by the sharp sword.

798
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,880
The flowers fall.

799
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,880
The sound of the flute.

800
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,320
The wind blows.

801
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,400
The song of the flute.

802
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,760
Who cares.

803
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,320
Love and hate.

804
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,040
The past.

805
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,560
Tears fall like wind.

806
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,560
The wind blows.

807
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,560
The song of the flute.

808
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,560
The wind blows.

809
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,560
The song of the flute.

810
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,560
The song of the flute.

811
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,560
The song of the flute.

812
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,560
The song of the flute.

813
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,560
The song of the flute.

814
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,560
The song of the flute.

815
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,560
The song of the flute.

816
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,560
The song of the flute.
