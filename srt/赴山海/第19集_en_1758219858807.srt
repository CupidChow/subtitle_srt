00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,920
How to Kill Evenine

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let the rain fall on the snowy mountains

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The sword has never been changed

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For thousands of years, I have been waiting

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Waiting for you to come

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The wind blows hard

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The waves are strong

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will go to the end of the world

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let the city and river be together again

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When the lights are out, the love will be over

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The end of the dark night, the sword in the night

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't forget this 100

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let the ice break the blood and the wounds

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The sword has never been changed

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For thousands of years, I have been waiting

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Waiting for you to come

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The wind blows hard

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The cloud seems to be laughing

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The first line was arranged by the original

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mom, I really am sorry for you

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I shouldn't have come to this world

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Qiushui, who said you were wrong?

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
On this road, no matter who I am

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No one can do better than you

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Tang Feng, you don't have to say anything

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm sorry

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tang Feng, you don't have to say anything

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I know now, no matter what I say

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't calm your emotions

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The world is a little far from them

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I will definitely think of a good way to cure you

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm fine

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you, you should go too

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't waste your time on a useless person like me

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Challenge the power gang

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't be afraid of life and death

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
To expose the sword king

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Even if it's broken, you have to save your family

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Such a little Qiushui is the pride of all of us

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What is true, what is false

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Who will know this world

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I won't talk to you anymore

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wait for the day to come

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There is no day to come

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tang Feng, everything is over

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There is nothing to keep you

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Take care

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No problem

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You go over

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Brother

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Brother

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The materials needed to reopen the sect are all ready

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
By the way

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That委托, the sword built by Zhu Jian Shanshuang

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
When will it be finished

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Within three days

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Brother, there is a disaster in the family

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You are the pillar of the Xiao family

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We are all relying on you

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Brother, don't be so immersed in sorrow

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I know

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I started at my parents' head

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I started to open the sect again

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
To die

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Recover my family

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I changed the sword to the sword

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If there is no sword, it can't be broadened

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So this Zhu Jian Shanshuang building

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The sword

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You have to do it yourself

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There is one more thing

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What is it

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This ordinary disease is easy to get

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But Changge sword

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Did you tell me the whereabouts

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Brother, although there are many people in the world

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Know that

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Father will soon pass on the position of the master to brother

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But on behalf of the position of the master

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If Changge sword is not in hand

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I am a son of the Xiao family

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now re-establish our family

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How can I be afraid of these rumors

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not for anything else

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This time we called these sects

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Not just to take back

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The field products that Huanhua lent them before

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But when I was in the Xiao family

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They didn't do it

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Today

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What if they deny it

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm afraid if they don't admit it

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have my own way

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Re-establish Huanhua

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
To be able to tell the power of parents in heaven

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Master

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Come

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Come

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Go

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Go

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Go

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Go

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Go

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Go

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Go

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Go

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Go

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Go

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,600
be careful

122
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
You trip back

123
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,040
Again and again

124
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,520
Chief is true to the hero supplies

125
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,000
but

126
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,760
tell me

127
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
Go to Sanshan and meet the chief

128
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,200
No, he did not.

129
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
He is not a leader.

130
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,440
He is still the leader.

131
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,040
They will seek justice.

132
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,920
It's not your fault.

133
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,360
You took blame for him by killing my sister's son.

134
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,280
Now you wantיץ to punish him for his evil plan.

135
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,200
I failed for you.

136
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
It's not your fault.

137
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,940
just as an alternate to understand the painую

138
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,400
saw?

139
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,960
On the hand oforia

140
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,240
Article

141
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,840
will advance

142
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,040
Fire

143
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,700
to take action

144
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Let the tears fall like the wind and the night is endless

145
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Who can tell the difference between love and hate?

146
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,240
The more I think about it, the more I feel helpless

147
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,240
Let the tears fall like the wind and the night is endless

148
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,240
The flowers fall and the stars follow

149
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,240
The head has been without a look for three days for the Keling Sect

150
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Boss, Brother Xiao is setting up a camp in other people

151
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,240
The Keling Sects in Guangyao and Jindu say they want to rebuild the flowers

152
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Thank you for coming

153
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
I, Xiao Yi Ren, am here to give you my regards

154
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,240
How can the Keling Sect invite us without a reason?

155
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Young Hero Xiao invited us to such a big camp

156
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I think there must be something wrong

157
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,240
To be honest, our Xiao family is in danger now

158
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,240
My father, Xiao Xi Long, was killed by the Power Gang

159
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,240
I think everyone knows about it

160
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
I don't believe it

161
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,240
You have always been the representative of the Jindu Sect

162
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
You have been protecting the martial arts of Jindu for many years

163
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Now the Flower Sword Sect has been destroyed by the Ji Ye

164
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,240
We Jindu martial arts people are deeply sorry

165
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Everyone, so I invited everyone here today to discuss this matter

166
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Come

167
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Let's go

168
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
This is called a new sect

169
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Yes, a new sect

170
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Yes, a new sect

171
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
This is called a new sect

172
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Yes, a new sect

173
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
This is a new sect

174
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Good job

175
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
The flower is blooming

176
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,240
Everyone, I, Xiao Maoren, am very happy to welcome you

177
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
It's a good deal.

178
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
It's a good deal.

179
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,040
Everyone,

180
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm not good at fighting.

181
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm not as good as my father

182
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,640
in martial arts and the martial arts world.

183
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,520
But now that my father is gone,

184
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,960
I, Xiao Yiren,

185
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
am willing to rebuild my sect

186
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,360
and lead the martial arts world.

187
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,720
Today, I will reopen my sect

188
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,640
and make a new start in this place.

189
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,800
I hope you can help me.

190
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,840
We will support the Xiao family.

191
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,400
That's right.

192
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,040
The flowers will be reborn.

193
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
It will be a great help to us.

194
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
That's right.

195
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,080
Congratulations, Young Master Xiao.

196
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,960
Congratulations.

197
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,680
Congratulations.

198
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Congratulations.

199
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,920
Congratulations.

200
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,720
Congratulations.

201
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,440
Congratulations.

202
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,000
Young Master Xiao is a good person.

203
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,280
He's a good dancer.

204
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,800
I wonder what plan you have

205
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
to rebuild the flowers.

206
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,680
In the past, the ancestors

207
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,440
didn't protect the martial arts of the capital.

208
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,280
They used the land between the Xiao family and the Tang family

209
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,640
to make an agreement for a hundred years

210
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,680
and rented it to all the sects of the capital.

211
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680
Now I'm re-establishing the flowers.

212
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,760
So I hope you can return the land

213
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,240
and take over the land rent for a hundred years.

214
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
A hundred years of land rent?

215
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,400
That's a lot.

216
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,160
That's a lot.

217
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,840
Young Master Xiao,

218
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,680
did your father promise us

219
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,160
to rent the land for free?

220
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,440
My father

221
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,360
values the friendship between the sects of the capital and the martial arts world.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,760
Now our family is in a crisis.

223
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,520
Please understand.

224
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,800
Your father, Xiao Xilou,

225
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,600
rented the land to us.

226
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,520
Why do you want to take it back?

227
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,240
Now I'm the young leader of the Xiao family.

228
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,200
Are you questioning me?

229
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,240
To be honest,

230
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,840
I sent the Tang family to sign the contract yesterday.

231
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,320
You...

232
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,400
I've already handed the land rent to the Tang family.

233
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,520
If you want money or food,

234
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
go to the Tang family.

235
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,160
Tang family?

236
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,520
We've already lost

237
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,080
the land of the Gui Dao Sect to the Tang family.

238
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,400
Have you forgotten

239
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
that you owe the Xiao family

240
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
more than the land and the land rent?

241
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,960
Xiao Yiren,

242
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,320
you're doing this

243
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,000
because you're afraid of ruining the reputation of the Flower Sword Sect.

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,240
My father, Xiao Xilou,

245
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,240
has been a kind person

246
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,160
for the rest of his life,

247
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,080
but what has he got?

248
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,280
He's got you

249
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,840
who don't care about the old love.

250
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,160
What?

251
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,600
What's this?

252
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,200
Forget it.

253
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,720
If you hurt your friends,

254
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,600
that's it.

255
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,800
I believe you

256
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,240
understand the power of this.

257
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,600
I'll give you

258
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,160
half a month's time.

259
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,720
In the beginning of next month,

260
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,320
it's forty-three grams.

261
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,600
I hope you

262
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,680
can give me the land and the money.

263
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,840
I know that

264
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,680
the red door banquet

265
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,320
is held today.

266
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,600
Goodbye.

267
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Goodbye.

268
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,760
The third young master of the Xiao family.

269
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,520
It's him.

270
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
He's the reason

271
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,440
why the Xiao family is in danger.

272
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,240
Let's go.

273
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,880
Let's go.

274
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,200
It's the day of the reconstruction of the Flower Sword Sect.

275
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,760
What are you doing here?

276
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,600
Brother,

277
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,280
my parents once told us

278
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,720
that evil and good people

279
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,040
are not dangerous.

280
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,200
They are all despicable.

281
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
How can we

282
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,720
be like them?

283
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,320
Stop talking nonsense.

284
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,640
You're not a good person.

285
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,680
You're a good person.

286
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
You're a good person.

287
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
You're a good person.

288
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
You're a good person.

289
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
You're a good person.

290
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,280
Stop talking nonsense.

291
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,040
These people

292
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,800
are the ones who

293
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,760
tried to kill us

294
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,680
when the Xiao family was in danger.

295
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,280
I used the way of the Qi people

296
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,520
to protect the God of Qi.

297
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
What's wrong with that?

298
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,480
How can I do anything

299
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,160
if I don't rebuild the Xiao family?

300
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
I didn't mean to blame you.

301
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,920
I mean,

302
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,600
I can't help the power

303
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,800
to control the people's hearts.

304
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,640
Shut up!

305
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,800
You still dare to

306
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
mention the power to the power?

307
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
If you didn't

308
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
lure the evil man into the world,

309
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,160
you would have been killed

310
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
by the evil Liu Suifeng.

311
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,640
How could we resist?

312
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,520
Brother,

313
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,680
do you know why I didn't

314
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,640
go back to the Sword-Slaying Sect

315
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
after my parents died?

316
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,400
It's because

317
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,320
I was afraid that I would

318
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,960
punish you if I saw you.

319
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
You really disappointed me.

320
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
Brother, calm down.

321
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
Qiu Shui has lost all his martial arts.

322
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,320
Why do you have to

323
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,400
be so strict with him?

324
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
He did what he should have done.

325
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Does he deserve the title of Xiao General?

326
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,880
Qiu Shui.

327
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,080
Qiu Shui.

328
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,360
Qiu Shui, you're awake.

329
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,560
Master Liang.

330
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,360
Don't move.

331
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,760
You haven't fully recovered yet.

332
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,280
Master Liang,

333
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,360
where are we?

334
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
It takes some time

335
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
to rebuild the temple

336
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,520
after the flowers have been replaced.

337
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,360
This is my private house.

338
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
It's enough for you

339
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,160
and your brothers to live together.

340
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
This time,

341
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,360
I'll have to trouble you again.

342
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Master Liang,

343
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,360
it's all thanks to you.

344
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
I've heard everything

345
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
you've been through

346
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
along the way.

347
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
You were brave

348
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
and fought against the Power Gang

349
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
with the help of the God-bearing Spell.

350
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
In fact,

351
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
you've already

352
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
made a name for yourself.

353
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
I'm glad that

354
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
I haven't been able to save anything.

355
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Nothing has changed.

356
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,360
I thought

357
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
that I could fight

358
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
with the power of my own.

359
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
But I was wrong.

360
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
It's only two days

361
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
since you're married.

362
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
You may not know

363
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
what happened outside.

364
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Come with me.

365
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Hero Xiao.

366
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Hero Xiao.

367
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Hero Xiao.

368
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Hero Xiao.

369
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Hero Xiao.

370
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Hero Xiao.

371
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Finally, you're here.

372
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Hero Xiao.

373
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Hero Xiao.

374
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Hero Xiao.

375
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Hero Xiao.

376
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Hero Xiao.

377
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Hero Xiao.

378
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,220
I pray that you will never go through this or

379
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,380
maybe it's the person you love.

380
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,580
Tell me,

381
00:21:53,780 --> 00:22:16,400
the Man of

382
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
we, the ten sects,

383
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,600
only retreated from the cliff

384
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
after we had joined forces.

385
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
It's a pity that

386
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,000
we came too late

387
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,600
and failed to help the Xiao family.

388
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
You mean

389
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I saved the ten sects?

390
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
Yes.

391
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,200
All the sects in Guanglian Martial Arts

392
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
have resisted.

393
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,800
The power of Mount Quhan is in Guanglian.

394
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
It's not as good as before.

395
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes.

396
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Young Master Xiao.

397
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
Young Master Xiao, I'm a soldier of the Wu family.

398
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is a letter from Madam Wu.

399
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
The late official, General Wu's man.

400
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
A letter from Madam Wu?

401
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
A letter from Madam Wu?

402
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What's going on?

403
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What does it say?

404
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes.

405
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,800
The one who is always grateful

406
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
is the one who has been given the gold medal

407
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
and is innocent.

408
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,000
After that, he led the army to the Magistrate's Mansion

409
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,600
and the bandits from the northern part of the city

410
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,400
came back to the city

411
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,200
and died in the morning.

412
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Madam Wu's letter.

413
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,800
The Magistrate's Mansion has sent me a report.

414
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
It's been two years.

415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
The Magistrate finally sent me the first report.

416
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
It's great!

417
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Great!

418
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
A report!

419
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,800
Great!

420
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Great!

421
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,400
Great!

422
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,600
According to the new report,

423
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,400
Madam Wu was on her way to the Magistrate's Mansion

424
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
and was killed by the bandits in the northern part of the city.

425
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,600
But now, General Wu led the army to the Magistrate's Mansion

426
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,400
and he's been in the northern part of the city.

427
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
So, the world has been changed.

428
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,800
I can also thank Xiao Qiushui for the story.

429
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,600
Young Master Xiao, you saved so many people.

430
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,600
We're not here to play tricks.

431
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes.

432
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,600
Our disciples

433
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,800
brought a lot of good wood and stone.

434
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,200
Now, we're here.

435
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,400
From now on,

436
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,000
we'll help you rebuild the Sword Sect.

437
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
Please help us rebuild the Seven States.

438
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,000
Help us rebuild the Seven States.

439
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Young Master Xiao, if you don't mind,

440
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
why don't we all join the Magistrate's Mansion

441
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
and set up a branch in Guangling?

442
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
Yes.

443
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
That's right.

444
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
Set up a branch.

445
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes.

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes.

447
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yes.

448
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Set up a branch.

449
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,800
Set up a branch.

450
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Set up a branch.

451
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,200
Yes.

452
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Set up a branch.

453
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Everyone,

454
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
thank you for your love.

455
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,400
But now,

456
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
I can't take this job.

457
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
We only take Xiao Qiushui.

458
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,200
Yes.

459
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
We only take Xiao Qiushui.

460
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,600
Don't quit, Young Master Xiao.

461
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Yes.

462
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,000
We only take you.

463
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
Qiushui, I think

464
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
you shouldn't refuse anymore.

465
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Yes.

466
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Yes.

467
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Xiao Qiushui, you agree?

468
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Yes.

469
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
You agree?

470
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Stop it.

471
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Stop it.

472
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Chuwei,

473
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,000
I, Xiao Qiushui, can't take the position of Chief.

474
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,800
But I welcome everyone

475
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,800
to join the Magistrate's Mansion.

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Join the Magistrate's Mansion.

477
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,600
Great.

478
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Great.

479
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Great.

480
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,200
We can join the Magistrate's Mansion.

481
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Great.

482
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Great.

483
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Great.

484
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,200
Everyone,

485
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,400
we will rebuild the Xiao family.

486
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,000
Let's start.

487
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let's start.

488
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's start.

489
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Let's start.

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Let's go.

491
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
By the way, Qiushui,

492
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
your sister

493
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
has been through some ancient problems.

494
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
She has found

495
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
a way to save the meridians.

496
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
You go first.

497
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Leave it to me.

498
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,800
Miss Tang,

499
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
according to what you said,

500
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
the person you want to save

501
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,600
is not only a meridians,

502
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,400
but also a strong inner heart

503
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,600
that is filled with the meridians.

504
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,800
I have been

505
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,400
treating this wound

506
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
for more than 50 years,

507
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
but I haven't heard anything.

508
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Now,

509
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
she can still live.

510
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
This is

511
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,000
the blessing of God.

512
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Uncle Liu,

513
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
can't you save her?

514
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,400
This prescription

515
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
can help her to get rid of the evil energy

516
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
and kill her for a few years.

517
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
If she can recover,

518
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,600
I have no other choice.

519
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,400
Then, in this world,

520
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,600
there is no one to help her.

521
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,400
I'm flattered.

522
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,000
The person you want to save

523
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
is your lover, right?

524
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yes.

525
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Uncle Liu,

526
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,400
why do you ask this question?

527
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,400
Your father, Tang Yaoshun,

528
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,600
as the head of Tang family,

529
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,600
not only is he good at medicine,

530
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,200
but also is good at breaking bones and cutting gold.

531
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
If you ask him

532
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,800
about the meridians,

533
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
it's much more useful than asking me.

534
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
If you didn't want to hide it from him,

535
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
why did you come to me?

536
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Are you going to save this young man

537
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,800
or keep it from your father?

538
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,600
It's up to you.

539
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

540
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Qiushui.

541
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Qiushui.

542
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,000
Boss.

543
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,800
Boss, you're awake.

544
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,200
Sister, how long have I been sleeping?

545
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
Two days and two nights.

546
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
I'm sorry.

547
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,400
You've only got 40% of your meridians.

548
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
You can rest well.

549
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,600
Thank you, sister.

550
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
Good morning, brothers.

551
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,800
Let's go practice swordplay.

552
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,600
Boss,

553
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
sister said you were recovering from your daily routine.

554
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,000
But she didn't say you can practice martial arts.

555
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,800
You're still as strong as a knife in the east.

556
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,200
Why are you so anxious?

557
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
I'll start practicing from zero o'clock.

558
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
I don't have time now.

559
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Again.

560
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Boss.

561
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Take a break.

562
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
If you keep doing this,

563
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
your body will be ill.

564
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm fine.

565
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Boss.

566
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Sister also said

567
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,600
the meridians have blood vessels.

568
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,200
You don't have to worry about revenge.

569
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
You should rest

570
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
and get some rest.

571
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,600
You didn't give me time.

572
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
Can you practice with me again?

573
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Again.

574
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Good sword.

575
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I didn't expect that

576
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
you recovered so much

577
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,400
after a few days.

578
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,800
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

579
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Your kindness today

580
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,800
is a great honor to me.

581
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Don't stand on ceremony.

582
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
It's my pleasure to support

583
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,800
the young martial arts talents.

584
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
By the way, Qiu Shui,

585
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,800
I found a sword

586
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,400
in the Xiaojia's sword room that day.

587
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,800
It's a rare item.

588
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,200
It's a rare item.

589
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,400
It's a rare item.

590
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
It's a rare item.

591
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
I found a thing

592
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,200
in the Xiaojia's sword room

593
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
and I didn't dare to give it to you.

594
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Now,

595
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,200
I can give it to you.

596
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I have no one to rely on.

597
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,800
I'm looking forward to the autumn water.

598
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Now, it's hard to break the sword

599
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,800
and the sword room.

600
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,800
If I don't see you again,

601
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,200
the Xiaojia will die

602
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
for the sake of loyalty.

603
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,800
I'm not regretful.

604
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,400
I wrote this book

605
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,200
to make a wish.

606
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,600
The Xiaojia's sword room

607
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,400
has suffered a lot before.

608
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,800
But the ancestors

609
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,800
know how to break the sword.

610
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,200
They made 128 sword-breaking swords

611
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,600
into Changge.

612
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's a soul of loyalty

613
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,400
in the Xiaojia's sword room.

614
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
If you read this letter,

615
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,400
you will be a mother.

616
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,800
Changge is wise and wise.

617
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,400
When in danger,

618
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,400
she will find the way by herself.

619
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
When in danger,

620
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,000
she will find the way by herself.

621
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
The flower will bloom.

622
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,600
The flower will bloom.

623
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,600
But it will not bloom again.

624
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,800
If it can bring back Changge,

625
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,600
the legend of the flower will never die.

626
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,200
Xiao Xilu

627
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
will meet the sword room

628
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,600
on the second day of the sixth month.

629
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Xiao Xilu

630
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,800
will meet the sword room

631
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,000
on the second day of the sixth month.

632
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
The second day of the sixth month

633
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,600
is the 15th day after we left the sword room.

634
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I was just a child.

635
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
Actually, your father knew that

636
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
only the light would die if you stayed in the Sword Tower.

637
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
So he sent you to escape from the Sword Tower

638
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
and go to Qiuyuan.

639
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
In fact,

640
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
he left the hope of being alive

641
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
to you.

642
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
It's all my fault.

643
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
I came back late.

644
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
It's all my fault.

645
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Qiu Shui,

646
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
your father has a clear message in his heart.

647
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Don't let yourself be sad.

648
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
A few days ago,

649
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I saw you were in a coma

650
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
and worried that you would be unwell.

651
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Now,

652
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
I hope you can follow the old promise

653
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
and recover soon

654
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
and find Changge Sword to rebuild the Xiao family.

655
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
My father said

656
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Changge Sword has a soul

657
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
and I will find it

658
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
when I'm in trouble.

659
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
But now I'm a useless person.

660
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm afraid I'm going to let my father down.

661
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
That's not true, Qiu Shui.

662
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Look.

663
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
You buried these people yourself.

664
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
But you built the Sword Tower

665
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
and the tombstone yourself.

666
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Hero Liang,

667
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
this is what every Xiao family

668
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
should do.

669
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Qiu Shui,

670
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
you can see the world from above

671
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
and bury the people of the Xiao family

672
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
together.

673
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
It shows that you have a sense of justice.

674
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
The Xiao family has been in the Jindong Martial Arts Society

675
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
for less than a hundred years.

676
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
This is what you are fighting for.

677
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
And these martial artists

678
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
are so devoted to the God's Will.

679
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
It's the same.

680
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Now the Xiao family is determined to build the formation

681
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
and buy the sword with gold and silver.

682
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
But the people behind the people of the Zhaixing

683
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
are the other people.

684
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
They can't buy it with gold and silver.

685
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Qiu Shui,

686
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
the two words of Xia Yin

687
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
are never in the sword

688
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
but in the heart.

689
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
I believe

690
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
that this fate will find you.

691
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
I believe you.

692
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Hero Liang,

693
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
thank you for your words.

694
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
What you said

695
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
is completely understandable.

696
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I believe

697
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
that you are the one

698
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
who can save the world.

699
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
I believe

700
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
that you are the one

701
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
who can save the world.

702
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
I believe

703
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
that you are the one

704
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
who can save the world.

705
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
I believe

706
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
that you are the one

707
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
who can save the world.

708
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
I believe

709
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
that you are the one

710
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
who can save the world.

711
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
The ancestors of the Xiao family,

712
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
when the Xiao family was in trouble for a hundred years,

713
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
you cut off 128 swords

714
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
and held the sword

715
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
with 128 swords

716
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
to the head of the family.

717
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
We have been together

718
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
for 128 days

719
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
and only got this sword

720
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
from me.

721
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
All souls in the world,

722
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
the flowers are blooming,

723
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I am willing to go back to Changge

724
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
and restore the flowers.

725
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
I believe

726
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
that you are the one

727
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
who can save the world.

728
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
I believe

729
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
that you are the one

730
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
who can save the world.

731
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I believe

732
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
that you are the one

733
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
who can save the world.

734
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,660
You can also test a web combination to see the experience

735
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,680
Back to the real world

736
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,360
I want to quit now

737
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,860
But I still have something procurement

738
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:26,940
sala

739
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,480
Xiao Jia

740
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,320
I won't pick

741
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,780
System warning

742
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,840
Please black out

743
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,780
If there is a return to skip

744
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,700
Head-on force return

745
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,800
Please stop

746
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,800
The evil spirits will disappear because of human's reality.

747
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
You will be forced to be in the system.

748
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,800
You can't leave the Demon Hall.

749
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
I will avenge the dead.

750
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
They are all living people.

751
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Where are you?

752
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I have a bad idea.

753
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
You can't leave the Demon Hall.

754
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
What about Xiao Binbin?

755
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
What about the Xiangquan team?

756
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
I only make the right choice.

757
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,800
The sword is broken and the flower is blooming.

758
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
The evil spirits will disappear.

759
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
But they will come back.

760
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,800
The sword is broken and the flower is blooming.

761
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Kid, remember.
