1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Break through the abyss of light

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let this city and river be filled with love

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let the sword be cut into the love

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let the end of the dark night be the sword in the night

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So that we won't forget this 100

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let this cloud be covered in blood

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let the sword never be changed

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let the millennium be with me and bloom

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Like a light that doesn't matter the bright future

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let the light be the light of the future

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let the light be the light of the future

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let the light be the light of the future

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Master, Liu Suifeng is as you expected

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He sent people to the pharmacy to get the medicine

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is it bad for you?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then why?

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I won't agree with what he wants to do

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I can't persuade him

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You should keep an eye on Suifeng

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I understand

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Master

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Master

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Think about it again

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Tang Manyao said

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The medicine made by the lotus is not good for people or ghosts

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's better to die

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Mingzhu is afraid

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Afraid that one day I will never see you again

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Get out

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't want you to see me after drinking the medicine

32
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He is not a normal person

33
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's for the sake of the master

34
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
For the sake of the master

35
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He made himself a medicine

36
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He will exchange his life for his life

37
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Master

38
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Mingzhu will never leave you

39
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I called you here today

40
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because I got the news

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
General Wu has come back to the capital

42
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The British organization colluded with the North Wilderness

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They have crossed the Xianren Pass

44
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
They used the waterway to let the soldiers of the North Wilderness

45
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Enter the Western State

46
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They are planning something

47
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
General Wu is in danger on the way back to the capital

48
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Please protect General Wu's safety

49
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Break through the British base

50
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Give the Western State peace

51
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Break through the British base

52
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The waterway is in danger

53
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We will do our best

54
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, the country is in danger

55
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We should take responsibility

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We should take responsibility

57
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Thank you

58
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Come

59
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Take a look

60
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Here, you go from here

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You go from here

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Ok, listen to the order

63
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ok

64
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Brothers

65
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is Wu Jie

66
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
See it clearly

67
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
At that time

68
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We will ambush them on the road

69
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Kill them

70
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Long Feidong

71
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You bastards

72
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How dare you harm General Wu

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Today we brothers will pay for the crime

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Take them down

75
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
More than ten people were caught and killed

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They are said to be used by the Longjiang waterway

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There must be a lot of people who have reported

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Please reward them

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Around the West Jingzhou Mountain

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
General Wu's secret was discovered

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because of the pre-trial attack

82
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Changed the route to the capital

83
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I am happy to see the good fortune

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There are unknown people who will know

85
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We should go out

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The West Jingzhou Mountain

87
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The West Jingzhou Mountain

88
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Lord Shun Sonya

89
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Isias

90
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
Where is it

91
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Master

92
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,520
Master

93
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,000
What are you doing

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Crisp pepper

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You admitted it

96
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes

97
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,600
He will come to the temple after he knows the dragon is dead.

98
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
Now the thief is a bandit.

99
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,600
Even if we go back,

100
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,920
it's just a death.

101
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
It's not a big deal to die.

102
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,640
But a man can't be humiliated.

103
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,040
Why don't we go back to the Immortal Pass

104
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,760
and kill him with our brothers

105
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,000
in the capital of the north?

106
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,720
See if they dare to commit suicide.

107
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,320
Jingyue.

108
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,560
Don't be rude.

109
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,280
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,880
Let's go.

111
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,840
It's not your fault, either.

112
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,640
You're a man who resides in grisly fire and itsarbeiten.

113
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,800
This is just

114
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,720
a great cause to the world.

115
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,680
We should act for Godshare.

116
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,560
With rules and human nature,

117
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,920
the King of Huo will be dead.

118
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
The military order is not accepted by the general.

119
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,280
The country is in trouble.

120
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,920
It's the time to change the order.

121
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,360
If I don't do this,

122
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm afraid I'll be a victim of the evil plan

123
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,880
and ruin the country.

124
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
I'll be a sinner.

125
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,400
Brother, the court wants you back

126
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
to kill you.

127
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,840
This is their conspiracy.

128
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,320
It's not a matter of time

129
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,680
if we go back.

130
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,520
Jiang Yue.

131
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,080
PleaseCharlemagne

132
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
You're dismissed.

133
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,880
Mark my words.

134
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,760
Yes.

135
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,000
Mr.Casey,

136
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,080
the country is in difficult times.

137
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,960
It's vampirical.

138
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
You need no silence.

139
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,160
But you should have some common sense.

140
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,520
We need you to imagine

141
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,000
such a difficult situation.

142
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,960
I went there

143
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,440
because I was afraid that I would die.

144
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,720
The traitors wanted to kill me to be at ease.

145
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,400
The court wanted to kill me to be at ease.

146
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,040
The North Wilderness wanted to kill me to be at ease.

147
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,200
I was not afraid of death.

148
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,040
But the mountains and rivers were not rich.

149
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
The North Wilderness was innocent.

150
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,440
They took away our people's lives.

151
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,480
They took away our people's lives.

152
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,680
Now I have three wishes.

153
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,760
I want peace in my country.

154
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,680
I want peace in my country.

155
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,800
If I die,

156
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,960
I want to help the people

157
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,160
protect the country

158
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
and return the peace.

159
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
I will be happy.

160
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
My second wish

161
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,560
can be for the court to kill me alone.

162
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,200
Please do not involve my brothers

163
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,440
and innocent people.

164
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,880
The country will be debted to our people."

165
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,480
Then, we will get the money back.

166
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,400
The bloodshed

167
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
and our brothers died in vain.

168
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,720
I have that too.

169
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:39,740
Bro!

170
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,700
His Majesty's letter is here!

171
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,280
Great to see you, General Wu.

172
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,140
Inform and run!

173
00:13:59,500 --> 00:13:59,960
Sure!

174
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
I have a third wish.

175
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,160
Even if I have to go to the bottom of Mount Shengdao,

176
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm willing to go.

177
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,320
Otherwise, the nation will be destroyed.

178
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
What else can we do?

179
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
The world is in chaos.

180
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,320
I hope my soldiers can die to guard the Immortal Guards.

181
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,320
The Hero is the one who really cares about me.

182
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,120
I appreciate it.

183
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,120
I'm not trying to use my strength to achieve something.

184
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,920
I'm trying to make a name for myself.

185
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,920
I'm trying to die and ask for the power.

186
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
The Hero is the one who really cares about me.

187
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,320
I'm trying to make a name for myself.

188
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
I'm trying to die and ask for the power.

189
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm trying to make a name for myself.

190
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm trying to make a name for myself.

191
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm trying to make a name for myself.

192
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,320
I'm trying to make a name for myself.

193
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Brother.

194
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Yuan'er.

195
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Brother, the Soul-gathering Cauldron was just taken out.

196
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
You should rest well at this time.

197
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
You should be obedient.

198
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Yuan'er, you've really grown up.

199
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,320
You're not like before. You always chased me and called me brother.

200
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
Look, now you're calling me brother?

201
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,320
Who told you to call me brother?

202
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,920
Oh, right. Look.

203
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
This is...

204
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
This is for you.

205
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
For me?

206
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,920
It's really pretty.

207
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,120
Do you like it?

208
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,320
Of course I like it.

209
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,720
Is it pretty?

210
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,520
It's really pretty.

211
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,520
This medicine is too bitter.

212
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,920
If I can eat some fresh fish now, how great would that be?

213
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,120
I'll go make fish for you right now. Wait for me.

214
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,120
Brother.

215
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:51,320
I didn't expect that the evil people of Da Xi Martial Arts

216
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,920
would all come back to the West.

217
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
This Water Immortal King sent thousands of miles, thousands of miles,

218
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,120
and hundreds of miles of masters to come here.

219
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,920
Today, here, I'll make General Wu a Qin.

220
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
How dare you?

221
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,720
How dare you?

222
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,520
You're a traitor. You're shameless.

223
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,520
I'll clear the obstacles for General Wu.

224
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,320
The city is getting more and more crowded.

225
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,720
Banner of martyrs from long tull the salty Pickle.

226
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:55,540
childhood

227
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,440
General, it seems that

228
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,080
everything that happened here has just happened.

229
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,040
Hero Yan.

230
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,240
As the saying goes,

231
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
a man would rather die in a battlefield.

232
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,200
But I'm not afraid of death.

233
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm not afraid of death.

234
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,640
I'm not afraid of death.

235
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,760
I'm not afraid of death.

236
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,960
I'm not afraid of death.

237
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
I won't be destroyed by the evil.

238
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,360
Those people I killed outside,

239
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,960
they are not only the defeated enemies in the martial arts world,

240
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,280
but also the people of the North Wilderness.

241
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,960
The waterway

242
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,080
is heavily rewarded and they want to kill you.

243
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,520
General Wu,

244
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,120
you should think twice.

245
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,600
Once you are in danger,

246
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,720
it's like the death of thousands of people.

247
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,600
Hero Yan said

248
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
all gold and gold are good words of wisdom.

249
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,640
However,

250
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,320
What?

251
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,040
However, although I know

252
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,920
the danger of this travel,

253
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,720
I must do this.

254
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,000
Only by meeting with His Majesty's persuasion

255
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,680
there's a chance

256
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,360
of defending the lower realms.

257
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,720
Daxi is in trouble.

258
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,880
It's exactly time for you to retreat.

259
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,520
Save yourself.

260
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
If I do this,

261
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm afraid

262
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,080
I'll be blamed for the evil plot of the traitors in the court.

263
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,240
If you're in trouble,

264
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,440
ask who else in the world

265
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,120
can lead the army to defend the North Desert

266
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
and protect my He Shan?

267
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
You're so kind,

268
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm flattered.

269
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,560
General Wu,

270
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,640
if I use this Hero Order

271
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,000
to stop you from

272
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,880
returning to the court and taking the order,

273
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
it'll no longer be my responsibility

274
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,480
to do neither of them.

275
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:16,500
If thisHzG

276
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,560

277
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,000
To go against all the seldomiesmusic.

278
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Go!

279
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll make you understand.

280
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You are Wu Yi.

281
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Where is General Wu?

282
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
General Wu has been captured by me.

283
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Today, the temple is waiting for you.

284
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The first crazy man in the martial arts world, Yin Crazy.

285
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll take all your internal force.

286
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Brother.

287
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Brother.

288
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You are crazy, Little Crazy.

289
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I won't let you hurt my brother.

290
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
With your brother,

291
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
you forget me?

292
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You hurt my parents and the Xiao family.

293
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You don't deserve to be my brother.

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Then you can see

295
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
who is more powerful.

296
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Who is the real one?

297
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Who is the real one?

298
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No!

299
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You don't want him to die?

300
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
As long as you listen to me,

301
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
do as I say.

302
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I promise you.

303
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
As long as you don't hurt my brother,

304
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll use my life to protect you.

305
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I won't let you die.

306
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yan Guangdu.

307
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Don't you want to see General Wu?

308
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Take him away.

309
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Chief Xiao.

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We met a ambush on the way back.

311
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
General saw something wrong.

312
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He asked me to split up and take the tiger talisman.

313
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Give it to you.

314
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Please keep the talisman.

315
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Save General.

316
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Xiao Qiu.

317
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Take General Jiang to have a rest.

318
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay.

319
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Thank you.

320
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
General Jiang, please.

321
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'll go.

322
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I chose these for you.

323
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Do you like them?

324
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't be so frivolous.

325
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's not beautiful if you don't.

326
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Look at my blood debt.

327
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's 700 times more than the money I spent.

328
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
As long as you follow me,

329
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll give you more than what Brother and Qiu Shui can give you.

330
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Luxury and wealth are all the same.

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I want to see my brother.

332
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
As long as you're obedient,

333
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
your brother won't die.

334
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll let you meet often.

335
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
How about this?

336
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
They're suitable.

337
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They're beautiful.

338
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Hero Yin, you're smart.

339
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You didn't struggle too much.

340
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You should know that

341
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I've sealed your blood.

342
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Three kings of the outside world.

343
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You are

344
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Baili Hanting.

345
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Qianli Gu Mei.

346
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And Wanli Pingyuan.

347
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You're really a crazy man.

348
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We've been hiding for years.

349
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You still recognize us.

350
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I didn't expect to meet you here.

351
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Luo Fei promised General Helian

352
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
to take the big picture.

353
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
He really wants to have a fight with the No.1 in the Central Plains.

354
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You're talking to yourself.

355
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Do you think I can't learn it?

356
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I can.

357
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Fight and learn it up.

358
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't want to power through yourself too.

359
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
No, don't be ok.

360
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
When I see you,

361
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'll give you my time.

362
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Ok.

363
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Hero Yin.

364
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,600
It will be for what I have with me.

365
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,120
Does Central Plain have such a rightful technique

366
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,280
when analyzing old Shimans?

367
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,760
What must가 Guan Yu此处

368
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:35,480
schkil

369
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,280
So you only know how to absorb and not how to use.

370
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,560
If you want to use my power, be careful of killing yourself.

371
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,360
I won't trouble you to worry about this.

372
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,560
One day, I will use your power to eat and drink.

373
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,760
Senior, take good care of Hero Yan.

374
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,960
Senior.

375
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,400
I heard Half fatty needs explain to me.

376
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,380
Please wait for me.

377
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,240
On hearing of quarter master.

378
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
Telling joint master has a restricted event in Beiyang.

379
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,680
Today, separate chief and not toадц a military officer.

380

Goodbye.

I'll always be with you.

391
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,440
Before I taste the one,

392
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,600
I have a wonderful poem

393
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
You can have your own life.

394
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,600
Don't be afraid of being defeated by power.

395
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,440
Don't be afraid of being with me.

396
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,240
Don't hesitate to take revenge.

397
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,920
Follow Fengjian's will.

398
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,560
Why?

399
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,640
I've been in Manchu for 15 months.

400
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,680
This wine

401
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,880
is you are dreaming.

402
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,720
Take a good sleep.

403
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:57,460
as soon as I get

404
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
How about it?

405
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,460
You won't eat or drink.

406
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
You won't live a life.

407
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,460
You're in a mess.

408
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
It's too late to be a demon.

409
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
Shut up!

410
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,460
When did you

411
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
dare to be so cruel?

412
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Go.

413
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Call Xiao Xue here.

414
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
Yes.

415
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,460
The Demon King

416
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
Brother.

417
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Xue Yu.

418
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
Don't you have a lot to say to him?

419
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Try to persuade him.

420
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Brother.

421
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,460
It's okay.

422
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
These days,

423
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
I'll find a way to get you out.

424
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,460
No need.

425
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
I don't need you to worry.

426
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
Brother.

427
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Listen to me.

428
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,460
What I'm going to say is important.

429
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
Come here.

The Heaven's Book of Forgetfulness

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
The Heaven's Book of Forgetfulness

434
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,620
Heaven and Earth

435
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,820
Earth Eclipse

436
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,020
The King and Qin's private fortune

00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
Goodness

439
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,460
The Buddha'sautumna

440
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,380
Water

441
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:50,380
Fire and Foreign

442
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,120
Sure.

443
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,220
The carriage is here.

444
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,680
Rong,

445
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,340
it's time to go back.

446
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,220
I'm sorry.

447
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,100
You came to the capital for the first time.

448
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,260
You've lived in the palace for three days.

449
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,300
You've lived for ten days the second time.

450
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,460
Since then,

451
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,460
you've been away for a longer time.

452
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,140
I don't know

453
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,220
when I can come back.

454
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,260
Things

455
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,020
always get harder and harder.

456
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,700
Fortunately,

457
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,100
it's coming to an end.

458
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,340
Don't worry.

459
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,780
I'll do my best

460
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,900
to make up for it.

461
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,300
The city always the same.

462
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,940
The song of the mountain is heart-wrenching.

463
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:34,140
The summer is in the heart.

464
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,260
The world is just a small place.

465
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,380
A few words can make a person happy.

466
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,860
The time is fast coming.

467
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,220
The wind and rain are not as good as the past.

468
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,180
Running on the road is just like a little bird.

469
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,220
The world is just a small place.

470
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,460
A few words can make a person happy.

471
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,420
The time is fast coming.

472
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,140
The wind and rain are not as good as the past.

473
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,340
The world is just a small place.

474
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,420
Journalist.

475
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,380
Masters.

476
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,900
Tagist?

477
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,820
Mister.

478
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,580
Woah, figurine.

479
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,580
Chief...

480
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,140
He...

481
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,340
Has already arrived here.

482
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,140
Yes...

483
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,460
Young Master.

484
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,940
Even if we go after them now,

485
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,140
it's too late.

486
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,940
Master is a wise man.

487
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,540
He will do the right thing.

488
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,660
I hope...

489
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,780
I hope Master can use the inner force to control the poison.

490
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,420
As long as the heart is not hurt,

491
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,180
maybe it can be saved.

492
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,020
Don't worry, Young Master.

493
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,420
There must be a way.

494
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,180
After drinking the medicine, I'll go to sleep.

495
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,620
I'll drink the wine

496
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:00,340
and make the world smile.

497
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,860
The world is but a small place,

498
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,140
like a bird flying in the sky.

499
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,540
After traveling a thousand miles,

500
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,660
I've found my freedom.

501
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,020
The world is but a small place,

502
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:24,020
like a bird flying in the sky.

503
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,620
After traveling a thousand miles,

504
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,740
I've found my freedom.
