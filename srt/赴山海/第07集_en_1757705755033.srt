1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Open the light

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The light that doesn't matter

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Wait for you to come

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Welcome to see Fushan Sea

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The tea is from the fairyland and the Chinese tea

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Welcome to see Fushan Sea

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The sea is full of flowers

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Six treasures, welcome to see Fushan Sea

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The eight big patterns

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:28,540
The

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Shandong Ji Xi

12
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's go to Zhenmei Pavilion

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's go to Zhenmei Pavilion

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's go

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What's wrong with this?

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong with this?

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Stop

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Why did he suddenly commit suicide?

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was looking for Miss Tao

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Get back my jade pendant

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But how did this happen?

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I saw her sneakily go here

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I followed

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I didn't expect her to see me

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Just kill me

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Old brother

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Should be stunned by the mist

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Uncle Qiu has been in our family for so many years

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I didn't expect

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's actually the inner seal of the power gang

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I ask you

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What did Uncle Qiu do today?

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He is in charge of making sword stoves

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He only went to the firewood house today

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Still helped Auntie Zhang pick flowers

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Just now the fire started from the firewood house

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's going to lead us there

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ye Ning

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She went to pick flowers

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It must be to poison

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Pass my order

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All the Xiao family

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't water the well

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You go and check

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is the well polluted?

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Sword stove only has this one mouth

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Now poisoned

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's going to get us all into a net

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, no

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I just got someone to pour water

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Made a bowl of soup and sent it to the main hall

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
go

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Go

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hero Zhang

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hero Xiao

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What happened

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The well was poisoned

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The soup just now can't be drunk

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hero Xiao

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Please be at ease

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I haven't used that bowl of soup yet

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Since that's the case

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There's no need to hide it anymore

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Go

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Call everyone here

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Everyone

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is Mrs. Wu

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Greetings, Madam

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm here

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have a gift for you

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please be seated, heroes

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you, Madam

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Please

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mrs. Wu

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
These are all the best results

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Of our fight against the power gang

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've learned

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That you're fighting against the power gang

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sitting here

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And I'm in a deep sleep

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That bowl of soup

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't have the appetite to drink

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was lucky to avoid some

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why did you come to the prison again

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I was supposed to go to the Immortal Pass to find my son

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Who knew that I was stopped by a gang

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When I was passing by the well

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I had to hand over the Order of Heroes

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thanks to Hero Xiao's help

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was able to hide here

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Madam

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have something I don't understand

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'd like to ask you a question

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Please

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Madam

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're not from the underworld

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But why do those people think

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That the Order of Heroes is in your hands

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
13 years ago

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The Northern Wilderness Army

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Stole our great He Shan

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And led the army to attack the Western Region

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They burned and killed and robbed our land

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
They were so reckless

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The people were so rude

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Your Majesty

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The Emperor was forced to leave the capital

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The Western Region was in a state of panic

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
At that time, Shaolin, Wudang, Emei

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Three sects of the sects gathered together

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
To build a wall

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
To build the Order of Heroes

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And to establish the Blood Clan

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If there's a person who can save the King of Wei

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You should use this crystal stone to give him the message

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In the end

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Someone really did it

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yan Kuang Tu

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's right

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yan Kuang Tu broke into the Northern Wilderness Army

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And killed 37 people to kill him

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He almost killed the commander of the enemy

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The Order of Heroes

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is in the hands of Yan Kuang Tu

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But he was too arrogant

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He was not allowed to fight

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He was surrounded by the people on Mount Wuxing

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And he disappeared

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Until recently

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He was not allowed to fight

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He was not allowed to fight

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He was not allowed to fight

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He was not allowed to fight

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He was not allowed to fight

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Until recently

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A bird came to me with this order

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The Order of Heroes

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Was actually entrusted to Madam Wu by Yan Kuang Tu

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's right

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know how the Power Gang knew

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Order of Heroes was in my hands

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And started to surround me

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yan Kuang Tu was innocent

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And killed him

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hero Xiao

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How is the situation outside?

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This time the Power Gang did send a lot of people

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But my sword furnace is heavily guarded

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They can't attack

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's just

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's okay to say

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The only water well in my sword furnace

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Has been poisoned

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm afraid the rest of the water

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Can't last long

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's my fault again

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That everyone is trapped

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's really hard to calm down

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Madam, you can't say that

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
General Wu is loyal to the country

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He is the hero in our hearts

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
All the officials in the Western Regions

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Only General Wu deserves the Order of Heroes

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This time

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Our family can protect Madam Wu

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's our honor

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If those scoundrels

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Arrest Madam Wu

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It involves General Wu's experience

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And misled the front line

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
By then the North Emperor will be in need again

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If we are not punished

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Then we will be the sinners

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Hero Xiao

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's your plan?

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I trust the Xiao family

181
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The Power Gang is trying to poison the capital

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The purpose is to force us out

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Outside the sword furnace

184
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm afraid it's already set up

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But according to the agreement

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Two days later

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We must send Madam Wu

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
To meet General Wu

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This matter can't be delayed

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We can't sit and wait

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Go

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Dad

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If some of us leave the street

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How long can the rest of the water last?

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If some of us can get out

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The rest of the water can last about 20 days

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
20 days

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I see

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Everyone

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We still have to send Madam Wu

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
To meet General Wu on time

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Only in this way

204
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Can we get rid of the current situation

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We can also get

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The chance to rescue the various sects

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Only by working together

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Can we defeat the Power Gang

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
To save our family

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But this sword is blind

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The Power Gang has a vicious person

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Send Madam Wu out in a hurry

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Isn't it taking the life of the old lady to risk it?

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Besides, now in the world

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
How many people dare to oppose the Power Gang?

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Your arrangement is a joke

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Just now, the sword furnace and the Power Gang fight

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You forgot so soon

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
No matter how powerful the Power Gang is

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Can it be bigger than our martial arts?

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Not to mention

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We are all people who oppose the Power Gang

223
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Madam Wu, don't worry

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I will do my best

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
To protect your integrity

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I've heard about this child from Huishan

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He is indeed the most like your parents

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Qiu Shui is right

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's time for us to discuss how to get out of the way

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's just that the Power Gang is now

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Surround the sword furnace

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Must be heavily guarded

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Can't guarantee everyone is safe

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's right

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hard break will only cause heavy losses

236
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Besides, our only victory now

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Is to know that the target of the Power Gang is Madam Wu

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why don't we give her a clever layout?

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The sky is over the sea

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Arrange people to pretend to be Madam Wu

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
As a bait

242
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
To confuse the other party

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
To ensure that Madam Wu is safe

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There must be some people

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Attract the attention of the enemy

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's it

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The rest of the people do their best

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Also ensure that Madam Wu is safe

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But in order to let me go out

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let others be baits

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm really worried

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Madam, don't worry

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'll go and lure them away

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Qiu Shui

255
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't worry

256
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Big brother and the others are not here

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Besides, I've grown up

258
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's time to do something for the flowers

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,960
of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the powerimme

261
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,400
Everyone

262
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,760
Boxu Marder

263
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,560
Very bad

264
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
In use

265
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,480
We would rather take further lying

266
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Quick

267
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,520
Jackey

268
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,760
Reconno Io

269
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,720
Uhm

270
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,120
Monk

271
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,080
Yes

272
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,200
Senior

273
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
You're already dead

274
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,760
This time

275
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,680
Jaoǎnyi

276
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,480
Lady Jin and Qiu Shui are rushing out of the prison.

277
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,280
Everyone,

278
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,320
this trip is very dangerous.

279
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,880
Please take care of yourselves.

280
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,880
I'll wait for you to come back

281
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,520
to drink and investigate.

282
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,360
Don't worry, Senior Brother.

283
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,320
Shui.

284
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,880
Shui.

285
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,320
Mother.

286
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
The prison is very high up.

287
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,880
You must protect yourself.

288
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,480
Shui, don't worry.

289
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,880
The child has grown up.

290
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,840
Since he chose to take this important responsibility,

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,440
he must have his own thoughts.

292
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,320
Just listen to his opinion.

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
The children of our family

294
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,960
are not sure

295
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,280
that they will say those big words.

296
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,600
Father, mother.

297
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,080
I didn't accompany you well

298
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,560
on my return this time.

299
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Don't worry.

300
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,240
I will protect myself.

301
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,240
Besides, mother,

302
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,680
I haven't eaten

303
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,560
Ni Chu's noodles yet.

304
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
Take this.

305
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,160
Mother,

306
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,600
besides the Three Judicial Offices,

307
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,040
there are also this white bag.

308
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
There are many mechanisms in it.

309
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,280
You must remember the secrets of use

310
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,080
and how to use them.

311
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,760
Yes, yes, yes.

312
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
Your mother is right.

313
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,520
I was also

314
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,880
seduced by your mother.

315
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,360
You are very good at it.

316
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,280
Shui,

317
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,920
when you were in the capital,

318
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
you said you were envious of those little things

319
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,920
that made you out of the world.

320
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,680
But, child,

321
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,480
have you ever thought about it?

322
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,680
Everyone is made of blood.

323
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,840
You should be afraid of death.

324
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,840
But why do these people

325
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,200
die for nothing

326
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,360
when they are in the hands of a hero?

327
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,880
This is because there is something more important

328
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,120
than life and death in this world.

329
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,960
Look at today.

330
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,320
There are so many friends

331
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,080
who are hurt or dead

332
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,680
for our Xiao family.

333
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,680
You must remember them forever.

334
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,680
Father, mother,

335
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,640
I will remember them.

336
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,280
After Madam Wu is out of danger,

337
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
I will ask for help from all the sects in the capital

338
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,720
to join hands and fight against the power.

339
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,480
Go.

340
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,520
Take care.

341
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
You must take care.

342
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,120
Father, mother,

343
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
in twenty days,

344
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,160
I will ask for help from all the sects

345
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,880
to help Jianluo.

346
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,840
Take care.

347
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,800
Take care.

348
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,780
Your son

349
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
is back.

350
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,000
So cute.

351
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,800
My daughter.

352
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,360
All right, all right.

353
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,320
Your son has grown up.

354
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
He has become sensible.

355
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,120
Look.

356
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,400
He still has a lot

357
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
We should be relieved

358
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
that he has found his true love.

359
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
That's enough.

360
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
I want to see him again.

361
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I understand.

362
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Go.

363
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Kill.

364
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Kill.

365
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Kill.

366
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Kill.

367
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Kill.

368
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
After we broke out of the dragon,

369
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
we were divided into four groups.

370
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Uncle Qu, Uncle Mu, and Uncle Tie Li

371
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
were the ones who led the dragon tribe to attack the Japanese.

372
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
We tried to get away from the other three tribes.

373
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Mrs. Wu also hid her identity in black.

374
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
The others were in the dark

375
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
and divided into three groups.

376
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
They were confused with each other

377
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
and took the enemy's soldiers.

378
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Go.

379
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Go.

380
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Let them go.

381
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
We'll break through.

382
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Go.

383
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Everyone should try to escape as much as possible

384
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
to avoid exposing their identities.

385
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
We'll try to take more time

386
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
to help Mrs. Wu.

387
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
This way.

388
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Taobao, Hong'er,

389
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
you and your parents

390
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
should protect Mrs. Wu.

391
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Take the east wing's forest as a guard post.

392
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Remember, you must bring a protective mask.

393
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
There will be a poisonous tent.

394
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
The people of the snow tribe will be suspicious.

395
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Moreover, they will be accompanied by Mrs. Wu.

396
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
They won't be in danger of being killed by the bombs.

397
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
You'll be safer.

398
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,400
We're in the poisonous tent.

399
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Put on a mask.

400
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Go.

401
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Go.

402
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I'll go with Uncle Kang.

403
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
We'll lead the people of the power house

404
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
to the forest.

405
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
They're coming.

406
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Protect Mrs. Wu.

407
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Yes.

408
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Go.

409
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
In that case,

410
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I'll lead you all here.

411
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Go.

412
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Tang Zhong, Yuhan, Zuo Xiu,

413
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
be careful.

414
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Find time to go up the mountain.

415
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
The people of the power house won't expect

416
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
someone to act against their will.

417
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Go.

418
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Go.

419
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I'll stay

420
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
and live with you.

421
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
You?

422
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
One word.

423
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Stupid.

424
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Foolish.

425
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You're dead.

426
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
You?

427
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Go.

428
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Go.

429
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
No.

430
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Go.

431
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Go.

432
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Go.

433
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Go.

434
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Brothers,

435
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
stop fighting.

436
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Go.

437
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Let's go.

438
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Let's go.

439
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Third Master, go.

440
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Go together.

441
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Jin'an.

442
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,400
The Xiao family protected me.

443
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Now I'm grateful to them.

444
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Stop talking.

445
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Go.

446
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Go.

447
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Third Master, go.

448
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Go.

449
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Go.

450
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Kou Yangqing.

451
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
You're worse than Fu Tianyi.

452
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,400
You can't kill me.

453
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,400
You can't kill me.

454
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Go.

455
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,400
The thing of Xiao Qiu Water is quite useful.

456
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
This is...

457
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
It's for anti-toxic.

458
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Take it.

459
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
One for each.

460
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
It's safe.

461
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Take it.

462
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Protect the old lady.

463
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Yes.

464
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Go.

465
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Go.

466
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Stop fighting.

467
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Retreat.

468
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Go.

469
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
What?

470
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Where is the old lady?

471
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
I don't know.

472
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Young Master asked me to be dressed up like this.

473
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Father, mother,

474
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
although Qiu Bo died,

475
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
but the power gang suffering double.

476
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,360
You can follow Feng Nuang

477
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,760
as the old lady.

478
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,400
Do I need to inform Mr. Feng?

479
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
No need.

480
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,200
Yes.

481
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,720
What should I do

482
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,840
if she's really the old lady?

483
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,920
Mother, I have another plan.

484
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,360
Why did Xiao Qiushui change her mind so suddenly?

485
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,560
Where is the old lady?

486
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
We'll know when we find Xiao Qiushui.

487
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,960
Let's go back to the source of the prison.

488
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,040
What do you come here for?

489
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,000
Xiao Qiushui is kind to me.

490
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,440
It's not right for me to help her.

491
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,040
You don't seem to care about

492
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,240
Xiao Qiushui's safety

493
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,400
since you came out.

494
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,080
Compared to her,

495
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,600
you care more about the old lady's whereabouts.

496
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,000
It's not right.

497
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,080
Oh?

498
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,200
Miss Tang,

499
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,520
are you here to steal people

500
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,840
and keep secrets from the Xiao family?

501
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,520
What did you mean by saving me?

502
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,520
It's nothing.

503
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,720
drank the wine for the people

504
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,680
and went to live alone.

505
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,320
Run.

506
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,360
Why don't you run?

507
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,080
Okay.

508
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I won't run away.

509
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,120
Run away?

510
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,600
Are you afraid of death?

511
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,520
Not at all.

512
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,600
I'll kill you.

513
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,000
Kill him.

514
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,080
Yes.

515
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Kill him.

516
00:33:38,360 --> 00:34:07,960
It's

517
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,360
You're just playing your own game.

518
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,360
This is just a appetizer.

519
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Tell me where Old Madam Wu is.

520
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Or I'll use your body

521
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
to feed my insects.

522
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
The Pagoda of the Hundred Poisoned Demon,

523
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,360
this is where you created your body.

524
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
The Pagoda of the Hundred Poisoned Demon,

525
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,360
this is where you created your body.

526
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
Or I'll use your body

527
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
to feed my insects.

528
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
The Pagoda of the Hundred Poisoned Demon,

529
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
this is where you created your body.

530
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Or I'll use your body

531
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
to feed my insects.

532
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Or I'll use your body

533
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
to feed my insects.

534
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Or I'll use your body

535
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
to feed my insects.

536
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Or I'll use your body

537
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
to feed my insects.

538
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Tang Rong,

539
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
you're good at

540
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
hidden weapons and mechanisms.

541
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
This time, you have to help me.

542
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Okay.

543
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
What do you want me to do?

544
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Boss,

545
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,360
I think what you've been doing lately

546
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
is really hard to understand.

547
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,360
Right?

548
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
The Pagoda of the Hundred Poisoned Demon has been killed.

549
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,360
The Xiao family has been surrounded.

550
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,360
I don't know how the future will develop.

551
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
I have to get ready earlier.

552
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Are you okay?

553
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
I'm fine.

554
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Where are the other guards?

555
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
You...

556
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
You're poisoned with the Pagoda of the Hundred Poisoned Demon.

557
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,360
I'll get rid of the poison for you.

558
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
No need.

559
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,360
Sister Xue Yi

560
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,360
gave me some poison-reducing pills.

561
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
I'll take one later.

562
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
What about Old Madam and Tang Rong?

563
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Old Madam and them

564
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
should be safe now.

565
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Tang Rong,

566
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
take Old Madam and Senior Zhang

567
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
to the cliff in the back mountain

568
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
and set off from there.

569
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,360
How do we get through the cliff?

570
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Don't worry.

571
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
I have a way.

572
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Let's go.

573
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,360
Qiu Rui is amazing!

574
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
She can really fly.

575
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Old Madam.

576
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Old Madam.

577
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Old Madam, are you okay?

578
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
I'm fine.

579
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Young Master Xiao is really good at planning.

580
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Let's take Old Madam to the Western Valley.

581
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Okay.

582
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,040
Why did you change your plan?

583
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,880
In the Jianghu,

584
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
their combat performances were unique.

585
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
They seemed to be clueless

586
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,240
and distracted after leaving the battlefield.

587
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,640
I dared not avoid the Lady Yu as circumstances required.

588
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
So I changed my plan temporarily.

589
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,920
Tell me,

590
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,240
Hello?

591
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,680
Hello?

592
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,680
Looks like my parents

593
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,580
and some uncles have safely returned to the πασκο writings.

594
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,440
It's late.

595
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,900
We have to battle with General Wu now.

596
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,740
I'm sorry.

597
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,260
So it's the arrival of the Red Phoenix.

598
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,060
You're the one who met the king?

599
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,980
Yes.

600
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,500
Who allowed you to meddle in the prince's business?

601
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,180
Did you see the whereabouts of Old Madam Wu?

602
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,300
My master only asked us to keep an eye on the Xiao family.

603
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,500
We never went in.

604
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,060
How could we know where Old Madam Wu went?

605
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,540
I see.

606
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,900
The King of the Sword has also come to see Old Madam Wu.

607
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,860
I have to report to the Prince.

608
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,160
King of the Sword

609
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,580
What about these places?

610
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,540
All of them are infiltrated by the power squad.

611
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,140
After Old Madam comes, she will rest.

612
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Tao Fang, go to the outside of the town to receive her.

613
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,220
If you meet Old Madam, first wake her up.

614
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,940
I will go to Tongfu Inn to see what's going on over there.

615
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,020
Okay. Be careful.

616
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Are you two eating or going out?

617
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
The people from the west are here.

618
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
You two are...

619
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,980
No one is here, but there's a letter that I must hand over.

620
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,180
There are always some people that are to blame.

621
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,180
X gloom.

622
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,660
Let's leave something unall clarity.

623
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,300
You don't marry anyone else.

624
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,900
They should have other ways to deal with them.

625
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,300
It's not easy.

626
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,700
Let's go.

627
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,500
Move aside!

628
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Did you find anything?

629
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
No.

630
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,900
Guard every entrance of the town.

631
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,100
No one is allowed to leave.

632
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,300
Yes.

633
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,300
What are you going to do next?

634
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,300
Let's go.

635
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,700
How many sorrows are there?

636
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,300
How many hopes are there?

637
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:44,300
The tears fall, the wind is not strong.

638
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,900
The grey fog is like sand.

639
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,100
I can't find my dream in my life.

640
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,300
How many branches are in the world?

641
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,500
Where is the grass growing?

642
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,700
Love and hate are in the past, but the grudge is in the present.

643
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,900
The unbreakable bond is like a horse.

644
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,700
I miss the crossroads of time.

645
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,300
I can't find my destiny.

646
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,100
Who can give me a piece of the sword?

647
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,900
What's left of the ten years?

648
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,700
The sword is cut off by the sharp sword.

649
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,900
The sword is cut off by the sharp sword.

650
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:39,300
Flowers fall, the life is lonely.

651
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:46,700
The wind blows, the song is sung.

652
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Who cares about love?

653
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,300
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

654
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:04,300
The tears fall, the wind is not strong.

655
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,300
Who cares about love?

656
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,100
The moon is bright and the moon is bright.

657
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:21,300
The tears fall, the wind is not strong.

658
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:31,300
The flowers fall, the heart is chasing after.
