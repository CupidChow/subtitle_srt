Little beauty

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,340
Come in

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,740
I will kill you

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
I'll kill you.

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,860
Young Master,

59
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,420
why are you doing this?

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,420
Kid,

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,420
since Yan Kuangtu asked you to come to me,

62
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,460
she would definitely protect you.

63
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,220
But she didn't show up

64
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,300
even when she was taking the elixir.

65
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,220
That proves that you're lying.

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,900
Since you said Yan Kuangtu

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,220
felt guilty about me,

68
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,540
you've been showing your tricks.

69
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,380
She took me away for ten years.

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,140
She never used any cruel means.

71
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,100
How could she feel guilty?

72
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,300
It turns out that

73
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,900
Shang Liao Liao was testing me.

74
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,540
I didn't expect her to be scheming.

75
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,340
What's more ridiculous

76
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,900
is that you're taking the elixir of Wuji.

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
Since you know

78
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,900
she forced me to take half a yang elixir,

79
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,940
you won't leave the elixir of Yin.

80
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,740
The last yang elixir

81
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,580
is the half yang elixir.

82
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,300
After you take it,

83
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,260
you'll only end up like me.

84
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,980
You'll be tortured by Yuan Yang and die.

85
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,140
You're not her brother at all.

86
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,900
You lied to me!

87
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
You're lying!

88
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,700
I was so cruel.

89
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,260
You all said

90
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,740
I was the one who helped Yan Kuangtu.

91
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,620
Actually, it was King Zhu Datian

92
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,660
who used my trick to stop him.

93
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
He lied to me too.

94
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,060
He said that Longjiang Water Sword

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,460
would make me a hero.

96
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,100
I've been suffering for years.

97
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,060
I heard that

98
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,700
you all took me as a traitor.

99
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,980
Why did I run away?

100
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,260
Do you really want to

101
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,660
give this elixir to King Zhu Datian?

102
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,740
I want him to eat it.

103
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,460
I want him to suffer

104
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,820
the pain of Yuan Yang and die.

105
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,900
I want you all to

106
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,540
taste the pain

107
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,700
I've been through

108
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,100
one by one.

109
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,220
You're not the one.

110
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,100
You attacked me

111
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,940
when I was tortured by Yuan Yang.

112
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,140
Then guess

113
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,500
what I want to do most now.

114
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,140
What do you want to do?

115
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,340
They told me that

116
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,380
there's a spirit worm

117
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,740
in the Cloud Mountain

118
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,940
that can relieve my pain

119
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,540
by taking it.

120
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
But I haven't found it

121
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,300
for so long.

122
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,620
You're a liar!

123
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,220
Now,

124
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,740
I'll let you relieve my pain.

125
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,860
Do you know who I am?

126
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,620
Yes.

127
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,460
A beauty.

128
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,460
I'm a member of Liu Zeifeng

129
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,020
and Master Liu.

130
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,340
If you dare to touch me,

131
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,740
I'll make you suffer

132
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,980
a thousand times more than you do now.

133
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,180
Even if you're telling the truth,

134
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,580
do you think

135
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,500
I'll care?

136
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,380
You look so beautiful

137
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,900
when you're angry.

138
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,260
You...

139
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,260
How dare you?

140
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,340
The little Flux Curse

141
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,300
will give you a place to map.

142
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
You're so kind.

143
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
Senior,

144
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,900
the human being is a human.

145
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
At least you should have some dignity.

146
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Dignity?

147
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Dignity?

148
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Dignity?

149
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
Dignity?

150
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Dignity?

151
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Dignity?

152
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Dignity?

153
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
How can you talk about dignity with me?

154
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Do you know how I've been living these ten years?

155
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
I've been living like a man who doesn't want to be treated like a ghost.

156
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm not even as good as a dog.

157
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Have you ever suffered the same pain as me?

158
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
You've never suffered my pain.

159
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Why are you talking about dignity with me?

160
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Why are you talking about dignity with me?

161
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
Dignity!

162
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Since you're so righteous,

163
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
you'll swallow this yang-egg.

164
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
You'll be just like me.

165
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
I'll use my real life to make up for my sins.

166
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
You won't.

167
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
You'll be tortured to death

168
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
in an hour.

169
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
But you can also learn from me.

170
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Use this girl

171
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
to ease your pain for a few days.

172
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
By then,

173
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
you'll see

174
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
how you'll show your dignity

175
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
in front of your eyes.

176
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Boy,

177
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
even if the peonies die,

178
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
the ghosts will still be there.

179
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
I've sealed this girl's acupoint.

180
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
You should do the same.

181
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
I'll throw you two into the valley.

182
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
By then,

183
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
a witch who you've been waiting for

184
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
will be by your side.

185
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
You... What will you choose?

186
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Live.

187
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
Jusen.

188
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Live.

189
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Jusen.

190
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Live.

191
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
Jusen.

192
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
The King of Heaven,

193
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
the matter between you and me is not over yet.

194
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
If you lose the Yang-egg,

195
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
I'll give you a poison pill.

196
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
I must avenge this.

197
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
You...

198
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
You ate the pill.

199
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Are you okay?

200
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Song Yuzhu,

201
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
the revenge of the destruction is not enough.

202
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
If you don't want to die, get out of here!

203
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Unlock the blood for me.

204
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I can help you.

205
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
Shut up!

206
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
I'm not going to die.

207
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm not going to die.

208
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm not going to die.

209
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
I'm not going to die.

210
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
I'm not going to die.

211
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Xiao Qiushui.

212
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,900
I can't resist the illness

213
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
if you want to kill the medicine tube.

214
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Even if you save me,

215
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
next time,

216
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
I will still fight for my master.

217
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
I will never stop.

218
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
I can't get rid of your blood.

219
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
I can't control the blood in my body.

220
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
When the time comes,

221
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,900
your blood will be released.

222
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
I tell you to get me out of here.

223
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
I'm not going to die.

224
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm not going to die.

225
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
I tell you to get me out of here.

226
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Xiao Qiushui.

227
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
Xiao Qiushui.

228
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900

229
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,900

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
Xiao Qiushui.

232
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Xiao Qiushui.

233
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Xiao Qiushui.

234
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Xiao Qiushui.

235
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
Xiao Qiushui.

236
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
Xiao Qiushui.

237
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Xiao Qiushui.

238
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
Xiao Qiushui.

239
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Xiao Qiushui.

240
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Xiao Qiushui.

241
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
Xiao Qiushui.

242
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Xiao Qiushui.

243
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Xiao Qiushui.

244
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Xiao Qiushui.

245
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Xiao Qiushui.

246
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
Xiao Qiushui.

247
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Xiao Qiushui.

248
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
Xiao Qiushui.

249
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
Xiao Qiushui.

250
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Xiao Qiushui.

251
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900

252
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Xiao Qiushui.

253
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
Xiao Qiushui.

254
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Xiao Qiushui.

255
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
Xiao Qiushui.

256
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Xiao Qiushui.

257
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Xiao Qiushui.

258
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Xiao Qiushui.

259
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Xiao Qiushui.

260
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Xiao Qiushui.

261
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Xiao Qiushui.

262
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
Xiao Qiushui.

263
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Xiao Qiushui.

264
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Xiao Qiushui.

265
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
Xiao Qiushui.

266
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Xiao Qiushui.

267
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
Xiao Qiushui.

268
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
Xiao Qiushui.

269
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Xiao Qiushui.

270
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Xiao Qiushui

271
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Xiao Qiushui.

272
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
Xiao Qiushui.

273
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Xiao Qiushui.

274
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Xiao Qiushui.

275
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Xiao Qiushui

276
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Xiao Qiushui.

277
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Xiao Qiushui

278
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Xiao Qiushui.

279
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Xiao Qiushui.

280
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Xiao Qiushui.

281
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Xiao Qiushui.

282
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,900
The poison is the forgiveness of Wu Qixuan's Yin.

283
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,900
The poison is the forgiveness of Wu Qixuan's Yin.

284
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,900
The poison is the forgiveness of Wu Qixuan's Yin.

285
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:45,740
The charm is only in the Yangxin's

286
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Xiao Qiushui, you are really different from others.

287
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,900
If I were you, I would live for a few more days.

288
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
I don't care about others' lives.

289
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Thank you.

290
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Stop.

291
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,900
The people of your Quanli Gang really don't have any conscience.

292
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Song Mingzhou, let me ask you.

293
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Where is my parents' body?

294
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Since you have killed me, I will tell you honestly.

295
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Your parents' body was taken away by my son.

296
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,900
But I really don't know where he has been sent to.

297
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,900
You are his close relative. You don't know it.

298
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
The son only said that he had a clue to find out.

299
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
I don't know.

300
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
Don't lie to me.

301
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I should have killed you.

302
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,900
I should have sent your bodyguards to the prison.

303
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,900
I should have told the people who died in the Xiao family.

304
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,900
You should have told Liu Suifang.

305
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
And Li Chenzheng.

306
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
I should have told him.

307
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
I should have told him.

308
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
I should have told him.

309
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
I should have told him.

310
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
This is Li Chenzheng.

311
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Your blood debt to the Quanli Gang.

312
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
I will solve it one by one.

313
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Xiao Qiu Shu has digested the Five-star Elixir.

314
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Won't the son be in danger?

315
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Did all the people in the Quanli Gang leave?

316
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Is this place safe?

317
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,460
Rou Shui and the people of the Powerful Gang are having a fight.

318
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,300
Just say what you want.

319
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,460
I took this Wujishian Pill back with my life.

320
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,020
It's to give it to you.

321
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,300
You did a good job.

322
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,500
I will tell the Heavenly King about your intentions.

323
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
It's been a long time, Kang Chu Yu.

324
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,900
Xiao Qiushui?

325
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,300
What are you doing here?

326
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,700
Guess.

327
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,500
I have something important to do.

328
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,700
If you want to die, I will kill you later.

329
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
I'm afraid you can't leave today.

330
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,500
You want to die?

331
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,700
I didn't expect this kid to be so strong.

332
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,300
Kang Chu Yu.

333
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,700
You betrayed your friends for your friendship.

334
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,100
You killed innocent people for your righteousness.

335
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
You are not worth dying for.

336
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,500
Today,

337
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,100
I will let you die in my family.

338
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,100
You...

339
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,300
Tang Rou, did you see that?

340
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,500
I finally let Kang Chu Yu give you life.

341
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,700
I will save you.

342
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,900
I will save you.

343
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,300
Father, mother,

344
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,300
the blood debt of our Xiao family,

345
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,300
I will also take it back one by one.

346
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:58,040
Qinqi Yi

347
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,420
You've been punished everywhere.

348
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,460
How dare you still be here?

349
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,700
I know I'm innocent.

350
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,460
But I'll let you punish me.

351
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,780
I just want you to give me a chance

352
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
to atone for my sin.

353
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,940
I've given you a chance to leave.

354
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,180
But you chose to stay.

355
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,420
Since you want to take this chance,

356
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,740
I'll let you take it yourself.

357
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,980
Is that what you mean?

358
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,060
I understand.

359
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,580
I'll go to Wudang to atone for my sin.

360
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
I didn't expect that

361
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,900
you would be the one who sent me off.

362
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,020
Liu Wu,

363
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,340
are you still guessing

364
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,500
that I sent you off?

365
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
I sent someone to disguise as the Chief

366
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,260
and frame you.

367
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,140
It can't be you.

368
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,860
You're the Chief,

369
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,340
but you're not that brave.

370
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,260
Put it on yourself.

371
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,780
pencil

372
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,940
Wake up, Liu Wu.

373
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,460
You don't die on your way.

374
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,500
Lord Tang, just command me.

375
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,900
Bao הח dying on you

376
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,460
I must goal.

377
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,300
hardware explanation

378
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,420
Wudang Sect

379
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,820
Dao Zui...

380
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,380
Weolly...

381
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,940
Sister你...

382
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,780
Dao Zui...

383
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,340
Sister You...

384
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,020
Dao Zui...

385
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,880
Dismissed, Van carefully killed Brother V말

386
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,040
it is right

387
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,680
Yes.

388
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
From what I know,

389
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,160
it's really Wu Dang's letter.

390
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,600
You've traveled northward.

391
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,280
Just rest here.

392
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,440
Leave him to us.

393
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,760
Wait.

394
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,600
We just simply informed Wu Dang

395
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,400
and asked for mercy.

396
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,800
How do you know

397
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,240
we traveled northward?

398
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,080
I was wrong.

399
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,960
Don't think too much.

400
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,920
We've been hiding along the way.

401
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
We should have come eastward.

402
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,600
But we just wanted to avoid people's eyes

403
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,400
and went to the south.

404
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,840
How did you know

405
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,000
Wu Dang came from the north?

406
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,400
Did someone

407
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,480
reveal our whereabouts to our ears in advance?

408
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,760
Tell me.

409
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,160
Who sent you here?

410
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
I guess

411
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,920
you stole our letters

412
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,680
and made a fool of us.

413
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,360
Do it.

414
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,160
Master!

415
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,760
Master!

416
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,440
Master!

417
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,720
retained Master.

418
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,480
Mistress!

419
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,760
Mistress.

420
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,600
We fate-간

421
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,280
was seesrist.

422
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,800
Thank you, Mistress.

423
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,880
Thank you.

424
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,880
These people's fox tails

425
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
have finally come out.

426
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
Take him back for interrogation.

427
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
Yes.

428
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Leave Liu Suifeng to me.

429
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Although you made a mistake,

430
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
he can't bear to let you die.

431
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Stop!

432
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Stop right there!

433
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Stop!

434
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Don't run!

435
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
I'll kill you if you don't move!

436
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
I won't let you run!

437
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
I won't let you run!

438
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Liu Suifeng

439
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
Why did you save me?

440
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Why did you save me?

441
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
I'm strong.

442
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
You saved my life.

443
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
I'll kill someone for you.

444
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,880
It doesn't sound attractive.

445
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Then I'll return your life.

446
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Return my life?

447
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
No need.

448
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
I like the meaning of your eyes.

449
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,880
It's a pity to die here.

450
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Take it.

451
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Liu Suifeng

452
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
You've been following me.

453
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
What else do you want?

454
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
My life is yours.

455
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Where else can I go without you?

456
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
But you're tortured so much.

457
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
What's the use of keeping you?

458
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I can kill someone for you.

459
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I can kill someone for you.

460
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I can kill someone for you.

461
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
I can cut wood and ride horses for you.

462
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
I can do everything.

463
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Since I died,

464
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
you haven't given up on me.

465
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
I've noticed it on the way.

466
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
I just don't know your specific arrangement.

467
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,880
I can only live my life.

468
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
You've figured out

469
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Chen Zhou's plan to lure the snake out of the hole.

470
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
If you want me to sacrifice my life

471
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
to calm down the anger of Shaoling and Wudang,

472
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
I have no complaints.

473
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
I have no complaints.

474
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Suifeng

475
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
Chen Zhou and I have always trusted you.

476
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
We know that

477
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,880
even if everyone in the gang betrays us,

478
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
you won't.

479
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I've helped many enemies in the past.

480
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
The previous plans have been failed.

481
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Chen Zhou has figured out

482
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
that the gang has been set up by people.

483
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
If we don't kill them one day,

484
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
there will be no peace in the gang.

485
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,880
So we'll use you to kill Tianzhen

486
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
and Taichan.

487
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,880
We'll make a big article

488
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
to draw these cases.

489
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
You're so wise.

490
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
But this life

491
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
is the death of Shilong and you.

492
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
If one day,

493
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
you really don't believe me,

494
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
I'll be like walking in the dead.

495
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
It's better to die happily.

496
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
You just rest here.

497
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
I'll go back and interrogate those traitors.

498
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
If there's any news,

499
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
I'll tell you.

500
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
I'll go back and interrogate them.

501
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Young Master.

502
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
It's cold at night.

503
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
You should rest more.

504
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I'm fine.

505
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
I heard about your accident.

506
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm worried.

507
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
I've done my job.

508
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
You don't need to blame me.

509
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
If you leave the power bank,

510
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
I'll have no mercy

511
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
to the power bank.

512
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
When I'm not here,

513
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
how about the Xiao family?

514
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Don't worry.

515
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
The people of the Xiao family

516
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
are in the capital.

517
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
They're trying to rebuild

518
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
the Yellow Flower Sword Sect.

519
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
But no one cares about it.

520
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
They don't care about it.

521
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
The little sects of the Xiao family

522
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
are also against it.

523
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
The people of the Xiao family

524
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
are forced to be free.

525
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
They want to be heroes.

526
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
But they're not serious about their life.

527
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
They can't afford to be crazy.

528
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
It's all because of Xiao Qiushui.

529
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
He's a man.

530
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
It's lucky to be able to live in the family.

531
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
He doesn't deserve to be worried about.

532
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
You really think he's not worth mentioning.

533
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Or is he just a new born protector?

534
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
You can just say it.

535
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
I can tolerate the mistake I made occasionally.

536
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
But you should know

537
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
the consequence of betraying me.

538
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
I dare not.

539
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,880
I will never betray you in this life.

540
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,880
If you have any doubts,

541
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
kill me now.

542
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
I hope you dare not.

543
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,640
You didn't mention the

544
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
Wuji Elixir this time.

545
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
How dare you?

546
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
A piece of it was eaten by Shao Liulei.

547
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
The other piece

548
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
was stolen by the God of Flaming God Cai Qi.

549
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
Shao Liulei's martial arts are above me.

550
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,880
I tried my best to get this piece of life back.

551
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
If you do it again,

552
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
you don't have to come back.

553
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Leave.

554
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Yes.

555
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Even if I have to die for him,

556
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,880
I will never remember any love in his heart.

557
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Oh, Flaming Pearl.

558
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
Are you still dreaming?

559
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Staying by his side is enough.

560
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
These days,

561
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
I have been investigating the clues of Yingdi

562
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,880
with the chief's wife.

563
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
I only know that the mysterious organization

564
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
supported by the North Wilderness

565
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
is deliberately installed in the Jianghu

566
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
to act as the North Wilderness.

567
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
I always kill people with one knife.

568
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
This is for you.

569
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Is it an explanation or a choice of knife?

570
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
It's up to you.

571
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
The evil spirit in the poem

572
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
is as powerful as death.

573
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
If you don't hand over

574
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
the letter of Yingdi right now,

575
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
I will let this thing

576
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
wander in your body.

577
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
It's hard to bear it

578
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
to keep it in the daytime.

579
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
At night, the whole house

580
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
is like eight ponds of gold.

581
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
It's not good for life

582
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
but it's not good for death.

583
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
I only know that

584
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
the head of the house

585
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
will meet in Qingfeng Garden.

586
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Fire King

587
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,880
made one mistake and another.

588
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
So he came here.

589
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
We are old friends.

591
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
We have always been in the same gang.

592
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
We have never fought.

593
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
I have prepared a knife

594
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
for each of you.

595
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
You can choose one yourself.

596
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
Li Chenzhou is so stupid.

597
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
He sent you to kill me.

598
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
No.

599
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I just want to get out of the mouth

600
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
of Fire King

601
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
and get rid of the top line of Yingdi.

602
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
As for whether

603
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I can kill Fire King,

604
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,880
I can't decide.

605
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Where can I escape

606
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
from the Han Gang?

607
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
This is the secret formula

608
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
of the military order

609
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
found from Mi's Mansion.

610
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
And that Yingdi

611
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
is enough to prove

612
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
that the Han Gang is colluding with the North.

613
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,880
What else can you say?

614
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
Since you all know,

615
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
I don't need to say more.

616
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
That's right.

617
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
We have been

618
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
a part of Yingdi for a long time.

619
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Fire King,

620
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
you are helping the Han Gang.

621
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
I give you

622
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
a chance to make a contribution.

623
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
If you confess,

624
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
who is your top line?

625
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Is there anyone

626
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
in the gang

627
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
who is loyal to Yingdi?

628
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
Yingdi is a strong enemy.

629
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
You can't stop it.

630
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
You have done everything wrong.

631
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Okay.

632
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Let me ask you.

633
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
The thing about the destruction

634
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
of Baicao Valley

635
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
is it related to you?

636
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
I don't know.

637
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
Tell me.

638
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I am a hero.

639
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
I will never deny

640
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
what I did.

641
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
If I didn't do it,

642
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
I would not bear to die.

643
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
I got the secret formula

644
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
from Dian Cang Sect.

645
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
As for Baicao Valley,

646
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
I have no idea.

647
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
You Liu Suifeng

648
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
just killed Tian Zheng and Tai Chan

649
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
and won the war against the martial arts world.

650
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
How dare you

651
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
still keep him by your side?

652
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,880
I think the power of the Power Gang

653
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
is over.

654
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
As for what I did,

655
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
it was just for Changyuan.

656
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
You are too arrogant.

657
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
You think only you know

658
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
what the world's heroes

659
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
are capable of?

660
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
I will kill myself

661
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
and get the gang back.

662
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I have thought about this.

663
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Back then,

664
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Li Chen Zhou and Wei Fang

665
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
were fighting against each other

666
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
between the eight kings.

667
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
We were so angry

668
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
that we almost died.

669
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Now,

670
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
I have learned the skills

671
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,880
of the outside world.

672
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
I have already lost

673
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
the poison in the meridians.

674
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
If they kill me,

675
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
I will be poisoned.

676
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,880
I can only wait for death.

677
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,880
But I can kill them.

678
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
The time is up.

679
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
The poison in the Fire King's body

680
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
is no longer effective.

681
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
He is no longer one of the eight kings.

682
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
You can start now.

683
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Let me

684
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
go with you.

685
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Let the ten years of

686
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
suffering of the Fire Palm

687
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
destroy you.

688
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
This knife is not

689
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
a good knife.

690
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Your death

691
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
is in the best time to kill this knife.

692
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
It's a pity, Sui Feng.

693
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
He is not your enemy.

694
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Your hatred

695
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
will only be reported in the future.

696
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
I can learn this recipe

697
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
without being used by the people.

698
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I can also

699
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
help the people of Baicao Valley.

700
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
But the Fire King

701
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
is eager to die.

702
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
The secret weapons of the English enemies

703
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
and their plans

704
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
are being investigated.

705
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
The Fire King is not dead.

706
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
It can be seen that the English enemies are far away.

707
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
They tricked Sui Feng

708
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
to kill Tian Zheng and Tai Chan

709
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
to create a dispute between us and Shaolin Wudang

710
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
and cause the whole gang of Western Qiang to be in trouble.

711
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
It can be seen that

712
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,880
they are not equal.

713
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
This Yi Rong can be so good.

714
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
I think

715
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
only the three great Qimen of the Fei family

716
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
are a thousand people.

717
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
In the past, Fei family

718
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
claimed that the thousand-people noodles

719
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
had been burned.

720
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
But I have always

721
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
suspected him.

722
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
But I heard that the thousand-people noodles

723
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
are very dangerous.

724
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
If the enemy really has this thing,

725
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
it will be more difficult to deal with.

726
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
In the extraordinary period,

727
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
we have to use extraordinary methods.

728
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,880
We don't have much time left.

729
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
Sui Feng,

730
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
go to the informant

731
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
to investigate whether this matter is related to the Fei family.

732
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Yes.

733
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
In addition,

734
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
tell the Ghost King to speed up

735
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
and quickly practice more skills.

736
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
The Ghost King reports that

737
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
this Yu Lan,

738
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Lord Chong has already lost his energy

739
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
and is still in a daze.

740
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Only the Heaven and Earth Pond

741
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
at the back of the Chonggu Gate

742
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
can make the opportunity to revive.

743
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
The Tang Gate never allows outsiders to enter the Chonggu Gate.

744
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
If you break in rashly,

745
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
you may hurt Lord Chong

746
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
and lose your power.

747
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
In the night of the murder,

748
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
they will take the position of the head of the family.

749
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
Maybe they can open the Chonggu Gate.

750
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
It is dangerous to act in the same way.

751
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
You need to be more careful.

752
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Don't offend Mrs. Tang.

753
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Understood.

754
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I won't fail to help Suo Tuo.

755
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
But there are still things to worry about.

756
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
This Wudang Shaolin

757
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
and the various sects in the Jianghu

758
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
are still looking for us.

759
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Many strongholds of the Power Gang have been destroyed.

760
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
At this time,

761
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
the great Heavenly King of the Longjiang Water Sect

762
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
suddenly rose.

763
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I always feel that

764
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
there is something wrong with this.

765
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
What the enemy wants to do

766
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
is probably not only

767
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
to disturb this martial art world.

768
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,880
The person behind this

769
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
wants to challenge the Power Gang.

770
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Then we

771
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
will fight together.

772
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
We will fight together.

773
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,880
The road of life is long and wide.

774
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,880
The past is left behind in the rain.

775
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,880
The first sight of snow is different.

776
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
The earth is heavy.

777
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,880
The city is always the same.

778
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
The song of the mountain is heart-wrenching.

779
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,880
The next one is in the heart.

780
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,880
The world is just a few words.

781
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,880
The time is fast.

782
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,880
The wind and rain are different.

783
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,880
The road is long and the people are happy.

784
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
The world is just a few words.

785
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,880
The time is long and the people are happy.

786
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
The sheep head is dry.

787
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
The wine is dry.

788
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,060
The

789
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,880
world is just a few words.

790
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,880
The time is fast.

791
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,880
The wind and rain are different.

792
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,880
The road is long and the people are happy.

793
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
The world is just a few words.

794
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,880
The time is long and the people are happy.

795
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
The sheep head is dry.

796
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
The wine is dry.

797
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,880
The world is just a few words.

798
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
The world is just a few words.

799
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,880
The time is fast.

800
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,880
The wind and rain are different.

801
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
The road is long and the people are happy.

802
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,880
The time is long and the people are happy.

803
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,880
The world is just a few words.

804
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,880
I want to live my life to the fullest.

805
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
I want to be with you forever.

806
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,880
I want to be with you forever.

807
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,880
I want to be with you forever.

808
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,880
I want to be with you forever.

809
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,880
I want to be with you forever.

810
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,880
I want to be with you forever.

811
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,880
I want to be with you forever.

812
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,880
I want to be with you forever.
