1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Form a line, tipo el Oxfam

2
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,040
Water spray

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,460
Flash

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
If you don't believe me,

6
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,240
just kill me with a sword.

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm begging you.

8
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,040
After I die,

9
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,640
don't believe Xiao Qiushui again.

10
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,040
He has lost the blood of the Xiao family.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Brother,

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
you've killed the Power Gang.

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
You've killed Li Chenzhou,

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
Liu Suifeng,

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,720
and avenged your parents.

16
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,960
Why?

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,040
I don't know

18
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,480
who's real and who's fake.

19
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,720
Why are you all

20
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,120
like a different person?

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
Only I'm in the dark.

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm in the dark.

23
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
Brother is in the bright.

24
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
These are all

25
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,000
the humiliation

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,920
that you've suffered for me.

27
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,800
Brother,

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,800
if you really don't know who you believe,

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,000
just go back to the capital

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,080
and check it out.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
You've done a great thing for His Majesty.

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,240
The Xiao family has already received the grace.

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Who is really

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,240
doing things for the Xiao family?

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,960
You'll know when you see it.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
Father,

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Mother,

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,240
I, Xiao Yiren,

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,880
am here to see you.

40
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Wei Young,

41
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I heard that

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,960
you've made some great efforts

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
to bring our Shi Clan back to life

44
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
in front of all.

45
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Screen it.

46
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
I sent your father and mother

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
to look after your big brother

48
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,960
since it has just started.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm unfilial.

50
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,920
I can only use my own way

51
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
to show my filial piety.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm too old to be a good son.

53
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,480
Don't blame me for being incompetent.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Brother Qiushui.

55
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
Come and have a look.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
Look.

57
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,760
Shaolin, Wudang, and He Mei

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,640
have held a Heroes Conference together.

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
They want to select the leader of the martial arts world in Changban.

60
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
The leader of the martial arts world

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
has been suspended for many years.

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,840
It seems that these people

63
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,520
have already known the court's order.

64
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
They want to select the leader

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
and lead the whole martial arts world to protect General Wu.

66
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
The purpose of doing so

67
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,240
is to fight against Ji Bei Huang.

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,640
The Boxing Gang and Longjiang Shui Dao

69
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,000
will definitely attend.

70
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
I think this time...

71
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
If Xiao Kenyan

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,760
takes the position of leader

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
with the identity of the King of Heaven,

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
General Wu

75
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,640
will be in danger.

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Brother Qiushui.

77
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Are you going to attend the Heroes Conference?

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm going.

79
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I want to

80
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,360
reveal Xiao Kenyan's face in public.

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,800
But the inner power of the eight masters

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
is not fully integrated with your body.

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,600
If you are forced to suppress it,

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,280
it will definitely hurt your body.

85
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
And your second brother

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
is going to steal many martial arts

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,920
from the martial arts masters with the Heaven's Book of Forgetfulness.

88
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,480
Are you really sure?

89
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Don't worry.

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,200
No matter what,

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
even if I die,

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
I won't let him succeed.

93
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,320
Brother Qiushui,

94
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
I believe you.

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
This Heroes Conference

96
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
will be a great loss to you.

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,400
Well said.

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,760
Well said.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,560
Boss.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,200
Boss.

101
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,760
We're here.

102
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,000
Boss.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,680
Boss.

104
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
We're here.

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,600
Brothers.

106
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,520
Boss.

107
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,120
Boss.

108
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
We believe you, too.

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,280
Really?

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Yuhan.

111
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,640
The family affairs

112
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,360
are all arranged.

113
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,800
Brother,

114
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,520
since our martial arts lord

115
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,720
is such an important guest,

116
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,120
how could I fail?

117
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
That's true.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
I already sent existing messages.

119
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,880
They can wait until

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
we have good news for them.

121
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,000
You must give our four kicks

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,360
right.

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Yes.

124
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,100
No.

125
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,720
We can do it.

126
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,720
We've got five kicks.

127
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,600
We can do it.

128
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
Ä±?

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
You can't kill us.

130
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,440
I admire you the most in this life.

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,040
You are kind, loyal and loyal.

132
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,240
With your support, I, Xiao Qiushui,

133
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,640
thank you all.

134
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,440
It should be us thanking you.

135
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,640
If you didn't let us join the God's Will,

136
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,440
we wouldn't know where we are.

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
That's right. We don't know where we are.

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,040
Brother Qiushui, we are all brothers.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,640
We can't be polite.

140
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,440
We can't be polite.

141
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,240
We can't be polite.

142
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,840
That's right.

143
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,640
God's Will is all about one thing.

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
All about one thing.

145
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,840
Today's martial arts conference,

146
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,640
the world's most powerful martial arts conference,

147
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,640
for the first person to be eliminated from the Central Plains martial arts competition,

148
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,840
will be led by the leader,

149
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
the leader of the martial arts competition,

150
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,040
to save General Wu.

151
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,440
Those who betray the Western State,

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,640
will be able to take part in the competition.

153
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,040
The competition will be a competition.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,440
The two will compete.

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,240
The winner will go to Changhai Pavilion

156
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,640
to be the leader of the three martial arts schools,

157
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

158
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

162
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

163
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

164
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

165
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

166
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

167
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

168
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

169
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

170
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,320
This place will still be open to You.

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,520
Besides Master Y mosque.

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,720
This King will still be alive!

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
Unless Master Y mosque abscond,

174
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,560
there is no place for innocent people here.

175
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,600
Brother Xun,

176
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,360
we.

177
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,040
Just do what you want.

178
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
I...

179
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,440
I got it.

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,720
I got it.

181
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,160
Besides,

182
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm afraid you have other intentions

183
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,160
to take the position of leader.

184
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
It's worth it to compete with you

185
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,160
in front of all the heroes.

186
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,560
You're really hypocritical.

187
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,160
Since you don't want to fight, let's start.

188
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Wait.

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Xiu Yi Ren?

190
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Why is his brother here?

191
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Brother.

192
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Don't call me brother.

193
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
You don't have the right to fight with me.

194
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Let's talk about this first.

195
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Brother.

196
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,160
You really choose to believe him?

197
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Cut the crap.

198
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Stop.

199
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Brother.

200
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Stop.

201
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,160
No matter where you are, you're so difficult to kill.

202
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Is your acting enough?

203
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Don't forget to try.

204
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
I'm not afraid of you.

205
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm not afraid of you.

206
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm not afraid of you.

207
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm not afraid of you.

208
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm not afraid of you.

209
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Don't forget who you are.

210
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Don't forget who you are.

211
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Don't forget who you are.

212
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Youâ¦

213
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Look.

214
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Allen Qiu.

215
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Ilullerate fromæ¢¦  ayudar

216
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
These are children ofÃ­sÃ­f Mochelon.

217
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Scumbag.

218
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
What does he want?

219
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
It's dark.

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,720
What's he doing here?

221
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Brother.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,640
You want to kill me?

223
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,680
Kill you?

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,680
I'll avenge my parents.

225
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,960
Xiuying.

226
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,680
For Third Brother,

227
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,680
you want to kill me?

228
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,160
Why are you always on his side?

229
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
My parents are like this.

230
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,840
You are like this, too.

231
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
Definitely tomatoes!

232
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,640
Dangerous!

233
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,640
Young Master!

234
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,200
Brother.

235
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,080
I'll go.

236
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,400
Brother.

237
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,560
Young Master.

238
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,280
Brother.

239
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,920
Young Master.

240
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,280
It's my Lord of Heaven, Xiao Kaiyan.

241
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,080
Xiao Kaiyan.

242
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,400
Yeah.

243
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
What's going on?

244
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,200
Yeah.

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm the first Lord of Heaven.

246
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,560
Xiao Kaiyan is also me.

247
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,440
Xiao Kaiyan.

248
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,720
Where's my Lord of Heaven?

249
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,840
Where's my Lord of Heaven?

250
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,680
Do you want to betray me?

251
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,760
Xiao Qiushui.

252
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,840
Now that it's come to this,

253
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,040
can you be patient with me?

254
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Your heart

255
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,880
is really mine.

256
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,280
It's really cruel.

257
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,240
Qiu Shui.

258
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
Brother.

259
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
It, it...

260
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,120
The materials...

261
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,980
Brother.

262
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,500
Brother.

263
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Qiu Shui.

264
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,680
Everything's fine.

265
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,280
I owe you.

266
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
I don't deserve to be your big brother.

267
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I've believed too many lies

268
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
and embarrassed Xiao Tai.

269
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Big brother,

270
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
What are you talking about?

275
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Stop talking.

276
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,680
I want you to live well.

277
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
It's...

278
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,080
Big brother's fault.

279
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
It's his fault.

280
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
I've been trying to hide it from you.

281
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
But I never noticed it.

282
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
It's me.

283
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm sorry, father and mother.

284
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Big brother,

285
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
I'll give you a medical treatment now.

286
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Stop talking.

287
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
No.

288
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,880
That was a blow

289
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
that broke my heart.

290
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
It's good.

291
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,280
From now on,

292
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
I'll live in the tree.

293
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Qiu Shui,

294
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
I'll rely on you

295
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,080
to get the sword back.

296
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,580
First cab treatment?

297
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Qiu Shui,

298
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,280
bury me in the playing field.

299
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,120
Take care of Xiaojiao.

300
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,200
Big brother.

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,880
Big brother.

302
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
Big brother.

303
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,960
Big brother.

304
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,720
I will definitely get up.

305
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,400
I will definitely fulfill your mission.

306
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,400
Big brother, be well.

307
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,000
Help me settle my big brother.

308
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,840
You are not allowed to enter the palace.

309
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
We are not interested in the case of the Xiao family.

310
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,560
I will be the leader of the martial art world.

311
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,560
Do you really think there is no one in the martial arts world?

312
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,920
Here, besides the old man Qiu, there is also a person.

313
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,160
This monk and Taoist priest are half.

314
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,400
What is the so-called white Taoist priest?

315
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,040
Ji Wu Peng.

316
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,080
It would be great if you had the opportunity to fight.

317
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,560
I am white Taoist,

318
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,560
you are black Taoist.

319
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
How could I know who you are?

320
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,480
Tell me your name.

321
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,880
I want to hit you.

322
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,600
It's an injury,

323
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,600
but it's not a measured point.

324
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,680
Think about it.

325
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,820
Go.

326
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,560
Come.

327
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,240
Bodhisattva Vze worried about you.

328
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,480
There is nothing podeowed.

329
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,280
Chief Samarin.

330
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,080
Chief Samarin is the Chief God of Soul Land.

331
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,880
Youyang is now under the name of Ji Wu Peng.

332
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
Who are you?

333
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,880
How do you know?

334
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Ji Wu Peng!

335
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Ji Wu Peng

336
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,240
How charming he is!

337
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,720
Who is this man?

338
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
There is such a person in the world!

339
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,760
He is so skilled.

340
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
He is a rare visitor.

341
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
I feel that he is familiar.

342
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,760
You are...

343
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,280
Yan Kuang Tu!

344
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,520
He is still alive.

345
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Yan Kuang Tu is still alive?

346
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
He is still so young.

347
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Yes, yes, yes.

348
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
No, no.

349
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
After so many years,

350
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
he is not only not old,

351
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
but also young and strong.

352
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
This logic doesn't work.

353
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
I knew it.

354
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
He is definitely not a normal person.

355
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I didn't participate in the killing of you back then.

356
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,280
I just felt that you are proud of the martial arts world

357
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
and don't take the world seriously.

358
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,280
You are quite similar to me.

359
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
But today you came,

360
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
why?

361
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Since you know my plan,

362
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
the world's heroes order

363
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,280
is to kill me.

364
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
You don't deserve it.

365
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
So many messages about him.

366
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,900
I will die without ë§ë¬´ë¦¬.

367
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,280
But when before I die,

368
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,280
I will still be able to hide my head.

369
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,280
I will definitely be able to get a tryna ear battery.

370
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,900
I swear on you.

371
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Zeng Ken lovingan bride

372
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,280
No one has dared to talk to me like this for decades.

373
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,880
Kid, what's your name?

374
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,680
Xiao Qiushui.

375
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,720
Then do you know who I am?

376
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,760
The first man in the martial arts world.

377
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,000
The first man in the martial arts world.

378
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,880
Aren't you worthy of the Order of Heroes?

379
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,080
You're not.

380
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,360
I'm not.

381
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm not. Who's worthy?

382
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,560
The first man in the martial arts world.

383
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,640
Then who's the first man in the martial arts world?

384
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,280
General Wu Jie.

385
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,040
You're right.

386
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,400
But in terms of martial arts,

387
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,120
I'm invincible.

388
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,560
The real invincible will never kill.

389
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,600
The real invincible

390
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,840
is the martial arts.

391
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,360
Only the real invincible can be protected.

392
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,960
You're just a mouthful of talk.

393
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,120
You're wrong.

394
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,120
You're just a word of the world's heroes.

395
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,240
Fine.

396
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,760
I've learned something.

397
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,800
For decades,

398
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,960
there's finally a character in the martial arts world.

399
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,360
But to fight the world,

400
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,120
you have to use your real skills.

401
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,920
If I want to kill you today, I'll do it like a boss.

402
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,120
But you're good at it.

403
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,400
I can take you as my apprentice and teach you martial arts.

404
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
When I'm happy,

405
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,200
I'll kneel down and beg for your help.

406
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,960
I won't kneel down.

407
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,520
Ask how many martial arts schools there are in the world.

408
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,640
I'll teach them a trick

409
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,040
without any effort.

410
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,520
How dare you

411
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,840
refuse me?

412
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,320
Yan Kuangtu is a wild man.

413
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,280
He's very extreme.

414
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,600
If he's on Boss Ding,

415
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
he won't give up easily.

416
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,560
What should we do?

417
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,840
You must go there.

418
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,600
Is my martial arts

419
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,720
not good enough?

420
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

421
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
You're just a crazy man.

422
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Great!

423
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,560
What a crazy man!

424
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
I'd like to see

425
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
if you kneel

426
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
or not.

427
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Anantoshi?

428
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Anantoshi?

429
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Shaolin's Hundred-Way-Walking.

430
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Even if the Buddha's son is a living thing,

431
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
it's hard to say he's a real man.

432
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
His eyes are so clear.

433
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Jade Dragon Sword.

434
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

435
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

436
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

437
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

438
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Boy,

439
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
why did you steal so many skills?

440
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm not a man.

441
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
It's not enough to die.

442
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Don't be so strong

443
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
with your wounds.

444
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Dong!

445
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
You have to kneel

446
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
even if you don't kneel.

447
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I won't kneel if I don't kneel.

448
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

449
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

450
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

451
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

452
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

453
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

454
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

455
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

456
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

457
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

458
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

459
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

460
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

461
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

462
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

463
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

464
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

465
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

466
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

467
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

468
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

469
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

470
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

471
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

472
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

473
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

474
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

475
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

476
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,560
The blood on the mountain is full of blood.

477
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
The sword has never been cut.

478
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
You're not drinking and you're not drinking?

479
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
I've been drunk for a thousand years.

480
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I've been drunk.

481
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,560
I want to wait for the light to come.

482
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,560
The wind is cold.

483
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
The wind is cold.

484
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
The wind is cold.

485
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
The wind is cold.

486
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
The wind is cold.

487
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
The wind is cold.

488
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
The wind is cold.

489
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,260
then there's eulp focus

490
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,460
diagonal but tonsured

491
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,400
This moment of endless romantic waste

492
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,060
Be molded into a elevation

493
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,680
When the tender body ì´ì¼ê¸°

494
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,480
ends

495
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,940
like the ejecedent chain

496
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,020
I quickly despawned

497
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,100
Marching into the immediate end

498
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,880
stop kneeling

499
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,140
To make me

500
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,280
As heavy as I can get

501
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,340
threaten In an eternal silence

502
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,220
in another life

503
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,860
I've been waiting for thousands of years

504
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,980
I want to wait for the endless night

505
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,220
I'll wait for you to come

506
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,620
I'll wait for you to come

507
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,820
I'm not afraid of the big waves

508
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,700
I'll wait for you to come

509
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,500
I'll wait for you to come

510
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,460
I'll wait for you to come

511
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,340
Let this city and river

512
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Take away the deep sea

513
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,220
Let the waves

514
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,060
Get into the sea of ââblood

515
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,820
To the end of the shore

516
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,620
The long night is in the middle of the sea

517
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,780
Just don't forget this 100

518
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,860
Let this big cloud

519
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,820
Be the blood of the world

520
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,380
The hero's sword has never changed

521
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,900
I've been waiting for thousands of years

522
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,860
I've been waiting for the endless night

523
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,860
I want to wait for the endless night

524
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,700
I'll wait for you to come

525
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,340
You

526
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,860
I don'tkÄlp these'ree

527
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,980
to be entangled

528
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,380
I'll come to you again

529
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,580
Don't search

530
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,660
Third brother

531
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,940
Ùì´ê°

532
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Young Master Xiao!

533
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Young Master Xiao!

534
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,940
Amitabha.

535
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
Young Master Xiao, how is your injury?

536
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
It's fine.

537
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Why did you stop us from chasing Yan Kuangtu?

538
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Yan Kuangtu deliberately beat me up.

539
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,940
If not, I would have killed him.

540
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
If he wants to kill me,

541
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,940
no one on the battlefield

542
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,940
can be his opponent.

543
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
In today's martial arts competition,

544
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,940
the winner is Xiao Qiushui from Shenzhou.

545
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Congratulations, Young Master Xiao!

546
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
Congratulations, Young Master Xiao!

547
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
That's great!

548
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Martial arts champion! Martial arts champion!

549
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
Young Master Xiao,

550
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Martial arts champion,

551
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
the martial arts world is in turmoil.

552
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,940
Our country is in danger.

553
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,940
From today on,

554
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
you have to take responsibility

555
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,940
and lead the martial arts world to unite

556
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
and fight against the enemy together.

557
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Take it. Martial arts champion! Martial arts champion!

558
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Take it, martial arts champion!

559
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
Take it.

560
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Take it.

561
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Yan Kuangtu, you're cheating!

562
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
You brat!

563
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
The leader of the martial arts world is yours.

564
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,940
I will continue to use the world's heroes' orders.

565
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Boss, Boss!

566
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Boss, Boss!

567
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Martial arts champion!

568
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
Yi Ran,

569
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
I still have a lot to tell you.

570

But you can't hear it.

In the past, you always lived in the life.

572

Who dares to...

585

Then you guys just raise your heads and look carefully.

586
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,940
