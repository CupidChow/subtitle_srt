1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Form a line, tipo el Oxfam

2
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,040
Water spray

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,460
Flash

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
If you don't believe me,

6
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,240
just kill me with a sword.

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm begging you.

8
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,040
After I die,

9
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,640
don't believe Xiao Qiushui again.

10
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,040
He has lost the blood of the Xiao family.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Brother,

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
you've killed the Power Gang.

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
You've killed Li Chenzhou,

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
Liu Suifeng,

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,720
and avenged your parents.

16
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,960
Why?

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,040
I don't know

18
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,480
who's real and who's fake.

19
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,720
Why are you all

20
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,120
like a different person?

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
Only I'm in the dark.

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I'm in the dark.

23
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
Brother is in the bright.

24
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
These are all

25
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,000
the humiliation

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,920
that you've suffered for me.

27
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,800
Brother,

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,800
if you really don't know who you believe,

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,000
just go back to the capital

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,080
and check it out.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
You've done a great thing for His Majesty.

32
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,240
The Xiao family has already received the grace.

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Who is really

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,240
doing things for the Xiao family?

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,960
You'll know when you see it.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
Father,

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Mother,

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,240
I, Xiao Yiren,

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,880
am here to see you.

40
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
Wei Young,

41
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
I heard that

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,960
you've made some great efforts

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
to bring our Shi Clan back to life

44
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
in front of all.

45
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Screen it.

46
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
I sent your father and mother

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
to look after your big brother

48
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,960
since it has just started.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm unfilial.

50
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,920
I can only use my own way

51
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
to show my filial piety.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm too old to be a good son.

53
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,480
Don't blame me for being incompetent.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Brother Qiushui.

55
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
Come and have a look.

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
Look.

57
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,760
Shaolin, Wudang, and He Mei

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,640
have held a Heroes Conference together.

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
They want to select the leader of the martial arts world in Changban.

60
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
The leader of the martial arts world

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
has been suspended for many years.

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,840
It seems that these people

63
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,520
have already known the court's order.

64
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
They want to select the leader

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
and lead the whole martial arts world to protect General Wu.

66
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
The purpose of doing so

67
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,240
is to fight against Ji Bei Huang.

68
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,640
The Boxing Gang and Longjiang Shui Dao

69
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,000
will definitely attend.

70
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,760
I think this time...

71
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
If Xiao Kenyan

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,760
takes the position of leader

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
with the identity of the King of Heaven,

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
General Wu

75
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,640
will be in danger.

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Brother Qiushui.

77
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Are you going to attend the Heroes Conference?

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm going.

79
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I want to

80
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,360
reveal Xiao Kenyan's face in public.

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,800
But the inner power of the eight masters

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,360
is not fully integrated with your body.

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,600
If you are forced to suppress it,

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,280
it will definitely hurt your body.

85
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
And your second brother

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
is going to steal many martial arts

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,920
from the martial arts masters with the Heaven's Book of Forgetfulness.

88
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,480
Are you really sure?

89
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Don't worry.

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,200
No matter what,

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,080
even if I die,

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,200
I won't let him succeed.

93
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,320
Brother Qiushui,

94
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
I believe you.

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
This Heroes Conference

96
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
will be a great loss to you.

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,400
Well said.

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,760
Well said.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,560
Boss.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,200
Boss.

101
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,760
We're here.

102
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,000
Boss.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,680
Boss.

104
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
We're here.

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,600
Brothers.

106
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,520
Boss.

107
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,120
Boss.

108
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,000
We believe you, too.

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,280
Really?

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
Yuhan.

111
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,640
The family affairs

112
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,360
are all arranged.

113
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,800
Brother,

114
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,520
since our martial arts lord

115
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,720
is such an important guest,

116
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,120
how could I fail?

117
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
That's true.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
I already sent existing messages.

119
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,880
They can wait until

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
we have good news for them.

121
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,000
You must give our four kicks

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,360
right.

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,200
Yes.

124
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,100
No.

125
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,720
We can do it.

126
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,720
We've got five kicks.

127
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,600
We can do it.

128
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
ı?

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
You can't kill us.

130
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,440
I admire you the most in this life.

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,040
You are kind, loyal and loyal.

132
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,240
With your support, I, Xiao Qiushui,

133
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,640
thank you all.

134
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,440
It should be us thanking you.

135
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,640
If you didn't let us join the God's Will,

136
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,440
we wouldn't know where we are.

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
That's right. We don't know where we are.

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,040
Brother Qiushui, we are all brothers.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,640
We can't be polite.

140
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,440
We can't be polite.

141
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,240
We can't be polite.

142
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,840
That's right.

143
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,640
God's Will is all about one thing.

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
All about one thing.

145
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,840
Today's martial arts conference,

146
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,640
the world's most powerful martial arts conference,

147
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,640
for the first person to be eliminated from the Central Plains martial arts competition,

148
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,840
will be led by the leader,

149
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
the leader of the martial arts competition,

150
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,040
to save General Wu.

151
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,440
Those who betray the Western State,

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,640
will be able to take part in the competition.

153
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,040
The competition will be a competition.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,440
The two will compete.

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,240
The winner will go to Changhai Pavilion

156
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,640
to be the leader of the three martial arts schools,

157
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

158
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

161
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

162
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

163
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

164
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

165
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

166
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

167
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
The first person to be eliminated from the competition will be

168
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
the leader of the three martial arts schools,

169
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
in Shaolin, Wudang and Nemei.

170
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,320
This place will still be open to You.

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,520
Besides Master Y mosque.

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,720
This King will still be alive!

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
Unless Master Y mosque abscond,

174
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,560
there is no place for innocent people here.

175
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,600
Brother Xun,

176
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,360
we.

177
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,040
Just do what you want.

178
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
I...

179
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,440
I got it.

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,720
I got it.

181
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,160
Besides,

182
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm afraid you have other intentions

183
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,160
to take the position of leader.

184
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
It's worth it to compete with you

185
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,160
in front of all the heroes.

186
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,560
You're really hypocritical.

187
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,160
Since you don't want to fight, let's start.

188
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Wait.

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
Xiu Yi Ren?

190
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Why is his brother here?

191
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Brother.

192
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Don't call me brother.

193
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
You don't have the right to fight with me.

194
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Let's talk about this first.

195
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Brother.

196
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,160
You really choose to believe him?

197
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Cut the crap.

198
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Stop.

199
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Brother.

200
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Stop.

201
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,160
No matter where you are, you're so difficult to kill.

202
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Is your acting enough?

203
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Don't forget to try.

204
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
I'm not afraid of you.

205
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm not afraid of you.

206
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I'm not afraid of you.

207
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm not afraid of you.

208
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm not afraid of you.

209
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Don't forget who you are.

210
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Don't forget who you are.

211
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
Don't forget who you are.

212
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
You…

213
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Look.

214
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Allen Qiu.

215
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Ilullerate from梦  ayudar

216
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
These are children ofísíf Mochelon.

217
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Scumbag.

218
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
What does he want?

219
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
It's dark.

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,720
What's he doing here?

221
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Brother.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,640
You want to kill me?

223
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,680
Kill you?

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,680
I'll avenge my parents.

225
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,960
Xiuying.

226
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,680
For Third Brother,

227
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,680
you want to kill me?

228
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,160
Why are you always on his side?

229
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
My parents are like this.

230
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,840
You are like this, too.

231
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
Definitely tomatoes!

232
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,640
Dangerous!

233
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,640
Young Master!

234
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,200
Brother.

235
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,080
I'll go.

236
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,400
Brother.

237
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,560
Young Master.

238
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,280
Brother.

239
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,920
Young Master.

240
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,280
It's my Lord of Heaven, Xiao Kaiyan.

241
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,080
Xiao Kaiyan.

242
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,400
Yeah.

243
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
What's going on?

244
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,200
Yeah.

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm the first Lord of Heaven.

246
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,560
Xiao Kaiyan is also me.

247
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,440
Xiao Kaiyan.

248
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,720
Where's my Lord of Heaven?

249
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,840
Where's my Lord of Heaven?

250
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,680
Do you want to betray me?

251
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,760
Xiao Qiushui.

252
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,840
Now that it's come to this,

253
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,040
can you be patient with me?

254
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Your heart

255
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,880
is really mine.

256
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,280
It's really cruel.

257
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,240
Qiu Shui.

258
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
Brother.

259
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
It, it...

260
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,120
The materials...

261
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,980
Brother.

262
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,500
Brother.

263
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,600
Qiu Shui.

264
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,680
Everything's fine.

265
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,280
I owe you.

266
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
I don't deserve to be your big brother.

267
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I've believed too many lies

268
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
and embarrassed Xiao Tai.

269
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Big brother,

270
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm sorry.

271
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
What are you talking about?

275
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Stop talking.

276
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,680
I want you to live well.

277
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
It's...

278
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,080
Big brother's fault.

279
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
It's his fault.

280
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,280
I've been trying to hide it from you.

281
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
But I never noticed it.

282
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
It's me.

283
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm sorry, father and mother.

284
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Big brother,

285
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
I'll give you a medical treatment now.

286
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Stop talking.

287
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
No.

288
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,880
That was a blow

289
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
that broke my heart.

290
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
It's good.

291
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,280
From now on,

292
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,480
I'll live in the tree.

293
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Qiu Shui,

294
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
I'll rely on you

295
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,080
to get the sword back.

296
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,580
First cab treatment?

297
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Qiu Shui,

298
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,280
bury me in the playing field.

299
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,120
Take care of Xiaojiao.

300
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,200
Big brother.

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,880
Big brother.

302
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
Big brother.

303
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,960
Big brother.

304
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,720
I will definitely get up.

305
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,400
I will definitely fulfill your mission.

306
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,400
Big brother, be well.

307
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,000
Help me settle my big brother.

308
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,840
You are not allowed to enter the palace.

309
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
We are not interested in the case of the Xiao family.

310
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,560
I will be the leader of the martial art world.

311
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,560
Do you really think there is no one in the martial arts world?

312
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,920
Here, besides the old man Qiu, there is also a person.

313
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,160
This monk and Taoist priest are half.

314
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,400
What is the so-called white Taoist priest?

315
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,040
Ji Wu Peng.

316
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,080
It would be great if you had the opportunity to fight.

317
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,560
I am white Taoist,

318
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,560
you are black Taoist.

319
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
How could I know who you are?

320
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,480
Tell me your name.

321
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,880
I want to hit you.

322
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,600
It's an injury,

323
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,600
but it's not a measured point.

324
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,680
Think about it.

325
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,820
Go.

326
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,560
Come.

327
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,240
Bodhisattva Vze worried about you.

328
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,480
There is nothing podeowed.

329
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,280
Chief Samarin.

330
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,080
Chief Samarin is the Chief God of Soul Land.

331
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,880
Youyang is now under the name of Ji Wu Peng.

332
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
Who are you?

333
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,880
How do you know?

334
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Ji Wu Peng!

335
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Ji Wu Peng

336
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,240
How charming he is!

337
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,720
Who is this man?

338
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
There is such a person in the world!

339
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,760
He is so skilled.

340
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,960
He is a rare visitor.

341
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
I feel that he is familiar.

342
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,760
You are...

343
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,280
Yan Kuang Tu!

344
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,520
He is still alive.

345
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
Yan Kuang Tu is still alive?

346
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
He is still so young.

347
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Yes, yes, yes.

348
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
No, no.

349
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
After so many years,

350
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
he is not only not old,

351
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,280
but also young and strong.

352
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
This logic doesn't work.

353
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
I knew it.

354
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
He is definitely not a normal person.

355
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I didn't participate in the killing of you back then.

356
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,280
I just felt that you are proud of the martial arts world

357
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
and don't take the world seriously.

358
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,280
You are quite similar to me.

359
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
But today you came,

360
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
why?

361
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Since you know my plan,

362
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
the world's heroes order

363
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,280
is to kill me.

364
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
You don't deserve it.

365
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
So many messages about him.

366
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,900
I will die without 마무리.

367
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,280
But when before I die,

368
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,280
I will still be able to hide my head.

369
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,280
I will definitely be able to get a tryna ear battery.

370
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,900
I swear on you.

371
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Zeng Ken lovingan bride

372
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,280
No one has dared to talk to me like this for decades.

373
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,880
Kid, what's your name?

374
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,680
Xiao Qiushui.

375
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,720
Then do you know who I am?

376
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,760
The first man in the martial arts world.

377
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,000
The first man in the martial arts world.

378
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,880
Aren't you worthy of the Order of Heroes?

379
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,080
You're not.

380
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,360
I'm not.

381
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm not. Who's worthy?

382
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,560
The first man in the martial arts world.

383
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,640
Then who's the first man in the martial arts world?

384
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,280
General Wu Jie.

385
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,040
You're right.

386
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,400
But in terms of martial arts,

387
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,120
I'm invincible.

388
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,560
The real invincible will never kill.

389
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,600
The real invincible

390
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,840
is the martial arts.

391
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,360
Only the real invincible can be protected.

392
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,960
You're just a mouthful of talk.

393
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,120
You're wrong.

394
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,120
You're just a word of the world's heroes.

395
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,240
Fine.

396
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,760
I've learned something.

397
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,800
For decades,

398
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,960
there's finally a character in the martial arts world.

399
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,360
But to fight the world,

400
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,120
you have to use your real skills.

401
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,920
If I want to kill you today, I'll do it like a boss.

402
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,120
But you're good at it.

403
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,400
I can take you as my apprentice and teach you martial arts.

404
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,960
When I'm happy,

405
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,200
I'll kneel down and beg for your help.

406
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,960
I won't kneel down.

407
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,520
Ask how many martial arts schools there are in the world.

408
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,640
I'll teach them a trick

409
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,040
without any effort.

410
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,520
How dare you

411
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,840
refuse me?

412
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,320
Yan Kuangtu is a wild man.

413
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,280
He's very extreme.

414
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,600
If he's on Boss Ding,

415
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
he won't give up easily.

416
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,560
What should we do?

417
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,840
You must go there.

418
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,600
Is my martial arts

419
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,720
not good enough?

420
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

421
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
You're just a crazy man.

422
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Great!

423
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,560
What a crazy man!

424
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
I'd like to see

425
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
if you kneel

426
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
or not.

427
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Anantoshi?

428
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Anantoshi?

429
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Shaolin's Hundred-Way-Walking.

430
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Even if the Buddha's son is a living thing,

431
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
it's hard to say he's a real man.

432
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
His eyes are so clear.

433
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Jade Dragon Sword.

434
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

435
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

436
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

437
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

438
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Boy,

439
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
why did you steal so many skills?

440
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
I'm not a man.

441
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
It's not enough to die.

442
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
Don't be so strong

443
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
with your wounds.

444
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Dong!

445
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
You have to kneel

446
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
even if you don't kneel.

447
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I won't kneel if I don't kneel.

448
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

449
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

450
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

451
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

452
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

453
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

454
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

455
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

456
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

457
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

458
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

459
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

460
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

461
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

462
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

463
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

464
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

465
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

466
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

467
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

468
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

469
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

470
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

471
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

472
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

473
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

474
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

475
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Dong Shi Xiaoping.

476
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,560
The blood on the mountain is full of blood.

477
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
The sword has never been cut.

478
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
You're not drinking and you're not drinking?

479
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
I've been drunk for a thousand years.

480
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I've been drunk.

481
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,560
I want to wait for the light to come.

482
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,560
The wind is cold.

483
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
The wind is cold.

484
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
The wind is cold.

485
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
The wind is cold.

486
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
The wind is cold.

487
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
The wind is cold.

488
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
The wind is cold.

489
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,260
then there's eulp focus

490
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,460
diagonal but tonsured

491
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,400
This moment of endless romantic waste

492
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,060
Be molded into a elevation

493
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,680
When the tender body 이야기

494
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,480
ends

495
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,940
like the ejecedent chain

496
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,020
I quickly despawned

497
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,100
Marching into the immediate end

498
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,880
stop kneeling

499
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,140
To make me

500
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,280
As heavy as I can get

501
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,340
threaten In an eternal silence

502
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,220
in another life

503
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,860
I've been waiting for thousands of years

504
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,980
I want to wait for the endless night

505
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,220
I'll wait for you to come

506
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,620
I'll wait for you to come

507
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,820
I'm not afraid of the big waves

508
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,700
I'll wait for you to come

509
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,500
I'll wait for you to come

510
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,460
I'll wait for you to come

511
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,340
Let this city and river

512
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
Take away the deep sea

513
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,220
Let the waves

514
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,060
Get into the sea of ​​blood

515
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,820
To the end of the shore

516
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,620
The long night is in the middle of the sea

517
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,780
Just don't forget this 100

518
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,860
Let this big cloud

519
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,820
Be the blood of the world

520
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,380
The hero's sword has never changed

521
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,900
I've been waiting for thousands of years

522
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,860
I've been waiting for the endless night

523
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,860
I want to wait for the endless night

524
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,700
I'll wait for you to come

525
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,340
You

526
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,860
I don'tkęlp these'ree

527
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,980
to be entangled

528
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,380
I'll come to you again

529
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,580
Don't search

530
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,660
Third brother

531
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,940
ك어가

532
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Young Master Xiao!

533
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Young Master Xiao!

534
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,940
Amitabha.

535
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
Young Master Xiao, how is your injury?

536
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
It's fine.

537
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Why did you stop us from chasing Yan Kuangtu?

538
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Yan Kuangtu deliberately beat me up.

539
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,940
If not, I would have killed him.

540
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,940
If he wants to kill me,

541
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,940
no one on the battlefield

542
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,940
can be his opponent.

543
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
In today's martial arts competition,

544
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,940
the winner is Xiao Qiushui from Shenzhou.

545

the martial arts world is in turmoil.

552
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,940
Our country is in danger.

553
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,940
From today on,

554
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
you have to take responsibility

555
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,940
and lead the martial arts world to unite

556
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
and fight against the enemy together.

557
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Take it. Martial arts champion! Martial arts champion!

00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940

Take it.

560
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Take it.

561
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Yan Kuangtu, you're cheating!

562
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
You brat!

563
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
The leader of the martial arts world is yours.

564
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,940
I will continue to use the world's heroes' orders.

565
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Boss, Boss!

566
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Boss, Boss!

567
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Martial arts champion!

568
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
Yi Ran,

569
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
I still have a lot to tell you.

570
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,940
