1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Break through the distance of light

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let this city and river be reborn in the sea of mountains

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let the sword of light cut through the dust

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let the end of the dark night be the middle of the night

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So that we won't forget this 100

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let this great battle break the ice and blood

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let the sword of life never change

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let the millennia be with me and bloom

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Like a light that doesn't count as the bright future

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The King's Avatar

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This paper is torn in half.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I suspect that Uncle Deng has left something for you.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Could it be that Father wants to write something?

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I found out that Father had something hidden from the Baicao Valley.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But no matter how I asked, he never wanted to tell me.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Maybe Father has figured it out.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He wants to tell us the truth.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You must follow me.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If he kills Uncle Deng,

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
no matter where he is,

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will avenge your father.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Brother, you mean that

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
we can't be sure that it's him now?

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My father has no other enemies.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Except for the Power Gang,

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Except for Liu Cifeng,

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
who else would be so heartbroken?

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yu Lan Jian, think about it.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is there anything wrong?

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The King's Avatar

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Second Brother's death.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Liu Cifeng?

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I came to see Father in the study last night.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I happened to meet Liu Cifeng walking out of the room.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I came to see Father when I was in the Third Geng.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sister, did you remember it wrong?

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's Second Brother.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sure

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
there must be someone else.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The King's Avatar

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How long has your father been unconscious?

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He was awake for hours a few days ago.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He's been unconscious for the past two days.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Your father is not

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
in the middle of his death.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have my own secret recipe,

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but this recipe has 50% failure rate.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm afraid that

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
your father's death rate will not be as high as before.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm afraid that

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you'll have to think about it.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Step aside.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me in.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Get lost.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is there anything wrong?

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I heard that the King's Avatar

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
came to see me.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He asked me to bring him some soup

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to help the King's Avatar.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Please allow me to come in.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you, Father.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But the King's Avatar is just a guest.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He's not like my father.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He doesn't need this soup.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who dares to poison the King's Avatar?

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why are you so careful?

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Miss, you misunderstood.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Miss, the King's Avatar is indeed strong.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's okay to take it

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
if it's just a normal medicine.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But it's not suitable for

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
a medicine that can save lives.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Fine.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The King's Avatar is rare.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
My ancestors thought

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
that the King's Avatar was sick.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If he can't support the Tang family,

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
he should make a decision as soon as possible.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But I also advised him that

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
if the King's Avatar is just a guest,

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
he will show up at the meeting in the middle of the month.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Right?

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Of course.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Please.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't escape from both sides.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Please don't worry about my father's illness.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay. I'll prepare for it.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The flowers are falling

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
How many times in a life

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The wind blows

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
As if it were a song to say goodbye

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who can stop the love

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
How many times in love

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The sky and the moon are in a hurry

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The tears fall

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The wind is not broken

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who can stop the love

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How many times in love

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The sky and the moon are in a hurry

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The tears fall

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The wind is not broken

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The flowers fall

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The stars follow

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The rain falls

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yuhan.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Uncle Deng has something in his mouth.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Iron Cloth.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Could it be the Divine Cloth?

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Uncle Iron Cloth is a righteous man.

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He is my father's best friend.

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When the Sword Lair was surrounded,

116
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
he risked his life to help.

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Could he still be alive?

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go and ask him.

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When the Sword Lair was lost,

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
he didn't find his body.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There were a few bodies

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that were burned to the ground.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can't decide if it was him.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Everyone

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
don't let him die in the Sword Lair.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There were many people in the Sword Lair.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why did only his body disappear?

128
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My father did hide something

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
in the White Grass Valley.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
what does it have to do with Iron Cloth?

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm not sure yet.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But I can be sure that

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
someone behind this

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
must be the murderer

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
who is behind our investigation.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yuhan.

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If I hadn't been the one to investigate,

139
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Uncle Deng

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
might have been the murderer.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I wouldn't have done this.

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yuhan.

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's not your fault.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The revenge of the Sword Lair

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and the revenge of my Sea Sect

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
must be avenged.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Zitu is vicious.

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If we can't catch him,

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
our family

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
will never be the last victim.

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yuhan.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't worry.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I will never be confused

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and surrender to the murderer.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We must find the poison in the martial arts world.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
When I settle my father and my accomplices,

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll come to help you.

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yuhan.

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can you do it alone?

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What I'm thinking now

163
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
is to let this murderer

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
die quickly.

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yuhan.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You must find that person.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yuhan.

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Rest well.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Father.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Father.

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Father.

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Father.

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm incompetent.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Miss, I'm sorry.

176
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Please.

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I know you are a powerful man.

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can take poison and cure both.

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can cure people

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
in no time.

181
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Please.

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Please teach me

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
another way.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Please get up.

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,280
I can't do that.

186
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,000
Indeed,

187
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
there is another way.

188
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,400
But for you,

189
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,680
it's too dangerous.

190
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
For me?

191
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,520
No matter what,

192
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,000
as long as you can be my father,

193
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,040
I can do it.

194
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,120
This is the way to poison with poison.

195
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
The person who can do it

196
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,920
will take my secret poison

197
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,920
and then use his inner power

198
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,800
to infect the patient.

199
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,720
The two poisons will be in conflict.

200
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,600
Maybe your father will be in danger.

201
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,440
But if you're not careful,

202
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,520
your father won't be in danger.

203
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,320
I'm afraid that

204
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
even your life will be in danger.

205
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,840
Please teach me this way.

206
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
No matter what,

207
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,840
I must save my father.

208
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,120
Then I'll do what you said.

209
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,000
Miss,

210
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,000
let's call it a day.

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
Don't worry about the country.

212
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,960
When you get better,

213
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
increase the amount of medicine.

214
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
Father.

215
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,240
Feng.

216
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
I'm sorry

217
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,600
to have troubled you.

218
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,600
As long as you're fine,

219
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,680
I can do anything.

220
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,040
LOL

221
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,120
The number you arranged

222
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,160
must be Yuhan's family contact number.

223
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,880
Answer it.

224
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,960
There is an unknown person

225
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
who tried to kill Mr. Yuhan

226
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,240
to kill him.

227
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,560
Or maybe there is someone

228
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,640
who الend a murder.

229
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,720
They say there's a female heroine in the city

231
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
who's been running around to cure the refugees.

232
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
It must be you.

233
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm just trying to help.

234
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,760
Brother,

235
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
why are you here so late?

236
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
I haven't heard from Brother these days.

237
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
I don't know how he's been doing lately.

238
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,280
How did you get together with Beihuang

239
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,360
and sell the country to the Emperor?

240
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,280
I've sent people to ask around.

241
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
But I still haven't heard from Brother.

242
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,120
I was going to look for him

243
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,080
and ask him to come back to make it clear.

244
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,240
But I can't let you go.

245
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
Brother, you're thinking too much.

246
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,840
You don't have to worry about me.

247
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,160
How can I not worry about you?

248
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
If anything happens to you,

249
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,960
how can I explain to Father and Mother?

250
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,040
Father and Mother brought you back home.

251
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,440
I treated you like my own sister.

252
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Of course.

253
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,160
Sometimes, I don't treat you like my own sister.

254
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
Brother,

255
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,760
why are you saying this all of a sudden?

256
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,960
I know

257
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,840
that you've always

258
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,440
admired Brother.

259
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,960
I only have a brother and sister relationship with him.

260
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,040
Of course,

261
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
I treat him the same.

262
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
I know that

263
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,120
Brother made you feel wronged that day.

264
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,120
Don't mention the past.

265
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,720
I'm from the Xiao family.

266
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,320
I had to suffer the Xiao family's misfortune.

267
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,920
Now,

268
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
there are only the few of us in the Xiao family.

269
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,720
So no matter what,

270
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,120
you'll always be my brother.

271
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Episode 16

272
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
What's going on?

273
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,920
I heard that the thief came from the town.

274
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,320
If I meet him, I'll definitely catch him.

275
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,320
The eldest son of the Xiao family is so cunning.

276
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,520
Who is this man in black?

277
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,320
He made me a son of a bitch.

278
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
I have to find out who he is

279
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,120
to make it clear.

280
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Xiao Yi.

281
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Yi Ren.

282
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,000
Why are you here?

283
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,600
I've been looking for you along the way.

284
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
I finally found you.

285
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Yi Ren,

286
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
come back with me, okay?

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Let's go back and tell everyone about it.

288
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
No.

289
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
I won't go back

290
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
if I can't find the person who framed me.

291
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
You're not leaving, okay?

292
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
I'll go with you.

293
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I finally found you.

294
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
I don't know when I'll find you again

295
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
after you leave.

296
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Why are you looking for me now?

297
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,600
I'm not who I used to be.

298
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,320
Everyone thinks that

299
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,400
I colluded with the North Emperor

300
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
and am a traitor in the martial arts world.

301
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,040
I'm like a mouse crossing the street

302
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,200
and fighting with people.

303
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
I don't care.

304
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,120
I don't care what happened.

305
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,200
I don't want to hear anyone say anything.

306
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
I only care about you.

307
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,920
The smell of fish is so fragrant.

308
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,800
The martial arts world is in chaos now.

309
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,520
Even the Deng family who never left

310
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,720
was destroyed by the power gang.

311
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
We're all here.

312
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
You know what?

313
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,360
The old man who was one of the three Qimen,

314
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,000
suddenly announced that

315
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,720
he would wash his hands after three days.

316
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Wash his hands?

317
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Yes.

318
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,320
I'll go back to the martial arts world

319
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,920
and wash my hands.

320
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,720
I won't care about any martial arts world anymore.

321
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,120
I'll be here for a year

322
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,920
and I'll be back to Manjing.

323
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,320
I have to change my mind as soon as possible.

324
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,720
Take the medicine.

325
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
The treasure brought back from South Heaven

326
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,320
has been cleared.

327
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
As you said,

328
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
90% of the treasure

329
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,520
has been replaced with food and clothes.

330
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
The rest

331
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,720
will be sent to all the sects

332
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,920
and the dead people's furniture.

333
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
The things

334
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,520
are all packed on the boat.

335
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,320
We can leave tomorrow.

336
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Okay.

337
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,520
I'll go to the martial arts world tomorrow.

338
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,120
I don't want you to go.

339
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Rong.

340
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
You're playing with the kids' temper again.

341
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,720
Every time you come back from the palace,

342
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,320
your health will get worse.

343
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,320
Don't think I don't know what happened.

344
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,320
He just wants to control you

345
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,320
and torture you.

346
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,520
But for what we want to do,

347
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,920
I can bear it.

348
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,720
When will you be able to bear it?

349
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
I'll be back.

350
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,120
In that case,

351
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Rong,

352
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
why don't you let me

353
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,520
finish my own business?

354
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,120
As long as he gets what he wants,

355
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,320
it won't be a difficult case.

356
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,520
A person's curiosity is a bottomless pit.

357
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,520
It's not a matter of life and death.

358
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,320
Even so,

359
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,120
what's the point?

360
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,720
What I do

361
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,920
is only for what I think in my heart.

362
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,120
As long as the country is at peace,

363
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,120
I don't care about anything else.

364
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,520
Come.

365
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,120
But you don't even care about your own life?

366
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,520
You're in love this time.

367
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I'm afraid it'll be dangerous.

368
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Let me go with you.

369
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Don't worry.

370
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,120
As long as the court

371
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,720
needs me,

372
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
they must let me live.

373
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,320
Rong, don't worry.

374
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,720
I'll be back

375
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,720
safely this time.

376
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,120
Drink the medicine first.

377
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
You're here to attend

378
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
the young master's ceremony.

379
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Do you need a invitation?

380
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
The Demon Lord has entrusted me with the order

381
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,120
of the two kings of Danxia.

382
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
Send a letter to the Fei family.

383
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,120
Please inform the jade king.

384
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Young Master, wait a moment.

385
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
Young Master, you can't enter without an invitation.

386
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,320
I'd like to see

387
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,120
what other plans you have.

388
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Young Master,

389
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,120
I'm here to see you.

390
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Please come in.

391
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,320
Thank you, Young Master Xiao.

392
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,520
I've known about the investigation of the two kings.

393
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
You came all the way here

394
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,320
to stay and rest for a few days.

395
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Thank you, Senior.

396
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,120
I have a favor to ask of you.

397
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm a disciple of the Taoism of Jianghu.

398
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,320
I should help you.

399
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,720
May I ask

400
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,920
if you've learned a martial art called

401
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,120
the Uncanny Counter?

402
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
So,

403
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,920
you're here for the Uncanny Counter.

404
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,320
This kind of martial art is dangerous

405
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,920
and should be cut off long ago.

406
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Please tell me that I can't teach you.

407
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
You misunderstood me.

408
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,520
I didn't learn it.

409
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,320
I just want to ask you to use the Uncanny Counter

410
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,520
to verify my parents' death.

411
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,120
Your parents?

412
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,120
This is Xiao Xilong.

413
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,120
I'm Sun Huishan's father.

414
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,120
I'm Xiao Qiushui.

415
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
I heard that

416
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,320
you're friends with Deng Qingfeng's son, Deng Yuhan.

417
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,120
Are you trying to find out the truth

418
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
and kill the whole Deng family?

419
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,520
I'm not.

420
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,920
Deng Yuhan is my sworn brother.

421
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,320
How could I

422
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,920
kill them?

423
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,320
Someone must have framed me.

424
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
If you're so suspicious,

425
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,520
you've set a trap.

426
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,320
How can I trust you?

427
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,920
You can't trust me.

428
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,920
If I'm a dangerous person,

429
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,120
how can the two heroes

430
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,720
entrust me with this task?

431
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,920
You're right.

432
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,320
The two heroes are good at martial arts.

433
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,920
You can't steal them.

434
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,920
Forget it.

435
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,120
Tomorrow is the day I give the ceremony.

436
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,920
It's also the day I wash my hands.

437
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,720
I don't want to be a stranger.

438
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,120
After tomorrow,

439
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,120
I'll take off this burden

440
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,120
and give a speech.

441
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Thank you.

442
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,120
While everyone is gathering,

443
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,120
you can search for them.

444
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,120
I don't believe the noodles are ruined.

445
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,920
Yes.

446
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Senior Fei.

447
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Today is the day my grandson becomes the official official.

448
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,320
It's also the day my family

449
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,520
makes up their mind to wash hands.

450
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
It's the day I quit the martial arts world.

451
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,920
From now on,

452
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,520
my grandchildren

453
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,520
can only follow the rules of the world

454
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,520
and don't care about the world.

455
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,920
Don't care about the world?

456
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,920
Don't care about the world?

457
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,320
Fengqing has always been

458
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,720
a stubborn boy.

459
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,520
He only likes the culture of the world.

460
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,320
He's the best fit for the family.

461
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,520
But you're all

462
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,320
close to my family.

463
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,520
You have your grudges and grudges.

464
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Today, I invite you to

465
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,120
have a fight.

466
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,720
What's going on?

467
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,120
What's going on?

468
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,120
Can't we just let it go?

469
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Stop it.

470
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Why are you so cold?

471
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Let it go.

472
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,120
This is the only chance today.

473
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,120
It's so regrettable.

474
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,920
I'll take the responsibility.

475
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,520
My grandchildren can't wait to be in the dark.

476
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Old man.

477
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,120
Your son Fei Danfeng

478
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,720
cut off my brother's arm.

479
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,720
Since you want to make up for your grudges,

480
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,720
you should make up for it

481
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,120
with some money.

482
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,520
Yes.

483
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,520
Old man.

484
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,120
Hand over the thousand-men noodles.

485
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Yes.

486
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,120
Hand it over.

487
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,520
Hand it over.

488
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,520
Hand it over.

489
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Hand it over.

490
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Grandpa.

491
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,120
What should we do?

492
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,120
You all want the thousand-men noodles.

493
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,320
I can only tell you where it is.

494
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,520
Five years ago,

495
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,920
my eldest son Danfeng

496
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,520
carried that thing to carry out the holy will.

497
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,320
But he was killed by a cruel man.

498
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,320
His body is still unknown.

499
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,320
That thing was also destroyed that night.

500
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,120
Only one left was burned.

501
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,920
I buried it in the tomb.

502
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,920
You...

503
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
How is that possible?

504
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,520
I can't tell you.

505
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Yeah.

506
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
You must hand it over.

507
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,720
How could it be burned?

508
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,720
In order to keep our family from suffering,

509
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,720
I made a death wish.

510
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,320
If anyone in our family

511
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,920
dares to steal the thousand-men noodles,

512
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
I'll cut off his martial arts

513
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,320
and kick him out of the family.

514
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Really?

515
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,520
Really?

516
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
No way.

517
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
He really did it?

518
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
What's going on?

519
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,320
So many people are here.

520
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,320
You're still lying here.

521
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,320
Hand over the thousand-men noodles.

522
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
We won't let you do that.

523
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
You two are a family of traitors.

524
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,520
You broke family rules.

525
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,320
You stole the thousand-men noodles.

526
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,720
You're not responsible for your actions.

527
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,320
You were kicked out of the family long ago.

528
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,120
You still have the nerve to stand here and show your hatred.

529
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,720
If you had told us about this secret,

530
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,120
we wouldn't have killed so many people.

531
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,920
I've told you many times.

532
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
I don't have that thing.

533
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,320
You two, get out of here.

534
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,920
I didn't expect that.

535
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,720
What's the golden hand

536
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,520
for hiding this thing?

537
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,120
Why don't we destroy it and prove it together?

538
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,920
Yes.

539
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,720
Hand it over.

540
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,520
Hand it over.

541
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Hand it over.

542
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,720
Hand it over.

543
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,720
Hand it over.

544
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,720
Hand it over.

545
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,720
Hand it over.

546
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,720
Hand it over.

547
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,720
Hand it over.

548
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,720
Hand it over.

549
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,720
Hand it over.

550
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,520
I lost the promotion of the martial arts business.

551
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,920
I've withdrawn from the martial arts world.

552
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,600
Yet you still fake it.

553
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,320
Fine.

554
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,680
Even if I break rules about washing hands今天

555
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,920
我们也不死不休 Such that we die and live without failing.

556
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,240
Hey.

557
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,520
Who will let me go to terms with it?

558
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,260
Two disciples from the stars.

559
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,620
It's possible that...

560
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Dad!

561
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
What's going on?

562
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
What's going on?

563
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
What's going on?

564
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
What's going on?

565
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
What's going on?

566
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
You're an outsider.

567
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Why are you interfering in our family affairs?

568
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,720
What I hate the most is bullying the elderly and children.

569
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,720
I have to take care of this matter today.

570
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Xiao Qiu Shui!

571
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
You're not qualified to be a member of our family.

572
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Your brother colluded with the North Wilderness.

573
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
As the criminal, how can you interfere in our family affairs?

574
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

575
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
You just killed Deng Jiang.

576
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
How dare you come here to commit suicide?

577
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
If you dare to do it,

578
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
we'll let you suffer.

579
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
You're right!

580
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
You're right!

581
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Let go of us!

582
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
Let go of us!

583
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Let go of us!

584
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Let go of us!

585
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Let go of us!

586
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Let go of us!

587
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Let go of us!

588
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Let go of us!

589
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
I have something to ask Mr. Fei.

590
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
So I have to protect him.

591
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
Well, everyone.

592
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Let's make a bet.

593
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
If you win,

594
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,720
I won't interfere in this matter anymore.

595
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,720
What if we don't bet?

596
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Then we can only bet our lives.

597
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
What?

598
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,720
What are you waiting for?

599
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Everyone.

600
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,720
If someone pulls out the sword from the stone,

601
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
I won't ask about the Fei family.

602
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
If you can't pull it out,

603
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,720
you can't make it difficult for the Fei family's descendants.

604
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
You two have to put the antidote in.

605
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Brother.

606
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Don't admit it.

607
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
He's very strong.

608
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Be careful.

609
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
It's just a sword.

610
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Why don't you try it?

611
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Okay.

612
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
We'll accept it.

613
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,720
If this matter is known to the world,

614
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
we can't let it go.

615
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
My two daughters,

616
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Qin Tian, who has been training for a long time,

617
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
and Hua Hu, who has been training for another year,

618
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
are all weak.

619
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
What if they really win?

620
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
No.

621
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
I'm not afraid.

622
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Little Qiu Shui.

623
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
You didn't say

624
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
you wouldn't allow us to pull it together.

625
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
I mean,

626
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
the sword is pulled out of the stone.

627
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
There's no stone.

628
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,720
Yes.

629
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
The stone is still on top.

630
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Yes.

631
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
It's not easy to be crushed

632
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
when you're smaller.

633
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
With your internal strength,

634
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
you can't pull it out at all.

635
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Now,

636
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
can you admit defeat?

637
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
I admit it.

638
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Take the antidote.

639
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Grandpa.

640
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
The bet is made.

641
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,720
You can't make it difficult for us anymore.

642
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Please make yourself at home.

643
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Come on.

644
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Let's go.

645
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,720
It's a pity that we can't meet him.

646
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
We've been forcing him.

647
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
He still said no.

648
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
It should be true.

649
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Let's go.

650
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Master.

651
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Master.

652
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
Master.

653
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Su Mu.

654
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
Su Mu has been run away.

655
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Okay.

656
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Su Mu.

657
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Su Mu.

658
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Su Mu.

659
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Su Mu.

660
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
Su Mu.

661
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Su Mu.

662
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Su Mu.

663
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Su Mu.

664
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Su Mu.

665
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Su Mu.

666
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Su Mu.

667
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Su Mu.

668
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Su Mu.

669
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Su Mu.

670
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Su Mu.

671
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
Su Mu.

672
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Su Mu.

673
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
Su Mu.

674
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Su Mu.

675
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
Su Mu.

676
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Su Mu.

677
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Su Mu.

678
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
Su Mu.

679
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
Su Mu.

680
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Su Mu.

681
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Su Mu.

682
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Su Mu.

683
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Su Mu.

684
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Su Mu.

685
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
I'm sorry.

686
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,720
I'm sorry.

687
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
I'm sorry.

689
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
I'm sorry.

690
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
I'm sorry.

691
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
I'm sorry.

692
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
I'm sorry.

693
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
I'm sorry.

694
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
I'm sorry.

695
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
I'm sorry.

696
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,720
I'm sorry.

699
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
I'm sorry.

700
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
I'm sorry.

701
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,720
I'm sorry.

703
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
I'm sorry.

704
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
I'm sorry.

705
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
I'm sorry.

708
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
I'm sorry.

714
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720

722
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720

I'm sorry.

728
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720

729
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I'm sorry.

730
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
I'm sorry.

731
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
I'm sorry.

732
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,720
I'm sorry.

733
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
I'm sorry.

734
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
I'm sorry.

735
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
I'm sorry.

736
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
I'm sorry.

737
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720

738
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720

I'm sorry.

747
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
I'm sorry.

749
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,720
I'm sorry.

750
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm sorry.

751
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
I'm sorry.

752
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
I'm sorry.

753
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
I'm sorry.

754
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
I'm sorry.

755
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I'm sorry.

756
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
I'm sorry.

757
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,720
I'm sorry.

758
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
