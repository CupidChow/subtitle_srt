1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,040
Let the blood flow in the rain

2
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,840
The sword has never been changed

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
For thousands of years, I have been open

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,600
I want to wait for you to come

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh, the wind is so strong

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, the waves are so strong

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Oh, break through the distance of light

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Let this city and the chaos create a new sea of mountains

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,600
When the light comes, the love will be over

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
At the end of the dark night, the sword in the night

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I can only count to 100

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Let this big land be filled with blood

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
The sword has never been changed

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,600
For thousands of years, I have been open

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I want to wait for you to come

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
The story is always like a dream

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
It's almost over

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
I tried my best, but I have no regrets

19
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Miss

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Take it away

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
What's going on?

22
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Leave

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Yes

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
How can I be unhappy on a happy day?

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Miss

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Miss

27
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Miss

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Miss

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Miss

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Miss

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Miss

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Miss

33
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Miss

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Miss

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Miss

36
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Miss

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Miss

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
It's just a pity

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Dian Dian and brother can't see

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,600
But it's okay

41
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,600
After we are done

42
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
to knock down the gate.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,880
Right?

44
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
By the way,

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,280
can you give Qiu Shui a surprise?

46
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
I've said it before.

47
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,680
My husband

48
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,840
must be a hero of the Martial Arts Society.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,640
This is

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,320
the Hero's Order of the Martial Arts Society.

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,880
I'll give it to you today.

52
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,200
In the future,

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,880
we can

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,400
rule the martial arts society together.

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,400
Second Brother,

56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,880
I was a single woman.

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
I was lucky to have been raised by the Xiao family.

58
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,960
I learned medical skills

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
and traveled the world.

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,600
I've long wanted to

61
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,400
help more people.

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,160
Instead of looking for a husband

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
and a wife to teach my son,

64
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
I've spent my whole life.

65
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,600
But

66
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,200
it's all in the past.

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,160
I've figured it out now.

68
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,240
People

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,080
should look ahead.

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
There's no need to be obsessed

71
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
with useless things.

72
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,560
You're tired.

73
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,480
In fact, as long as you change your mind,

74
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,240
in the future, whether you want to save people

75
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,240
or walk the martial arts world,

76
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,920
it's not a big deal

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
to show off your talents.

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,040
It's not just a big deal.

79
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,320
You poisoned me.

80
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,640
Son.

81
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,400
Sir.

82
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,400
Is it the same person?

83
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,160
Hey!

84
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,320
That's right!

85
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,960
Hi.

86
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Father.

87
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,320
It looked like

88
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,600
a slip of the cake.

89
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,440
I was watching a Congress electionà

90
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
thanks to the videojis.

91
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,640
Let's see who성이 more intelligent to appear in the final round.

92
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
If that's the case,

93
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,360
the glory of the Xiao family.

94
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,260
Wu Senior,

95
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,920
I ended things.

96
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,800
We really ended up cheminpering to here.

97
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:29,840
Put up the

98
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,040
You're finally here.

99
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,640
Come on.

100
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,880
Sit.

101
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,160
Sit.

102
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Xiao Kuan Ye.

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,360
Where is your sister?

104
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't worry.

105
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,360
Today is the day

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,920
I and Xu Yu got married.

107
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
I haven't had a drink with you for a long time.

108
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,680
Come on.

109
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,120
Let's have a good time

110
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,280
with me.

111
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,280
What?

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm afraid it's poisonous.

113
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Don't worry.

114
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,920
I won't kill you now.

115
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
So many days,

116
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,920
I've been looking for you.

117
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
We can't find

118
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
where Xu Yu is.

119
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,000
You put her in here

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,360
and forced her to get married.

121
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't drink this.

122
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,560
You don't deserve it.

123
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,720
Look, whether you cut contra nations

124
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,080
or make cabbages?

125
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,920
Have you forgotten

126
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
who always held

127
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,220
you 요 with

128
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,820
The one who protects you the most is Xue Yu Jie.

129
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,100
I heard...

130
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,340
What did I hear?

131
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,300
The one who protects you the most is me.

132
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,820
You said that

133
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,980
the one who protects you the most is me.

134
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,940
If that's the case,

135
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,420
I'll fight with you.

136
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,620
You can count the Xiao family's accounts.

137
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,020
From childhood to...

138
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,460
From childhood to...

139
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,780
You want to have the main character's soul since you were born.

140
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,300
A person like me

141
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,820
will never have any success in my life.

142
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,580
Just let me

143
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,060
live a peaceful life

144
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,580
for the rest of my life.

145
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm angry at you and my brother.

146
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,460
But where's Xiao Yi Yuan?

147
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
He just killed himself.

148
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,700
He doesn't have any way to be a leader.

149
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,980
Besides causing trouble,

150
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,460
how can you be a little better than me?

151
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Let me tell you.

152
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,700
Today,

153
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,100
the martial arts

154
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
and the world

155
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,060
are all for me.

156
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,260
I can get whatever I want.

157
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,320
Since I had estan Violet God Reminder

158
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,380
on the day of coming that day.

159
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,320
I don't think

160
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,020
even an Details Measuring Stone

161
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:12,940
can help me ticket

162
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,620
the Bailu moments in advance.

163
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,300
Sister.

164
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,220
Sister.

165
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Sister.

166
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,220
I'm Qiu Shui.

167
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
Don't be like me, sister.

168
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,220
How many nights and nights have passed since I met you?

169
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,220
The tears fall and the wind is not moving.

170
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,220
The grey clouds are like dust.

171
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,220
Xiao Shiyu.

172
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,220
I'm not mature enough.

173
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,220
Why did you die?

174
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Little Qiu Shui.

175
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Do you want me to die now?

176
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
I was in a happy life.

177
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,220
He just wanted to kill me.

178
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,220
Why do I have to work hard every time to get what I want?

179
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Sister.

180
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
I'll take you home.

181
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,220
The flowers fall and the stars follow me.

182
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
I just wanted to give him a chance.

183
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,220
But he chose to betray me.

184
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,220
I'll destroy everything you care about.

185
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,220
Your sister is dead.

186
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Are you still trying to seduce me?

187
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Kill me.

188
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Kill me.

189
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Kill me.

190
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
You can't find General Wu.

191
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
Little Qiu Shui.

192
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,220
A coward.

193
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
He's a coward.

194
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,220
I'll kill you.

195
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,220
Kill me.

196
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,220
I don't want to kill you.

197
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
If I kill you,

198
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
I will kill you.

199
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,420
Who else can see me rule the world?

200
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,220
I will let you live.

201
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,380
I will let you die.

202
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,660
It's so interesting.

203
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,620
You are so generous.

204
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
The King of the Deceased

205
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,660
If it comes to light,

206
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,260
are you three

207
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,780
a good match?

208
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,740
I'm tired of hearing that.

209
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,060
But today, you say it.

210
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,980
Then I won't be modest.

211
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,500
What a pity.

212
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,540
If the inner power and swordsmanship

213
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,660
are no match for us in the Western Realm,

214
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,300
you don't purpose to

215
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,020
be here this time.

216
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,260
カレブルがいる?

217
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,460
It's pretence.

218
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,460
If not for the

219
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,060
General Wu,

220
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,220
Wu Jie can't come back

221
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,660
and keep the order.

222
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,700
Even if we let him go now,

223
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,940
we can't stop the plan of the Northern Wilderness.

224
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,500
You three are known as the Wulin Chess Club.

225
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
But in my opinion,

226
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,260
you are just greedy and rich.

227
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Otherwise,

228
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,620
why would you be fired by Xiao Kaiyan?

229
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,620
Good, Yan Kuangtu.

230
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,380
You are known as the wildest man in the West Wulin.

231
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Today,

232
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,340
we want to have a good talk.

233
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
Talk?

234
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
How?

235
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,340
You think you can take over the Western Kingdom?

236
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,100
Today, I, Yan Kuangtu, will show you

237
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,900
the real power of the Western Wulin.

238
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Master Yan,

239
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,780
I underestimated you.

240
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,660
I wanted to spare your life for Xue Yu's sake.

241
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,220
But now, I can't.

242
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,420
Where is General Wu?

243
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,580
It doesn't matter anymore.

244
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Master Yan,

245
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,340
I will use your martial arts

246
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,860
to make you laugh.

247
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,180
Is this the power of the wildest man in the Wulin?

248
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
Good.

249
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,820
Master Yan,

250
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,380
thank you for your gift.

251
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,180
You are a rat who only knows how to take things.

252
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,900
You want to put us in the water.

253
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,060
You can't do it.

254
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
You can't.

255
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
You can't.

256
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
You can't.

257
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
You can't.

258
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
You can't.

259
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
You can't.

260
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
You can't.

261
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,060
You can't.

262
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,100
You can't.

263
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,540
Let me ask you,

264
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,740
What do you live for?

265
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,020
When one steps forward toarts a path,

266
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,860
One Associates can find an Mouse,

267
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,500
One only tries to Mundia sichuan busted mortal.

268
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,000
It's a

269
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,400
Potential world,

270
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,660
했어-per Maker

271
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,300
it's someone who would

272
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,420
Legend has for movies and dramas

273
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,420
I will never forget this life.

274
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Never forget this life?

275
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,060
Never forget this life.

276
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,220
Qiu Shui,

277
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,860
I'll leave the rest to you.

278
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
I'll leave the rest to you.

279
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,240
Revival ofued

280
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,660
beefy lift down spirits

281
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,620
announced her

282
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,100
that she walked through salt water

283
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
I wrote it on the corner of my clothes

284
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
so that I can see it.

285
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Brother, sister,

286
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,100
you take care of your parents for me.

287
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
I'll come to you

288
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
when I'm done with you.

289
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,100
I'll come to you when I'm done with you.

290
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
No!

291
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,100
No one in this world

292
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
has the right

293
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
to force you to do

294
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
what you don't want to do.

295
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,100
This is what

296
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
all the people who love you

297
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
and care about you

298
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
really want.

299
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Father, I'm tired.

300
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
This is too hard.

301
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
I really can't learn it.

302
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
It's hard to learn swordsmanship.

303
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I've never seen it

304
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,100
difficult when you were practicing swordsmanship.

305
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
How can it be the same?

306
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Swordsmanship is something

307
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
engraved in the bones of the Xiaojian people.

308
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
How can I not be tired?

309
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,100
Second, you try it.

310
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Father, what does it say?

311
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
I can't understand it.

312
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
I can't understand it.

313
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
What does it say?

314
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
I can't understand it.

315
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
You practice swordsmanship

316
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
and practice swordsmanship.

317
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,100
It's not easy to learn it.

318
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
Good.

319
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Fortunately, the Xiao family has Third.

320
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,100
You have a good heart, so you can practice.

321
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
This song is called

322
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,100
The World Has Blood.

323
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,100
The temple is empty and the heart is deep.

324
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Third, practice it well.

325
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
I didn't expect that

326
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
Jiang's brother would put the Heaven Book

327
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
in the sword

328
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
to protect the people

329
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,100
and hide it in the sword

330
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
of the Qing Bu Yin Law.

331
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
The golden sword in the Heaven Book

332
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
grows with the Yin Law

333
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,100
and the heart is deep.

334
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
But my father told me

335
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
that if you love the world,

336
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,100
you will always be with the people.

337
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
So this world

338
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,100
is the foundation of the world

339
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
if you gather together.

340
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
If you want to be happy,

341
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
you can die without regret.

342
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
But what you want is

343
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
to live your life.

344
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Let's sing and dance

345
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
in the sea of stars

346
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,100
until the light turns into love.

347
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
We will fight until the end

348
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
and fight until the end.

349
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Even if we forget the past,

350
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,100
let's make the world

351
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
full of blood and dust.

352
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,100
We will never change in our lives.

353
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I will be a mountain

354
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
after a thousand years.

355
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
I will wait for you

356
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:03,100
until the day the sun rises.

357
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
I will avenge the dead.

358
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,100
They are all people of the Life Stone.

359
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Let's cross the abyss of the sky

360
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,100
and let's make the world full of blood and dust.

361
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
In the Heaven Book,

362
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,100
there are five rules of the skill,

363
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
which are

364
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
the sign of heaven,

365
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
the earth,

366
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
the king,

367
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,100
and the four senses.

368
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
The four limbs,

369
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
the heart,

370
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
the eyes,

371
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,260
The water is salty.

372
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
The fire is salty.

373
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,660
The fire is salty.

374
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
The sun is bright.

375
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
The moon is bright.

376
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,260
The wind is cold.

377
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
The clouds are bright.

378
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
The fire is bright.

379
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,020
The punchienne!

380
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
No love.

381
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,460
It turns out

382
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Your Majesty.

383
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
You may leave.

384
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,900
Chen Zhou, hurry up.

385
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,300
No need to be so polite. Come here.

386
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
Drink with me.

387
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
Come on.

388
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,300
Chen Zhou, please.

389
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,700
This Immortal-ghost Temple...

390
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,700
We are here to have fun.

391
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,300
We won't talk about anything else.

392
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,300
We'll just drink.

393
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,900
Chen Zhou, drink with me.

394
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Come on.

395
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Chen Zhou,

396
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,900
do you know that the wine

397
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
is from the Northern Wilderness?

398
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,900
If we can stop the war and make peace,

399
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,900
I think the food and wine

400
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,700
will be incessant.

401
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Stop the war and make peace?

402
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,900
Your Majesty, you don't know, do you?

403
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,300
The Northern Wilderness Iron Banner

404
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,500
is a sacred temple.

405
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,700
If it fails,

406
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
the Western Qi will be in chaos.

407
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
No one can protect it.

408
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,100
The country will be in danger.

409
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Your Majesty,

410
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,500
who is responsible for this?

411
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
Chen Zhou,

412
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
why do you say that?

413
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,900
Aren't we talking about peace now?

414
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,700
Why are you talking about the war?

415
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Is there anyone who wants to take advantage of

416
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,500
the war between the Western Qi and the Northern Kingdom

417
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
to enter the city and fight against the evil?

418
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,500
I know that

419
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
there have been rumors

420
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,340
that I have been

421
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,700
trying to conquer the Central Plains

422
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,500
without any intention.

423
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,700
But do you know that the Western Qi is weak?

424
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,300
The stronger it is, the weaker it is.

425
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
The people don't understand me.

426
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,700
Chen Zhou, don't you understand me?

427
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,700
I did all this

428
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,300
for the sake of the Western Qi's country and the country.

429
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,500
The country and the country?

430
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
Have you really considered

431
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,300
the people of the Western Qi?

432
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,100
If we can negotiate,

433
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,700
how can we have such a situation now?

434
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,100
Who will benefit from

435
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
the war?

436
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,100
And Wu Jie

437
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,100
refused to go back to the capital.

438
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,580
His army is constantly

439
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,900
on the front line.

440
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Could it be that

441
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,700
someone secretly

442
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,100
cooperates with the army

443
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,700
to make them so rebellious?

444
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,500
The soldiers fought on the battlefield

445
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,900
and killed countless people.

446
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,500
The general was killed by the evil

447
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,700
and his life was not yet saved.

448
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,700
Your Majesty,

449
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,300
you don't go to fight the enemy now,

450
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,100
but you are so suspicious of me,

451
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,700
and if this continues,

452
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,300
how can the Western Qi be defeated?

453
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,700
Li Chen Zhou, how dare you!

454
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
How dare you say such a big evil word!

455
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,500
The Taizong Kingdom will be settled soon.

456
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,300
The Taizong Kingdom is well-educated.

457
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,300
The ancient kings came to the four seas to conquer the capital.

458
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
The Gu's tribe is sealed, which is a dead end.

459
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
How can we punish the long-term

460
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,700
if we wrong the power of the Qiu's?

461
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,100
The show has been going on for a hundred years.

462
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,700
We are only missing

463
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,500
the court's opinion.

464
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,300
You really spoil my mood.

465
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,500
I wanted to drink with you.

466
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,700
Now it seems that

467
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
you don't want to.

468
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,500
I have a lot of state affairs to attend to.

469
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,500
I won't see you off.

470
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,300
I've had enough of this wine.

471
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
This cup of wine

472
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,900
is for the soldiers in the front line

473
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,300
and for those who died in the martial arts world.

474
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Grand comma Surrender

475
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Look carefully.

476
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,900
scribing on the very one side

477
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,300
with fake parabolic boca

478
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,500
looks for him very seriously.

479
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,820
to menu out all my orders.

480
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,860
Your Majesty, do you still remember

481
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,060
how the red moon

482
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,900
took Over Mount He to the Big North,

483
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,260
and Chen Zhou achieved his goal

484
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,300
by his own will?

485
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,660
Li Chen Zhou,

486
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,620
don't blame it on me.

487
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,900
This is the test option

488
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,020
which we use for the test.

489
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm not afraid of the wind and snow

490
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,500
I'm just a wanderer on the road

491
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
I don't know how many good times in the world

492
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Drunk and drunk, I'm drunk

493
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Wait!

494
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
I'm so drunk

495
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
I'm so drunk

496
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
I'm so drunk

497
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
I'm so drunk

498
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,500
I don't know how many good times in the world

499
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
I'm so drunk

500
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm so drunk

501
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
I'm so drunk

502
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
I'm so drunk

503
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I'm so drunk

504
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,500
I don't know how many good times in the world

505
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Drunk and drunk, I'm drunk

506
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Wait until the rain ends

507
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I just want to say it

508
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
I don't know how many good times in the world

509
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Rong'er.

510
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Why are you here?

511
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
I'm here to take you home.

512
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Chen Zhong.

513
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Chen Zhong.

514
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Chen Zhong.

515
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Wake up.

516
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,500
The road ahead is long and steep.

517
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,500
The past is left behind in the rain.

518
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,500
The first sight is a little different.

519
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
The earth is heavy.

520
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
The city is always the same.

521
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
The song of the rain is a little bit lonely.

522
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,500
The next one is in the heart.

523
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,500
The world is just a little bit of a play.

524
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
The time is fast.

525
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:38,500
The wind and rain are so long.

526
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,500
The world is just a little bit of a play.

527
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,500
The wine is drunk.

528
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
The wine is dried.

529
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,500
The government has completed all the evil because of trees.

530
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:15,460
The按 for the

531
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

532
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

533
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

534
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

535
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

536
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

537
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

538
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

539
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

540
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

541
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

544
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

545
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

546
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

547
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

548
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

549
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

550
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

551
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

552
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

553
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

554
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

555
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

556
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

557
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,460
I'll drink to my heart's content

558
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,460
I'll drink to my heart's content
