1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
I'll pass on all my power and skills to you.

2
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,440
Kill him for me!

3
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,760
Kid, I'll pass on my power to you too.

4
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,720
Let's see who's better at martial arts.

5
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,720
We'll pass on our power to you too.

6
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,880
Yes.

7
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,080
Senior!

8
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,120
Senior!

9
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,320
Don't alors me the honor.

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
opinions.

11
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,340
Qing Fei!

12
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,720
Qing...

13
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,520
How are you feeling

14
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,580
by the actions of Su Geng Ning?

15
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,000
Su Geng Ning?!

16
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,560
igraphik.

17
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,580
Su Geng Ning?!

18
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:40,960
What?

19
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,320
Su Geng Ning has no professor,

20
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,840
so I can't even insert those in my heart.

21
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,740
Come inside,

22
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,900
please adjust the bags.

23
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,040
What?

24
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Senior.

25
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Please.

26
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Little boy.

27
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Senior.

28
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,640
Please hold on for a while.

29
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I heard that

30
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,240
the Young Master of the Xiao family

31
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
had an affair with Shen Zhou.

32
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,440
You weren't meant to be friends with the Taoist.

33
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,040
But in the future,

34
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,840
you'll have to save the Lake of Life

35
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
and deal with the power gang.

36
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,840
It's all

37
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,040
your fault.

38
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
Little boy.

39
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
Do you remember?

40
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Yes.

41
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
I remember.

42
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
I remember.

43
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
May I ask you,

44
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,040
is this your sword wall?

45
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,640
So what?

46
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,640
Is the mark on it

47
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
left by you?

48
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,440
You know the mark?

49
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Tell me,

50
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,840
which sect does this belong to?

51
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
Senior.

52
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
If you don't know,

53
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,640
then where did you get

54
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,240
the sword wall?

55
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,840
I had a family.

56
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,640
I was out of town half a month ago.

57
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,240
When I saw my friend,

58
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,840
my friend was killed

59
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,840
by a snake.

60
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
A month ago,

61
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
he went out of town to steal the sword

62
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,240
and colluded with the foreign clans.

63
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
He found out that

64
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,640
the mark

65
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,440
is on the message.

66
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Who did this?

67
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Who did this?

68
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
I don't know.

69
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
This is the mysterious organization

70
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
hidden in the martial arts.

71
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,240
It seems to have colluded with the North Emperor.

72
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
I...

73
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm so useless.

74
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
I...

75
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
I'll kill you.

76
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,040
I didn't expect

77
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,440
to have a son

78
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
who is

79
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,440
as smart as the emperor.

80
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,040
For years,

81
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,040
we have been

82
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,240
the same kind of people.

83
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
And

84
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,440
we have the same disciple.

85
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,840
You three are on your own.

86
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,240
How can you leave me alone?

87
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
This is the same as

88
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,840
the world path.

89
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,840
The imperial circle is on fire.

90
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm so lonely.

91
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,500
Eight-tailed

92
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
are from different places,

93
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
but they are all poor.

94
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
They are all illiterate.

95
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
They are all illiterate.

96
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
But this martial art

97
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
is not good.

98
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
If you use it as a good thing,

99
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
you will be in trouble.

100
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
I hope you can stay in another world

101
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
and not be trapped by the foreign clans.

102
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
I hope you can stay in another world

103
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
and not be trapped by the foreign clans.

104
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
I hope you can stay in another world

105
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
and not be trapped by the foreign clans.

106
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,020
In the end,

107
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,540
your suffering

108
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,540
will becomeification of all of these

109
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,540
will becomeification of all of these

110
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
spoils.

111
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,820
What happened?

112
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
It's okay.

113
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,740
Even though I lost, I still have the honor.

114
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,340
Now, I have five friends who lost to me.

115
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
I want to be my opponent

116
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,740
on this golden top.

117
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Why don't you all just admit defeat?

118
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,740
You're not being cruel!

119
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,740
I, the leader of the Emei Sect,

120
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,740
will teach you how to help Madam Gao Zhao.

121
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,740
The power of the paper dust is so powerful.

122
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,940
But why has the Emei Sect been getting more and more disappointed these past years?

123
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,940
I heard that the paper dust is a very old weapon.

124
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,940
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

125
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

126
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

127
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

128
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

129
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

130
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

131
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

132
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

133
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,540
I'm afraid that if we fight for it, we'll be more and more painful.

134
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,840
Hyacinth mortata

135
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,880
Hyacinth mortata

136
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
How did this have such similarity?

137
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,140
Congratulations, Teacher!

138
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
Li Chen Zhou.

139
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,140
It's him.

140
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
He's a thief.

141
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,460
How can there be

142
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,940
someone who looks like him?

143
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
Li Chen Zhou!

144
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,340
What do you want...

145
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
Qian Jie Zhi.

146
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,460
It's his original body.

147
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Qian Jie Zhi.

148
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,820
It can control the heart.

149
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,780
If you want to live,

150
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,340
then live.

151
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,420
If you want to die,

152
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,220
then die.

153
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Everyone.

154
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Do you all

155
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,300
not want to forget the Heaven Book?

156
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,620
Let's go together.

157
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,700
There might not be a winner.

158
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
What I have

159
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,860
is the Immortal Elixir.

160
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,980
Whoever kills this demon first,

161
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,460
I, King of Heaven,

162
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,060
will reward him.

163
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,620
You all were ordered to marry me,

164
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,100
because you are not as strong as me.

165
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,980
If you get the Immortal Elixir,

166
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,380
you can break it.

167
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,540
I want to see

168
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,740
if you want to kill me

169
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,020
or take the Immortal Elixir to keep your life.

170
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,900
I...

171
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
I want to see

172
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,220
if you want to kill me

173
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,540
or take the Immortal Elixir to keep your life.

174
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
I...

175
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Yes.

176
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,060
I can't get the Xiao Jiang back.

177
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,100
I can't be controlled by Li Chen Zhou.

178
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,900
King of Heaven.

179
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Who is it?

180
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
Over there.

181
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,580
Qiu Shui.

182
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:22,980
Mine.

183
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,460
Give it to me.

184
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,020
Give it to me.

185
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,020
Give it to me.

186
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,460
Brother, be careful.

187
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,700
The Immortal Elixir is fake.

188
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,180
It's the poison

189
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
that Shao Liu Lie gave to King of Heaven.

190
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,420
What did you say?

191
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
Poison?

192
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,620
You do look a little like me.

193
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,260
This...

194
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,020
This is like a first-time encounter.

195
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,620
I'm very powerful.

196
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,300
Brother Qiu Shui is much more handsome than Li Chen Zhou.

197
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,340
Although we have the similar looks one after another,

198
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,140
we are totally different from one another.

199
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,080
It's supposed to beMIX.

200
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,060
I've caught it!

201
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,560
Give it to me.

202
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:34,960
Give it to me!

203
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
It's mine!

204
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,540
Give it to me!

205
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,180
Give it to me!

206
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,100
Shame on you.

207
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,420
Give it to me!

208
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,700
Poison!

209
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Come on, give it to me!

210
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,620
Poison!

211
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,340
It can kill!

212
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,500
We will get really poisoned!

213
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
We'll die!

214
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
We'll die!

215
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
We'll die!

216
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
It's better to tell the truth than to believe it.

217
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Only because the truth is worse than the lies.

218
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Now, it's the result of

219
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
fighting for our lives.

220
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I called everyone here

221
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
to bring you all together

222
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
to destroy the Power Gang.

223
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
But someone is so stupid

224
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
to steal the elixir.

225
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
He's so generous.

226
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Where's the King of Heaven?

227
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
The demon is in the fire!

228
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Qiu Shui,

229
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
how do you know that the elixir is fake?

230
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Does the young master of the Xiao family

231
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
not know the magic of the other emperor?

232
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
The real elixir of the Wu Ji

233
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
has been eaten by him.

234
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
The elixir is gone.

235
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
There's only one way for you to survive.

236
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Be careful, everyone!

237
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,500
The Qianjie paper is a very strong evil skill.

238
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
We came here to eliminate the demon.

239
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
How can we be fooled by him?

240
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
So despicable.

241
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Xiao Qiu Shui,

242
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
it's time to hand over the Hero's Manual.

243
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
The Hero's Manual

244
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,500
Li Chengcheng,

245
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
you've learned the secret door of the gang.

246
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Today,

247
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I'll avenge my parents

248
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
and the 127 people of Huaihua.

249
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
No!

250
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

251
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

252
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
The move is good,

253
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
but it's not hot enough.

254
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
The Shaolin Arts!

255
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Xiao Qiu Shui,

256
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
how can he know the martial arts of Shaolin and Wudang?

257
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

258
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
The Shaolin Arts!

259
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

260
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
The Shaolin Arts!

261
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
The Shaolin Arts!

262
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

263
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
The Shaolin Arts!

264
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
The Shaolin Arts!

265
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

266
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
The Shaolin Arts!

267
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
The Shaolin Arts!

268
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

269
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
The Shaolin Arts!

270
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
The Shaolin Arts!

271
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

272
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
The Shaolin Arts!

273
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
The Shaolin Arts!

274
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
The Taichi Swordplay of the Martial Arts!

275
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
The Shaolin Arts!

276
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
The Shaolin Arts!

277
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
The Shaolin Arts!

278
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Go!

279
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Oh my goodness!

280
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
There is no need for Li Qian Zhong to go with us!

281
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,980
calling me in silence?

282
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,620
Chen Zhou, the tuge is heavy.

283
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,500
You'd better put it on

284
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,540
I'm the most famous young man in the martial arts world.

285
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,540
You are one of them.

286
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,140
Today,

287
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,500
I won't kill you.

288
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,020
You won't kill me today.

289
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
Some other day,

290
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,620
it'll be the time for me to kill you.

291
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,300
What are you trying to say?

292
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,420
You ducked at your age.

293
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,220
Did you� Days patient

294
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,700
fish anduo by yourself

295
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,500
Okay,

296
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,580
I'll just wait.

297
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,980
Please ask me

298
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,300
what's going on.

299
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,700
in the

300
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,660
area?

301
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,300
Force it

302
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,300
into my Heroaron.

303
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,960
You live through hell two will never

304
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,540
die

305
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,400
See

306
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,660
Who is this

307
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
it's you

308
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
This is the map.

309
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,780
Yes.

310
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,660
In the past, the Northern Wilderness

311
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,700
attacked the capital in the south.

312
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,580
They wanted to transport the treasure and the military secret to the north.

313
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,780
But on the way,

314
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,580
they encountered General Wu's army.

315
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,260
In the chaos,

316
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,260
these treasures were accidentally scattered on the Southern Sky Road.

317
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,260
Nine years ago,

318
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,100
the Wilderness was accidentally trampled on by the Wilderness.

319
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,700
In the middle of it,

320
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,420
he found the treasure

321
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,300
and hid it.

322
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,020
So,

323
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,020
he engraved the treasure map

324
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,380
on the Hero's List.

325
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,260
So, the original intention of the Wilderness

326
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,580
is to let Old Madam Wu

327
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,300
tell General Wu

328
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,420
about the Wilderness.

329
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,060
That's right.

330
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,020
It's a pity that this matter is important and unimportant.

331
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,260
The one who is determined

332
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,300
would never think that the Hero's List is related to the Wilderness.

333
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,060
All right.

334
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,060
You all know about this matter.

335
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,580
Then come with me.

336
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,580
If you don't want to go,

337
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,340
you can die here.

338
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,260
Qiu Shui,

339
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,860
the treasures of the Western Regions are scattered on the mountain.

340
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,140
They are indeed from the imperial family.

341
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,420
But

342
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,940
the power gang can't be so narrow-minded.

343
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,980
I've already unsealed most of the people's bond.

344
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
The ones who stay

345
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,220
are useful people.

346
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,180
See you at the entrance of South Heaven

347
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,700
in three days.

348
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,140
I know that you want your parents' bodies.

349
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,700
When this matter is over,

350
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,700
I will definitely reward you.

351
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,780
Also,

352
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,420
your parents

353
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,900
are not killed by the power gang.

354
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,220
Believe it or not,

355
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,380
you will find the answer.

356
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
The head of the sect

357
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,900
is really making a fool of himself in front of the sects.

358
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,540
It's a pity that Second Brother Xiao isn't here.

359
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,300
If Brother Xiao sees this, he will be unhappy.

360
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,060
Enough.

361
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,980
If Second Brother Xiao is here,

362
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,260
he will also be punished by the Heaven-given Order.

363
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,540
Both of you

364
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,540
are not as good as my Brother Qiu Shui.

365
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,380
I'm sorry.

366
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,300
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,260
I'm sorry.

368
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,220
I'm sorry.

369
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
I'm sorry.

370
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,220
I'm sorry.

371
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,220
I'm sorry.

372
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,220
I'm sorry.

374
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm sorry.

375
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
I'm sorry.

376
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,220
Senior.

377
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,980
I didn't expect

378
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,500
Li Chen Zhou

379
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,380
to save the Heaven-given Order.

380
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,780
He almost got the Wulin Sect's technology to die with him.

381
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,220
I

382
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,380
failed to live up to the efforts of the seniors.

383
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,660
I failed to kill Li Chen Zhou.

384
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,660
You did a good job.

385
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,660
You have tried your best to save us all.

386
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
I just

387
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,540
saw the martial arts you used.

388
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,660
It's Iron Banner, Silver Banner,

389
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,300
Wooden Leaf, Flora,

390
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,300
Dong Xi, Er Jian,

391
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,460
and Broken Jade, Cang Jin.

392
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,340
Are these eight skills considered to be passed down?

393
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,540
Yes.

394
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,380
Now, the eight seniors

395
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,060
have already...

396
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,860
They have passed down

397
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,700
their last skills to you.

398
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,260
It means that they trust you very much.

399
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Senior.

400
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Qiushui.

401
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,860
In this world,

402
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,300
a new person is needed.

403
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,580
Use your own method

404
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,540
to make everyone believe

405
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,420
that the next life is a long one.

406
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,380
I'm already a non-human.

407
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
From now on,

408
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,740
it's all up to you.

409
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Okay.

410
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,820
Senior.

411
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,420
Don't say anything.

412
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,020
You'll be fine.

413
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,700
Please.

414
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,060
Qiushui.

415
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,900
In three days,

416
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,380
we're really going to the Southern Heaven.

417
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,460
That's all we can do now.

418
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,180
Now, many people are controlled by the Heaven Realm.

419
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,020
Besides, Li Zhenzhou said

420
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,260
that my parents' bodies are in his hands.

421
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
I still have to go there.

422
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,300
Chief, do you really believe him?

423
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
This uncle and aunt

424
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,940
are not killed by the power gang.

425
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,500
I don't believe anyone.

426
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,700
I must find

427
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,660
this answer myself.

428
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,860
What a pity!

429
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,300
He almost killed Li Zhenzhou today.

430
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,300
He actually had a chance

431
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,860
to kill me completely.

432
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,700
I thought

433
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,660
Liu Suifeng would take this position

434
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,100
and take the risk.

435
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,300
It's possible that

436
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
it's Er.

437
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,580
But he is Li Zhenzhou's trusted aide.

438
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,380
He will make the decision.

439
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,620
Does it mean that

440
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,500
Li Zhenzhou is Er?

441
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,020
Did he order Liu Suifeng to do this?

442
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,740
This time,

443
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,340
Zhao Ge sent some martial artists

444
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
to discuss the power gang.

445
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,700
But the one who is to blame

446
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,140
is Li Zhenzhou,

447
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,380
who is the one who forgot the Heaven Book.

448
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,780
The purpose of his doing this

449
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,140
must be to cause chaos.

450
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,500
You mean

451
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,340
that Er wanted to take this opportunity

452
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,460
to destroy the entire martial arts world?

453
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,020
Oh my god!

454
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,860
Brother.

455
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,780
What are you talking about?

456
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,180
What do you mean?

457
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,700
Sancai said that

458
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,300
the road ahead is slow.

459
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,300
I said that

460
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,900
Wu Bei only has to move forward.

461
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,380
We've been on the road,

462
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,500
haven't we?

463
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,340
That's right.

464
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,540
We've been on the road.

465
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,380
Let's go.

466
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,020
Okay.

467
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
Go, go, go.

468
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,700
Go, go.

469
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,580
Go, go, go.

470
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,900
Since Brother came back from the Golden Peak,

471
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,180
he's been depressed.

472
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,540
I've always heard

473
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,060
that there are rumors about Qiu Shui.

474
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
It's said that Qiu Shui has learned

475
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,660
the Heaven Book of Forgetting Love at the Golden Peak Conference.

476
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,500
That's outrageous.

477
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,940
It's nonsense.

478
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,740
Brother, don't be anxious.

479
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,380
In fact, Sancai has been

480
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,460
obedient to you since childhood.

481
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,980
But now,

482
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,860
he may have no chance.

483
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,580
Brother.

484
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,140
Our Xiao family is in a critical situation.

485
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,300
Now,

486
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,060
Qiu Shui has done something.

487
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Why don't we use him to rebuild the Xiao family?

488
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,980
He's a famous man now.

489
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,660
How can we hire him?

490
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,900
Maybe Qiu Shui has long wanted

491
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,580
to hand Changge over to Brother.

492
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,540
But he didn't do it

493
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,700
out of respect.

494
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,740
Brother Qiu.

495
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,340
Boss.

496
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,540
You're back.

497
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,020
How are you?

498
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,460
How's the thing you did?

499
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,900
We went to the Golden Peak

500
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,860
and pulled out

501
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,700
twelve small pieces along the way.

502
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,900
Twelve?

503
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,060
Brother Qiu Shui.

504
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,060
Everyone knows

505
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,940
what you did at the Golden Peak.

506
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,900
You're so great.

507
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,420
Boss.

508
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,180
Are you hiding something from us?

509
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,740
The martial arts you used at the Golden Peak

510
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,020
are not the illusion sword.

511
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,380
I'm not hiding anything from you.

512
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,460
But this experience

513
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,700
is too strange.

514
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,140
Strange?

515
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,820
Boss.

516
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,020
What's the strange thing?

517
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,380
Let's hear it.

518
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,620
Yeah.

519
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,860
Yeah.

520
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,020
You remember

521
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,220
the day at the Golden Peak

522
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,020
when eight masters

523
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,540
accidentally fell off the cliff.

524
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,140
When I chased after them,

525
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,740
I found them

526
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,180
dancing in the water.

527
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,620
Unexpectedly,

528
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,380
they passed on

529
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,500
the skills of the Bishun School

530
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,500
to me.

531
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,460
So,

532
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,580
you've gathered

533
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,540
the best martial arts

534
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,380
of the eight masters.

535
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,900
That's right.

536
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,860
Brother Qiu Shui

537
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,700
is getting more and more brilliant.

538
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,900
He's getting more and more brilliant.

539
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,940
He's really like a master.

540
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,940
That's a bit exaggerated.

541
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,700
All right.

542
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,540
Let's not talk about it.

543
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,100
Let's go back

544
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,420
and have a rest.

545
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,540
There are more important things

546
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,940
to do.

547
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,340
Boss, have a good rest.

548
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,780
Let's go.

549
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,380
Go.

550
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,260
Go.

551
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,540
Go.

552
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,660
Brother Qiu Shui.

553
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,700
Brother Qiu Shui.

554
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,620
You must be hungry.

555
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,700
I'll get you something to eat.

556
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,260
Fatty, where's the funeral room?

557
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,420
I'm calling you, Fatty.

558
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,020
Brother.

559
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,460
Brother.

560
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,180
Why are you here?

561
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:16,980
What?

562
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,980
Since Xue Yu's wedding,

563
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,700
have you planned to

564
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,980
never go back to the school?

565
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:24,980
No.

566
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,140
Have you?

567
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,820
You never mentioned

568
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,260
such an important thing

569
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,060
as the Hero Order.

570
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,700
If you ask me if I don't blame you,

571
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,180
it's obviously false.

572
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,700
But it's true.

573
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,460
The current situation is difficult.

574
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,860
You've grown up.

575
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,780
You have your own opinions.

576
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,220
It's normal.

577
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,620
I'm here today

578
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,900
to clear up the misunderstanding

579
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,580
between us.

580
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,820
If you're free tonight,

581
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,620
come to the villa with me.

582
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,860
It's good.

583
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,020
My brother is ill today.

584
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
He can't go.

585
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,260
He's much better now.

586
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,500
He wants to see you, too.

587
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,620
Okay.

588
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,700
Before the battle,

589
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,220
we should

590
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,020
have a good talk.

591
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,980
Brother,

592
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,380
I'll be here tonight.

593
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Greetings, Blue Flower Mask.

594
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,740
How about you?

595
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,140
Brother.

596
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,740
These are the resar I gave you.

597
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,340
Go on.

598
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,220
identify them.

599
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,340
Yes.

600
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,180
I'll".

601
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,940
This is

602
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,500
Xie Yu Bu'ou a girl's body.

603
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,940
This is the bamboo leaf from the backyard of our house.

604
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,700
I haven't drunk it for a long time.

605
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,220
I only brought a few pieces out.

606
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,140
I don't want to drink it.

607
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,500
I brought it for you

608
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,700
when you came.

609
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,540
I don't want to drink it.

610
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,340
I brought it for you

611
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,900
when you came.

612
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,020
By the way,

613
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,020
I found my mother's old stuff

614
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,780
when I was tidying up the house.

615
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,980
I made it myself.

616
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,340
There's your favorite tea flower inside.

617
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,940
Thanks, Jian'ai.

618
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:44,980
Thanks, Bro.

619
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,060
I know

620
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,540
you and I have misunderstood.

621
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,980
So I hope

622
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,820
today's problem

623
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,140
is flew still between us.

624
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,020
Bro,

625
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,940
we couldn't have done anything

626
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,460
for you without our help.

627
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,420
Will you be okay over it?

628
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,700
I really have the same thought.

629
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Come on.

630
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,700
It's been a long time.

631
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,700
Come on.

632
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
In that case,

633
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
I hope you can tell me honestly,

634
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,700
where did you get your inner power and skills?

635
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
That day, on the Golden Peak,

636
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
the eight masters passed them to me.

637
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Eight masters?

638
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,700
Third Brother,

639
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,700
you know them well.

640
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Why would they pass you their skills?

641
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,700
We are a family.

642
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,700
Just tell us the truth.

643
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,700
It's a bit strange.

644
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,700
There are always people who are not loyal to their elders.

645
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
They will do something extraordinary.

646
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Eldest Brother,

647
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Second Brother,

648
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,700
I don't have to make up a story

649
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
to deceive you.

650
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Now that the situation is critical,

651
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
I'll be straightforward.

652
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Third Brother,

653
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
did you learn the Heaven-forgetting Skill secretly?

654
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,700
I didn't.

655
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,700
I just learned it from the master.

656
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,700
I'm not sure if I can do it.

657
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
I'll try.

658
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700

659
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700

I'll try.

677
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,700
I'll try.

678
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700
I'll try.

679
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,700
I'll try.

680
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,700
