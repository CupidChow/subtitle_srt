1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let the rain fall on the snowy mountains

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The sword has never been changed

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
For thousands of years, I have been waiting

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Waiting for you to come

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The wind is not strong

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The waves are not strong

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will go to the end of the world

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let the city and the mountains be reborn

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let the sword be the sword of love

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let the peace be at the end of the world

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's not forget this day

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let the rain fall on the snowy mountains

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The sword has never been changed

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For thousands of years, I have been waiting

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Waiting for you to come

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:11,120
The veteran

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,000
Da Musk

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I heard that the mobile mathematical demon

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
is in the woods over there

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's look along the river

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,100
You're right

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,740
living in a cave like a mouse.

23
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,140
I don't know if it's true or not.

24
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,780
Brothers,

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,180
why do you insist

26
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,860
to join the Power Gang?

27
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,860
It's a miracle.

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,820
Who would dare to

29
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,940
hear the name of the Power Gang?

30
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,220
Maybe it's a bit shallow.

31
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,820
I think it's more profound.

32
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,820
First,

33
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,580
we want to make a name for ourselves.

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,260
We need to join them.

35
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,540
We need their fame.

36
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,220
Second,

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,780
we have our own strengths.

38
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,500
The Power Gang

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,100
needs talents like us.

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,500
I've even thought of a name.

41
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,340
The poison in my sleeve

42
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,340
is very effective

43
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,900
in preventing people from getting infected.

44
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,980
So I'll call it

45
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,420
Poisonous Demon.

46
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,460
Think of two names.

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,540
Awesome.

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,500
They say

49
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,940
the Power Gang is full of evil.

50
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,340
If you kill people and set fire to them,

51
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,780
and harm the innocent,

52
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,260
you'll do the same.

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,500
We've never thought of that.

54
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,260
We just want to make a name.

55
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,220
We never thought of doing bad things.

56
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,060
Well,

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,020
I'll go over there to check.

58
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,060
Don't get too excited.

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,460
Be careful.

60
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,300
Okay.

61
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,620
Yeah, we can't

62
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,740
harm the people.

63
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,860
Yeah.

64
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,940
We can't do that.

65
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,820
Young Master.

66
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,740
Young Master, help me.

67
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,580
Come on.

68
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,740
Help me.

69
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,820
Let me go.

70
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,500
Brother.

71
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,300
Brother.

72
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,300
Boss.

73
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,980
Zuo Qing, Yu Han.

74
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,820
Why are you here?

75
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,460
We want to go to Guang Ling to exchange flowers.

76
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,660
This is a must-do.

77
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,900
Brother.

78
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,940
I failed to get my family's reinforcements.

79
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,100
My father...

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,980
If I hadn't resisted,

81
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,500
I would have been

82
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,020
locked up at home.

83
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,300
I'm so sorry.

84
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,980
Don't say that.

85
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,180
You're

86
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,020
still here to stand by my side.

87
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,580
That's enough

88
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,180
to be my brother.

89
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,980
Boss.

90
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,780
We've heard about

91
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,900
the death of Feng Lang.

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,300
Don't be too sad.

93
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,580
We're all here.

94
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,700
Brother.

95
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,900
These are the Qu family's sisters.

96
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,540
Qu Mushuang and Qu Mi Miao.

97
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,700
Brother Qiu.

98
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,940
The Qu family is in a mess.

99
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,700
The whole world is talking about

100
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,860
you taking the Hero Order to Guang Ling.

101
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,180
They want to separate.

102
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,260
So they followed us here.

103
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,100
They said they'll go back to the Sword House

104
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,460
after meeting Brother Xiao.

105
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,940
That's good.

106
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,820
We can unite

107
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,820
and have more security.

108
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,500
That's right.

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,220
I hope you're fine.

110
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,260
Don't worry.

111
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,180
The Sword House is strong and strong.

112
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,500
The enemy can't attack us.

113
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,780
We just need to

114
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,860
get to the other side of the Xiao family.

115
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,060
By the way,

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,700
Tang Fang

117
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,500
has been captured by the Quanli Gang.

118
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,580
Miss Tang.

119
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,220
What?

120
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,220
That's the Guangling Empire.

121
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,580
It's where the King of Sword is.

122
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,220
Don't worry, Brother Qiu.

123
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,060
We're many.

124
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,060
We'll find him.

125
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,180
It's hard to say

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,220
if Guangling is big.

127
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,980
It's hard to find someone.

128
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,580
The King of Sword is the leader of the Quanli Gang.

129
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,140
It's hard to hide.

130
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,860
But Brother Qiu, have you heard

131
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,060
of the name of the great hero, Qu Hanshan?

132
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,940
Why don't you go to the outside world

133
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,900
and ask him for help?

134
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,820
Qu Hanshan?

135
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,380
Father said

136
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
the martial arts world

137
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,820
is the most fair place in the world.

138
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,580
It's the one-hundred-meter-long temple of Hero Qu

139
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,500
and the information desk of Hero Liang Dou.

140
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,740
Hero Qu won't stand by and do nothing.

141
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,020
I'll go and ask him

142
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,900
about the matter of Hero Qu.

143
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,300
If Hero Qu is willing to help,

144
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,460
I believe

145
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,220
we don't have to worry about saving people.

146
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,780
I think it's about half a day's journey

147
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,380
from Guangling to here.

148
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,660
We can't be late.

149
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,820
We have to split up.

150
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,140
And please

151
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,540
take this message

152
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,260
back to Guangling

153
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,620
and inform my brother.

154
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,060
It'll be faster if there are more people.

155
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,020
I think we can't wait

156
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
for the arrow to fall.

157
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,340
Let's set off now.

158
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,420
Brother, be careful.

159
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,100
Okay.

160
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,620
Be careful.

161
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,740
Let's go.

162
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,460
Take it away.

163
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,420
Hey, he's modified.

164
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,980
Stop it!

165
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,180
Kill him.

166
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,540
Xie Huai's

167
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,100
You go first.

168
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,180
Don't push, take it easy.

169
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,700
Why do you keep saying that?

170
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,660
How dare you kill me!

171
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,980
Why do you keep saying that!

172
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,540
Don't press it Ko.

173
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,060
I'll hit you to death

174
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,140
with this thing.

175
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,620
You go first.

176
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,700
How dare you!

177
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,620
Say it, yourself.

178
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,980
I will kill you!

179
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,440
My lord, please calm down.

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,740
Suddenly killed people?

181
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,300
Please forgive me.

182
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:30,780
Why you killed people so

183
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,760
You were adulterer

184
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,240
why you kill her under your door?

185
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
How can you tolerate that?

186
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,920
It's clearly a trap.

187
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,080
If you don't talk,

188
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,480
you can't be arrogant and domineering.

189
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,200
The

190
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
The

191
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
The

192
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
The

193
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
The

194
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
The

195
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
The

196
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
The

197
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Do you know why this place is called Yi Gong Lin?

198
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,200
It's the world's first palace.

199
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Anyone who comes here

200
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
who knows martial arts and doesn't know martial arts,

201
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
rich or not,

202
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
will be treated fairly.

203
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
I will never lose my honor

204
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
for anyone or anyone.

205
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
I'm tired.

206
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm tired.

207
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Chief Qin,

208
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
your disciple was murdered for no reason.

209
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
You should send the murderer

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
to the door to plead for forgiveness.

211
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Kill him and let him go.

212
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Chief Huo.

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Yes.

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm sure that your disciple

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
should be killed for no reason.

216
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
You can't let the murderer go to the door to plead for forgiveness.

217
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Otherwise, both parties will be

218
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
involved in a bloodbath and a murder.

219
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
By then,

220
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
if you two fight for your lives,

221
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
and hurt innocent people,

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I will definitely

223
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
kill innocent victims.

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Do you know the truth?

225
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
We all agree to it.

226
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Chief Qin, please help us.

227
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Good.

228
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
All martial arts schools should be

229
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
united and fight against injustice.

230
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
There are the North Wildlands

231
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
and the strong enemies of the North.

232
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
We should be united.

233
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Today, you two make an appointment again.

234
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
If you have any problems,

235
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
you should do it.

236
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Good.

237
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Master Qu is not the chief of the martial arts school.

238
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
We will follow your instructions.

239
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,200
We will follow your instructions.

240
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Master Qu.

241
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Master Qu.

242
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Master Qu.

243
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm Peng Zhi from the Huanhua Sword Sect.

244
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I have urgent matters to ask for your help.

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
It's easy to say.

246
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Master.

247
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I have urgent matters to discuss with this young man.

248
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Don't let anyone disturb me.

249
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes.

250
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Please.

251
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Young Hero Xiao, please.

252
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Young Hero Xiao.

253
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
You said you are from the Huanhua Sword Sect, Peng Zhi.

254
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
You saw the power of the Power of Power Sect,

255
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
so you came to ask for help.

256
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I have a friend who is in the same group.

257
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
He was caught by the power of power,

258
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
and handed over to King of Sword.

259
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm looking forward to asking Master Qu

260
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
to contact the local subordinates

261
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,200
to save my friend as soon as possible.

262
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
I won't stand by and watch.

263
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
I just don't know why the Demon of God

264
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
wants to catch your friend.

265
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
As far as I know,

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
the power of power will be in the hands of someone.

267
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
They don't hesitate to reward

268
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
the three sons of the Xiao family, Xiao Qiushui,

269
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
for their pursuit and gambling.

270
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
It's just because he has the Order of Heroes.

271
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Why don't you tell me the truth?

272
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I had a good talk with Brother Xilou

273
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
about the Sword of Jiangpan.

274
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Look at you.

275
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
You look like your father.

276
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
You can't be wrong.

277
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I'm sorry for what I did.

278
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

279
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Master Xun has been running around

280
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
to seek help from the Flower Faction.

281
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
He must have been always in danger

282
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
and was being watched everywhere.

283
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
That's why he's so cautious.

284
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Or maybe it's because

285
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
you have the Order of Heroes.

286
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
You don't trust others or me.

287
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
But that's understandable.

288
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Uncle Qu, it's not like that.

289
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
It's just that...

290
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
It's just that the world is full of people

291
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
who are not the same as you.

292
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
But the world...

293
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Could it be that...

294
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Actually, the Order of Heroes

295
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
is a little bit inferior.

296
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm really ashamed.

297
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I really didn't protect it well.

298
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Why?

299
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I lost my partner.

300
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
I was so worried.

301
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I came to Guanling all the way

302
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
and ran into Song Mingzhu of the Power Gang.

303
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
He was ruthless.

304
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I had to escape with all my might.

305
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
That's why the Order of Heroes

306
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
was taken away by him.

307
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Uncle Qu, I came all the way

308
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
to seek help from all the big gangs.

309
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
But none of them

310
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
dared to offend the Power Gang.

311
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
So I...

312
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
I beg you, Uncle Qu.

313
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Xian Zhi,

314
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
the Order of Heroes is about the whole martial art world.

315
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
If the evil people are in charge,

316
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
the consequences will be unimaginable.

317
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
I will not be indifferent.

318
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
But Uncle Qu,

319
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't know where the Order of Heroes

320
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,200
is hidden by Song Mingzhu.

321
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Don't worry, Xian Zhi.

322
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Since I have the reputation

323
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
of being a friend of the Power Gang,

324
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I will find the whereabouts of Jian

325
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
and help you find your friend.

326
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I won't let Song Mingzhu

327
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
take the Order of Heroes out of this place.

328
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I will send someone to find it.

329
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
You wait for my news at home.

330
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I will wait for you.

331
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Wait for my news.

332
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Tang Fang fell into the hands of King Jian,

333
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
but he appeared here.

334
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Since King Jian and Liu Suifeng are not good,

335
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
it's a good chance to take advantage of it.

336
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Mingzhu,

337
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I will go to see the Emperor.

338
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I will go to see the Emperor.

339
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Go.

340
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Song Mingzhu,

341
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
hand over the Order of Heroes.

342
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I don't understand what you are talking about.

343
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Since I can't make it clear to you,

344
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
please ask your master to come out.

345
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Long time no see.

346
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
King of Qian,

347
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,200
you still don't respect me.

348
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Liu Fu's master has traveled a long way

349
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
and came to my territory.

350
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
What is the purpose of this?

351
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Master ordered you and me

352
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
to investigate the Order of Heroes.

353
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
I am naturally after Xiao Qiushui.

354
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Isn't the Order of Heroes already in your hands?

355
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Can Xiao Qiushui tell you that?

356
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
I knew

357
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
he would use this trick to trick you.

358
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
At that time, King Jian

359
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
also experienced

360
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
the trick of this kid.

361
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Liu Fu's master has always been very cunning,

362
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
but he hasn't caught the kid of the Xiao family.

363
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Are you waiting for me to clean up the mess for you?

364
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
King Jian, you'd better worry about yourself first.

365
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You have been a hero for more than 20 years in Guang Ling.

366
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Now, this mask is about to be taken by someone.

367
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
I feel so sorry for King Jian.

368
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
The foundation I set here

369
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,200
is not so easy to be shaken by that kid of the Xiao family.

370
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
He dared to come to my territory without permission.

371
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
He has to bear it.

372
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I'll see you out.

373
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
I didn't expect that

374
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
I could find this place so quickly.

375
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Young Master,

376
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:54,280
our

377
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
There must be a trick

378
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
for so many people to guard this place.

379
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
The home of Yuan family.

380
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,260
you still wouldn't give up?

381
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,500
It's much better

382
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,360
for you to stop giving one touch.

383
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,540
Sit.

384
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,120
Brother, don't take it seriously.

385
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,560
Father asked us to stop investigating the military order.

386
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,560
He asked us to act recklessly.

387
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,720
Otherwise,

388
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,040
the situation will be dire.

389
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
Dere?

390
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,520
Father really said that?

391
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,320
This is father's handwriting.

392
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,840
I don't suspect what brother said.

393
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,360
I just think

394
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,760
father always values the big picture.

395
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,120
It's a bit strange

396
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,440
that you not upset.

397
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,640
Maybe father has his own thinking.

398
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,120
Father is different from us,

399
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,120
and the situation is different.

400
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,920
After all, dies is a routes.

401
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,960
We should not act recklessly.

402
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,320
Sometimes, being intent on the wrong track

403
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
can causeSean to be anticipate.

404
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,960
This is notturned to be a weak skill.

405
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,840
If so,

406
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,840
I'll use this chance

407
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,320
I'll investigate it with you.

408
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,520
Brother,

409
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
there's something wrong with the letter.

410
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,040
What's wrong?

411
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,320
Look at this ink.

412
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,600
Father has been

413
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,640
favoring Song Yan Mo,

414
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,600
who is very loyal to Jing Song.

415
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,160
Look at this letter.

416
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,080
It's indeed

417
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,440
ordinary oil ink.

418
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,440
And the two kinds of oil ink

419
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,320
are very different.

420
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,880
You mean

421
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,480
the letter is not from father.

422
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,600
Someone forged it?

423
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,200
Yes.

424
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,480
But the letter

425
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,040
was sent by the Xiao family

426
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,080
to contact Xingge.

427
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,720
We have to go through

428
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,920
all the Huanhua contact points.

429
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,720
If that's true,

430
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,760
it's a big deal.

431
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,320
I'm afraid Huanhua is in trouble.

432
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,520
Young Master.

433
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,440
Something's wrong, Young Master.

434
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,280
Wenwen,

435
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,680
a third young master's partner asked for an audience.

436
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,320
He said...

437
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,520
He said

438
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,400
the Jianlu of the Wen family

439
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
was surrounded by the Power Gang.

440
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,640
What?

441
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,560
What?

442
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,320
The Power Gang is so rampant.

443
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,600
That means

444
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,560
all the letters

445
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,000
received by the capital

446
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,840
have been changed.

447
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,680
Brother,

448
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,280
the Power Gang is very bold.

449
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm not a vegetarian.

450
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,720
Uncle Xiao said

451
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,440
the Jianlu was still in power.

452
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,720
But we were surrounded

453
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,560
on the way here.

454
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
We've been delayed for a long time.

455
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm afraid it's even more difficult

456
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,960
to return to the garden.

457
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,000
Brother Xiao,

458
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,400
we have to hurry up.

459
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,840
A'Qing.

460
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,560
Yes.

461
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Gather all the people

462
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,640
of Guangling Huanhua.

463
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,040
Go with me right away.

464
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
Return to the Jianlu.

465
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,840
Yes.

466
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,280
Open the snow garden.

467
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,320
You two stay here.

468
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,240
Brother,

469
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,440
why?

470
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,800
The situation in the well is still unclear.

471
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,000
It's too dangerous for you to go with them.

472
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,760
Why don't you stay here

473
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
and ask for help?

474
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,160
Although you're thoughtful,

475
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,400
you're the one who should stay.

476
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,400
You're the leader of Huanhua Sect.

477
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,760
You have a reputation and prestige in the world.

478
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
If you help the Guangling Sect,

479
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,600
it should be more smooth

480
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,240
if you help them.

481
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,400
You're right.

482
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,680
Lady Weng.

483
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,960
Lady Weng also knows

484
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,080
that we're surrounded

485
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,200
by the Huanhua Sect.

486
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,960
I know that you're eager to return to the garden.

487
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
But the more difficult it is,

488
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,120
the more you have to be steady.

489
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,920
Don't worry.

490
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,400
Our leader has sent a letter to Shaolin and Wudang Sect

491
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,320
to ask for help from Huanhua.

492
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
Bishan Sword Sect is a noble sect.

493
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
But the road to Shaolin and Wudang Sect

494
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,440
is far away.

495
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,960
I'm afraid that Yuan Shui can't solve the problem.

496
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,280
You're the main character of Huanhua.

497
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
You have to stay

498
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
and meet with some helpers

499
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,800
in Guangling.

500
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,760
Only Huanhua can help you.

501
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,520
Lady Weng is right.

502
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,800
I'll ask Uncle Kong Shi

503
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,560
to take the Longhu Team

504
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,960
to the road to the sword.

505
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,320
We'll meet with them

506
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,400
after we get help.

507
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
I'm here to ask for help from Hero Qu.

508
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
If I can get help

509
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,040
and save Tang Fanghou,

510
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,480
I'll ask him

511
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,160
to help us.

512
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,600
Hero Qu is a brave man

513
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,880
of the martial arts world.

514
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
If you can

515
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,280
get help from the people of Guangling

516
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,960
and help us,

517
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,520
Huanhua will be saved.

518
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,440
Brother.

519
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,880
Qiu Shui is a troublemaker.

520
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm worried that he'll go alone.

521
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,560
I'll go to ask Hero Qu

522
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,560
to help us.

523
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,840
Brother, I'll go with you.

524
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,960
Ex Raviate

525
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,400
유 juicy

526
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,600
Ex Raviate

527
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,000
Huang Lu

528
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,280
Huang Lu

529
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,080
Huang Lu

530
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,560
Xiang Zhuo

531
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,360
you have to be able to get out of the hands of the King of Sword.

532
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,400
The time has come.

533
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,240
Even if everyone knows it,

534
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,160
what can you do to me?

535
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,240
I am still a fair person.

536
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I don't want to embarrass you.

537
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
As long as you give me what I want,

538
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,600
you can take anyone

539
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,920
to leave my Quzhai Gate safely.

540
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,440
Hope Chen Zan's soul can still remain.

541
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
You want my Commander?

542
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,920
Never...

543
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,800
believe that the King of Sword

544
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,440
disease bites off the Whit Bluetooth.

545
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,320
The Commander?

546
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,560
How can I possibly get it?

547
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
If you don't believe me,

548
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,240
come and search for me then.

549
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,840
expired.

550
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,840
Zulan came in by himself.

551
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,120
It's said that Brother Qu is practicing calligraphy.

552
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,280
Is it not the right time for me to come?

553
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,800
Let's go.

554
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,040
I'll let you see

555
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,280
how the so-called hero

556
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,680
will commit suicide.

557
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,200
Go.

558
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,360
Brother Qu.

559
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,480
I didn't expect you to come to Guangling.

560
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
I'm sorry for the long trip.

561
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,640
Come and sit.

562
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,320
I was in a hurry and didn't get a notice.

563
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,520
I came here without permission.

564
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm sorry.

565
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,280
Brother Gu.

566
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,640
Brother Kang is also a guest in the mansion?

567
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,880
Brother Kang just arrived the other day.

568
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,880
We're all friends.

569
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,880
You don't have to avoid me.

570
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,280
Please sit.

571
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,440
All right.

572
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,920
Brother Qu, do you know

573
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,080
that the Wu Army suddenly appeared in the well

574
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,320
a few days ago?

575
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,760
Really?

576
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,080
What's that?

577
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,440
We found out that

578
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
the Wu Army saved our lives

579
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,640
from the massacre of the Power Gang.

580
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,140
To stop it,

581
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,720
we came along

582
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,880
to the place

583
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,560
where the Power Gang escaped.

584
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,860
But we didn't expect

585
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,020
to reach Guangling by ourselves.

586
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,880
You mean

587
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,560
therie men

588
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,760
who Once plundered the power该

589
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
Yes, I've been doinng with the Power Gang

590
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,040
for a long time

591
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,840
but it's been account of

592
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,700
きて saw��

593
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,980
We have to be careful

594
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,700
in this investigation.

595
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,060
So we should be careful.

596
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,900
I heard from the Wu Family

597
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,740
that the one who escorted Madam Wu

598
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,340
was the member of the Xiao Family.

599
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,420
Brother Kang, if I remember correctly,

600
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,780
you and Brother Xi Lou are old friends, right?

601
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,700
Then in the recent days,

602
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,180
you should be at the Martial Arts Festival

603
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,220
held by the Flower of Illusion for years.

604
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,940
Why did you come to Guang Ling?

605
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,740
It's not a coincidence.

606
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,580
I was busy this year,

607
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,660
so I couldn't go to Brother Xi Lou's place.

608
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,300
If I had known that the Flower of Illusion was so righteous

609
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,900
and saved Madam Wu,

610
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,380
I should have made a difference.

611
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,500
Who is behind the bottle?

612
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,980
It happened that a friend who lived in the mansion

613
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,020
had a bad illness and couldn't see people.

614
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,940
Didn't you just say

615
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,020
that the King of Sword might be in Guang Ling?

616
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,140
Yes.

617
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,260
When I went to investigate the case of the destruction

618
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,780
of Guang Ling's famous sect,

619
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,220
I found a trace of the King of Sword.

620
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,660
A trace of the King of Sword.

621
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,100
How can we be sure that it's the King of Sword

622
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,620
just by the trace of the sword?

623
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,820
Not only that,

624
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,460
there's also a white hair.

625
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,740
Maybe the murderer

626
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,740
is also an old man of the sword.

627
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,420
Everyone knows that

628
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,740
the King of Sword has a unique body armor.

629
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,740
It's only used in extremely dangerous situations.

630
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,740
At that time,

631
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,620
the body will be swollen due to the gas pulse,

632
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,940
causing the hair to turn white.

633
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,940
It's different from ordinary old people.

634
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,340
It's just a coincidence that

635
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,580
we found another thing nearby.

636
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,580
Mr. Kang, look.

637
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,940
Is this what you want?

638
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,940
It's not a coincidence, right?

639
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,180
Mr. Gu, you misunderstood.

640
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,180
This jade coin of mine

641
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,140
is still on my body.

642
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,580
Be careful, sir!

643
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:49,940
Senior,

644
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,460
Xue Anshan is the King of Sword.

645
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,940
You're the King of Sword?

646
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,100
Mr. Gu,

647
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,460
we've been friends for twenty years.

648
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,100
We've been hunting for three mountains.

649
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,660
I didn't want to hurt you,

650
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,060
but you came at the wrong time.

651
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,340
Mr. Kang,

652
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,580
if you ever try to grab the sword

653
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,420
again,

654
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,420
I will monitor your attacks.

655
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,460
What smell is that?

656
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,100
Why does it smell bad?

657
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,020
Mr. Kang,

658
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
kill him

659
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,860
I'll do that.

660
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,300
If you make any trouble at all,

661
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,660
I'm going to beat you to let you break into the enterprise

662
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,780
What are you going to do?

663
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,620
Sister

664
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
you can do it

665
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,300
Let's go

666
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
You're not a little animal.

667
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,300
You lied to us.

668
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,300
Let's not talk about this.

669
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
Let's go.

670
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Let's go.

671
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
Go what?

672
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Let's solve this first.

673
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
Heroine, I came up with this idea.

674
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Don't hurt my brother.

675
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Kill me.

676
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Shut up.

677
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
I tied you up.

678
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
If you want to kill me,

679
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
forget about it.

680
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Kill me.

681
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
Stop it.

682
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,300
Tang Fang,

683
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
they are here.

684
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
The situation is very critical.

685
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Let's go out first.

686
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Go.

687
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
Go.

688
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Brother Gu,

689
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,300
why do you do this?

690
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Luo Tuo's god, Gu Jun Shan,

691
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,300
has made a name for himself.

692
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Today,

693
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,300
he is going to die here.

694
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
It's a pity.

695
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Qu Han Shan,

696
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,300
I misjudged you.

697
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
Why did you...

698
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,300
Why?

699
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
In life,

700
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
there are only three things you want.

701
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Money,

702
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
position,

703
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
and power.

704
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Why do you want to be a hero?

705
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
I want to be a hero.

706
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
I want to be a hero.

707
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
I want to be a hero.

708
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Money,

709
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
position,

710
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
and power.

711
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
All of them are power.

712
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
All of them are power.

713
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,300
I am going to be a hero with you.

714
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Brother Gu,

715
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,300
why are you so pessimistic?

716
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Power needs talent.

717
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Brother Gu,

718
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,300
you always hate the martial arts world.

719
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Only the power can make the martial arts world go wild.

720
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
Master Li Chen Zhou is capable.

721
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
As long as you can join the Power Gang,

722
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
we can still fight against the world.

723
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
Even if we do bad things?

724
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Do you still think that

725
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
the Power Gang is just a

726
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
cold and cold martial arts world?

727
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
I am telling you, you are wrong.

728
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,300
Master is going to do great things.

729
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Maybe it's something

730
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
that even the gold and silver can't do.

731
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,300
If you are willing to join us...

732
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
I have never been in contact with you.

733
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,300
You are laughing at me.

734
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
You want me to be in contact with you?

735
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Don't think about it.

736
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Brother Gu,

737
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
you are too narrow-minded.

738
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,300
The sword is not a sword.

739
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
It can also make everything a sword.

740
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Even if it is empty,

741
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,300
it can still make a sword.

742
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,300
I didn't expect

743
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
that before my Gu Jun Mountain died,

744
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
I could learn a lesson from you.

745
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
I just want to ask you one last time.

746
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Where is the Du Yue Mountain

747
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,300
that we once lived in the same life?

748
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Senior.

749
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Why are you back?

750
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Don't worry, Senior.

751
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
I will

752
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
take good care of you.

753
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Good.

754
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Xiao Xiu Shui,

755
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
hand over the Order of Heroes

756
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
and be with the Power Gang.

757
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
Why don't you worry about

758
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Jin Xiu's future

759
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
and the success of the martial arts world?

760
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,300
I am worried about you.

761
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
I don't think

762
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
you will be able to

763
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
make it to the future.

764
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,300
You are the founder of Guang Ling.

765
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
For the sake of your future,

766
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
you abandoned the righteous and the righteous.

767
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
You are a dog in the power gang.

768
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Even if I have the Order of Heroes,

769
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
I will never give it to you.

770
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
If you don't listen to me,

771
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
you will die.

772
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Senior!

773
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
Senior!

774
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,300
No!

775
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Go!

776
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
You must escape

777
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,300
and break the secret of the Demon King!

778
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Go!

779
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
Senior!

780
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
Go!

781
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Go!

782
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Xiao Xiu Shui,

783
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
don't try to leave!

784
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,300
You!

785
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
Let go of me!

786
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Senior!

787
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Go!

788
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Go!

789
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Xiao Xiu Shui!

790
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
There is someone here!

791
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
There is no way!

792
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Xiao Xiu Shui!

793
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
How dare you play tricks on me?

794
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Go!

795
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Run!

796
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,300
Where else are you going?

797
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,300
Young Master,

798
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,300
there is no way.

799
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
What should we do?

800
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Kill them all.

801
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Even if one of them is killed,

802
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
he will have to face the truth

803
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
of Qu Anshan, the old fox.

804
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Okay.

805
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,300
Die if you stop me!

806
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,300
Kill me!

807
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Come on!

808
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,300
Idiot.

809
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
Old Qu, what are you doing?

810
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Old Qu, are you okay?

811
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
You scared me to death.

812
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Old Qu.

813
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,300
Old Qu.

814
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
How are you?

815
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
Are you okay?

816
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,300
I'm fine.

817
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,300
Do you have a face?

818
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,300
I was careless.

819
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,300
Where is this place?

820
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Listen.

821
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300
There is a sound of running water.

822
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Since there is water,

823
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
it means

824
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
there must be an exit.

825
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
How about this?

826
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Let's look around.

827
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,300
Okay.

828
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Xie Wan, go that way.

829
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,300
Old Qu, it's okay.

830
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
It's okay.

831
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,300
This cave is too long.

832
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
It's okay.

833
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
What's in here?

834
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
Old Qu,

835
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
the cave is closed.

836
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,300
It's okay.

837
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
They will go to their own death.

838
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300
God bless me.

839
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Are you a human or a ghost?

840
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
Why do you look so familiar?

841
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Yes.

842
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,300
Let's go.

843
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Don't go.

844
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,300
Is he dead or alive?

845
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,300
I don't know.

846
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,300
I don't know.

847
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,300
Be careful.

848
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,300
Be careful.

849
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,300
I have a song to send farewell to Wan Ge.

850
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,300
Who can understand

851
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,300
the sorrow of love?

852
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,300
The sky and the earth are full of wishes.

853
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:39,300
The human tears fall like wind.

854
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,300
The grey fog is like sand.

855
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,300
The dream is hard to find in the world.

856
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,300
How many branches are in the world?

857
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Where do the grass and grass grow?

858
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Love and hate are in the past.

859
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,300
The unreachable past is like a horse.

860
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,300
The time is wrong.

861
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,300
The destiny is not right.

862
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
Who can give me a piece of memory?

863
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,300
What do you have left?

864
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,300
I am so lonely.

865
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,300
I am so lonely.

866
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
The flowers fall.

867
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,300
I am so lonely.

868
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
The wind blows.

869
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,300
I have a song to send farewell to Wan Ge.

870
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Who can understand

871
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,300
the sorrow of love?

872
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,300
The sky and the earth are full of wishes.

873
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:59,300
The human tears fall like wind.

874
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Who can give me a piece of memory?

875
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:08,300
The sky and the earth are full of wishes.

876
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,300
The human tears fall like wind.

877
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,300
The heart is falling.

878
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,300
It's chasing me.
