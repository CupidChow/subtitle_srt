1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Break through the distance of light

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let this city and river be together in the sea of stars

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When the light shines on the shore of love

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The end of the dark night

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The sword in the night

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's not forgotten

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let this big cloud of tears

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The blood and the wound

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The sword of life has never changed

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let the thousand years be with me

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I open my eyes

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to wait for you to come

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The End

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Young Master Xiao, come, please sit

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Young Master Xiao, have you safely delivered your parents' bodies?

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have already settled down

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's good

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I wonder what you want to see me for this time

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, right

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That day in South Sky Hall

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I remember that Young Master Xiao mentioned the murderer of the Xiao family

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The symbol they left behind

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I wonder what this has to do with the whole Li Gang

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What does this have to do with it?

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This person is also an enemy of the whole Li Gang

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He colluded with the North Desert and harmed the Great West

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We are the people of the Great West

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My whole Li Gang, of course, has the obligation to protect the country

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Since the leader of the Li Gang is very loyal

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Then we should unite the martial arts world and fight against foreign enemies

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why use these threatening methods

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
To let the martial arts world give in to you?

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is the reason why this world is called the world

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Young Master Xiao, it's not as simple as you think

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
When there are too many people, the heart will naturally disperse

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If we don't use tough methods, the sects will listen to me

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm afraid the martial arts world will never be able to be united

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If fear can make these people listen to me

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If fear can make these people listen to me

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then why should I be a bad person?

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The sects of the Ming Sect should not be united by fear

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
On the contrary, the South Heaven Sect's action also proves that

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This world is threatened by righteousness

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You think that without the power gang

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The world will become better?

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But your power gang now

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Will only make this world worse

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You want to unite the martial arts world

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But you used the wrong method

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You have your own way of the world

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have my own way of doing things

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Although it's not right

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But what I want is not different

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Chief Li, why did you ask me to come here?

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
To form an alliance

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The murderer of the Nian Sect and the traitor of the power gang

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Used this item

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
On the North Wilderness people in the South Heaven Sect

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They found this item

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It seems that your big brother Xiao Yiren

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Was used by them

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
In this way, the traitors who destroyed the Xiao family

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And the power gang

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are all from the same gang

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Young Master Xiao, tell me

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Who is behind this?

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Unfortunately, until now

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I haven't found out

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
His true identity in the martial arts world

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I always feel that his real purpose

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is not as simple as we think

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If we say so

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Then we will have more chance

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And now the only clue

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is the chaos

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Young Master Xiao, what do you think?

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
With the power gang's style

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How can we call it an alliance?

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It should be called mutual use

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Chief Li, you want me to find this person, right?

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It doesn't matter if I do have to leave tomorrow

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I will go and confront the Deng Qingfeng

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And the Fei Yuqiao of the Fei family

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then what do you want?

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Just ask

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have one more thing to ask you

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Chief Li, please help me

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Go ahead

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The King of Medicine of the Qi Gang

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Has a strange habit

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I have a friend

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
His father has a strange disease

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He wants you to send the King of Medicine to the town

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The King of Medicine is going to the Tang Gang to treat his disease

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's really not appropriate

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But Young Master Xiao, I will arrange it

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you, Chief Li

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Goodbye

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's so late, you haven't slept yet

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Chongming is noisy, I can't sleep

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I miss your father

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
My father has been sick for many years

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I left Tang Gate for half a year

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,580
I thought there would be news of the opium

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have to go

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will go

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But I still have a heart attack

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Tang Feng

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think in this world

114
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Maybe not only forget the Heaven Book

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
To save your father

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Other friends

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Are also looking for the antidote

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I believe

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There must be a way

120
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I hope so

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can't accompany you on this trip

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You must be careful on the way

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't worry

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I have entrusted the King of Medicine to go back to Tang Gate with you

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Wait here

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Maybe he can cure your father's disease

127
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We are waiting for your good news

129
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Brothers, take care

130
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't worry, give us the key

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Take care

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't worry, give us the key

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I will go

134
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Boss, give me two bowls of noodles

135
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ok, wait a minute

136
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No. 26

137
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yuhan, through this emergency

138
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Will it be your home soon?

139
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes

140
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I remember you haven't been back for a long time

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Or bring some rice to your family

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You know my relationship with my father

143
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Forget it

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I remember

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I met him in the morning

146
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't understand

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why did you learn to follow the order?

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
My father is a dancer

149
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Unfortunately

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He led the sword sect to develop our previous sect's martial arts

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So my father wanted to make a big impact

152
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
To give the sword sect some vitality

153
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
A few years ago

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He learned a lot of martial arts

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Follow the order

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
May be one of them

157
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He is good at martial arts

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Since I started my career

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
My father has been away from me for many years

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In the sword sect

161
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There are few people who can see him

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I have been walking the world for years

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have some experience with him

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But brother

165
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't believe

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
My father will kill uncle Xiao and auntie Xiao

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But since he is too suspicious

168
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I have to ask him

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's also reasonable

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yuhan

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you can get rid of uncle Deng

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You have to lock in the real murderer earlier

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sister

174
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I am back

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Sister Yulan

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Long time no see

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Long time no see

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You haven't been back for so long

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Go to the study first

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will be back soon

181
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I will be back soon

182
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will be back soon

183
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I will be back soon

184
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I will be back soon

185
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will be back soon

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You haven't been back for so long

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Go to the study first

188
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I will take Qiushui to the hall

189
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ok, brother

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I will go first

191
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Go, Qiushui

192
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Father

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Qiushui

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You must be hungry

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Come

196
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I have prepared a meal

197
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
After you finish your meal, I will come to see you

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sister Yulan

199
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I am sorry to bother you

200
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Enjoy your meal

201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I will go to see father first

202
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Ok

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Please

204
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Father

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Brother

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Tie him up first

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Wait for news from King of Heaven

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes

209
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Where is he?

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Go find him

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Qiushui

213
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why are you...

214
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Sister Yulan

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I am sorry

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Say it

217
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Where is uncle Deng?

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Uncle Deng

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I know you are at home

220
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't want to fight with you

221
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Come out

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How dare you

223
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You still want to fight against me

224
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I won't let you go

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The people in the city are all over the place

226
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They are all in the forest

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I didn't expect uncle Deng's men are so good

228
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Qiushui

229
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't know about your family

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Because of your relationship with your son

231
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I won't make it difficult for you today

232
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You should go

233
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Uncle Deng

234
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I am here to find out the real murderer who killed my parents

235
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I want to see you

236
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You don't know what you are doing

237
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Don't blame me

238
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I will kill you

239
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The smell of death

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's a trap

241
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's really dark

242
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Uncle Deng

243
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You don't have such a strong inner force

244
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You should come out

245
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Nonsense

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Go to hell

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Uncle Deng

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Uncle Deng

249
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You should come out

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I will follow you

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Follow me

252
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I am guilty for the time being

253
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Dad

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Dad

255
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How are you, dad

256
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Dad

257
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Brother

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Why are you fighting

259
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Dad

260
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yuhan

261
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Uncle Deng has internal injury

262
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let him sit down and talk

263
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Dad

264
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Dad

265
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yuhan

266
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Your father has multiple meridians

267
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He just suffered a stroke

268
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
His blood is bloodshot

269
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't know about this

270
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Uncle Deng

271
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Sorry

272
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Brother

273
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
My father has a strong inner force

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why did he suddenly get a meridians injury?

275
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yuhan

276
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Uncle Deng may have his own reasons

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Your family's name is Hu Xinqiang

278
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's called Hu Yingbi

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's close to the corner of the wall

280
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It can magnify its voice a hundred times

281
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Even the one who is mentally ill

282
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The voice after magnifying a hundred times

283
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Is enough to shock people

284
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And these mechanisms

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Are used to control the disappearance and explosion

286
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I guess uncle Deng

287
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You have been

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Relying on these

289
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
To support the reputation of the Deng family

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Dad

291
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What the hell is going on

292
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Uncle Deng

293
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I know

294
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I shouldn't ask others about Yin Zhong

295
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But I have a hidden motive

296
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
In the Xiao family

297
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Zhenzhen killed my parents

298
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
She is good at following the order

299
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So I came here

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Just to investigate this

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Uncle Deng, please tell me

302
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The day Qianlu was killed

303
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Did you come to the Xiao family?

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Dad

305
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What brother said is true

306
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Please tell me the truth

307
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I want to let my brother

308
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Find the murderer who killed uncle Xiao and aunt Xiao earlier

309
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
My wound

310
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Has to start from the time

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
When the Baicao Valley was robbed

312
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And the whole thing

313
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I was in Baicao Valley

314
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I was hit by the thunder and fire

315
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
My meridians were broken

316
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
My martial arts were lost

317
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Although I lost my life

318
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But all my power

319
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Was gone

320
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
For the past 15 years

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I have been practicing martial arts

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Just to recover my power

323
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But until now

324
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I have only recovered

325
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
A little

326
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Uncle Deng

327
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So

328
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Your wound

329
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Was healed 15 years ago

330
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This meridians needs strong inner power to drive

331
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I can't control it now

332
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
These years

333
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I have been thinking about it many times

334
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Just to be able to repair the mechanism

335
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
To cover up the fact that I lost my power

336
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
When dad was young

337
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
With the help of this chaos paper and Hailin sword

338
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
In this world

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I have made some achievements

340
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But also

341
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I have many enemies who want to kill me

342
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
At that time, only uncle Xiao knew that I was out of power

343
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I asked him to help me keep the secret

344
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Although in the world

345
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There are many rumors about me

346
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But

347
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They don't know the reason

348
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
When uncle surrendered to King of Heaven

349
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He just wanted to find a backer

350
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
To fight against the power bank

351
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Dad

352
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Dad surrendered to King of Heaven

353
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Dad

354
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He had his own difficulties

355
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
When he saw all the clans that joined together

356
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
All were in trouble

357
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He couldn't escape even if he changed the sword

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I know

359
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
All of this

360
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Was all done by Liu Suifeng

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
At that time

362
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I had already lost all my power

363
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If dad

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Didn't surrender to King of Heaven

365
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
How can I be sure

366
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Our family can survive?

367
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So

368
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
At that time, you didn't want to help the Dage family

369
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The Xiao family

370
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I really feel guilty

371
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But I want to tell you

372
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The Xiao family's disaster

373
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It has nothing to do with me

374
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I am innocent

375
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But today

376
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
For you

377
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
To find the real murderer who killed your father

378
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I don't have to hide anymore

379
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm sorry

380
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm sorry

381
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The way of the death of the Great Yin's master

382
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
If the meridians are just damaged

383
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's not a bad death

384
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's still possible for the Great Yin's master to be reborn with the meridians

385
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But if the way of death

386
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Couldn't be transferred in the meridian

387
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
That means

388
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Elder sister

389
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Please

390
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,160
0.

391
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,800
Father.

392
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Father.

393
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,020
about your injuries,

394
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,420
you've got better.

395
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,240
You can only be better.

396
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I've accepted the reality long ago.

397
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,240
Now, in my heart,

398
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,320
I hope

399
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,000
our family can be safe and sound.

400
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,160
Father.

401
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,040
Liu Suifeng.

402
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
Liu Suifeng.

403
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
Liu Suifeng.

404
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,600
You're finally here.

405
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,600
If you want to seek revenge,

406
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,360
just kill me.

407
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,920
I'm not the one who did it.

408
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
The last thing I regret is that

409
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
I couldn't kill you,

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
the son of a traitor,

411
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
and let you have a chance

412
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,360
to kill Wu Lin.

413
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
You traitor.

414
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,560
Today,

415
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,120
I'll let you die.

416
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,200
This is the personal testimony

417
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
of the assassin of the Northern Emperor, Yu Zhiqing.

418
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,280
The Baicao Valley has always been a place of refuge.

419
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,680
It never had any ties with the Northern Emperor.

420
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,040
My mother created it

421
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,520
to protect the people

422
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,040
and to protect the people.

423
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,440
The Northern Emperor has made up his mind

424
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,640
at this time.

425
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,880
If he wants to use it as military supply,

426
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,320
he can spread rumors

427
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
about Wu's country

428
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,040
and destroy the territory of the Baicao Valley.

429
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,720
Impossible.

430
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,080
Impossible.

431
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,000
There are people from the Northern Emperor

432
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,280
in the Baicao Valley.

433
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
We received the news that

434
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,160
the Baicao Valley colluded with the people

435
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,520
to make military supplies.

436
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,400
We were led by Hero Xiao

437
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,480
to the Baicao Valley

438
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,400
to find out the truth.

439
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,880
Master Liu,

440
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
I promise

441
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
that after we enter the valley,

442
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,600
I won't hurt anyone

443
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
without any reason.

444
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,120
If we can't find any evidence,

445
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,840
I'm willing to

446
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,800
make up for your sins.

447
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,680
No.

448
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,920
You can't come in and search

449
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,080
the Baicao Valley

450
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
with any charges.

451
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
Although we are weak,

452
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,920
we are upright and upright.

453
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,240
How can you insult us?

454
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,120
The Mountain Sea Sword has left.

455
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,080
It's our place.

456
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,040
Be careful.

457
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,680
Hero Xiao.

458
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,480
Well...

459
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,040
Should we break in?

460
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,320
No.

461
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,240
Give Master Liu some time

462
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,280
to think about it.

463
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,480
I believe

464
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,080
he will make the right decision.

465
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,920
Hero Xiao gave your mother

466
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
a chance to prove his innocence.

467
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,520
But she was

468
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,440
so stubborn.

469
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,600
Tell me.

470
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,240
If it wasn't for the evil in her heart,

471
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,320
how could she react so?

472
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,880
You came to the Baicao Valley to be robbers.

473
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,600
And we came here with a smile.

474
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Besides, you said it so well.

475
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,120
In the end,

476
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,720
you broke into my family.

477
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,560
You killed my family

478
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,800
without any evidence.

479
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,800
Mother.

480
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,000
Mother.

481
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,720
Mother.

482
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,120
Mother.

483
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,000
Mother.

484
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,040
I saw my mother

485
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,800
die in front of me.

486
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,520
But my family

487
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,800
became cold and cold.

488
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,960
In a short time,

489
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,680
you knew

490
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
you started to kill

491
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
without any interrogation or questioning.

492
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,520
It's obvious that

493
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,880
the crime in the Baicao Valley

494
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,840
is going to be exposed.

495
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,160
You want to kill me?

496
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,440
What's going on?

497
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
What's going on?

498
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,120
What's going on?

499
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,200
Go.

500
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,800
They are transferring the evidence.

501
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,120
The military order?

502
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,200
The North Emperor?

503
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,480
The Baicao Valley

504
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,400
is indeed making the military order for the North Emperor.

505
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,240
So many eyes

506
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,840
saw the North Emperor

507
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,400
transferring the military order in the Baicao Valley.

508
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
How can you explain it?

509
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,120
How do you know

510
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,400
that someone in the North Emperor

511
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,680
colluded with the North Emperor?

512
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,200
The evil spirit of the North Emperor

513
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,560
stole the secret recipe of the military order.

514
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,240
He killed the God of Death

515
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,760
and buried the truth.

516
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,040
Nonsense.

517
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,320
Before we entered the valley,

518
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,280
we had seen

519
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,960
the account books of the exchange of military orders

520
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,480
between the North Emperor and the Baicao Valley.

521
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,520
The accounts of the Yibinbi

522
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
are clearly remembered.

523
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
We were in the back hill.

524
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,000
We even saw

525
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
you were transferring the evidence

526
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,240
and were killed.

527
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,440
You have no reason to escape.

528
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,200
The crime of colluding with the enemy

529
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,400
in the Baicao Valley

530
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,400
is a crime of the highest degree.

531
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
The highest degree?

532
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
Who brought the records?

533
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,720
Who is the mastermind?

534
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,720
I...

535
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,480
I don't know.

536
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
Okay.

537
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,800
It seems that you don't want to know.

538
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,640
Is it not working?

539
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,880
I'm more curious now.

540
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
Who is it

541
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,800
that can keep you here?

542
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,160
If I had known

543
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,520
you would become

544
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,960
such a big devil today,

545
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,720
I wouldn't have saved you

546
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,840
from death.

547
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,760
What did you say?

548
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,040
Back then,

549
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,720
the little hero saw you die.

550
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,880
He was kind and kind.

551
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,240
He saved your life.

552
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,840
He asked someone

553
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
to send you to Tang Gate.

554
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,960
Only then can you survive until today.

555
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,880
Mom.

556
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,920
There's a monkey here.

557
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,520
Be careful.

558
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,280
Be careful.

559
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,840
There's a living one here.

560
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,360
Be careful.

561
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,120
Tang Gate?

562
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,040
Which family are you from?

563
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm from the Liu family.

564
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,120
You're from the Liu family?

565
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,280
I didn't expect

566
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,120
you to take the Xuanli Sect

567
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,880
to attack the Xiao family.

568
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,720
There's no

569
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,600
heaven in this world.

570
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,760
You just killed one of me.

571
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,280
You called yourself a Bodhisattva.

572
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,360
I'll ask you one last time.

573
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,600
Back then,

574
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,640
who brought the records?

575
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,320
It was again the chief monk of the Qing соврем之家.

576
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,360
All right.

577
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,660
I'd like to see

578
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,040
who's tougher,

579
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,040
your dareliest or mine.

580
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,720
Father!

581
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,160
If you don't tell me,

582
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,960
I'll ask you again.

583
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,840
Father.

584
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,640
Come in.

585
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,320
Father.

586
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,320
I've rested.

587
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,160
I'm fine.

588
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,800
Okay.

589
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,960
How's your injury?

590
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,840
It's fine.

591
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,560
All right.

592
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,120
Sit down.

593
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,320
Okay.

594
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,640
Father.

595
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,480
About the Baicao Valley,

596
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,880
did you hide something?

597
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,920
Nonsense.

598
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,120
What's there to hide?

599
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,160
Others don't know,

600
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,960
but I know it.

601
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,240
Every time you lie,

602
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,400
Yan Tian will look down.

603
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,240
You...

604
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,760
Father.

605
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,920
You Sui Feng is a man of his own.

606
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,720
Once he's watching over us,

607
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,520
I'm afraid there will be no peace

608
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,760
in the Sword Sect.

609
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,160
That's why,

610
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,800
I'll just treat him recklessly.

611
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:04,960
Have mercy.

612
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,760
Okay.

613
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:15,720
Your father is indeed an

614
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,440
extraordinary person.

615
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,560
Be violent and

616
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,680
never let anyone

617
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,840
reacts like a boss.

618
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,600
What can I do about this?

619
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,440
Just remember that

620
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,640
I'm going to find my brother.

621
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,880
A sect that fights against the Heavenly King

622
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,040
is probably worse than the Power Gang.

623
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,960
When the sun rises tomorrow,

624
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,040
I'll leave with my brother.

625
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,520
Father,

626
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,320
I hope you can get over your confusion.

627
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,280
Don't let me down.

628
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,680
Ziagger,

629
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,480
you should've told me.

630
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,160
I wouldn't dare say that.

631
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,840
I hope you can move on.

632
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Father, I hope you can get over it.

633
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Don't keep me waiting.

634
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
What's going on?

635
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
What's going on?

636
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
Hurry up.

637
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
They're transferring the evidence.

638
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Hurry up.

639
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
This is it.

640
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Let's go.

641
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Yu Han.

642
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Sister.

643
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
Father, help me.

644
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Father.

645
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Father.

646
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Father.

647
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Father.

648
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Father.

649
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Don't scare me.

650
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Father.

651
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
Father.

652
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
Father.

653
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Why is this happening?

654
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Brother.

655
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Father.

656
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
Why is this happening?

657
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Father.

658
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Father.

659
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Father.

660
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Uncle Deng's fatal wound

661
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
is the wound on his back.

662
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
This wound

663
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
is caused by their secret weapon.

664
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Other than that,

665
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
there are many other wounds

666
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
caused by external forces.

667
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
I've seen these wounds.

668
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
It must be Liu Suifeng.

669
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
These wounds on father's body

670
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,840
are all his own.

671
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
It's my fault.

672
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
Father.

673
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Father.

674
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
I'm sorry.

675
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
I shouldn't have quarreled with you.

676
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I shouldn't have said those words.

677
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
I shouldn't have left.

678
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Father.

679
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
It's all my fault.

680
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Father.

681
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Father.

682
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
Father.

683
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Father.

684
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
It's all my fault.

685
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I should have guarded your father.

686
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
It's my fault.

687
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Look.

689
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
This piece of paper

690
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
is torn in half.

691
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
I suspect

692
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
that Uncle Deng

693
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
left something for you.

694
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
It's not true,

695
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
but I think

696
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
it was a piece of paper

697
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
I didn't notice.

698
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
I saw

699
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
on the paper

700
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
the letter

701
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,880
that his mother

702
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
ditched

703
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
of more than a billion dollars

704
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
to reassure him.

705
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
It came with such true stories.

706
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
So let's read it.

707
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
WhatHere

708
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Are these The G�� of the year

709
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,840
The past is left behind in the rain

710
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,840
The first sight of snow

711
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,840
How many worries does the world have

712
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,840
The city always has the same

713
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,840
The song of the rain is in the east

714
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,840
The next one is in the heart

715
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,840
The world is just a few words

716
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,840
The book is about to arrive

717
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,840
The wind and rain are far away

718
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,840
But the wind and rain are always so carefree

719
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,840
The world is just a few words

720
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,840
The wine is in the mouth

721
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,840
The wine is in the head

722
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,840
The world is just a few words

723
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,840
The world is just a few words

724
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,840
The book is about to arrive

725
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,840
The wind and rain are far away

726
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,840
But the wind and rain are always so carefree

727
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,840
The world is just a few words

728
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,840
The wine is in the mouth

729
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,840
The wine is in the head

730
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,840
The world is just a few words

731
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,840
The world is just a few words

732
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,840
The bird is singing

733
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,840
The moon is passing by the county

734
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,840
The freedom is not just a gun

735
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,840
The world is just a few words

736
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,840
The world is just a few words

737
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,840
The world is just a few words

738
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,840
The world is just a few words
