1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
God untame the misjudged

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
Let the blood flow in the rain

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,960
The sword has never been changed

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Thousands of years have passed, I have grown up

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,440
I want to wait for you to come

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,720
The wind is not strong

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
I resume me

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,440
Go through all contributed

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,480
My thousand white devils come to my rescue

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:21,280
Since you're back to rescue me

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,400
I thought love was forever

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,720
My sticker for love seems un chilli

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
You left me in between the heart and hair

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,880
I was born a hero

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,400
It is all the journey

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,640
Because my love is love

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
My blood is all for you

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,580
I never isot22

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,400
Let me light up a hold of the light

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
I just want to keep my leg as soft as a dumpling,

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,200
but here I am,

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm going first.

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
Where did you get this demon's hair?

25
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,600
What did you do to my family?

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,120
It doesn't matter what I did.

27
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,560
What should you do, Xiao Qiao?

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,160
The only thing that can save the Xiao family now

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,360
is myself.

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,040
Xiao Qiao,

31
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,080
why don't you give him the token?

32
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,840
Give it to him.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,320
Yes.

34
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
Please.

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,640
Give it to him.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Yes.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,840
Give it to him.

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,000
Give it to him, okay?

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,560
I really don't know where this hero is.

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
You said he wasn't here.

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
Then think about it again.

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,960
What happened after seeing the old lady?

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,480
If you really can't think of it,

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,080
you don't have to keep it.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:13,180
The name of the pray for

46
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,020
Hurry up.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,700
I told you not to get it.

48
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,660
Right.

49
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,580
You didn't listen.

50
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,900
I think

51
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,980
we should force him to tell you

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,340
he has a 4th 놀라질수 var.

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,100
Right, my died.

54
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,340
You're just trying to get rid of me.

55
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,660
Your injuries won't heal either.

56
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,180
It's all your fault!

57
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,860
Right now, we can only work together

58
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,020
to find a way to escape from here.

59
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,580
My sister, Xiao Xue Yu, is very smart.

60
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,940
I believe she will cure your injuries.

61
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,700
Xiao Xue Yu?

62
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,180
Good, good.

63
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,900
No, no, no. You're being so kind.

64
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,900
I'm not that kind.

65
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,100
But think about it.

66
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,620
This Liu Sui Feng, he's cruel and ruthless.

67
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,500
Do you think he will let you off?

68
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,420
No, no, no.

69
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,580
So, we're now

70
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,340
on the same boat.

71
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,940
Then we must work together.

72
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,900
Find a way to escape from here.

73
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,780
On the same boat?

74
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,740
Then we'll be five-times.

75
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,740
Five-times?

76
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,900
Five-times.

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,340
That's right.

78
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,540
We're five-times.

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,620
Then if we get out,

80
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,380
your sister won't help us break our legs.

81
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,540
What should we do?

82
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,780
That's right.

83
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,700
No, my sister is kind.

84
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,380
You saved me, that's my benefactor.

85
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,060
Since you're my benefactor,

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,500
they'll definitely save you.

87
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,300
Bu Jian, you lied to me.

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,340
Even if you don't believe my sister,

89
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,460
you know them.

90
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,420
They have a very powerful way to save us.

91
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,460
I have a friend,

92
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,220
his name is Tang Fang.

93
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,860
Although he's a bit arrogant,

94
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,540
and he's not very strict,

95
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,460
but I believe that if you get me out,

96
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,300
he'll definitely heal your wounds.

97
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,100
That's good.

98
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,900
Third Brother, come here.

99
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,380
I'm Qi Qi Feng.

100
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,340
You're Ruo Kai.

101
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,180
Hurry up and go.

102
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,220
Go after him.

103
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,700
Hurry up, my legs are shaking.

104
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,420
My legs are shaking.

105
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,500
Xiao Qiushui, what's going on?

106
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,700
Didn't you already...

107
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,380
I couldn't care less about it.

108
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,220
This matter is indeed a bit complicated.

109
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,500
By then, I'll tell you.

110
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,980
You dare to lie to me?

111
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,940
In this world, no one dares to lie to me.

112
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,340
You even dared to lock me up with an iron cage?

113
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,060
You're the sister that he's talking about, right?

114
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,220
She's clearly the evil girl, Miss Tang.

115
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,740
Shut up!

116
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,140
Miss Tang?

117
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,500
I'll give you one more chance to explain.

118
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,540
I can't drag my friend into this anymore.

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
If something happens to you,

120
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,700
I won't be able to explain it to you.

121
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,940
Oh, do you have anything to say?

122
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,820
Y-Yes.

123
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,660
How about we let Liu Suifeng come over?

124
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,020
Miss Tang, you have to follow us to the sun too.

125
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,180
Yes.

126
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,700
Liu Suifeng? You've seen Liu Suifeng?

127
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,340
We've seen him. Look, his legs are shaking.

128
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,460
He's fighting.

129
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,700
That's right.

130
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,380
The wind is warm, that's Liu Suifeng.

131
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,460
Art's here, letter's too far away.

132
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,660
installment

133
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,180
remove

134
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,620
Put the belts there as soon as possible.

135
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,180
The right person isn't here.

136
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,580
Put that out.

137
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,340
When she sneaked out from the pack,

138
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,500
use one of them.

139
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,040
The time right now is pretty tight.

140
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,500
Let's get out of here first.

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,460
Yes.

142
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,420
Let's get out first.

143
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,020
Got it.

144
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,040
The machine here is already burned.

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,460
You four,

146
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,300
set it up.

147
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,340
Escort Mr Xiao out.

148
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,140
I'll use this chambero City bail-out drug to cure you.

149
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,680
Good.

150
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,380
Miss Miao.

151
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,180
No.

152
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,180
It can't be.

153
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,020
I...

154
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,060
Your Highness,

155
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,500
your formation has been broken.

156
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,140
Xiao Qiushui was rescued.

157
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,580
He could break my Taoist School's formation

158
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,500
and rescue Xiao Qiushui.

159
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,780
Could it be him?

160
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,420
Feng,

161
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,020
is he really that important to you?

162
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,340
What should we do now?

163
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,780
Go!

164
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,340
San!

165
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,300
Move!

166
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,380
This poison has been selling for too long.

167
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,180
We can't get the antidote.

168
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,020
Eat it.

169
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,860
Thank you.

170
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,220
It's dangerous.

171
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,300
I gave you the medicine

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,740
that's poisoned by the West.

173
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,780
Now,

174
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,340
only you can help yourself.

175
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Open the door.

176
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
I want to wait.

177
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,300
I'll wait for you

178
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,300
even if the sky is bright.

179
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,740
Thank you.

180
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,060
Miss Tang,

181
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,700
I find that your medical skills

182
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,380
are no worse than

183
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,380
Xiao Xueyu.

184
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,580
That's right.

185
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,140
Do you know Xiao Xueyu?

186
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,180
No.

187
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,620
Listen to him.

188
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,740
Listen to him.

189
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,940
Yes.

190
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,620
He said that you are a cunning and ungrateful person.

191
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,580
Yes.

192
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,540
So we don't need to beg you.

193
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,300
You are willing to help us.

194
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,500
Yes.

195
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,020
You told them that?

196
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,260
If you keep talking nonsense,

197
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,460
I'll cut your hands and feet.

198
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,940
That's not what I mean.

199
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,260
Boring.

200
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,860
glory

201
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,540
ayı

202
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,400
is

203
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,260
I

204
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
I have a request.

205
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
This thing is called the Golden Feather.

206
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
It's left by Wei Guyou.

207
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,980
Wei Guyou

208
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,300
is the first person in the martial arts world

209
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,220
that everyone feared

210
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,940
a few years ago.

211
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,740
Crazy Heaven.

212
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes.

213
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,540
He was defeated under the name of Wu Bi.

214
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,420
He was the only one who passed his Heaven-fearing Spell.

215
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,820
He was extremely jealous of his peers.

216
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,980
He took away his two younger siblings

217
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,940
and forced them to pass the Heaven-fearing Spell.

218
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,340
But after Master Yan passed it,

219
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,380
they broke their promise.

220
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,860
They made Master Yan

221
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,140
search for the traces of his own brother and sister for ten years.

222
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,740
When they got the clue,

223
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,940
they sealed the North Emperor

224
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,900
and sent out some masters

225
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,580
to assassinate my son.

226
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,740
Master Yan didn't care about his relatives.

227
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,420
He saved my son's life.

228
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,860
He lost his brother and sister again.

229
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,580
Everyone says that Yan is crazy.

230
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,740
He is arrogant and impetuous.

231
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,220
But he didn't expect that

232
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,460
he was also a hero.

233
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,860
After that,

234
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,340
Master Yan searched for the body

235
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,380
but only found the body of the bandit.

236
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
He searched for his brother and his brothers.

237
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,660
He became a demon

238
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,660
and became the crazy Yan

239
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,980
that everyone feared.

240
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,700
He searched for his beautiful nephew

241
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,500
and made him

242
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,940
turn the martial arts world into a bloody place.

243
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,300
He was led to the Five-Storied Mountain

244
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,220
and was beaten by Master Yan.

245
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,620
But no matter what,

246
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,140
Master Yan and the Wu Family

247
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,060
are of high status.

248
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,220
The Wu Family owes Master Yan a favor.

249
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,100
After that,

250
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,100
he left the Golden Fly Swallow.

251
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,060
What about his sister?

252
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,220
All these years,

253
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,460
I've been looking for her everywhere.

254
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,020
But

255
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,460
time has passed.

256
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,500
The world has become bigger.

257
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,660
I'm old.

258
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,780
I want to get rid of Qiu Shui

259
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,900
and use the Golden Fly Swallow as a token

260
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,100
to help me find

261
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,740
Master Yan's only family.

262
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,500
Great Midwife Zhao,

263
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:06,880
outdoor

264
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,280
choreography

265
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,660
music

266
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,540
and music

267
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,860
led by Sima Hong COMP bitある

268
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,820
the Annanung

269
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,580
Ms. Tang!

270
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,320
Ms. Tang!

271
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,380
Ms. Tang...

272
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,880
Ms. Tang.

273
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,300
This hook is made of dished up wine.

274
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,040
Just nella in the finger.

275
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,340
Then the everytime spent will pass.

276
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,960
But want a great doctor to cure everything.

277
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,960
And this is the god ditch of Miaoyyy.

278
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,760
After you eat it,

279
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
your internal energy will be restored.

280
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,520
Give me another one.

281
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
Give me another one.

282
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,840
Give it to me.

283
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,040
Give me another one.

284
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,760
Qiushui.

285
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Give me another one.

286
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,560
What happened?

287
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,160
How did you...

288
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,120
How did you come back to life?

289
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
Give me another one.

290
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
I might be able to go to Mount Anshan.

291
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
Let me go back to the West for the time being.

292
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
It hurts.

293
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,160
It looks like I'm dead.

294
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Here.

295
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,400
That one.

296
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,040
Yes.

297
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,400
I have more.

298
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,200
Okay.

299
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,040
Give it to me.

300
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,480
It's good that you're okay.

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,720
Don't push.

302
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,360
What's your next plan?

303
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,640
Let me do it.

304
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,880
Go.

305
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,680
Go.

306
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,480
Go.

307
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,720
I'll go with you.

308
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,800
King Jian and Liu Suifeng.

309
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,680
Let me do it.

310
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,240
Let me do it.

311
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
I tried my best to contain them.

312
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,280
Now,

313
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,840
I have to hurry back to Huanhua.

314
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
I hope the big brother has arrived.

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,720
Give it to me.

316
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,520
Let me do it.

317
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,920
Let's go after they finish applying the medicine.

318
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,920
Okay.

319
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,400
I...

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Xue Yu.

321
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,360
Xue Yu.

322
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,000
What's wrong?

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
Are you okay?

324
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,160
I'm fine.

325
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
The road is important.

326
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,640
Let's go.

327
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,440
Young Master.

328
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,600
Young Master.

329
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,080
Young Master and Young Master Zuxiu are still missing.

330
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,800
Young Master.

331
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
Young Master.

332
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,440
There's good news.

333
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,560
Young Master is still alive.

334
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,000
What did you say?

335
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,800
Did you hear it or see it with your own eyes?

336
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,520
Someone said that

337
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,120
Young Master Zuxiu is still alive.

338
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
So I looked for him.

339
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,560
Someone did see him.

340
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,560
What a good news.

341
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,600
Qiu Shui is still alive.

342
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,280
Great.

343
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,200
Qiu Shui.

344
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
I'll hurry back to Jianluo as soon as possible.

345
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,000
Xue Yu.

346
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,000
Xue Yu.

347
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,360
Xue Yu.

348
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,000
Xue Yu.

349
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,360
Xue Yu.

350
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
Snake poison.

351
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,200
How could this happen?

352
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,600
Xue Yu wanted to hurry back to Jianluo.

353
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,640
He kept it a secret.

354
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
If he continues to go back,

355
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,520
he might die.

356
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,680
But now Jianluo...

357
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,200
I'll stay and find a way to save Xue Yu.

358
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,560
Yi Ren.

359
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,960
The most important thing for you is to hurry back to Jianluo.

360
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,000
Save your parents.

361
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,200
You two stay here.

362
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,320
Ji Yue, follow me.

363
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,960
Yes.

364
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,240
Xue Yu.

365
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,840
My foot is fine.

366
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,640
It's fine.

367
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,680
My foot is fine.

368
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,560
My foot is fine.

369
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,560
Great.

370
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,840
My foot is fine.

371
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,880
Thank you, Miss Dao.

372
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,000
Thank you, Miss Dao.

373
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
Thank you, Miss Dao.

374
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,000
Thank you.

375
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,840
Why did you hit me?

376
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm not in control.

377
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm fine.

378
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm fine.

379
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,560
I'm fine.

380
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,360
I'm fine.

381
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,320
I'm fine.

382
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
You were in a mess just now.

383
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,480
Did you not use the right way?

384
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
Did you use the wrong way?

385
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,040
Third Brother.

386
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,920
I told you.

387
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,400
Don't worry.

388
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,280
Why are you fighting with me?

389
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,720
What does it have to do with me?

390
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,360
Liu Suifeng.

391
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
You are really a spirit.

392
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,680
Liu Suifeng.

393
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,920
You know the formation of my Tang Sect.

394
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,800
What does it have to do with you?

395
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,720
Tell me, Fang Er.

396
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,640
You can't stop me.

397
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,680
You call me Fang Er?

398
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,800
You call me Fang Er?

399
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,000
You call me Fang Er?

400
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,200
You call me Fang Er?

401
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,560
You call me Fang Er?

402
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
You call me Fang Er?

403
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,960
You call me Fang Er?

404
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,560
You call me Fang Er?

405
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,960
I'm your Brother Feng.

406
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,040
Brother Feng.

407
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,520
Run!

408
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
You brat.

409
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,920
How dare you break into my school?

410
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,240
Fang Er.

411
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,360
Brother Feng.

412
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
You are really Brother Feng.

413
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,120
I wanted to be with you

414
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,560
in a better way.

415
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,240
So you are from Tang Sect.

416
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,640
Since you are Brother Feng,

417
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
why did you help the power to protect the tiger?

418
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,520
Why did you always

419
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,880
follow the Xiao family?

420
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,400
Do you remember

421
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,880
how I came to Tang Sect?

422
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,240
After Tang Yaoshun and my mother gave birth to me,

423
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
she returned to the Tang Sect to be her master.

424
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,440
My mother took me

425
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,200
and stayed in Baicao Valley alone.

426
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
Baicao Valley was

427
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,320
taken by the evil Xiao Xieluo

428
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
and many martial artists.

429
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,440
He killed all the people in the sect.

430
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,600
He killed all the people in the sect.

431
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,800
I escaped.

432
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,200
I wanted to seek revenge for Tang Yaoshun.

433
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
But she ignored me.

434
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,200
I think

435
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,600
the one who took the order of Baicao Valley

436
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,920
took the order of Baicao Valley

437
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
and set up the mountain for Beihuang.

438
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,200
Thanks to him,

439
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,360
the hero Xiao and the people of the Martial Arts Sect

440
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,400
were united and destroyed.

441
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,400
This is called a death for the innocent.

442
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,800
Yes, a death for the innocent.

443
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
A death for the innocent.

444
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,720
A death for the innocent.

445
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,520
Shut up.

446
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
I, Baicao Valley,

447
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,480
was a righteous man.

448
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
How could I be an enemy of the outside world?

449
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,800
Isn't it Xiao Xieluo, the traitor,

450
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,320
who stole the elixir

451
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,920
and set up the Baicao Valley

452
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,880
for the crime

453
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,320
and for the punishment?

454
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,840
My father won't kill me.

455
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,320
I think you're lying.

456
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

457
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
Their punishment.

458
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,800
Feng,

459
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,800
since you know the truth,

460
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,560
you shouldn't stop me.

461
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,400
I know.

462
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,680
I know.

463
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,320
Stop me.

464
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
Don't call me Fang.

465
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,160
You're not the Feng I knew back then.

466
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,680
Now,

467
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,360
you're just the vice chief of the Power Gang,

468
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,280
Liu Suifeng,

469
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,960
who's always defending the Heaven.

470
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,880
I joined the Power Gang

471
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,720
because I had many opportunities.

472
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,320
I'll tell you more about it later.

473
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,520
But now,

474
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,680
I have to get the Hero Power

475
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,280
and find the Heaven Book.

476
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,760
Fang,

477
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,360
I know you have a request.

478
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,880
When I get the Heaven Book,

479
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
I'll definitely lend it to you.

480
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,640
Why do you have to stay with him

481
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,640
and put yourself in danger?

482
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,320
No need.

483
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
I did come for the Heaven Book.

484
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
But not only for the Heaven Book.

485
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,520
I, Tang Fang,

486
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
know what can be done

487
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,960
in this world.

488
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,120
What can't be done.

489
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,640
I'll find

490
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
what I want.

491
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,000
I saved you from hell back then.

492
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,320
I didn't want you

493
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,320
to drag others into hell.

494
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
Fang,

495
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,480
you can't stop me.

496
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,120
Vice Chief Liu,

497
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,640
you're fighting against

498
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,840
a man who's not good at martial arts.

499
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,880
Did you

500
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,880
violate the justice of the martial arts world?

501
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,920
Well said.

502
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Stop.

503
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,160
I'm the son of the Commandant of the Guards.

504
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,600
I can't let you

505
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,640
stay here and make trouble.

506
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
Lord Liang,

508
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,920
why don't you take your Prince of Xiaoyao

509
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
to have a taste of the Soul Water of the Xiao family?

510
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,720
I'm friends with the West Tower's couple.

511
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,320
Not only Soul Water,

512
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
but also the Heavenly Poison.

513
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,640
I want to come too.

514
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,680
Why are you still here?

515
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,760
Do you want to be my friend?

516
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,920
We're far apart.

517
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
See you again.

518
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,120
By the way, Qiu Shui,

519
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
how's your injury?

520
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm fine now.

521
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,920
Thank you for saving my life.

522
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,200
But now,

523
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,720
the Xiao family is in danger.

524
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm afraid we can't hold on for long.

525
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm afraid we can't hold on for long.

526
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,320
Please lend me some horses.

527
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,080
I have to go back now.

528
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,960
Don't worry.

529
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,720
I've prepared

530
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,680
several horses for you.

531
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
You can ride back.

532
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,480
I heard that the two elders of the Shaolin and Wudang Sect

533
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
have gone to the capital.

534
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
You're badly injured now.

535
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,160
I'll go meet them first.

536
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll repay your kindness today.

537
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,920
I'll pay you back in the future.

538
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,800
Chief.

539
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,040
Sui Feng.

540
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,080
Where is the Hero's Necklace?

541
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,400
I'm useless.

542
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,480
I can't get it.

543
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
You've always been careful.

544
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,680
But you're not ready

545
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,760
at the moment

546
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,320
to release the insect.

547
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,680
I don't think

548
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,320
there's anything Mitre 귍

549
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,960
you've been failing in the Taoist world.

550
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,400
I appreciate your help.

551
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,920
You've never had a second thought in your life.

552
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,720
But you've failed many times.

553
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,760
Even if I don't say it,

554
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,400
how can you convince others?

555
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,920
I'll get the Hero's Order back

556
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,240
and give you an explanation.

557
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,280
Tang, Shaolin, Wudang Sect,

558
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,800
these three sects

559
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
have been in the martial arts world for a long time.

560
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,920
But they are all in the world of the Xiao family.

561
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,880
Shaolin and Wudang Sect?

562
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
I just got a secret message.

563
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,040
The two masters of Shaolin and Wudang Sect

564
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,640
have dared to go to the Xiao family.

565
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,200
You go stop them

566
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,360
and send them away.

567
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,320
Yes.

568
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,640
Master, if we fight against

569
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,000
the two sects of Shaolin and Wudang Sect at the same time,

570
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,720
I'm afraid...

571
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,880
What are you afraid of?

572
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,640
I...

573
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,320
Deputy Chief,

574
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,520
Tianzheng's martial arts are strong.

575
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,920
With its internal force, it can pierce through everything.

576
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,920
And Taichan's swordplay is soft.

577
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,560
It's impossible to predict the changes.

578
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,440
Master,

579
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,960
I'm afraid that

580
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,920
we can't win.

581
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,560
If the two of them work together,

582
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,680
they will be in a critical situation.

583
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,640
They need to be tough.

584
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm afraid we won't win.

585
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,160
The chief has a command.

586
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,080
Even if we have to die,

587
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
what's the point?

588
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,440
Yes.

589
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,440
Yes.

590
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,800
But

591
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,800
this time, we have to fight against two sects.

592
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,200
Of course, it's a dangerous situation.

593
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,280
I won't let you die like this.

594
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,880
This time, we have to fight against the sects of the Central Plains Martial Arts.

595
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,080
I have to be wise.

596
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,040
You always have a plan.

597
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,160
Please give me your order.

598
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,440
The people of the Power Sect

599
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,320
have been lurking in the Central Plains Martial Arts for many years.

600
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,440
Now,

601
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,800
it's time to send Yongcheng here.

602
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,720
Junior, be careful.

603
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,600
Yes.

604
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,360
Mo Yan Xia, the White-Eye Guanyin.

605
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,240
Thank you for your help, Master Mo.

606
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm willing to do anything for the Martial Arts.

607
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,240
Good.

608
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,680
Since you're here to send people,

609
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,720
don't blame us for being rude to you.

610
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,920
There are many things that can't be done.

611
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,520
If you can't kill people,

612
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
it's better not to kill them.

613
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
Amitabha.

614
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,800
Master.

615
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,920
Master Tianzhen's crying paper

616
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,240
is indeed famous.

617
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,520
You have created many murders.

618
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,400
You are guilty.

619
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,600
Why don't you put down the knife

620
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,040
and repent for the crimes you have committed?

621
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,160
Old monk, why are you meddling in my affairs?

622
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,760
If I use this to help Shaolin,

623
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,160
will you agree to it?

624
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,960
It's a new scripture.

625
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,000
Yes.

626
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,720
It's a new scripture from the Demon Lord.

627
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,560
It's the most precious treasure of the Buddha.

628
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,160
We want to give it to Shaolin.

629
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,480
If we lose it,

630
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,360
it will be the greatest sorrow of the Buddha.

631
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,640
The scripture is indeed the most precious treasure of the Buddha.

632
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,480
It can't be used to bring justice to the Xiao family.

633
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,520
If that's the case,

634
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,720
then destroy it.

635
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,440
Shan Zai.

636
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,760
It seems that you still can't bear it.

637
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,680
The scripture is indeed the most precious treasure of the Buddha.

638
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,440
Even if you hide the ancient insect inside it

639
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,680
to trick me,

640
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,880
it's still a pity if it's destroyed.

641
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,920
So you know it.

642
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,480
The ancient insect is so powerful.

643
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,760
It can't kill it even if it's not powerful.

644
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,920
What's wrong?

645
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,000
Just a littlele.

646
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,440
Qi tomar

647
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,400
Hong Fenghuang

648
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,800
出來

649
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,700
See, I have come to late

650
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,420
I failed to get Hanjiang's power back.

651
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,900
The Mc 좋을 from the old monk

652
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,820
was lovely.

653
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,540
But I've hurt you in the end.

654
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,660
I tried to extend it by 10iras

655
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,440
but the old monk

656
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,380
couldn't may you eat that up.

657
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,860
Amidun�.

658
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,580
Master, I'll kill them!

659
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,020
If you are to be caught by the devil,

660
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,860
you must not make another move.

661
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,260
Yes, Master!

662
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,020
Master Tian Zheng is the leader of the martial arts world.

663
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,900
You are going to kill him in broad daylight.

664
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,060
Aren't you afraid that the Power Gang

665
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,020
will have a deep feud with Shao Ling?

666
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,540
I'm afraid.

667
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,740
In the future,

668
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,300
Shao Ling, Wudang and Emei

669
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
will be afraid to have a feud with our Power Gang.

670
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,700
Are you trying to

671
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,740
disrupt the entire martial arts world?

672
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,460
Let's make a comparison.

673
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,220
Who is the leader of the martial arts world?

674
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,220
Are you really afraid of them?

675
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Kill them!

676
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,420
Tai Chen, you are here.

677
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
Good luck.

678
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,060
Tian Zheng,

679
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,980
you can still be fooled by these juniors.

680
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
There is no improvement.

681
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,820
Old Tian Zheng,

682
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,820
you are injured.

683
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,060
I will protect you.

684
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,460
When you are in the injury,

685
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,860
we will work together.

686
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,860
I will protect you.

687
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,860
I will protect you.

688
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Why are these juniors of the Power Gang afraid?

689
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Amitabha.

690
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,860
But Master Tian Zheng's internal injury is not light.

691
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
How can he be suppressed on the spot?

692
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,260
Others can't, but Tian Zheng can.

693
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,460
His crying will kill the enemy with tears.

694
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
He will be killed with tears.

695
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,860
He will be healed with the Rong Ji.

696
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,460
He can live or die.

697
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Tian Zheng, I will help you heal.

698
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,660
Then we will fight together.

699
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,260
It will be a good fight.

700
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,060
Good luck.

701
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,260
Leader Mao,

702
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
I will leave them to you.

703
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,460
Come.

704
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,460
Come.

705
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,460
Come.

706
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,460
Come.

707
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,460
Come.

708
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,660
Little girl is a little capable.

709
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,060
She survived before I saw her.

710
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,660
But I still advise you to retreat.

711
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,260
Wudang Kungfu is good.

712
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,460
I will leave Tian Zheng

713
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,860
to kill you all.

714
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,660
It's not a little Kungfu.

715
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,260
But if you want to attack,

716
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,860
if you don't have the ability of Yan Kuang Tu,

717
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,860
don't dream.

718
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,460
We are not the opponents of the leader.

719
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,860
But,

720
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,260
you are poisoned.

721
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,860
Powder of Powder of Powder?

722
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,060
Yes.

723
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060
It's the powder of Powder of Powder of Powder.

724
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,260
I'm afraid you can't get the inner power.

725
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,660
Such a low-class skill

726
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,460
is not suitable for the old La Yu.

727
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,060
Master.

728
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,460
Tian Zheng.

729
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,060
What's going on?

730
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
It's the scripture.

731
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,260
Tian Zheng's sect

732
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,060
killed the insects

733
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
with the crying paper.

734
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,660
These insects are called

735
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,060
the dead early.

736
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Master killed them with crying paper.

737
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,660
They are the early ink

738
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,860
on the scripture.

739
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,060
Then, the scripture

740
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,660
on the big tree.

741
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,260
They are the early ink

742
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,060
on the big tree.

743
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
Then, the scripture

744
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,860
on the big tree.

745
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
When you use the sword to heal the injured,

746
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,060
they will be revived by your magic

747
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,460
and become the insects again.

748
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,460
They will be ingested into your body.

749
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,660
When the real people of Tai Chan help you heal the injured,

750
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,860
the insects will naturally

751
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,260
leave the body of the real people of Tai Chan.

752
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,860
We have made so many efforts

753
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,460
to make you two use the real power

754
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,460
to make the insects work.

755
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,660
If the insects are not

756
