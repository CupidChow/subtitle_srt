1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Break through the light and go far away

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let this city and river be buried in the sea of stars

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When the light shines on the shore of love

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The end of the dark night

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The sword in the night

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's not too late to forget this 100

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let this big cloud of life

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The blood and the wound

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The sword of life has never changed

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let the thousand years be with me

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to wait for you

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The King of Blaze

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 16

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The fat and the milk powder are more suitable for the Chinese baby's body

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let you watch Fushan Sea

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Children don't like to eat, don't grow up

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Use the bone of the dragon mother

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The bone of the dragon mother invites you to watch Fushan Sea

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Miss Tang is right

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Little uncle

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This matter still has to be said to others in advance

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you understand

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Brother Qiushui, I'm back

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let me go

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So many people

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I haven't introduced you to everyone yet

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is Sancai Jianke

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Nice to meet you

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thanks to him for this plan

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Nice to meet you

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sancai

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Not my brother

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your brother

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Do you want to talk to me

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is all my own people

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Your brother said he was too busy to take care of you

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And said he didn't have a brother like you

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I wanted to return Chang Ge's gold to him

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Too much

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:44,000

46
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,940
Moonlight container, tips in tentacles

47
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Novelists

48
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,760
You've come too late.

49
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,560
It's too late now.

50
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,860
Wherever you can find us,

51
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,140
our family will recipient you.

52
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,460
Don't be sure of being worried.

53
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,080
Director DD's never been to our place often,

54
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,460
so I don't want my father to be worried.

55
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,660
Whichever way you go, give them all to her

56
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,300
How is your wound?

57
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,620
Is it good?

58
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,780
It's not bad.

59
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,740
Thank you, Dr. Tang.

60
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,060
Please stop.

61
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,580
What are you saying?

62
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm telling you a real story.

63
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,300
It's true.

64
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
To me,

65
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,340
Hua Clock Trial isCHUCK takes his oath.

66
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,020
He's one of Bundes price.

67
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,980
He is going to confess all the money

68
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,020
they have in her hand to 주的儿 Mis father.

69
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,940
She's my main mistress.

70
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,900
I don't want to lose him.

71
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,140
Because of his secret of hiding you.

72
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,540
We must borrow care from our big brother.

73
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,540
I've always carried it with me.

74
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
It's like a protective suit.

75
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Since you've been protecting the position of the master

76
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
in the valley of insects,

77
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
I'll give this to you.

78
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Just take it as protection.

79
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
I hope you won't be hurt again.

80
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
I'll be hurt again.

81
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Thank you.

82
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,540
Thank you.

83
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Snow Fish

84
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,540
Snow Fish, you can't marry.

85
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
You don't like him at all.

86
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
We've seen and seen Snow Fish grow up.

87
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,540
No matter what, we can't make it difficult for him.

88
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
By the way, sister,

89
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,540
your own happiness should be in your own hands.

90
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
No one can force you.

91
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
Snow Fish,

92
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,540
I'll find you a strong, wise and wise sister

93
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
who is as beautiful as a flower.

94
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
Don't worry.

95
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Snow Fish

96
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
Father, mother,

97
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
I'm going to get married today.

98
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Now the Xiao family needs me.

99
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
I can't live only for myself.

100
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,540
I can't live for my family.

101
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
I can't live for myself.

102
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,540
I can't live only for myself.

103
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,540
I can't live only for myself.

104
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I can't live only for myself.

105
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
You will support my choice,

106
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
right?

107
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Do you like it?

108
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Do you like it?

109
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Yes.

110
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,540
Have some bread.

111
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Thank you, sister.

112
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,540
Brother.

113
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
Very beautiful.

114
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
You are really beautiful today.

115
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
How is it?

116
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Are you ready?

117
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,540
I suddenly remembered

118
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,540
that you were so beautiful today.

119
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
I was so happy.

120
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
I was so happy.

121
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,540
I was so happy.

122
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
I suddenly remembered

123
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
that I still have a lot of herbs

124
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
that I haven't cut.

125
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
I will trouble you later.

126
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,540
I will help you keep them.

127
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,540
I remember when I was young,

128
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,540
I fell down the cliff

129
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,540
to pick herbs.

130
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Fortunately, I was found by you in time

131
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
and I was able to save them.

132
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Later,

133
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,540
whenever I needed any herbs,

134
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
you could always notice them carefully

135
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,540
and picked them for me.

136
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,540
Thank you very much.

137
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Xue Yun,

138
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
the person you are talking about

139
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,540
should not be me.

140
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Not you?

141
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
At that time, it was my third brother.

142
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
He always went to the back hill

143
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,540
and carried a bag of herbs.

144
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
He was badly injured.

145
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,540
My father always said

146
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
that he was too young

147
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,540
and that he had beaten him several times.

148
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
I didn't expect

149
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
that it was Qiu Shui.

150
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Anyway, Xue Yun,

151
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,540
thank you for everything you did for the Xiao family.

152
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Please take back what you said just now.

153
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,540
I am from the Xiao family.

154
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
My parents raised me

155
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
and loved me.

156
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
I naturally want to

157
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,540
protect the Xiao family.

158
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
Okay.

159
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
Help!

160
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
Don't be afraid.

161
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540
Don't be afraid.

162
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,540
Don't be afraid.

163
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
You must be the one.

164
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
The sister Xue Yun who was born in the new generation.

165
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
I am the one.

166
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
I am the one.

167
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
I am the one.

168
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
I am the one.

169
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Yes, you are the new born.

170
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
You are the new daughter of the Xiao family.

171
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
I have a sister.

172
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
Sister.

173
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,540
Slow down.

174
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
Brother.

175
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Brother.

176
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Do you miss me?

177
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Do you miss me?

178
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Mother.

179
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Miss, it's late.

180
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Young Master San.

181
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
Uncle Liang.

182
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,540
What's wrong with you today?

183
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Miss, you are going to marry the Miao family.

184
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
Brother.

185
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
Brother.

186
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Brother.

187
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
You are out there

188
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
in the middle of the night.

189
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
Why are you so angry?

190
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Why are you so eager to come back?

191
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,540
Tell me.

192
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
Why did you let your sister

193
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
marry into the Nangong family?

194
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Now the matter of the Xiao family

195
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
has nothing to do with you.

196
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
As long as she is my sister,

197
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
I have the right to know.

198
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Tell me.

199
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
Is it because of someone else

200
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
that you are so angry?

201
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Or you are forcing her

202
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
to stop her from being unreasonable?

203
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
I am not unreasonable.

204
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
Tell me.

205
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Is she willing to do it?

206
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,540
Or is it because

207
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,540
this marriage

208
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
is related to your family?

209
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Enough.

210
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
As the eldest son of the Xiao family,

211
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
you are the one who is responsible for the Xiao family.

212
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
How can you understand?

213
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
As a member of the Xiao family,

214
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,540
you should support the Xiao family

215
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
and protect the food.

216
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
Brother.

217
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
We still have three brothers.

218
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
Why did you let your sister

219
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
be with him all her life?

220
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,540
Brother,

221
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
stop blaming Brother.

222
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
Didn't you see

223
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,540
the situation in the family?

224
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
We offended the Power Gang.

225
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
All the sects in the capital

226
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
are in a hurry to stop us.

227
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
Even the younger children in the family

228
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,540
are all relying on Tang Song.

229
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,540
What can Brother do?

230
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,540
Now Xue Yu can marry into the Nangong family,

231
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
but it's not a big deal.

232
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,540
It's just a kind of cover.

233
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Cover?

234
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
Brother.

235
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
Brother.

236
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,540
Tang Song is in a state of emergency.

237
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,540
You don't have to worry

238
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,540
about Tang Men anymore.

239
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,540
Tang Men?

240
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,540
How do you know?

241
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
Tang Men and the Xiao family

242
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,540
are not a match.

243
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
What?

244
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,540
Now you and Tang Men

245
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
are not a match?

246
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
I went to Tang Men

247
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,540
just to get rid of the power gang

248
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
and destroy the sects in the capital.

249
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm not angry with them.

250
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
Brother.

251
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,540
Can you be honest

252
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
and answer my question?

253
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Now you're going to Tang Men

254
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
for others?

255
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
What?

256
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Do you want me to show my respect for you?

257
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,540
I'm afraid you'll cause trouble for the Xiao family.

258
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
Anyway, now you have no right

259
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
to say anything to the Xiao family.

260
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
I don't.

261
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
I really don't.

262
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Brother, Qiushui.

263
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,540
Sister.

264
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Qiushui.

265
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,540
I'm glad you came today.

266
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Qiushui.

267
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
Sister.

268
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,540
As long as you say you don't want to,

269
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,540
no one can take you away.

270
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,540
I'm willing to do it for the Xiao family.

271
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Sister.

272
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
No.

273
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,540
The Nangong family is rich and powerful.

274
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
The world is peaceful.

275
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,540
No one wants to have a good support.

276
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,540
This is good for the Xiao family

277
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
and for me.

278
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
I know it.

279
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,540
I'll be relieved.

280
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,540
You don't have to argue.

281
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
I'm fine.

282
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,540
The moon is about to fall.

283
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,540
The wind blows like a long string.

284
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,540
The past is left behind in the rain.

285
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,540
It's a little different.

286
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,540
The earth is full of sorrow.

287
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
The city is always like a wind.

288
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
Sister.

289
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,540
I'll support anyone you want to find.

290
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,540
Of course, it's the good thing of the world.

291
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
You need to be good at martial arts.

292
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,540
You need to be good at your work.

293
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
Of course, the integrity is more important.

294
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,540
You need to be kind and considerate.

295
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,540
The wind and snow are different.

296
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,540
The road is so narrow.

297
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,540
The world is full of sorrow.

298
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
The past is left behind in the rain.

299
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,540
The city is always like a wind.

300
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,540
The wind blows like a long string.

301
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,540
The city is always like a wind.

302
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
Who made the Xiao family so rude?

303
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Qiuxue.

304
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
Are you okay?

305
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,540
Brother.

306
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,540
Sister doesn't want to get married to Nangong family, right?

307
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
The moon is about to fall.

308
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,540
But it's not that she promised her.

309
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,540
The past is left behind in the rain.

310
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,540
The city is always like a wind.

311
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,540
She said those words

312
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,540
The world is full of sorrow.

313
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
The world is full of sorrow.

314
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
She just doesn't want to get married.

315
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,540
The city is always like a wind.

316
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,540
Sister doesn't want to get married.

317
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Xiao Xueyu is not always like this.

318
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
She is too sensible.

319
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,540
So she always neglects herself.

320
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
But brother.

321
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
You know sister will be like this.

322
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,540
Why don't you stop brother?

323
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
I'm not stopping brother.

324
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,540
When mother was alive.

325
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,540
She treated her as her own daughter.

326
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,540
But now mother is gone.

327
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,540
Xueyu is forced to get married.

328
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Nangong family took the sword of our family.

329
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
If Xueyu doesn't agree to marry them.

330
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,540
They will not return the sword.

331
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
Brother has no way.

332
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,540
He doesn't want the sword to be left behind.

333
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,540
The wind blows the bird away.

334
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
The moon passes the city and the north and west.

335
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,540
Freedom is not only a gun, but also a good cause.

336
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
The world is full of sorrow.

337
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,540
The city is always like a wind.

338
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,540
The city is always like a wind.

339
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
The world is full of sorrow.

340
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
The city is always like a wind.

341
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,540
The city is always like a wind.

342
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,540
The moon is long.

343
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,540
The people are small.

344
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,540
The flowers fall and the rain falls.

345
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
The heart is like a piece of jade.

346
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,540
The tears are falling.

347
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Nangong family.

348
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,540
Take good care of yourself.

349
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,540
If anything happens.

350
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Xueyu is gone.

351
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
If he is gone.

352
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,540
I don't want to cause trouble to my family.

353
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,540
Brother, don't worry.

354
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,540
I will be a good man.

355
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,540
I will be a good man.

356
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
I will be a good man.

357
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,540
I will be a good man.

358
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,540
I will be a good man.

359
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,540
I will be a good man.

360
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,540
I will be a good man.

361
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,540
I will be a good man.

362
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,540
I will be a good man.

363
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
I will be a good man.

364
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,540
I will be a good man.

365
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,540
I will be a good man.

366
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,540
I will be a good man.

367
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,540
I will be a good man.

368
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,540
I will be a good man.

369
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,540
I will be a good man.

370
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,540
I will be a good man.

371
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,540
I will be a good man.

372
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,540
I will be a good man.

373
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,540
I will be a good man.

374
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,540
I will be a good man.

375
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,540
I will be a good man.

376
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,540
I will be a good man.

377
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,540
I will be a good man.

378
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,540
I will be a good man.

379
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,540
I will be a good man.

380
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,540
I will be a good man.

381
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,540
I will be a good man.

382
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,540
Who are you?

383
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,540
What are you doing?

384
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Who am I?

385
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,540
I am your husband.

386
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,540
Of course, I am doing

387
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,540
the good thing of painting the bridal chamber.

388
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,540
Come, let's drink a little.

389
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,540
Get out of here!

390
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,540
The one who married me

391
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,540
has always been a man without a wound.

392
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,540
What are you?

393
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Stop pretending!

394
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
Xiao Xueyu, I am telling you.

395
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,540
I know you are not easy to deal with.

396
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,980
You have put the

397
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,540
spell on me in advance.

398
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,540
When your brother Xiao Yiren came to the wedding for the first time,

399
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,540
he was so angry that

400
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540
the one who married you

401
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,540
has always been me, Nangong Han.

402
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,540
Brother, you can't do this.

403
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,540
You are lying to my brother.

404
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,540
Although the Xiao family is now in decline,

405
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,540
in the end,

406
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Yu Nangong family is a family of scholars.

407
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,540
How can you be so deceitful?

408
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
Stop it.

409
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
Xueyu, come on.

410
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Is this your brother's suicide note?

411
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,540
He wrote this himself.

412
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
You don't know him, do you?

413
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
It's good that you understand.

414
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
Don't play any love story with me here.

415
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Think about

416
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
what the Xiao family is like now.

417
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Your brother Xiao Yiren

418
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,540
doesn't even have a family sword.

419
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,540
I, Nangong Han, can marry you.

420
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,540
That's because I admire you.

421
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,540
Even if I die,

422
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,540
I will never obey you.

423
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
Really?

424
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
Let me see.

425
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,540
Sister, let's go.

426
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,540
No one

427
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
can force you to do anything.

428
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
Remember this.

429
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
I, Xiao Xueyu,

430
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,540
have nothing to do with you.

431
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,540
Changge Sword?

432
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,540
From today on,

433
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
if the Nangong family

434
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,540
wants to offend the Xiao family again,

435
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
don't blame me for being ruthless.

436
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,540
Let's go.

437
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
Xiao Jiu Shui!

438
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,540
Sister, don't worry.

439
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
It's safe here.

440
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,540
The Nangong family doesn't dare to come here.

441
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,540
I will

442
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,540
discuss with my brother.

443
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,540
I took the responsibility.

444
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
I want to repay

445
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,540
my parents' kindness.

446
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
I want to be a good daughter

447
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,540
to my father.

448
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,540
I want to be a good daughter

449
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
to my father.

450
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
I want to

451
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,540
rebuild the family

452
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,540
and do my best for the Xiao family.

453
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,540
But I didn't expect

454
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,540
that my brother and sister

455
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,540
would not trust me

456
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
in the end.

457
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,540
This is ridiculous.

458
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
Sister,

459
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
you shouldn't

460
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,540
use your life as a bargaining chip.

461
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,540
You can't risk your life.

462
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Brother is even more ridiculous.

463
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
My parents

464
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,540
have guarded the family for a lifetime.

465
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,540
How can the Xiao family

466
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,540
be saved by the Shen Family?

467
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,540
On my way to the Nangong family,

468
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,540
I remembered a lot of things.

469
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,540
I remembered the first time

470
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,540
my parents took me home.

471
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,540
When I was young,

472
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,540
you told me

473
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,540
to let go of the past.

474
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,540
You made me

475
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,540
really think of myself as a member of the Xiao family.

476
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Qiushui,

477
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,540
it was really great

478
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,540
to be with our family

479
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,540
at that time.

480
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,540
Sister,

481
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,540
I don't dare to

482
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,540
take revenge

483
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,540
for the family

484
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
who raised me.

485
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,540
We should respect and understand each other.

486
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,540
In this world,

487
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,540
no one

488
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,540
is qualified to

489
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,540
force you to do what you don't want to do.

490
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,540
And you

491
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
shouldn't have such thoughts.

492
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,540
You should love yourself

493
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,540
and do what you want.

494
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,540
This is

495
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,540
what all the true feelings

496
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,540
and what your family

497
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,540
want.

498
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,540
I understand.

499
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,540
Don't worry.

500
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,540
Since I can

501
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
save you from the Nangong family,

502
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,540
I won't allow anyone

503
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,540
to hurt you and force you to do what you don't want to do.

504
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,540
If I meet

505
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,540
someone like this, I will break his head

506
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
and kick his head.

507
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,540
Qiushui,

508
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
thank you.

509
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,540
Thank you.

510
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,540
We are family.

511
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
It's a little bit

512
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,540
strange to say this.

513
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,540
Sister,

514
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,540
the Qu family

515
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,540
lives here.

516
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,540
When the time comes,

517
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,540
you should tell them

518
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,540
and take care of yourself.

519
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
I guess they will give you some soup now.

520
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
I'll go and find them.

521
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Qiushui,

522
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,540
I thank you

523
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
not only for what you did today,

524
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,540
but also

525
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
for saving me

526
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,540
when I was picking herbs.

527
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
Thank you for

528
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,540
picking those precious herbs

529
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,540
for me all the time.

530
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,540
We are family.

531
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
In the future,

532
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
no matter what danger you encounter,

533
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
I will come to save you first.

534
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Alright.

535
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,540
I won't say it.

536
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
Besides, you think I'm talking nonsense.

537
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,540
I think

538
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,540
we should look forward to everything.

539
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,540
We are brothers and sisters.

540
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
We will never separate.

541
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
I used to

542
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,540
talk nonsense about you.

543
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Today, you are the one

544
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,540
who is talking nonsense about me.

545
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Alright.

546
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,540
You have lost weight.

547
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,540
I'll go get you some soup.

548
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Qiushui,

549
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,540
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
I'm sorry.

551
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,540
I'm sorry.

552
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,540
I'm sorry.

553
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,540
I'm sorry.

554
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,540
I'm sorry.

555
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,540
I'm sorry.

556
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,540
I'm sorry.

557
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,540
I'm sorry.

558
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,540
I'm sorry.

559
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
I'm sorry.

560
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm sorry.

561
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,540
I'm sorry.

562
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,540
I'm sorry.

563
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,540
I'm sorry.

564
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,540
I'm sorry.

565
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,540
I'm sorry.

566
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Tang Fang.

567
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,540
I saw you were busy.

568
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,540
So I waited outside for you to come out.

569
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
You are...

570
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,180
Women's troubles are the same.

571
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,020
You saved Sister Xue Yu.

572
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
I'm very happy.

573
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,900
Sister Xue Yu is trapped in the Nangong family.

574
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,300
That's no different from my situation in the Peach Blossom Clique.

575
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,980
So I'm very glad you went.

576
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,660
This way, she'll be safe.

577
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,940
Thank you.

578
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
I received a letter from my father.

579
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,300
I heard that they have a mess waiting for me to clean up.

580
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Since your wound has healed,

581
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,180
I'll go back first.

582
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
Will it be troublesome?

583
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Those are all minor problems.

584
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,620
Once I'm done, I'll go back.

585
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
I'll be back.

586
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
I'll be back.

587
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,940
I'll be back.

588
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,740
Okay.

589
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,740
Let's go to the North.

590
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,140
If you can find out the secret of the book,

591
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,140
then your father will be saved.

592
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
Boss!

593
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
As you expected,

594
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,940
Nangong Wushang and his men have already gone to the Xiao family's house.

595
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,940
The Xiao family doesn't even care about our Nangong family.

596
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,940
Mr. Nangong, what are you doing?

597
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
You still don't understand?

598
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,940
Xiao Yiren, the Nangong family gave you face.

599
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
You said you'd take care of the financial affairs.

600
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,940
My eldest brother hasn't finished his class yet.

601
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,940
The bride was taken away by the three of them?

602
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,940
What are you playing at?

603
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,940
Didn't Xue Yu marry you to Nangong Wushang?

604
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,940
What's going on?

605
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,940
Xiao Qiushui doesn't have the ability.

606
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Besides, she's not part of the Xiao family anymore.

607
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,940
She's not?

608
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
The one Xiao Qiushui is holding

609
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,940
is the Xiao family's master, Jian Changge.

610
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,940
What?

611
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
Changge is in the hands of Qiushui?

612
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,940
Big brother, what's going on?

613
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
Xiao Yiren, since you can't be the master,

614
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,940
why are you pretending to be the head of the family?

615
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,940
I don't want the marriage.

616
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
As long as you give the money to the Fenghuan family,

617
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,940
and compensate for all the losses of the Nangong family,

618
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,940
5,000 taels will be enough.

619
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,940
Nangong family, don't be so shameless.

620
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,940
5,000 taels, why don't you go and grab it?

621
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Even if I take all your family today,

622
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
I have to take it away.

623
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,940
How dare you!

624
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,940
How dare you be so impudent!

625
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,940
Resistance is not about death.

626
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
I must live on it!

627
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,940
If you move an inch away,

628
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,940
I'll save myself!

629
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,740
тутi

630
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,940
Qiushui

631
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Xiao Qiushui

632
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
The mejorang of Nangong family

633
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,940
If he chose to become the head of the family,

634
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,140
I'll send them back together.

635
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,820
Let's go.

636
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,740
Third Brother.

637
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,860
You've recovered your martial arts.

638
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,700
You're still so good.

639
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,020
Your martial arts have improved.

640
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,180
Your ability to cause trouble has improved too.

641
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,780
If you say

642
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,180
I brought back the blood and jade from the Nangong family,

643
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,340
then I'm not wrong.

644
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,740
Eldest Brother,

645
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,900
you were wrong.

646
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,900
Let me ask you.

647
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,740
Is Changge Sword really in your hands?

648
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,380
When I got Changge Sword,

649
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,220
I planned to bring it back to Eldest Brother.

650
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,460
But now,

651
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,660
it seems that Eldest Brother doesn't need it anymore.

652
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,660
As the daughter of the Xiao family,

653
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,340
the one who can make the Xiao family proud

654
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,380
should be responsible for everything.

655
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,260
But I don't agree.

656
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,940
Eldest Brother should do it this way.

657
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,540
Xiao Qiushui!

658
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,660
Qiushui!

659
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,820
Qiuxue,

660
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,260
Qiushui,

661
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,500
it hurts so bad.

662
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,380
Qiushui,

663
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,660
I'm so cold.

664
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,100
How is it?

665
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,500
It hurts.

666
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,860
You're so strong.

667
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,100
You're still so weak.

668
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,380
You're a coward.

669
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,660
Then I'll be a coward.

670
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,460
Brother Qiu Zhen, look.

671
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,060
I found this eagle butterfly

672
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,380
in the secret room of the King of Sword's bedroom.

673
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:11,220
The eagle would fly away without flinching in the wind.

674
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,680
He'll be a heroommen used by all the soldiers on Marine Corps.

675
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,160
We can't join his army in vain.

676
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,160
The city always the same

677
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,160
The song of the mountain is moving

678
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,160
The summer is in my heart

679
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
The world is just a little bit

680
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
A few words of sighing

681
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
The time is fast

682
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
After a thousand miles of wind and rain

683
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,160
I run to the roadside to find my happiness

684
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,160
I run to the roadside to find my happiness

685
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
The world is just a little bit

686
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,160
A few words of sighing

687
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,160
The time is fast

688
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
After a thousand miles of wind and rain

689
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,160
I run to the roadside to find my happiness

690
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
The world is just a little bit

691
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,160
A few words of sighing

692
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,160
The time is fast

693
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
After a thousand miles of wind and rain

694
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,160
I run to the roadside to find my happiness

695
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,160
I don't know how to do a happy life

696
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
So I drink repeatedly

697
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
I drank too much

698
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,160
So I laugh at the world

699
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
The world is just a little bit

700
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,160
A few words of sighing

701
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
I will be your soldier

702
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
I will be your soldier

703
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
I will be your soldier

704
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
I will be your soldier

705
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
I will be your soldier

706
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
I will be your soldier

707
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
I will be your soldier

708
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
I will be your soldier

709
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,160
I will be your soldier

710
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I will be your soldier

711
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I will be your soldier

712
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
I will be your soldier

713
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I will be your soldier

714
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
I will be your soldier

715
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,160
I will be your soldier
