1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
Let the blood flow in the rain

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,920
The sword has never been changed

3
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
Thousands of years have passed, I have grown

4
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,440
I want to wait for you to come

5
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,720
The wind is not strong

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,440
The waves are strong

7
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,120
Break through the sky and look forward

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Let this city and river be together again

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,720
When the light comes, the love will be seen

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,320
The end of the dark night, the sword in the night

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
I don't forget this 100

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
Let the blood flow in the rain

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,040
The sword has never been changed

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,640
Thousands of years have passed, I have grown

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,720
I want to wait for you to come

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,440
Big brother

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Everyone's bond has been untied

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
If you don't want to believe him, you can take a revenge

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,320
Minister Xiao

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,520
Yesterday in the critical moment, you saved us

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
What do you think of his words

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
Li Chenzhou is strange

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,640
Now it is different from where he was born

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,600
And it must not be defeated

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
Now the front line is important

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
Hope these treasures can meet the needs of the front-line soldiers

27
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
But today everyone who came to the South Heaven

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,600
Including my family

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,920
With the grudge of the power group

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
For the time being

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
Master Li

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
If you want the whole martial arts world to be happy with you

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
Then let the whole martial arts world witness your words today

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,520
I will ask for it

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
Ok

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,880
It's a deal

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
Since the Minister Xiao has spoken

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
My Haisa Gang also admitted

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
Today I don't want all the revenge of the Haisa Gang

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
All for the front-line soldiers

41
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
We don't need the one from the department

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,960
We don't want it either

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,920
We don't want it either

44
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
We don't want it either

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
We don't want it either

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
I don't want it

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,840
All for the front line

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,960
All for the front line

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,760
All for the front line

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
I don't want my share

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,760
We don't want it

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,560
We don't want this

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,160
This is a matter of the front line

54
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Sir, you can't sit

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,040
Sir, you can't sit

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,480
Go

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,360
Forget it

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Be alive

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,400

You mother willl have to kill us.

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,280
Yes.

63
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,900
They killed w und their fathers and relatives.

64
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,100
You should listen to them.

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,540
I haven't killed them.

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,520
You must ageand die in here.

67
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,520
Go.

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:06,920
Go.

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,460
Go.

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,460
Kill them.

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,000
Kill!

72
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,840
Go!

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,280

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,080
I to first!

75
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,900
Put this in his homework.

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,060
What?

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,760
You can see for yourself.

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,160
The North Wilderness Man.

79
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,400
The North Wilderness Man?

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
How could it be?

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,520
You brought the North Wilderness Man here.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,760
You should ask yourself.

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,760
Shut up!

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,800
How could you be the North Wilderness Man?

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,440
Didn't you help the Xiao family?

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
You brought us here.

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
You know who we are.

88
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,840
You know it, don't you?

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Yiren.

90
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,760
What's going on?

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,840
They are the new Xiao family disciples.

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,680
Brother.

93
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,600
Someone is trying to harm you.

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,200
Tell me.

95
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,280
Why did you pretend to be the Xiao family disciples?

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,000
You tried to harm me.

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
You got the name of the North Wilderness Man.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
Why?

99
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,720
You are a nobody.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,520
It's not our turn to harm you.

101
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,640
Xiao Yiren.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,480
I didn't expect you to fall down here

103
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,040
and collude with the North Wilderness Man.

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
It's not like that.

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,520
No.

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,840
They...

107
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
They were going to help me

108
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,840
rebuild the Xiao family.

109
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,360
Why would they do that?

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
Why would they do that?

111
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,880
I'm still asking you.

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,800
Who is inside?

113
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,760
And who is it?

114
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Yiren.

115
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
Who is it?

116
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Why would he do that?

117
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,840

118
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,880

Even if 놔 wanted to Killing talk

by their own family

125
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,500
My eldest brother said

We'll wait for you to investigate this matter.

134
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
The Power Gang is not a small-minded person.

135
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
If the Power Gang

136
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
keeps its promise

137
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,240

the Ocean Sand Gang

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,080
will also do its best

140
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,200
to help us.

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,040
Yes.

142
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,200
The plan to save the king

143
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,440
should be helped.

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,200
Let's send the item out first.

145
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Well said.

00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,400
the chief has something to tell me.

151
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,480
The subsequent affairs of the treasure

152
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,880
will be handled by Young Hero Xiao.

153
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
As for your parents' bodies,

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,360
when the matter is over,

155
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,480
the Power Gang will send someone to send them back to the Xiao family.

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,760
Let's go.

157
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,920
The Power Gang just left?

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,520
Yes.

159
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,280
Li Chen Zhou was very careful.

160
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
He used this to eliminate the suspiciousness.

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
He even took the risk

162
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,920
to buy the God's heart.

163
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,040
Young Hero Xiao.

if you hadn't helped us,

168
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,280
we would have been dead.

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,640
The grace of saving lives is like making a new one.

170
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,440
Please accept our respect.

Young Hero Xiao,

the Ocean Sand Gang

175
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,160
has always been ungrateful.

176
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,480
We have seen your ability today.

177
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800

I'll send someone to help you

188
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,400
Why are you so rude to my people?

189
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,920
You lied to me to lure the North Emperor

190
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,040
to take the treasure in the South Heaven.

191
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,040
Who are you?

192
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,880
Xiao Yiren,

193
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,040
it doesn't matter who I am.

194
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,680
You should know

195
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,200
that you can only get out

196
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,520
by relying on me.

197
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,520
You used the Xiao family to lure the North Emperor

198
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
to the South Heaven.

199
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,320
What's your purpose?

200
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,520
You may not know,

201
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,760
when the North Emperor was in the capital,

202
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,480
the imperial jade seal of the Daxi State

203
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,680
was stolen.

204
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,240
It was stolen by the treasure.

205
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,400
If you can get the jade seal

206
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,720
and return it to the state,

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
you will do a great thing

208
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,160
for Daxi State.

209
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,960
What?

210
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,720
You mean the North Emperor stole the jade seal

211
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,680
and gave it to His Majesty?

212
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,880
How is that possible?

213
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,440
You've been in the underworld for a long time.

214
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm afraid you can't guess what's going on in the palace.

215
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,800
Think about it.

216
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
If the North Emperor

217
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
returns the jade seal to the state,

218
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,200
the Daxi State will be destroyed.

219
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,120
The people will be destroyed, too.

220
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,360
Isn't that a good thing?

221
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,920
What about the northern part of the country?

222
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,880
Will we never be able to

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,760
take the jade seal back

224
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,960
and reunite with Daxi State?

225
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,280
Taking the jade seal back

226
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,280
is just a wish of your people.

227
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,280
In fact, His Majesty

228
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,360
doesn't want to fight with the North Emperor.

229
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
His Majesty just lacks the opportunity

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
to communicate with the North Emperor.

231
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,480
Xiao Zhangmen,

232
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,320
I've given you a good opportunity

233
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,920
to help the two sides

234
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,440
to do as you wish.

235
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,160
If that's the case,

236
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
then the Xiao family

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,200
will never be

238
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,280
the sinners who sell the country.

239
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,040
The country and the world

240
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,560
are not for you to worry about.

241
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,320
If His Majesty is satisfied,

242
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
he will reward the Xiao family.

243
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,400
By then,

244
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
you can give the Huahua Sword Sect

245
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,640
a jade seal and a gold plaque.

246
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,400
Not only the Jindu Martial Arts Society,

247
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,000
but also the Central Plains Martial Arts Society

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,640
will be under your control.

249
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,040
Who are you?

250
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,240
Who are you?

251
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Great.

252
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,960
You're all back.

253
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,000
Qiushui.

254
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,840
Boss, you're finally back.

255
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,000
You're back.

256
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,400
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

257
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,720
Look, it's all ready.

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,520
It's all the same.

259
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Young Master Xiao, are you satisfied?

260
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,240
I, Xiao Qiushui,

261
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,920
thank you for your help.

262
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,720
You don't have to be so polite.

263
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,680
From now on, we're a family.

264
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,320
We will go to all the martial arts circles

265
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,920
and listen to the request of the God's Will.

266
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
Since you're satisfied,

267
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,440
we can rest assured.

268
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,800
We'll take our leave now.

269
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,480
Please.

270
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:26,960
Please.

271
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,520
Please.

272
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,080
Please.

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,560
Boss,

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,240
go to the martial arts circle and have a look.

275
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,680
I made it myself.

276
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,920
No.

277
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
What do you mean by you made it yourself?

278
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
We all made it together.

279
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes.

280
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
We all made it together.

281
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,040
They made it together too.

282
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,520
Okay.

283
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,360
Then today,

284
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,880
let's all

285
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,840
have a drink.

286
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,600
It's a good wine.

287
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,040
Of course, we can't leave you alone.

288
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,400
But...

289
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
Master Zuoqiu,

290
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,800
what do you think I'm doing?

291
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,080
What do you think I'm doing?

292
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,200
I have something to do. I'll leave first.

293
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,800
It's okay.

294
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,680
Third Brother.

295
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,680
Third Brother.

296
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,880
Third Brother.

297
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,200
Third...

298
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,640
Second Brother.

299
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,680
Second Brother.

300
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,160
Second Brother.

301
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,040
Qiu Shui.

302
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,600
How are you?

303
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Why are you injured?

304
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
My brother and I

305
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,240
are from the North Emperor.

306
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,720
But we didn't expect that

307
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
my brother disappeared in a blink of an eye.

308
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,200
The South Heaven is a dead end.

309
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I had no choice

310
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,160
but to leave on my own.

311
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,840
Third Young Master.

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,680
Third Young Master.

313
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,680
Zhao Shirong brought the body of Lady Yang here.

314
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,040
Madam.

315
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,240
I was really afraid.

316
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,160
You don't have to worry.

317
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,040
I've warned you several times

318
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,920
not to be too control.

319
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,920
I promise you

320
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
not to make major mistakes.

321
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,480
I have warned you already.

322
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,200
The greatest because of you

323
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:28,040
will not bring 제가

324
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,720
to heaven tomorrow.

325
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Father.

326
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Mother.

327
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Father.

328
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Mother.

329
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Zhao... Zhao Shiyi.

330
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Zhao Shiyi.

331
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Zhao Shiyi.

332
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Zhao Shiyi.

333
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Zhao Shiyi.

334
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Your power gang

335
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
caused the Xiao family to be destroyed.

336
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Today,

337
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I came here with my parents.

338
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I, Xiao Gaiyin,

339
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,160
will die in the blood.

340
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Brother. Brother.

341
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Please wait.

342
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
He is Li Chenzhou.

343
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
He sent people to search for my parents' dead bodies.

344
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Brother.

345
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
At that time,

346
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Li Chenzhou said

347
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
that my parents and the entire Xiao family

348
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
were not killed by the power gang.

349
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
He said that

350
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
the murderer was someone else.

351
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Qiu Shui.

352
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
The power gang is the murderer.

353
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
How can you be fooled by them?

354
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
He showed me

355
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
the evidence that I had to believe.

356
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Li Chenzhou promised me

357
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
that he would bring back

358
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
my parents' bodies in three days.

359
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
He also told me

360
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
that he would expose the murderer

361
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
who killed my parents

362
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
and my mother.

363
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Since everyone is here today,

364
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
tell me.

365
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,160
What else did Li Chenzhou say?

366
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
What else did he say?

367
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,280
Your parents were killed by the

368
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Lost Token.

369
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Lost Token?

370
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

371
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
The Lost Token

372
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
is the skill left by Tuoshan Patriarch

373
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
decades ago.

374
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
Qiu Shui.

375
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Don't listen to the wall anymore.

376
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,160
He just wants to help the power gang.

377
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
I don't believe it.

378
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Iron Sand is the evidence.

379
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
I've used two needles

380
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
to force the Iron Sand

381
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
to be kept in their bodies

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
and to guard the dark place.

383
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
You'll know when you see it.

384
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Who is this person?

385
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Tuoshan Patriarch

386
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
was the one who spread the news

387
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
decades ago.

388
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Who did he pass the skill to?

389
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
According to my investigation,

390
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
there are only three disciples

391
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
who were sent by him.

392
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
They are from the famous

393
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
three clans of the southern martial arts.

394
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
One of them

395
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
is Fei Clan, one of the three clans.

396
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
The other one

397
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
is the clans of the Hai Ling Sword Sect.

398
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
The clans of the Hai Ling Sword Sect

399
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
are the clans of the Tartars.

400
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
The three clans

401
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
are the clans of the Tartars.

402
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
The Tartars are the clans

403
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
of the Tartars.

404
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
My family?

405
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Zhao Shirong,

406
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
do you have any evidence?

407
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Yuhan.

408
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Who is the third one?

409
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
The third one is Tang clan.

410
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
That's right.

411
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
This skill is very hard.

412
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Only men can practice it.

413
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
The one who practices this skill

414
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
is Tang Yaoshun.

415
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Don't get me wrong.

416
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
My father has been ill for many years.

417
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
He never left the Tang clan in the past year.

418
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
The skill of the Tartar

419
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
requires the transfer of the power.

420
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
The power of the Tartar

421
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
is the power of the body.

422
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
So it's impossible that he is my father.

423
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
That's right.

424
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Tang Yaoshun's inner power

425
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
has been half damaged.

426
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
He can never use it again.

427
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,160
So the murderer who killed your parents

428
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
should be among the other two clans.

429
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
The cultivator of the Fei Clan

430
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,160
is the Fei Clan Leader, Fei Yuqiao.

431
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,160
The one from the Deng Clan is Deng Qingfeng.

432
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Brother.

433
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
I've never seen my father use this skill.

434
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
I've never heard that

435
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
he is a Toshan Patriarch.

436
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Yuhan.

437
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I don't believe your father

438
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
will harm Miss Xiao.

439
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
If so,

440
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I'll go to the Fei Yuqiao of the Fei Clan first

441
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
and test her martial arts.

442
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Then I'll know the result.

443
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Wait.

444
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Before leaving,

445
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
I'd like to ask you to go somewhere.

446
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Chen Zhou said

447
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
he has something important to tell you.

448
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I'd like to ask you

449
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
to go to the power gang's headquarters.

450
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Okay.

451
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
This can give you

452
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
the freedom to use it.

453
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Goodbye.

454
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Father.

455
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
I want to bury the pearl in the soil.

456
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Please go down the mountain

457
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:20,120
and prepare for the

458
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Xie'ai.

459
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
You promised the power gang's headquarters

460
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
so you're not afraid that they'll harm you.

461
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Maybe it's good

462
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
to wait for other clues.

463
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Be careful.

464
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Mother.

465
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Father.

466
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
I finally found you.

467
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
I finally found you.

468
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I finally found you.

469
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
I finally found you.

470
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
I finally found you.

471
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
I finally found you.

472
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I finally found you.

473
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I finally found you.

474
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
I finally found you.

475
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
I finally found you.

476
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
I finally found you.

477
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
I finally found you.

478
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
I finally found you.

479
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
I finally found you.

480
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I finally found you.

481
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,160
I finally found you.

482
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
I finally found you.

483
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
I have a crazy idea.

484
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Is there anyone here

485
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
who is the same as me?

486
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Maybe

487
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
there's another one.

488
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
What?

489
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Go back.

490
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
What?

491
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
What?

492
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Come back.

493
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Let's restart.

494
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,060
Reset.

495
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,100
Reset the appears of the roles.

496
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Once more.

497
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,360
Reset. Reset. Reset.

498
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,400
Mingming.

499
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,280
Today is the day of the snow-capped festival.

500
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,240
Why haven't you come?

501
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,180
It has begun.

502
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,560
Go for it.

503
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,760
I saw it more than ten times every night.

504
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,960
It's really good! Can you give me one more?

505
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
How come there are only two thousand words on this one?

506
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,860
Google it!

507
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,460
The love lines are so boring!

508
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,360
The chapter that I updated last night is totally crazy!

509
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,860
This is the best of all!

510
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,960
The plot was not bad.

511
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,560
The love lines are so boring.

512
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,460
Senior Sister Wei Yan is so great!

513
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,360
Nan Dan, I love you to death, Nan Dan!

514
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,660
Nan Dan.

515
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,260
You have no face.

516
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,760
You are a liar.

517
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
You're shameless.

518
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,360
You're a liar.

519
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,240
Hero Xiao,

520
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,760
you're indeed a talented martial artist.

521
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,480
You're the best in the 31 weeks of the monthly lottery.

522
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,800
You're the one who deserves it.

523
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,360
You're quite something.

524
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,960
I'll give you some chicken legs.

525
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
I don't like chicken legs.

526
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,360
You're a kid. You can't be picky.

527
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,400
You...

528
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,360
It's a boy! It's a boy!

529
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,880
I want to see him!

530
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,000
He was yelling at me last night.

531
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,920
He must be a boy.

532
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,880
He's shining.

533
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,320
He's always like this.

534
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,120
Ridiculous.

535
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,760
He's so shy to teach.

536
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,120
Keep your voice down. He's coming.

537
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,600
This is the Nandao Studio?

538
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
This studio is so stylish.

539
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,400
Senior,

540
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,800
I just finished reading the master's letter.

541
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,680
It's so beautiful.

542
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,840
I'm losing my sleep.

543
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,320
Morning, Mr. Li.

544
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,320
Mr. Li.

545
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,480
You've worked hard.

546
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,800
No, I haven't.

547
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,760
It's my job.

548
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,080
It's so stylish.

549
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,840
You can do it, too.

550
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,480
The students in your Chinese department

551
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,880
are so talented.

552
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,200
They're so good at everything.

553
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,160
They're so talented.

554
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,480
I was like that, too.

555
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,920
The outside world is the outside world.

556
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,120
You're not talented.

557
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,880
You're not talented.

558
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,120
Tianzhi is a liar.

559
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,840
You're here.

560
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,800
Let me see.

561
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
Pure martial arts.

562
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,600
The love of the country.

563
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,960
The company is good.

564
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,480
It's the theme.

565
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,480
By the way,

566
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,320
I just brought two cups of tea leaves from the outside world.

567
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,680
I'll give it to you later.

568
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,840
Senior,

569
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,760
thank you.

570
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,080
I'm so happy.

571
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,920
I'm so happy.

572
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,720
I'm so happy.

573
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,400
Thank you.

574
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,440
We've talked about it before.

575
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,560
If the teaching data is correct,

576
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,520
the company will sign a contract with me.

577
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,520
The data is good.

578
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,360
But are you a little tired these days?

579
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,960
The text is updated a little slowly.

580
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,240
The readers have their opinions.

581
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,200
How about this?

582
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,040
You write a few more stories about Li Daxian.

583
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,960
That line is more familiar.

584
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,840
Li Daxian has already been released.

585
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,360
Then restart it.

586
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,640
Reset it.

587
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Reset it.

588
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Trust me.

589
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,280
Open more gold fingers for the characters.

590
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,560
The audience will like it.

591
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,600
Gold fingers are loved by readers.

592
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,120
But you can't open it randomly.

593
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,440
Look at this.

594
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
This one.

595
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,400
Let me think about it.

596
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I still want to write about pure martial arts.

597
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,120
You're getting mad again.

598
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,400
I know you have a good idea in writing.

599
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
And you're very serious.

600
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,360
So I've always been optimistic about you.

601
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,400
Your parents left early.

602
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,440
They came to me when they graduated from college.

603
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,400
I treat you as my real brother.

604
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,600
Write it well.

605
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,240
Don't think too much.

606
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,560
Mr. Li.

607
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,800
The Military Journal has left you a list.

608
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,480
I'll arrange for you to visit this week.

609
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
It's a secret.

610
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,680
I'll arrange a time table for you.

611
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,560
I see.

612
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Xinsilu seems to be quite busy.

613
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,520
Isn't this my novel?

614
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
Don't rush into it.

615
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,520
There are all the media,

616
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
the public number, the big number, the big V.

617
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
You... you want to get into the headquarter?

618
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
But Jiao Zhuang,

619
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
it's my new art project.

620
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Isn't that obvious?

621
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,520
He just wants you to be the man behind him.

622
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
What man?

623
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
I don't understand.

624
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I don't want to understand either.

625
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Yes, he is despicable,

626
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
but you forgot his mouth.

627
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Restart, restart, reset, reset.

628
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Let me tell you,

629
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
how long has his office computer not been running?

630
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
He's already in the future.

631
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
He only hopes that you can restart it for him.

632
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Wait a minute.

633
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
I'll do it. I'll make it clear.

634
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,520
I wasn't good enough.

635
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Brother,

636
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
the story of Jiao Zhuang's second brother,

637
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,520
is the same as my half-way hero.

638
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
You're obviously thinking too much.

639
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
I planned Jiao Zhuang's second brother

640
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
six months ago.

641
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
Again.

642
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
You're not meeting or meeting every day

643
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
for six months.

644
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,520
When did you get the idea?

645
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
What?

646
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm just a netizen,

647
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
I stole your idea.

648
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
This is my novel.

649
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Let me tell you,

650
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,520
I won't be your gunman anymore.

651
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
Please give me your life.

652
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,520
You don't understand.

653
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
I'm the author of this IP,

654
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
so it's more valuable.

655
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Otherwise, who would notice?

656
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Besides,

657
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
you wrote a lot before.

658
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
Do you understand?

659
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,520
Young people have to step on the ground.

660
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
I'll give you a chance.

661
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Brother,

662
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
you used to

663
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,520
be the role model of our department.

664
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
I want you to be honest.

665
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
This is complicated.

666
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,520
You won't understand even if I tell you.

667
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,520
I have a meeting later.

668
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
We'll talk later.

669
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
Just accept it.

670
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
Isn't it good?

671
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
You're a gunman,

672
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,520
your budget is stable,

673
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
and you don't have to worry about writing.

674
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
If he doesn't admit that

675
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Piao Jianhan is fooling me again,

676
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I won't let him

677
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
hold me back anymore.

678
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
Brother,

679
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
this is a workplace,

680
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
not a living world.

681
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
I told you last time

682
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,520
about the software and the novel.

683
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Try it.

684
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
This novel system

685
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
is written by AI.

686
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
There's a new one

687
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
written by you,

688
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Wen Rui'an,

689
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Master Wen,

690
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,520
and the hero of Shenzhou.

691
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Isn't it good?

692
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
It's your dream.

693
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
The novel system.

694
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
The novel system.

695
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
The novel system.

696
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
The novel system.

697
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
The novel system.

698
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
The novel system.

699
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
The novel system.

700
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
The novel system.

701
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
The novel system.

702
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
The novel system.

703
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,520
The novel system.

704
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
The novel system.

705
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
The novel system.

706
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
The novel system.

707
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,520
The novel system.

708
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
The novel system.

709
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,520
The novel system.

710
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Quite a forceful war

711
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
is 발라zing

712
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
in Shenzhou and Jiangzhou.

713
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
I'm a sitting jeep.

state wing.

720
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Under these circumstances,

721
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,280
Young Master San.

722
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Young Master San.

723
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,960
Young Master San.

724
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,240
Young Master San, wake up.

Young Master San.

726
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,960
Young Master San, wake up.

727
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,120
Young Master San is awake.

728
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,400
Young Master San is awake.

729
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,680
I remember now.

730
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,560
Before I came to Rui Lie,

731
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,200
I didn't write the demon butterfly at home.

732
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,400
I missed out on a most important memory.

733
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,080
It's too hard.

734
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,600
Why hasn't she left?

735
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,440
Don't wait.

736
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,080
Senior Brother won't come.

737
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,760
Since you mentioned Big Brother,

738
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,080
he hasn't appeared.

739
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,120
He's obviously...

740
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,800
He's deliberately hiding from you.

741
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,880
Hurry up and come with me.

742
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,960
It's already late.

743
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,720
I'll go and see how the other two are doing.

744
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,400
I'll go and see how the other two are doing.

745
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,080
I'll go and see how the other two are doing.

746
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,440
I'll go and see how the other two are doing.

747
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,440
Hurry up and come with me.

748
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,640
I'll take you to eat.

749
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm not eating.

750
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,520
You go back first.

751
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,800
I'll wait for a while.

752
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,120
Okay.

753
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,800
You're not talented.

754
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
I'll go now.

755
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Eat something.

756
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,880
How unlucky.

757
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
What?

758
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,520
No, I promise.

759
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,000
Say that again.

760
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,200
Yes.

761
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,000
Say it again.

762
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,200
Sorry.

763
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,040
department.

764
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,480
Where's the Ideally selection tool?

765
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,560
This is

766
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,080
our official parameter.

767
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
Check...

768
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,960
the information below.

769
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,860
Got it.

770
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,520
Please look at the remaining resources.

771
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,040
There can't beWOO-W breathe inside here.

772
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,240
Check the air vent for'!

773
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'll put it on for you.

774
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,440
The base is heavily guarded this time.

775
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,960
We can't take out the equipment.

776
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,240
Luckily, you prepared the equipment for me.

777
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,960
Don't worry.

778
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,320
baby

779
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,040
Grandfather

780
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
What are you doing?

781
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
You didn't get off, right?

782
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
The things on here,

783
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,840
were you secretly filming them during the military forum event?

784
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,840
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

785
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
I don't understand.

786
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Then call the police.

787
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
Let the police investigate.

788
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Stop fooling around.

789
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Say it. What do you want?

790
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Money? New books?

791
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Name?

792
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,240
Can we discuss all of these?

793
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,240
I can be ungrateful.

794
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
Jin Qiao,

795
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
when you sell the country's secrets to the outside world,

796
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
it's another matter.

797
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
Let go!

798
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Give it to me!

799
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Let go!

800
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,240
It's him.

801
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,240
If Li Nan was here from the day I came to this world,

802
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,240
I would have changed my direction.

803
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,240
I would have asked Big Brother and the others to help me get home.

804
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,240
But Big Brother still didn't leave.

805
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,240
I changed my route, but I couldn't get back to the front door.

806
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Did Li Nan change his direction again?

807
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Also, your parents

808
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
weren't killed by the Boxing Club.

809
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,240
When I gave the order to the Xiao family, I just didn't kill them.

810
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
When the Boxing Club rushed over,

811
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,240
the Xiao family's arrow path was already broken.

812
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,240
The person who killed your whole family

813
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,240
should be inside your arrow path.

814
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
If the Boxing Club came to the arrow path,

815
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,240
the arrow path was already broken from the inside.

816
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Then the one who killed my parents must be you.

817
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Does Li Nan still have a helper in the Xiao family?

818
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
What identity does she have now?

819
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,240
She hid so well in the Xiao family.

820
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,240
Who exactly is she?

821
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
Big Brother!

822
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Big Brother!

823
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Yu Han, do you have a problem?

824
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,240
That day, the Xiao family's arrow path was broken.

825
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
I was too careless to tell you

826
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,240
that I would ask my father to come to help me change the arrow path.

827
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
But I never thought that

828
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,240
he would be so careless and just stand by.

829
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,240
I already felt that I was wronged.

830
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Yu Han, no matter what your father did,

831
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
you are my brother for the rest of my life.

832
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
Moreover, the case of the arrow path

833
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,240
was just a guess.

834
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
You don't need to think too much.

835
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
When we four brothers had an agreement,

836
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
I said that

837
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
no matter what happens,

838
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
no matter when,

839
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,240
you will always be my good big brother.

840
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
I will accompany you to the arrow path

841
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,240
and ask my father to prove it.

842
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
That's good.

843
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,240
In case you feel anxious,

844
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,240
wait for me to come back.

845
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
I will wait for you.

846
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,240
The snow falls in the rain.

847
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,240
The snow falls in the rain.

848
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,240
The snow falls in the rain.

849
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,240
The snow falls in the rain.

850
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,240
The snow falls in the rain.

851
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,240
The snow falls in the rain.

852
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,240
The snow falls in the rain.

853
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,240
The snow falls in the rain.

854
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,240
The snow falls in the rain.

855
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,240
The arrow is about to strike.

856
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,240
The wind and rain are far away.

857
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,240
The journey is long and the road is narrow.

858
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,240
The world is not a long story.

859
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
The good and the bad are both in the past.

860
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,240
The wine is in the past.

861
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,240
The wine is in the past.

862
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,240
The grudge is in the past.

863
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
The wine is in the past.

864
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
The world is not a long story.

865
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,240
The story is short and the arrow is about to strike.

866
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
The wind and rain are far away.

867
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,240
The journey is long and the road is narrow.

868
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
The world is not a long story.

869
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
The good and the bad are both in the past.

870
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,240
The grudge is in the past.

871
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
The wine is in the past.

872
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,240
The grudge is in the past.

873
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,240
The wine is in the past.

874
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,240
The grudge is in the past.

875
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,240
The wine is in the past.

876
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,240
The grudge is in the past.

877
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,240
The wine is in the past.

878
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
The grudge is in the past.

879
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
The wine is in the past.

880
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
The grudge is in the past.

881
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
The wine is in the past.

882
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,240
The grudge is in the past.

883
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
The wine is in the past.

884
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
The grudge is in the past.

885
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
The wine is in the past.

886
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
The grudge is in the past.

887
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
The wine is in the past.

888
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,240
The grudge is in the past.

889
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,240
The wine is in the past.

890
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
The grudge is in the past.

891
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
The wine is in the past.

892
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
The grudge is in the past.

893
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
The wine is in the past.

894
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,240
The grudge is in the past.

895
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
The wine is in the past.

896
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
The grudge is in the past.

897
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,240
The grudge is in the past.

898
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
The grudge is in the past.

899
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
The grudge is in the past.

900
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
The grudge is in the past.
