Please watch Fushan Sea.

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,520
The sea of the moon is full of flowers.

7
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,440
The six treasures of the talisman.

8
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Please watch Fushan Sea.

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,600
Please watch Fushan Sea.

13
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,200
It's really amazing.

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,040
It's my turn.

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm not too late, pack up.

16
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,720
I won, brother.

17
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,040
潜入澳内,

18
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,660
Really?

19
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,420
I thought that you were against Jin Xun,

20
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,760
But you promised to fight against you.

21
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,300
I never disasters you practice punches,

22
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,580
How could you do that?

23
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,100
Well,

24
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,260
don't get too excited.

25
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,460
It's autumn in the martial arts world.

26
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,100
There are mountains and skies in the martial arts world.

27
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,020
Besides,

28
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,580
it's a good thing that

29
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,020
the young master of the Xiao family is smart.

30
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,300
I'm doing it for the sake of my will.

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,740
It's also within the rules.

32
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,180
Father, mother,

33
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,780
we can't just admit defeat, right?

34
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,460
Yes, we have to admit defeat.

35
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,140
Nonsense.

36
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,260
The ghosts will know when it's the right time.

37
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,700
How do you want to compete in the second battle?

38
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,140
Let's compete in who gets the flowers first and who wins.

39
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,860
Xiu Shui,

40
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,700
did you do it on purpose?

41
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,220
Are you trying to make the boss angry?

42
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,380
One, two, three, four.

43
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,500
What's this?

44
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,740
What kind of trick is this?

45
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,180
Brother,

46
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,180
you arranged these competitions.

47
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
Are you going to use these side ways?

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,900
The Xiao family is powerful and powerful.

49
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,580
They are all real talents.

50
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,980
How can you do such a trick?

51
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,300
Where do you put the rules of the Xiao family?

52
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,700
If Xiu Shui does this,

53
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm afraid that brother is really going to make trouble.

54
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,940
In case of another punishment.

55
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,700
Don't worry.

56
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,180
Has the trouble that brother has caused been small since he was a child?

57
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,020
Aren't you always fine?

58
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,940
The competition is a competition.

59
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,700
In terms of skill,

60
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,620
don't play tricks again.

61
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,660
Okay.

62
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,580
Good.

63
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,380
Let's compete.

64
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,420
Mother's last words.

65
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,220
Mother even gave her own best trick to third brother.

66
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,780
Brother, be careful.

67
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,540
Go.

68
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,500
Xiu Shui used a trick.

69
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,380
Isn't this dangerous?

70
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,580
Go.

71
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,980
Xiu Shui, are you okay?

72
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,100
Did you cut your head?

73
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,940
Xiu Shui.

74
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,220
Are you okay, Xiu Shui?

75
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,260
Are you okay?

76
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,580
I lost my sense of direction.

77
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,100
But,

78
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,020
Xiu Shui often uses the side door.

79
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,260
If he still does this when he walks in the martial arts world,

80
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,380
he will definitely suffer losses.

81
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,020
I also hope that he can remember this lesson

82
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,620
in the small city and the big street.

83
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,700
He should learn martial arts and find the right path.

84
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,980
It's good that you're okay.

85
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
But father,

86
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,060
I didn't get it either.

87
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Your masking may come off.

88
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Take care of yourself near the way.

89
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,540
Yes.

90
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,780
X Éspu.

91
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,500
Come.

92
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,500
Stop.

94
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,820
Hurry up.

95
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,820
About the name,

96
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,780
Xiao Yi Ren will be the manager of Shopkeeper Bank from now on.

97
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,340
I will make a decision now.

98
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,740
Qiu Shui,

99
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,220
you could have dodged that move just now.

100
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,620
Why didn't you?

101
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Brother Lou,

102
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,100
how could I dodge that sword move?

103
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,020
Do you think I can't recognize your words?

104
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,900
You dodged both of them.

105
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,980
But you could have dodged the last move.

106
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,460
Qiu Shui,

107
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,140
why didn't you dodge it?

108
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,060
My parents are all behind me.

109
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,300
How could I dodge it?

110
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,380
It's wrong to be a fool.

111
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,500
You should have lost this match.

112
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,420
But you could have used your body

113
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,060
to protect the one behind you.

114
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,900
I did win a chance for you.

115
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,260
So,

116
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,940
I order you to be the leader.

117
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,620
After half a year,

118
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,260
you two will have a fair match.

119
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,940
No, no, no, father.

120
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,340
No, it's too long.

121
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,300
I think...

122
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,260
I think...

123
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,420
If you want to be the leader,

124
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,340
you don't have to wait for half a year.

125
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,140
Then you don't need to think about it.

126
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,820
In this world,

127
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,900
you just need to be honest.

128
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,940
I won't be yours then.

129
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,900
I can't be patient.

130
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,020
Even if there are consequences,

131
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,420
I will take them on my own.

132
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,360
owner,

133
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,260
Your Majesty,

134
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm really sorry.

135
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,900
I'll be the leader.

136
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,620
Qiu Shui,

137
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,180
it was not good of you just now.

138
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,340
Dearly sorry.

139
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,340
Please don't 해줘 atmosphere.

140
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,940
Go to Guangling Court.

141
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,340
Yes.

142
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,140
Guangling...

143
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,740
Brother.

144
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,540
Brother.

145
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
You lost your sword?

146
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,540
Your sword is broken?

147
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,340
What can we use?

148
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,940
I remember we have some good swords.

149
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,740
You can choose one.

150
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,940
Father.

151
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,940
Can you lend me your sword?

152
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,940
Qiu Shui.

153
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,740
You want to climb?

154
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,740
The sword is the master's heart.

155
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,340
You want to be the master?

156
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,540
No.

157
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,940
You can practice martial arts.

158
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
You need to have a lot of ideas.

159
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,540
Are you okay?

160
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,140
Does it hurt again?

161
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,740
You are hurting him again.

162
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Have a good rest.

163
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,340
I will come to see you later.

164
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
You...

165
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,340
I will get some medicine for you.

166
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,140
Okay, sister.

167
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,340
I want to see you.

168
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,540
I will go with you.

169
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,140
You have no choice.

170
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,540
You can only wait.

171
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,940
Who is it?

172
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Xiao Qiu Shui.

173
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,340
You are always surprising people.

174
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,540
In 10 days,

175
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
I will surpass your father and brother.

176
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,340
Brother's sword-changing skill is really good.

177
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,140
I can't do it next time.

178
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,740
Qiu Shui.

179
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,140
Sister Xue Yu.

180
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,340
Sit.

181
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,740
Does it still hurt?

182
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,940
It's okay.

183
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,940
I want to go to Guang Ling's villa with brother.

184
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,140
Remember to give me these herbs.

185
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,740
Sister Xue Yu, thank you.

186
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,540
Actually,

187
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,740
brother also cares about you.

188
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,540
He knew I was coming to see you.

189
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,140
He didn't care about it on the surface.

190
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,740
But he specifically mentioned some herbs.

191
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,140
He gave them to you on purpose.

192
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,340
I know brother is doing it for my own good.

193
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,340
By the way,

194
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,740
you asked me to bring you some gifts from Zi Hui.

195
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,940
I will get them for you now.

196
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,940
Qiu Shui.

197
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,140
The carriage is outside the door.

198
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,940
After I come back,

199
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,540
you can give me your gifts.

200
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
I will be back in a moment.

201
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,940
Qiu Shui.

202
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,340
You're also like this.

203
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,940
Why are you always so impulsive

204
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
and want to fight with brother?

205
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,940
No matter what,

206
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,740
you have a good goal.

207
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,540
Don't just talk about it.

208
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,740
I have been away for so many days.

209
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,140
You should practice hard without me.

210
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,740
I know.

211
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,540
Don't worry.

212
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,740
Qiu Shui.

213
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,580
But you don't have to be anxious.

214
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,220
You should practice more.

215
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,620
In a few days,

216
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,500
we can have another hero in the Xiao family.

217
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,340
I know.

218
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,980
By the way,

219
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
Sister Xuanyu,

220
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,380
you don't have to

221
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,100
take what Kang Jieshen said seriously.

222
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
I will support

223
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,220
whoever you want to find in the future.

224
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,620
Of course, it's a matter of the world.

225
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,020
You should be good at martial arts

226
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,540
and have a good attitude.

227
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,940
Of course, uprightness is more important.

228
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,620
You should be generous and bold.

229
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,940
Okay.

230
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,140
By the way, Sister,

231
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,660
your own happiness

232
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,100
should be in your own hands.

233
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,340
No one can force you.

234
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,780
Okay, I know.

235
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,740
You must practice hard these days.

236
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,060
After half a year,

237
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm still waiting for the hero Qiu Shui

238
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,100
to make a move.

239
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,300
I'm leaving.

240
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,100
Take good care of yourself.

241
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,660
Don't make your parents angry.

242
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,420
Do you understand?

243
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,100
Shang Qiu Shui.

244
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,620
Come out.

245
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,820
Brother, brother.

246
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,300
Didn't sister say

247
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,460
you have left?

248
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,180
What's going on?

249
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,380
She's so afraid of us leaving.

250
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,020
My brothers are going to Gua Ling.

251
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,940
You don't send them away.

252
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,420
Why do you let us go so soon?

253
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm a little dizzy.

254
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,980
Brother, I have something to tell you.

255
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,620
After we leave,

256
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,380
you must take good care of your parents.

257
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,380
Listen to them.

258
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,660
Don't make them angry.

259
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,620
Do you understand?

260
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,380
It hurts.

261
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,060
It doesn't hurt.

262
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,180
Are you still

263
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,500
in the hospital?

264
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,460
No.

265
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,660
Brother, don't worry.

266
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,140
I will take good care of my parents.

267
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,500
After we leave,

268
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,860
practice hard.

269
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,180
After half a year, when we come back,

270
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,180
you must take good care of yourself.

271
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,580
I understand.

272
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,340
Let's practice hard.

273
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,060
Stay at home.

274
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,420
Don't cause trouble to your parents.

275
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,620
Let's go.

276
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,660
Take care.

277
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,020
Brother, brother.

278
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,180
Be careful.

279
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,700
Don't worry.

280
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,220
Master Cang Jian.

281
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,580
How's the state of preparation going?

282
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,980
I have sent all the guards

283
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,220
around the charactero

284
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,100
to is kind redAgainst my rhythm.

285
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,540
In case you order an order,

286
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,280
we are in the course of

287
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,340
taking revenge of the noodles

288
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,700
so as to avoid the ceuxle邊

289
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,460
'me surtout bed

290
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,620
What about the late king?

291
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,460
It hasn't happened since

292
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,780
you skimmed down named pink.

293
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,620
Don't worry.

294
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,260
Do not make him

295
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,140
torture you.

296
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,700
Yes.

297
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,700
Miss Lu,

298
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,240
Madam Wu has entered the jail.

299
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,860
Did they find out?

300
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,700
No need.

301
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,820
You pushed the Xiao Family into extreme territory.

302
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,880
I have my own way to enter the jail

303
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,940
and to find her.

304
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,140
Then should I tell the others

305
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,580
that son is in the Xiao Family?

306
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,120
They don't know your well-being.

307
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,160
I'm afraid I'm minding your business.

308
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,280
They are not so capable.

309
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,620
Remember,

310
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,160
not to upbeat the Xiao Family.

311
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,300
I want them to close the door.

312
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,900
Yes.

313
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,300
Give me a bowl of noodles.

314
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,100
Okay.

315
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,300
Sir.

316
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Have some tea first.

317
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
May I ask

318
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,100
where the Flower Faction is?

319
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,900
Where is the Flower Faction?

320
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,900
Over there.

321
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Go along this road

322
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,900
and go south.

323
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Then you'll reach the Flower Faction.

324
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,700
Thank you.

325
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,900
Wait a moment.

326
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
The noodles will be ready soon.

327
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,700
I've already asked for Tang Rou's name.

328
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,500
I should be able to get into the Xiao family

329
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,300
and find the Hero's Order.

330
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Look at this.

331
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Xuanling Gang.

332
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Who is it?

333
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
Xiao Qiushui's sword.

334
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,500
The Xuanling Gang

335
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,100
is here to take over the Xiao family.

336
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
The Xuanling Gang

337
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,300
is still

338
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,500
in danger.

339
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Father.

340
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,300
Mother.

341
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,100
Qiushui.

342
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,700
What are you doing in a hurry?

343
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,300
Father.

344
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,900
Mother.

345
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,700
I...

346
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,900
Father.

347
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,700
Mother.

348
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,900
It's so refreshing recently.

349
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,900
It's also suitable for going hiking.

350
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
How about

351
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,900
going out for a walk

352
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,900
in the near future?

353
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,100
What are the three kids in the Xiao family

354
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,300
up to?

355
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Qiushui.

356
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
How did you know?

357
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,100
Father.

358
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,100
Xiao Qiushui.

359
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,100
Sister.

360
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Sister.

361
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,300
Sister.

362
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,100
Sister.

363
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,500
Xiao Qiushui.

364
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,500
Tell Tang Rou to leave the Xiao family.

365
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,700
Don't involve my brother

366
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,100
in your trouble.

367
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,300
The blood of the Power Gang

368
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
is in the capital.

369
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,500
The Power Gang sent the blood of the power.

370
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,300
They are seeking revenge.

371
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,100
Turn the door.

372
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,500
Turn the door.

373
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,100
Master.

374
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,500
The blood of the Power Gang

375
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
is found in the capital.

376
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,300
In the coffin,

377
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,700
is the sword of the third young master.

378
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,100
Leave.

379
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,100
Yes.

380
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,900
Didn't I deal with that sword?

381
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,100
Qiushui.

382
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
When did you offend the Power Gang?

383
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
Yesterday.

384
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,700
You have already said it.

385
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,900
Qiushui.

386
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,900
Tell me the whole story.

387
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,500
Qiushui killed the Iron Demon,

388
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,300
Fu Tianyi.

389
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Three years ago,

390
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,900
the Fuhudao of Huizhou

391
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
took over a pawnshop of the Power Gang.

392
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,300
Twelve people in the family died in one night.

393
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,100
He Luotong and Ding Wen

394
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,900
were separated from the Power Gang

395
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
because of the problem of the number of the pass.

396
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,100
The whole family was killed.

397
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,900
The couple drowned in the water.

398
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,700
Once they offended the Power Gang,

399
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,500
they would end up like this.

400
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,700
They won't be kind.

401
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,100
The Power Gang wants to find me.

402
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,300
They want to find me alone.

403
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,500
But the most important thing now

404
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,700
is that we should leave Huahua.

405
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,700
Dad, mom.

406
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,700
I will find a way to protect you.

407
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,300
What can you do?

408
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,100
Qiushui.

409
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
You said that

410
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,900
the Gold and Silver Manor

411
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,500
colluded with the North Emperor.

412
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,700
What evidence do you have?

413
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,300
Dad, please tell me.

414
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,300
I have found the evidence.

415
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,700
I was going to tell you

416
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,500
after I get over this.

417
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,900
It seems that the Power Gang

418
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,900
colluded with the North Emperor.

419
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,500
There is indeed such a thing.

420
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,500
Brother Xiao.

421
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,900
The Gold and Silver Manor

422
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,100
is the private property of Fu Tianyi.

423
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Just because of this,

424
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,300
it doesn't prove that the Power Gang

425
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
colluded with the enemy.

426
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,100
It's enough that there is a Fu Tianyi.

427
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
It's enough.

428
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,100
Qiushui didn't

429
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,500
make a grudge in the martial arts world.

430
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,300
He just killed a

431
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,300
traitor who colluded with the enemy.

432
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,300
Why are you afraid that others will come to avenge him?

433
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,300
Today,

434
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,500
the three sons of my family,

435
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Xiao Qiushui,

436
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,100
killed the traitor.

437
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
This is really

438
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
the glory of our family.

439
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,300
The grudges he caused

440
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,700
are also borne by our family.

441
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,500
You have nothing to do with this.

442
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,100
Please leave this place immediately.

443
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
When the day comes,

444
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,100
our family will get over this.

445
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,700
Then you will have nothing to do with this.

446
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,900
Please.

447
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,700
Brother Xiao.

448
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,900
You want to be a hero,

449
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
but you want us to run away with our tails.

450
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,900
Isn't that too despicable?

451
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
What's your brother's business

452
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,700
is my business.

453
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Yes, Brother Xiao.

454
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,900
With our friendship for many years,

455
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,100
I will run away with the Xiao family.

456
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,100
I've been drinking tea with the Xiao family for so many years.

457
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,900
How can I be alone?

458
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,500
I should be with my father.

459
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,100
Uncle Xiao.

460
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,700
We are brothers of the Jiejies of Qiushui.

461
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
We will never retreat.

462
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,300
Don't kill me.

463
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,900
We swore to live and die together.

464
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,300
Don't worry about this time.

465
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,100
Since my brother wants to stay,

466
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,300
I should stay with him

467
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,900
to protect the martial art world.

468
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,700
Uncle Xiao.

469
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,500
Qiushui is my savior.

470
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,500
I should return the favor.

471
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
My brothers.

472
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,100
You are all good.

473
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,100
I appreciate it.

474
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,300
Today,

475
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,700
so many heroes are here.

476
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,900
No matter how powerful the Power Gang is,

477
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,900
we can still fight.

478
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,100
Thank you.

479
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Thank you.

480
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Sect Leader.

481
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
Sect Leader.

482
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,300
Outside.

483
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,300
Outside.

484
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Let's go.

485
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,500
It's poisonous. Be careful.

486
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,500
It seems that the Jiejies are still going to the stone.

487
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,700
But I did save Tang Rou.

488
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,500
Does that mean

489
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,500
I also have the chance to save the Xiao family

490
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,300
and save everyone?

491
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,300
Protect the needle.

492
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,900
I heard that the Power Gang

493
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
has 19 heroes and demons in the Nine Heavens.

494
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,100
All of them are great heroes.

495
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,100
Since we are here to exchange flowers today,

496
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,100
why don't we show up and talk?

497
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,300
I can also be one of the masters.

498
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,100
You want to protect yourself.

499
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,100
Why do you want to be one of the masters?

500
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,900
Sect Leader Xiao, you are overestimating yourself.

501
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,700
You are the Three-Division Sword Demon,

502
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,100
Kongyang Qinbao.

503
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,100
Today, I came here

504
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,700
to ask for the same thing as you.

505
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Thing?

506
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,100
Isn't it because you want to collude with

507
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,100
the father of the Northern Wilderness, Tian Yi?

508
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,100
His life is not worth it.

509
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Sect Leader Xiao,

510
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,300
hand over the Order of Heroes.

511
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm afraid that you are disappointed.

512
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,100
The Xiao family doesn't have the Order of Heroes.

513
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,900
Okay.

514
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,300
Sect Leader Xiao wants this family

515
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,500
to die here.

516
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,300
I'll take it.

517
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
Since you are in the pugilistic world,

518
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,100
you can die as a ghost.

519
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Good.

520
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,500
Life is short,

521
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,700
but there is always a way out.

522
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,100
I'll give you this.

523
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,500
I remember that except Kongyang Qinbao,

524
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
Sha Qian Deng, who surrounded the Xiao family,

525
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,300
there should be a Baidu Shenmu Hua Gu Fen

526
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
who looks like a lantern.

527
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,900
To get the same thing,

528
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,300
I must find out his location first.

529
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
I'm afraid that I can't find him.

530
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,900
I'll go to the sect leader's room.

531
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,500
I'll go to the sect leader's room.

532
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,100
I'll go to the sect leader's room.

533
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,980
What?

534
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,300
What is your problem?

535
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,700
I'm not involved.

536
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,500
Why won't you hurt me?

537
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
How can you kill me?

538
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,700
I'm the military man.

539
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Even if it's just a murder,

540
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,900
what can I do?

541
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,700
Abbess Wan.

542
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,500
Logs of the Five Ancient shirts.

543
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,300
No.

544
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,900
Your son has learned some martial arts.

545
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,180
Don't worry, mother.

546
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,540
You must be careful.

547
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,580
Qiu Shui, be careful of the death of the puppets.

548
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,820
They only know how to kill people with swords.

549
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:52,540
Teacher Hou Qiang's

550
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,540
Kill ...

551
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Disciple of Xiao family doesn't pretend to be OK

552
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:05,580
Zansheng,

553
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,100
you!

554
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,580
Wu clamping

555
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,500
Du speaking

556
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,500
Hu how do you handle it

557
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,340
How are you?

558
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,540
I'm fine.

559
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,420
Are you all right, Ling?

560
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,180
How are you?

561
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,980
I'm fine.

562
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,300
Kill!

563
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,380
Kill!

564
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Kill!

565
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:56,380
Kill!

566
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Kill!

567
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,380
Kill!

568
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
Kill!

569
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,060
Brother.

570
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,700
Father.

571
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,060
Are you all right?

572
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,900
I'm fine.

573
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,180
Kill!

574
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,460
Take the shortcut.

575
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,180
Okay.

576
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
Go.

577
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,180
Kill!

578
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,980
Go.

579
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Kill!

580
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
Kill!

581
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Kill!

582
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
Kill!

583
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
Kill!

584
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,700
Chase.

585
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,580
Hurry.

586
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,380
My lord!

587
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,860
My lord!

588
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,660
Madam!

589
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,860
How is everyone?

590
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,660
Quickly,

591
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,580
take everybody to recover.

592
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,780
Yes, my lord.

593
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,460
Quickly.

594
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,220
Come with me.

595
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,860
Be careful.

596
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,780
Let's go.

597
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,700
Be careful.

598
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,820
Brother,

599
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,980
how long can we hold on?

600
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,420
Don't worry, Brother Kang.

601
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,860
When Jian Lu was getting rid of the sword,

602
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,220
he considered that

603
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,220
one day,

604
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,820
when the North Emperor came,

605
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,700
the Huanhua Sect could fight here.

606
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,500
It's said that

607
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,780
the gold is rich and the grains are abundant.

608
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,020
Even if it's a few months,

609
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,220
it's still a good deal.

610
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,460
Don't worry.

611
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,300
As you expected,

612
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,420
he's already gone to Jian Lu.

613
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,980
The water in our family has grown up.

614
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,620
It can be used as a separate bowl.

615
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,100
You can't be arrogant.

616
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,700
Don't be reckless in the future.

617
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,220
Father, Mother,

618
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,900
I understand.

619
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,580
There's something particularly important

620
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,700
that I want to confirm with you.

621
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,580
Is Mrs. Wu

622
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,460
in our family?

623
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,540
Are you...

624
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,300
There are so many guards in this Ivy told

625
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:30,020
by

626
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,620
Stone-stein lamp to stop light.

627
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,240
Your father and I

628
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,540
feel unsettled,

629
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,740
and we've arranged the old lady

630
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,180
to enter Jian Lu long before.

631
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,380
4 picked Sun Dian and

632
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,340
Xiao only got one day free.

633
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,180
and now lives in Zhenmei Pavilion.

634
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,740
It's a good time to see it.

635
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,380
Mother,

636
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,420
is there any other secret passage

637
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,020
that can make us

638
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,140
escape from here?

639
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,780
This sword furnace is just a fortress.

640
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,420
There's no secret passage.

641
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,660
Besides,

642
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,940
the enemies outside

643
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,300
are already in danger.

644
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
They can't let us

645
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,900
escape secretly.

646
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,220
But we don't have to worry too much.

647
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,740
It's a place of gold and gold.

648
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,100
If we stay here,

649
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,420
there won't be any danger for now.

650
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,260
But we were supposed to meet

651
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,980
with General Wu's subordinates

652
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,380
two days later.

653
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,180
I'm afraid

654
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,700
we can't make it in time.

655
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,620
Father, mother,

656
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,380
I don't know what the Power Gang

657
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,420
is going to do.

658
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,780
I always think

659
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,740
they'll leave some kind of sign.

660
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,860
If there's a hidden seal in this sword furnace,

661
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,140
there won't be any safety

662
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,940
in the sword furnace.

663
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,540
You're very thoughtful.

664
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,340
But don't worry.

665
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,980
We've arranged everything.

666
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,660
But now,

667
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,420
we're too tired.

668
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,860
When we're settled,

669
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,900
your mother and I

670
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,580
will make a row of tea.

671
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,820
All right.

672
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,940
Everyone is busy today.

673
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,500
Why don't we have a good meal first?

674
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,780
We can eat later.

675
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,140
You're right.

676
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,860
Come on.

677
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,380
Thank you for today.

678
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:35,700
Cheers.

679
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,380
Thank you, Brother Xiao.

680
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:36,900
Cheers.

681
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,700
Cheers.

682
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,220
Elder Xie,

683
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,540
handsome and smart.

684
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,860
Don't hate me.

685
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,220
Uncle Xiao,

686
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:09,020
they surrounded the Sword Lure

687
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,020
and retreated.

688
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,620
Now we are

689
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,420
following the past

690
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,020
and we are not

691
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,300
the heroes.

692
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,700
It's a pity that we can't eat

693
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,220
a big meal while healing.

694
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,540
It's said that when Qiu Shui met the Power Gang today,

695
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,980
he was fearless

696
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,580
and brave.

697
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,540
No wonder Master Kang recommended him.

698
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,940
He is a young hero.

699
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,420
Don't praise him.

700
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,260
If you praise him,

701
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,420
he will be really proud.

702
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,740
You are making me

703
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,340
a master of the party.

704
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,700
Come on, boy.

705
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,060
Let's have a toast.

706
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,860
Uncle Zhu, I don't deserve it.

707
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,060
Come on.

708
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,580
Uncle Zhu,

709
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,860
I should

710
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,540
toast to

711
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,660
the friendship between you and me.

712
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,340
I have been

713
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,060
reading many stories of the heroes.

714
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,420
I envy

715
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,340
the stories in the books.

716
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,420
But I think

717
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,500
the stories in the books are the stories in the books.

718
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,540
It's impossible that they will be true.

719
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,340
But today,

720
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,100
you are still strong

721
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,660
and strong

722
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,740
in order to change flowers.

723
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,020
I admire you more

724
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,500
than those in the books.

725
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,140
I toast to

726
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,340
everyone

727
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,300
who has been with me

728
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,420
for a long time.

729
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,140
Cheers.

730
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,700
Come on.

731
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,340
Come on.

732
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,140
Come on.

733
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,940
Cheers.

734
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,740
Cheers.

735
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,260
Cheers.

736
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,260
Cheers.

737
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Cheers.

738
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,860
Good wine.

739
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,460
Good.

740
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,140
Pour it on me.

741
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,340
Pour it yourself.

742
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,660
Let's have a toast.

743
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,740
Good wine.

744
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,900
Why don't you finish it?

745
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,220
Good wine.

746
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,100
Good wine.

747
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,300
Come on.

748
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,060
Fill it up.

749
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
Thank you.

750
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,460
Come on.

751
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,380
Drink some decoction.

752
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:08,860
Cheers.

753
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,500
Come on.

754
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
Let's Lun Kerf a toast.

755
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,500
Okay.

756
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,340
Let's drink.

757
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,220
Cheers.

758
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,540
我們 predator

759
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:55,720
1

760
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,840
communicating

761
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,900
Look at me

762
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,120
mesa

763
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,440
ะ

764
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,640
You're willing to stay in the Xiao family

765
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,280
to save the martial arts world?

766
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,680
I just found out

767
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,840
that the Xia Yi

768
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
is wearing a belt on my sister's body.

769
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,760
Sister, I'll give you a toast.

770
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,800
That's right.

771
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,840
Let's give Miss Tang a toast, too.

772
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,840
Let's give Miss Tang a toast, too.

773
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,840
All right.

774
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,240
Go and have a drink.

775
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:26,960
Come on.

776
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,440
Come on.

777
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,520
I stayed here to ask for the Heaven's Love Book.

778
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,680
You guys are stupid.

779
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Let's have a drink.

780
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,360
Brothers.

781
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,520
Young Master San.

782
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,160
Thank you all for your hard work.

783
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,720
I'll give you a toast.

784
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,320
Let's give a toast to Young Master San.

785
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,360
Come on.

786
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,320
Come on.

787
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,160
Let's all sit down.

788
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:06,440
Okay.

789
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:06,920
Sit down.

790
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,080
Brothers.

791
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,160
I'll give you a toast.

792
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,960
Come on, brothers.

793
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,240
Come on.

794
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,880
Let's have a toast.

795
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,600
Come on.

796
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,800
Brothers, it's already evening.

797
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,840
Come on. Pour it in.

798
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,840
Pour it in.

799
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,940
I'm begging you, Lin Ye.

800
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:47,840
It seems that the薄羅 Tagen that I had for you

801
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,680
helped a lot.

802
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,360
There's nothing we can ever beat this sword.

803
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,760
Thanks, Mister.

804
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,280
Don't worry.

805
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,240
I'll never...

806
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,040
fight against Qi.

807
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,000
How many years now that you're at your own peril?

808
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,300
It's time for you to

809
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,360
fight back now.

810
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,820
I...

811
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,320
will do all I can to save all the people in my sect.

812
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,720
I'll never betray you.

813
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,280
I told you.

814
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,480
Yes.

815
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,880
Bad news! Bad news!

816
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,480
The fire is on!

817
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,880
The fire is on?

818
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,280
Let's go!

819
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,880
Let's go!

820
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,080
Hurry!

821
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,280
No.

822
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,760
The

823
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,680
The

824
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
The

825
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,680
The

826
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
The

827
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
The

828
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
The

829
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,680
The

830
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,680
The

831
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,680
The

832
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,680
The

833
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
The

834
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
The

835
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
The

836
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,680
The

837
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
The

838
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
The

839
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
The

840
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,680
The

841
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,680
The

842
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,680
The

843
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,680
The

844
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,680
The

845
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,680
The

846
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
The

847
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
The

848
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
The

849
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
The

850
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,680
The

851
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
The

852
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,680
The

853
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
The

854
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,680
The

855
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,680
The

856
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
The

857
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,680
The

858
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
The

859
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
The

860
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
The

861
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
The

862
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
The

863
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,680
running towards the road of happiness.

864
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Unknowingly, the world is full of good and evil.

865
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Drunk and drunk, the morning is long.

866
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
The sheep head is dry.

867
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,680
The river is dry.

868
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
The grass is dry.

869
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
The grass is dry.

870
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
The river is dry.

871
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
The river is dry.

872
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,680
The river is dry.

873
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,680
The river is dry.

874
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,680
The river is dry.

875
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
The river is dry.

876
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,680
The river is dry.

877
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,680
The river is dry.

878
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,680
The river is dry.

879
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
The river is dry.

880
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
Separation is inevitable,

881
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,680
across thousand miles and behind the hasle,

882
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,680
to become a good man is not destructive.

883
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,680
The people's lies are endless

884
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,680
the madness is endless

885
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:11,860
when they get together they may
