00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Break through the darkness and go forward

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let this city and river be filled with love

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let the sword be the sword of love

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The end of the dark night

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The sword in the night

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't forget this 100

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Be covered with blood

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The sword of the hero has never changed

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let the thousand years

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Be with me

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want to wait for you

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Even the night is bright

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Fushanhai

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Youth is sweet or not

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Peace is Li Ziyuan

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Li Ziyuan invites you to watch Fushanhai

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The first year of the Daxi

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The martial arts world has been reborn

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The most powerful power in the world

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Powerful

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The water is a big king

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Long-term control of the water

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The two parties are fighting

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The four years of the Imperial Army

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The difficulty has not been eliminated

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The emperor was forced to leave the capital

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
At the same time

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Heroic power in the world that has disappeared for many years

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Reborn

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I would like to stick to the masters' order

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The great sage

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The general Woodg时候

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Various people in the martial art world

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The drama at stake

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,640

Decal provide assistance

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He is the third son of the Flower Sword Sect, Xiao Qingshui.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He used the Qingling Sword to make the Flower Sword Sect and Xiao Qingshui

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
into a pure and pure king.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He has been a man of no inner power and outstanding martial arts.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
His sword skills are as good as the shooting star and as good as the thunder.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He used his strength to use his power to help the people.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He has won the battle.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Flower Sword Sect

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am Xiao Qingshui.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Greetings, Lady Wu.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Get up quickly.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How about using the magic dot to change the Seven Gorges of Shenzhou?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I specifically applied for your internal qualification

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to aid your martial arts.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This magic dot only requires you to set up the key plot nodes

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and character settings.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The rest is up to the AI in the magic dot system

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to fill in the gaps for you.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Welcome to use the magic dot interaction writing Chinese system.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Since we need to change the setting, the buff is not enough.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The male lead must be the top master.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The Qingling needs to be the best, the inner power needs to be the best,

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and the sword skill needs to be the best.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He is not only a skilled martial artist,

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but also born with a golden bone.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He is the first martial arts talent in the world.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When he was 12 years old, he used the flower sword of the Xiao River to control the body.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When he was 18 years old, he was passed on by Yan Kuangtu

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:46,000
who used

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,880

When I was twenty

75
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,680
I went to pick up Premier of humans

76
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920

We will share in

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,040
each other's happiness.

106
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,520
Even in the hardest of times,

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,680
always in the 재밌ment of life,

108
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,920

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,920
Standing on the height of life,

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,440
Xiao Qiushui learned the main character well.

114
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,360
She turned around and looked at the world.

115
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
She said six words.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,920
No, it should be eight words.

117
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,280
God is invincible.

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,680
The demon is like snow.

119
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,280
The magic point given by Li Cai is quite useful.

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,520
Not bad.

125
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,960

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Wake up.

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Young Master is awake.

194
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Young Master is awake.

195
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Young Master.

196
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Are you okay?

197
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Young Master.

198
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
How lucky.

199
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Young Master.

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
That's great.

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Finally, he's awake.

202
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Yes, finally.

203
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Young Master, does your head hurt?

204
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
How do you feel?

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Young Master.

206
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Are you okay?

207
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
What's going on?

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Where am I?

209
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Have some water first.

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Who are you?

211
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Where's Li Cai?

212
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I know.

213
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
You're the actors he woke up with, right?

214
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Actors?

215
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
What are actors?

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
What's actors?

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
You

218
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
had a party with your friends

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
on this street yesterday.

220
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
You came here to celebrate.

221
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
You got drunk later.

222
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Young Master.

223
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
You just rest here?

224
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Young Master.

225
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Did I see the sword of Young Master

226
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
and have a dream about Xie Xiaofeng?

227
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Why is this dream so evil?

228
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Young Master.

229
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
What's wrong with you?

230
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Is this thing so real?

231
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Is there any problem?

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Something's wrong.

233
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
It's so dark.

234
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
What's wrong with you, Young Master?

235
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Something's wrong.

236
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Something's wrong.

237
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Young Master.

238
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Young Master.

239
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Be careful.

240
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
What did you say?

241
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Young Master?

242
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Don't make fun of me.

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Aren't you the third young master of the Flower Fist Sect,

244
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Xiao Qiushui?

245
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
The Flower Fist Sect, Xiao Qiushui?

246
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
The Flower Fist Sect, Xiao Qiushui?

247
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Yes.

248
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Isn't it wrong?

249
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I...

250
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I...

251
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I...

252
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm out of the contract.

253
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
No.

254
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
This...

255
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
This...

256
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
This is in the age of the opera, right?

257
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Yes.

258
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
In the western suburbs of Jindu,

259
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
on the west side of the Flower Fist Sect,

260
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
there is a Flower Fist Sect.

261
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
The owner, Xiao Xilou,

262
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
is very famous in the capital.

263
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
He is the famous person of the local sect.

264
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Xiao Xilou has three children and one daughter.

265
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
The youngest son is Xiao Qiushui,

266
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
who has been famous in the martial arts world

267
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
for many years.

268
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Could it be that

269
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm stuck in the five-character

270
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
little book I wrote,

271
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
The Ten-Century Magic Box?

272
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Now I've become Xiao Qiushui.

273
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Isn't it called Mimi?

274
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Let's go over there and have a look.

275
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I think I've prepared it for you.

276
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Good.

277
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Good.

278
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
In my memory,

279
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Xiao Qiushui, who is twenty years old,

280
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
sacrificed his life.

281
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
And the blood-stained sword

282
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
that can add buff anytime.

283
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
It's the top master of the martial arts world.

284
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
The first sword skill in the Qinggong Hall.

285
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
It seems that my little Mimi's luck

286
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
is not that bad.

287
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Not only does she wear the main character,

288
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,200
she also wears the most glorious moment in her life.

289
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Even if it's not true,

290
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
it's good to have a dream in this little book.

291
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Move away.

292
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Move away.

293
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Stop looking.

294
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
The Black Venom is going to kill you.

295
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
What should we do?

296
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Move away.

297
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Move away.

298
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Don't worry.

299
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Move away.

300
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I have a way.

301
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
It's down.

302
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Let you guys try it.

303
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I'll write the ultimate skill.

304
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm like a bird.

305
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Like a bird.

306
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
It doesn't feel right.

307
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
I can do the ultimate skill.

308
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Xiao Qiushui, stop.

309
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Little Three,

310
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
her sister is here too.

311
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
My sister?

312
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Qiushui,

313
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
you're in trouble again.

314
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Come home with me.

315
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Let's see how dad will punish you this time.

316
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Let's go.

317
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
You're back.

318
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
How many times have you done this?

319
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Lift your face up.

320
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Look at me.

321
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
You're a fool.

322
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
You're a fool.

323
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You're a fool.

324
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
You're a fool.

325
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I'll be honest with you.

326
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
I won't hit you today.

327
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
You learned to be a fool.

328
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Do you know your last name?

329
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Who's your last name?

330
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
You're still awake?

331
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Cotton, plain water,

332
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
and night is not a normal day.

333
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm going to punish you this time.

334
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Don't expect anyone to help you.

335
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Dad?

336
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
This is...

337
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
my dad?

338
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Xiao Qiushui doesn't like

339
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Xiao Qiushui the most in the garden.

340
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
She's always making trouble.

341
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
I don't know what to do.

342
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Kneel down.

343
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You're unfilial.

344
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
You're unfilial.

345
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Qiushui.

346
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Qiushui.

347
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Dad, dad, dad.

348
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
I was wrong.

349
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
It's strange.

350
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
You're usually so stubborn.

351
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
You're so quick to admit your mistake today.

352
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Dad,

353
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Qiushui is just a young man.

354
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
But you told him to investigate

355
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
the North Imperial Army's play.

356
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
He's been investigating it all the time.

357
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I see.

358
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
In that case,

359
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
then...

360
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Dad,

361
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I'd like to ask the third brother

362
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
what he found.

363
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
I'll ask him.

364
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Then tell me.

365
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Third brother,

366
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
these days,

367
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I've been running around with your second brother.

368
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
But I didn't expect you

369
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
to be so ungrateful.

370
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
It's your business.

371
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Let's just forget about it.

372
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Dad,

373
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I've done something ridiculous.

374
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I need to find out the truth.

375
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
You're still practicing martial arts?

376
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
This second brother is still practicing martial arts?

377
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
He was stabbed?

378
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Aren't you two my brothers?

379
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Is it necessary to be so friendly?

380
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Since you asked me to teach you,

381
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
I have the right to teach you.

382
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Dad,

383
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
a tree is not a tree.

384
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
A man is not a man.

385
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Right.

386
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Let's go.

387
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Let's go.

388
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Let's go.

389
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Brother.

390
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm sorry for not teaching you.

391
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
How about I, as your mother,

392
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
teach this naughty brat a lesson?

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Mingming,

394
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
come.

395
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Have some noodles.

396
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Mom.

397
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Yiren.

398
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Bring me the ladle.

399
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Mom, you want to bring...

400
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Yes.

401
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Move aside.

402
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Mom,

403
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
why are you also here to revive?

404
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Why isn't he my dad?

405
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
What are you laughing at?

406
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
You brat.

407
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
You're always playing tricks.

408
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Today, I'm going to teach you a lesson.

409
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I'll make you mess around again.

410
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
You're really hitting me, mom.

411
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Aren't you wearing your pants?

412
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
If you hit me, I'll run away.

413
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Stop.

414
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
You brat, where are you running to?

415
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Stop.

416
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I'll see where you're running to.

417
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Stop.

418
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Stop.

419
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I'll beat you to death today.

420
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
You're really hitting me.

421
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Have some tea.

422
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Mom,

423
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
it turns out

424
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
you're talking about this.

425
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Of course.

426
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
When you were angry with your dad for three days,

427
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I made this leather jacket for you.

428
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
This isn't ordinary leather.

429
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
It's made of hard leather.

430
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
You can't even wear it through a regular knife.

431
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm sorry.

432
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm sorry.

433
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm sorry.

434
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm sorry.

436
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I'm sorry.

437
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Mom,

439
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I thought

440
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
I'd never see you again.

441
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
You silly child.

442
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
What are you doing?

443
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Are you cursing your mom?

444
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Mom,

445
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
it's so nice to see you.

446
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You're even warm.

447
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Mom,

448
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
what kind of person

449
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
do you think I am?

450
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,200
What?

451
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I mean,

452
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
in terms of rank,

453
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
isn't there always

454
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
a ranking in this country?

455
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
I know I'm not the best.

456
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Then,

457
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I have to rank

458
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

459
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
You have a fever?

460
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
No.

461
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
How many ranks are there in the martial arts world?

462
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Let me tell you.

463
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
In our yard,

464
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
you rank 5th,

465
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
your dad, your mom, and me,

466
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
your big brother, and your second brother,

467
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
and then you.

468
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I...

469
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm talented.

470
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Am I more magical?

471
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Yes.

472
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You're more magical.

473
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I'm more magical.

474
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm more magical.

475
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I'm more magical.

476
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I'm more magical.

477
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Yes.

478
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
You're really talented.

479
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
When you were young,

480
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
you were so happy.

481
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
So your dad and I

482
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
didn't force you.

483
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Since you're not good at

484
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
the fencing,

485
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
you've created

486
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
your own fencing.

487
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Did you lose

488
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
your hand

489
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
when you went out this time?

490
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
No.

491
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Mom,

492
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
how is my qinggong?

493
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
It's always

494
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
short.

495
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
How about the inner force?

496
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
It's flat.

497
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Why are you

498
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
so weird?

499
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
You lost your memory?

500
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
You have so many problems today.

501
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Why is it

502
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
different from what I thought?

503
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Mom,

504
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
how much difference

505
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
is there between me and

506
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Li Chenzhou from the whole class?

507
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Qiu Shui,

508
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
you can

509
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
mess around with

510
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
other things.

511
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
But this thing,

512
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
you should remember

513
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
what your father said.

514
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Don't

515
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
harass the people

516
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
of the Powerful Gang.

517
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
The Powerful Gang

518
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
is in the martial arts world

519
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
and kills people by accident.

520
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
No matter how many

521
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
heroes and heroes in the world

522
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
die under their swords,

523
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
there are nine gods and nine demons.

524
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
How can they

525
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
kill anyone

526
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
in the world?

527
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
The power of the power

528
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
of the power of the power

529
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
is the power of the power.

530
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
It's the power of the power

531
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
of the power of the power

532
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
of the power

533
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
to거

534
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
not to kill or

535
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
kill.

536
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
When a power

537
00:23:50,200 --> 00:24:14,280
has ten dragon

538
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,680
Did the Yan Kuan Tu not notice my pulse?

539
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,640
When Yan Kuan Tu disappeared, you were the only child.

540
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,320
All these years, he never appeared in the martial arts world.

541
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
If he really did appear,

542
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,120
then it's probably another bloody storm.

543
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Let me.

544
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
You...

545
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,000
Is there any special martial arts secret in our family?

546
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,000
It's the kind that you practiced, the special flying chicken.

547
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,520
Don't say that to your father.

548
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,400
You haven't practiced the flower sword yet. You're still thinking about practicing the side.

549
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Okay.

550
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
I have one last question for you.

551
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,840
Why are you asking so many questions today?

552
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,280
Is Sister Xue Yu my biological sister?

553
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,480
Xue Yu is the adopted daughter of our Xiao family. She is a hard-working child.

554
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,000
You must protect your sister well from now on.

555
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,080
Okay.

556
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,880
Enough. Stop thinking about it.

557
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm going to your father.

558
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,960
Remember, don't make him angry.

559
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,360
Okay.

560
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Eat the orange.

561
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Okay.

562
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,000
The person in the water is Yuan Xiao.

563
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,480
But she kept my blood blood pressure.

564
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,960
Could this be the writing of the demon-picking man Ji Hong Dong?

565
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,080
Did he upgrade my martial arts skills and return to the scene I wrote?

566
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,480
I don't care. Let's go and get the equipment first.

567
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
So many letters.

568
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
I was so hasty at the time.

569
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
I just copied a small part of the book.

570
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
I didn't remember much at all.

571
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,880
But I still remember the protagonist's golden fingers.

572
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,480
I remember that the letter was written by the demon-picking man.

573
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,480
I remember that the demon-picking man was the one who wrote the letter.

574
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,480
I remember that the demon-picking man was the one who wrote the letter.

575
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,080
But I still remember the protagonist's golden fingers.

576
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,480
I remember that everyone in the novel wants the secret weapon, the book of forgotten love.

577
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,480
It's in this Xiao family's building.

578
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
I must look for it.

579
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
But where is it?

580
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,480
I can't see it. I can't see it.

581
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
It's so mysterious.

582
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
It must be hidden in a very mysterious place.

583
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
The book of forgotten love

584
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
The book of forgotten love

585
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
The book of forgotten love

586
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,480
In many martial arts novels,

587
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,480
the most powerful secret weapon is hidden in this stone coffin.

588
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
I'm not going to look anymore.

589
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
I'm sorry.

590
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Feel bad.

591
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
The book of forgotten love

592
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
The book of forgotten love

593
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
How is this a arrow?

594
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
They didn't add the book of forgotten love?

595
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,400
You used the Magic Point Stone to

596
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,760
create a new character

597
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,440
and change it.

598
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,080
Please find it.

599
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Magic Point Stone?

600
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,520
Come on.

601
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,400
Come out.

602
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,640
Don't be fooled by him.

603
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,960
Okay.

604
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,000
How about this?

605
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,760
Let's discuss it.

606
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,800
Let me ask you.

607
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,600
Can I play freely?

608
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,400
The Seven Devils of God

609
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,800
is a classic martial art

610
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,200
from the 1980s.

611
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,880
It's different from the

612
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,840
unrivaled Liu Shuang Long

613
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,040
in the popular martial arts world.

614
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,920
The leader of the Niu Xia

615
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,440
in the traditional martial arts world

616
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,920
is just a martial artist.

617
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
He is the master of

618
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,200
the ancient and modern

619
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
martial arts.

620
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,320
The magic point stone

621
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,400
will be the essence of the original work.

622
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,480
It will make a significant change

623
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,120
in this technique.

624
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,040
You're a big head.

625
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,080
Traditional martial arts

626
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,440
need to be reborn.

627
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,560
If the main character doesn't change,

628
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,520
can he play?

629
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,840
Moreover,

630
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,600
in real life,

631
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,480
it's annoying enough.

632
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,280
Do you want to

633
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,600
stick in the novel?

634
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,720
Are you dumb?

635
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm asking you.

636
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,360
You don't want to talk, right?

637
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,280
Okay.

638
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,400
I'll quit.

639
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,520
Go back to the gate.

640
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,320
You can't leave.

641
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,920
Unless you complete the main character,

642
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,320
you can't quit.

643
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
You want to play with me?

644
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,600
Please go to the stage with Xiao Qiu Shui.

645
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,680
Xiao Qiu Shui will be the most important person in the martial arts world.

646
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,080
He loves to sing with you.

647
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,600
Wait.

648
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,360
Let me ask you.

649
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,120
In this chaotic world,

650
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,800
there are the Queli Gang,

651
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,080
the King of the Heavens,

652
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,360
and the North Wilderness.

653
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,200
You don't want me to use my golden fingers.

654
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:56,880
Can I live to

655
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,200
the first year of the Martial Arts Conference?

656
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,360
What are you talking about?

657
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,880
If you can become

658
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,360
the Great Sage of the Flower Realm,

659
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,760
you can enter your own

660
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
Great Master.

661
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,560
I won't use my Great Sage.

662
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,760
In the meantime,

663
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,560
pay attention to the operation of your martial arts.

664
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,120
It's a critical moment.

665
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,320
I'll teach you a lesson.

666
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,560
The operation of your martial arts.

667
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
I can't do it either.

668
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,120
Do you remember the method you wrote for yourself?

669
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Thank you.

670
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,320
I've been covered by the veil

671
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,520
of the poison in your hands.

672
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,960
Once you get the poison,

673
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,280
you will be able to draw a picture.

674
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,160
You can draw it yourself.

675
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,320
Two, two, three, three.

676
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,360
One, two, three.

677
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,960
You're so despicable.

678
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Remember.

679
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,240
This is a story of a master

680
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,960
who is good at martial arts.

681
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,240
Let him practice martial arts.

682
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,720
He is a martial artist.

683
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,240
If you want to go,

684
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,560
you can write a story

685
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,680
about your own dream of being a hero.

686
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,200
Are you all right?

687
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,320
I don't accept it.

688
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,200
Guardantate of Commandery Commandery

689
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,280
What's going on?

690
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,560
Sorry about that.

691
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,720
Don't want to subjects

692
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,240
That Hong Dan

693
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,600
Really

694
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,880
But I won't

695
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,340
yo

696
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:43,880
too

697
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,880
No

698
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,560
Do you compliment this

699
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,440
bitch

700
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,000
I have no rebellion

701
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,080
I have no rebellion

702
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,400
Although I can't exercise my data

703
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,380
I still have about 10 boil

704
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,500
Very enfim

705
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,860
Tiew locked up

706
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm not going to send you to the temple.

707
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,020
Now hide in the mountains.

708
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,060
As long as you avoid those difficult situations,

709
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,060
you'll be a big and small wood.

710
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,340
Don't try to torture me.

711
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,780
I'm going to the temple.

712
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,980
I'm going to the temple.

713
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,180
I'm going to the temple.

714
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
I'm going to the temple.

715
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
I'm going to the temple.

716
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
I'm going to the temple.

717
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
I'm going to the temple.

718
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
I'm going to the temple.

719
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
I'm going to the temple.

720
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
I'm going to the temple.

721
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
I'm going to the temple.

722
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
I'm going to the temple.

723
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm going to the temple.

724
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
I'm going to the temple.

725
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
I'm going to the temple.

726
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
I'm going to the temple.

727
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
I'm going to the temple.

728
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
I'm going to the temple.

729
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
I'm going to the temple.

730
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,180
I'm going to the temple.

731
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
I'm going to the temple.

732
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,180
I'm going to the temple.

733
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,180
I'm going to the temple.

734
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
I'm going to the temple.

735
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,180
I'm going to the temple.

736
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,180
I'm going to the temple.

737
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,180
I'm going to the temple.

738
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,180
I'm going to the temple.

739
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,180
I'm going to the temple.

740
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,180
I'm going to the temple.

741
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
I'm going to the temple.

742
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
I'm going to the temple.

743
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
I'm going to the temple.

744
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
I'm going to the temple.

745
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
I'm going to the temple.

746
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
I'm going to the temple.

747
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
I'm going to the temple.

748
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
I'm going to the temple.

749
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,180
I'm going to the temple.

750
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
I'm going to the temple.

751
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,180
I'm going to the temple.

752
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,180
I'm going to the temple.

753
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,180

00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,180
I'm going to the temple.

760
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
I'm going to the temple.

761
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,180
I'm going to the temple.

762
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,180
I'm going to the temple.

763
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,180
I'm going to the temple.

764
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
I'm going to the temple.

765
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,180
I'm going to the temple.

766
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
I'm going to the temple.

767
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
I'm still here.

768
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
What's going on?

769
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,180
You can't get rid of this damn system.

770
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
This is good.

771
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
This whip...

772
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
No way.

773
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Chongzhi?

774
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,180
No way.

775
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Young Master is here.

776
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,180
Young Master is here.

777
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Young Master is here.

778
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,180
This is what the martial arts world looks like.

779
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,180
Boss.

780
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Boss.

781
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Boss.

782
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
Boss.

783
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,180
Tang Xun, Deng Zhe, Li Chao Han.

784
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
They're over there.

785
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
Boss.

786
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
Boss.

787
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,180
You said we were...

788
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
What?

789
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,180
What?

790
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
Friends?

791
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,180
They're all Qin's.

792
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Is Qin's a high-ranking official?

793
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Qiu Shui.

794
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,180
You're not still awake from the alcohol?

795
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Boss.

796
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
You're just going to see a dragon boat.

797
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,180
Why are you so excited?

798
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,180
Are you kidding me?

799
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,180
There's someone who looks so good.

800
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,180
Although the martial arts world is not the best,

801
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
but I don't have any friends.

802
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,180
I guess these three are the three dead islands in the original.

803
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,180
How come they look like the friends in my real life?

804
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,180
What's the problem?

805
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,180
I can't run away even if I don't let the dog run away.

806
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Since I have to go far away,

807
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,180
it seems that I can only survive if I hide behind these brothers.

808
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,180
I think Boss is really...

809
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,180
He's drunk at night and can't even figure out his own room.

810
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
You two don't let him drink anymore.

811
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
How dare we?

812
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,180
I didn't.

813
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,180
Don't say it.

814
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Drink some water.

815
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
It's a little thirsty.

816
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,180
Zuo Qiu.

817
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,180
How's your hand-grip training going?

818
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Boss.

819
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
Why are you looking at him when you're talking to me?

820
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
What are you looking at?

821
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,180
Drink some water.

822
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Boss.

823
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,180
I heard that you were attacked by Uncle Xiao again.

824
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,180
So we have to change our plan.

825
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,180
I came to discuss this with you.

826
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,180
This time, we go to Zihui.

827
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,180
We're not going to Sanlongzhou.

828
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,180
There will be an organization that bullies men and bullies women.

829
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,180
It's called the Gold and Silver Front.

830
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
I knew Boss was looking for us.

831
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
There must be another Qian Kun.

832
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
There's another party.

833
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
You know how to fight.

834
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,180
We have been specialized in this kind of gang for years.

835
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,180
Boss, what do you think?

836
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,180
We're not going to fight.

837
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
We're going to attack.

838
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
Attack?

839
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,180
Boss, you're not right today.

840
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,180
Boss has always been a man of his word.

841
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,180
Let's hear him finish his words first.

842
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,180
I'm sorry.

843
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Do you know who is behind the Gold and Silver Front?

844
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
Who?

845
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,180
The god of the Boxing Club, Fu Tianyi.

846
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,180
The world is full of ups and downs, the good and the bad

847
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,180
Drunk and drunk, the wine is all over the place

848
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:25,180
The wine is all over the place, the grudge is all over the place

849
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,180
The world is full of ups and downs, the good and the bad

850
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,180
The time is running out

851
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,180
The wind and snow are running through the mountains

852
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,180
The wind and snow are running through the mountains

853
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,180
The world is full of ups and downs, the good and the bad

854
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,180
Drunk and drunk, the wine is all over the place

855
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:59,180
The wine is all over the place, the grudge is all over the place

856
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,180
The world is full of ups and downs, the good and the bad

857
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,880
That's the

858
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,420
Thing that you didn't do

859
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,180
Even the eagle flies in the sky

860
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
Every desire is revelled

861
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,180
Even in death

862
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,180
The though無能

863
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,180
Only fight on

864
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,180
Words like melting away
