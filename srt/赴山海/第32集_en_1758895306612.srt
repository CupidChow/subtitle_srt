1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,260
Goat

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,220
Most excited

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,420
Let this DUI rise

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,140
Freely go to the wild

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,420
When the time comes, scientists will appreciate

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,120
Yaothe 他病, quiz

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,120
The phase of long night

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,580
Be accordingly, forget about the faults

9
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,580
I will never change my mind

10
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,580
I will never change my mind

11
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
I will never change my mind

12
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,580
I will never change my mind

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,580
I will never change my mind

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,580
I will never change my mind

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,580
I will never change my mind

16
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,580
I will never change my mind

17
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,580
I will never change my mind

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,580
I will never change my mind

19
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,580
I will never change my mind

20
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,580
I will never change my mind

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,580
I will never change my mind

22
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,580
I will never change my mind

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,580
A thousand years, I will always be with you

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,580
I want to wait for you

25
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,580
Even if the day breaks

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,580
I will wait for you

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,580
Old man Fei, is there anything wrong?

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,580
If this is really a thousand-person noodle

29
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,580
It hasn't been connected to the vital heart

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,580
It hasn't been used up the inner energy

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,580
It should have been turned into blood

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,580
But you see, the noodle skin is still there

33
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,580
It's obviously fake

34
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,580
But how could it be so?

35
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,580
But how could it be so?

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,580
But how could it be so?

37
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,580
But how could it be so?

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,580
But how could it be so?

39
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,580
But how could it be so?

40
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,580
But how could it be so?

41
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,580
This thing

42
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
It's related to Shuqi's martial arts case

43
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
It's not just your Fei family's family history

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,580
My father's sword

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,580
Why did this tomb

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
Hide my father's sword

47
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
Could it be

48
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,580
My father is the one who hid it here

49
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,580
Old man Fei

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,580
You have something to say

51
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,580
If the news of the presence of the thousand people

52
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,580
If the news is spread

53
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
It will cause a storm

54
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
By then, for your Fei family

55
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,580
It will be difficult to escape this

56
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
Five years ago

57
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Danfeng went to the Imperial City Department

58
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,580
Come back for the mission

59
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
I was chased by the great king of heaven

60
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,580
I hurried to pick up

61
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,580
On the way

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,580
I met the hands of the great king of heaven

63
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Water god

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,580
I thought he was killing Danfeng

65
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,580
I tried my best to use the chaos

66
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
To kill him

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,580
But when I took off my mask

68
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,580
I found out that it was my son Danfeng

69
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Danfeng

70
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,580
Danfeng

71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,580
Then I took advantage of my inner power

72
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,580
To swear

73
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,580
No more chaos

74
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,580
Grandpa, my father

75
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,580
He was killed by you

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,580
Grandpa, return my father

77
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,580
Young master

78
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,580
You return my father

79
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,580
Young master, let's go

80
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,580
You return my father

81
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,580
Grandpa

82
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,580
Old man Fei

83
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,580
The great king of heaven

84
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,580
What's the problem with Fei Danfeng

85
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,580
To be honest

86
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,580
My Fei family's martial arts

87
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,580
In the three great qi schools

88
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,580
Not top

89
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,580
Only because of the face of the thousand people

90
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,580
Can set up the world

91
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,580
That day, Danfeng was under the secret order of the Imperial City Department

92
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,580
Secretly investigate the identity of the great king of heaven

93
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,580
Found that the iron and silver province is the great king of heaven

94
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,580
He wanted to get the face of the thousand people

95
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
Let me kill Danfeng wrongly

96
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,580
The great king of heaven is the iron and silver province

97
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,580
Was he the one who scattered the white grass valley

98
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,580
If he has the face of the thousand people

99
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,580
That fake leader

100
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,580
Who lied to me to kill Tian Zheng Tai

101
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,580
It must be him

102
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,580
Who is here

103
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,580
I won't say anything else

104
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
Young master

105
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,580
I hope you will give the world in the future

106
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,580
No matter what the face of the thousand people is

107
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,580
What is the blood of the heart

108
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,580
Zheng Ming has nothing to do with my Fei family

109
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,580
Please

110
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,580
Old man Fei is polite

111
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
Old man Fei

112
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
Old man Fei

113
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,580
Old man Fei

114
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,580
Old man Fei

115
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,580
Old man Fei

116
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,580
Old man Fei

117
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
Old man Fei

118
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Old man Fei

119
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,580
Old man Fei

120
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,580
Old man Fei

121
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,580
Old man Fei

122
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,580
Old man Fei

123
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Old man Fei

124
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,580
Old man Fei

125
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,140
Old man Fei

126
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Old man Fei

127
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Old man Fei

128
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
Old man Fei

129
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
Old man Fei

130
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
The master of Li. It's getting late

131
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Please

132
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
Master, it's getting late.

133
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,340
Please.

134
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,940
Chen Zhou.

135
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

136
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,860
Chen Zhou?

137
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,660
Chen Zhou, you're here.

138
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,740
It's been a while.

139
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,300
You still look so handsome.

140
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,460
I thought you wouldn't

141
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,780
want to drink with me anymore.

142
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,860
Come on, come on.

143
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,260
Come on.

144
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,380
Drink with me.

145
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,460
Sit down.

146
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,860
Come on.

147
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,540
Sit down.

148
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,300
Sit down.

149
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,980
Sit down.

150
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,540
Sit down.

151
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,220
Sit down.

152
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,900
Sit down.

153
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,540
Sit down.

154
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,140
Sit down.

155
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,740
Sit down.

156
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,340
Sit down.

157
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,940
Sit down.

158
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,620
Sit down.

159
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,260
Sit down.

160
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,100
Sit down.

161
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,820
Sit down.

162
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,460
Look.

163
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,900
I'm very attentive.

164
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,660
I prepared

165
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,820
all your favorites.

166
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,460
Come on.

167
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,260
Hurry up.

168
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,140
Hurry up.

169
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,820
The grass is soft.

170
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,900
It's good for the body.

171
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,100
Sorry to disturb you.

172
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,020
It's been a while.

173
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,900
You're still so anxious.

174
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,820
Okay.

175
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,380
Let's talk about business first.

176
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,060
Do you see it?

177
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,180
You see 35!

178
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,180
Help me.

179
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,260
Why did you take it back?

180
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,420
What do you want to say to me?

181
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,860
Please stand, please.

182
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
I'm guilty.

183
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,740
I saw the north was heading east.

184
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,900
The soldiers were short of food and clothing.

185
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,180
I couldn't bear it.

186
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,660
So I sent the food and clothing to the front line.

187
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,860
The war was imminent.

188
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,220
I traveled a thousand miles a day.

189
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,540
I didn't report it.

190
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,740
This is indeed a serious matter.

191
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,300
I'm willing to take the punishment.

192
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,900
I've heard it.

193
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,260
You mean

194
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,020
I was not considerate enough

195
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,940
and treated the soldiers badly.

196
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
In that case,

197
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,700
I have nothing to say.

198
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,020
Chen Zhou,

199
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,420
drink this cup of wine

200
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,860
and go back.

201
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,060
What are you doing?

202
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,980
Are you mad at me?

203
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,220
Chen Zhou.

204
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,220
I'll go and send a nasty doctor.

205
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,220
That's unnecessary.

206
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,060
I already know someone is riding the horse' defense.

207
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,940
Don't rush over.

208
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,340
You can't come to the modern time.

209
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,620
Your Majesty may Not sculptures.

210
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,300
because of the cold?

211
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,540
I thought

212
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
you were dissatisfied with the government

213
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,300
and made many decisions.

214
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,900
That's why I ran away from the martial arts world.

215
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,220
As the King,

216
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,620
I had to be dragged by the country

217
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,420
and live in this unique government.

218
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,420
Now that I see you die,

219
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,580
I know why you did it.

220
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,380
You know that the King of Yi is biased.

221
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,540
I'm really sorry for you.

222
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,700
I've been doing things

223
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
like flying red and walking on snow all my life.

224
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,580
How people evaluate me

225
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,100
is not important to me at all.

226
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,340
You said that

227
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,860
and reminded me of someone.

228
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,940
But the red and the white are different.

229
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,020
If you die one day,

230
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,140
who in the world

231
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,700
can do what you didn't do?

232
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Your Majesty,

233
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,180
the treasure of South Heaven

234
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,140
was taken by the power gang.

235
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,940
It was indeed exchanged for material

236
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,060
and transported to the front line.

237
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,900
The front line?

238
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,940
You want to bribe people?

239
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,380
Have you found it?

240
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,660
The person I sent

241
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,260
was set up by Li Chen Zhou.

242
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,940
There is no sign of the jade seal

243
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,780
in the South Heaven.

244
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,980
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.

245
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Please punish me.

246
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
Chen Zhou's little mind

247
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,860
is almost gone.

248
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,980
Now that he's poisoned,

249
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,620
he still has to come to me every month

250
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,020
to get the elixir to live.

251
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,540
I want to see

252
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,140
how hard his bones are

253
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,060
and how long he can last.

254
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,580
Your Majesty is wise.

255
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,700
Under your support,

256
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,900
Shui Dao

257
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
has the ability to defeat the power gang.

258
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,700
It's not easy for him

259
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,340
to make trouble.

260
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Enough, Uncle Shen.

261
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,740
Get up.

262
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

263
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,660
The North and West Dynasties have been in a bad shape

264
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,140
and the people are suffering.

265
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm worried.

266
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,180
Li Chen Zhou has been suffering for so many years.

267
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,660
It's time to rest.

268
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,900
From now on,

269
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,380
the Daxi Wulin will be yours.

270
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,020
Don't let me down again.

271
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,660
I will do my best.

272
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,940
Stop.

273
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,940
I saw what you did in the Fei family.

274
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,700
You said in front of everyone

275
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,100
that you can't bully the weak.

276
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,620
In exchange for the third one,

277
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,980
I have a thing

278
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,060
to ask you.

279
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,340
You followed me all the way.

280
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,980
Did you know about the fire in the Xiao family?

281
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,100
I don't know

282
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,380
who did it.

283
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,700
But I know

284
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,900
the truth of the case

285
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,260
that Dan Feng investigated.

286
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,380
You want to use this position

287
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,660
to help me take revenge.

288
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,820
The Fei family's master,

289
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,540
Fei Yu Qiao.

290
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,380
I should have died long ago.

291
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,140
But I don't dare to.

292
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,740
Look at my face.

293
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,940
It's the result of using the thousand-men noodle.

294
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,180
It turns out that it's been a long time

295
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,940
since I used the thousand-men noodle.

296
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,060
It turns out to be like this.

297
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,940
Not only that,

298
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,620
every time I use the thousand-men noodle,

299
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,860
I will lose my inner power.

300
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,860
If I don't use it well,

301
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,740
I will lose my life.

302
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,660
The thousand-men noodle of the Fei family

303
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,660
is a sin in the Jianghu.

304
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,220
But I also regret it.

305
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,220
Everyone in the Jianghu wants to see the thousand-men noodle.

306
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,660
Look at my Fei family.

307
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
For him,

308
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,500
I'm waiting for you to die.

309
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
When I used the thousand-men noodle,

310
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,900
I was weak and weak.

311
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,140
But I was blinded by the people.

312
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,860
I became a lonely ghost.

313
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,420
So you want me

314
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,940
to take you back to the thousand-men noodle.

315
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,180
Let me take you back to the thousand-men noodle.

316
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,620
No.

317
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,260
The thousand-men noodle is in the Jianghu.

318
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,620
It's a sin.

319
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,980
I just want to find it

320
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,820
and destroy it completely.

321
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,420
Then why do you trust me?

322
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,900
You've been a ghost for a long time.

323
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,100
But you can see people clearly.

324
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,620
The third son of the Xiao family,

325
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,180
I'm very sad about your parents' death.

326
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,900
Although they're not close friends,

327
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,180
your father is the most respected hero I admire.

328
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,660
Let me tell you.

329
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,860
The one who killed Danfeng

330
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,300
was also a member of the Lansui clan.

331
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,860
The first king of the heaven.

332
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,220
That's right.

333
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,260
I wrote the Lansui clan into a map

334
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,820
and lent it to Tie Yi for a month.

335
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,780
He must have remembered it.

336
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,260
Find Tie Yi's body

337
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,540
and destroy the thousand-men noodle in his hand.

338
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,900
The Fei family can't

339
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,380
create more troubles for the Jianghu.

340
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
Young Hero Xiao.

341
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Young Hero Xiao.

342
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Please.

343
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,460
Elder.

344
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
Thank you, Elder.

345
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,540
Elder.

346
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,500
You wanna escape again?

347
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,500
Fine.

348
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,060
Finally found you.

349
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Come on.

350
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
It's you.

351
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
Xiao Yiren,

352
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,060
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

353
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
Longjiang Waterway,

354
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,060
isn't it enough for you to be ashamed?

355
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
You're the one who's ashamed.

356
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
I'm not ashamed.

357
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
I'm not ashamed.

358
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
I'm not ashamed.

359
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
I'm not ashamed.

360
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,060
You colluded with the North Wilderness.

361
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
What do you want?

362
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Collusion?

363
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
You're ashamed?

364
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
I'm not that rich.

365
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Look,

366
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
in South Sky Hall,

367
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,060
I've asked you to get a penny for me.

368
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Li Chenzhou is the one who's ashamed.

369
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,060
She took half of the treasure

370
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,060
of South Sky Hall

371
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
and put it on the front line.

372
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
But

373
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
His Majesty didn't want to see it.

374
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,060
Just as what I said to you last time,

375
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,060
the West and the North Wilderness will continue to fight.

376
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
The people will get rich.

377
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
No matter how many treasures are there,

378
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
they will just fill in the void.

379
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
It will be gone after a fight.

380
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
I think

381
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
I'm just worrying about His Majesty.

382
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,060
But if that's the case,

383
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
why didn't you tell me?

384
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
You lied to me that I went to South Sky Hall

385
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
and risked my life.

386
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
The reputation of my family

387
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,060
has been ruined.

388
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
What I ruined

389
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
won't ruin the reputation of the family.

390
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
Don't you believe me?

391
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
I'm not lying.

392
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,060
His Majesty heard that you wanted to report to the court.

393
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,060
So he gave the letter to the Xiao family.

394
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
With this imperial edict,

395
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
I'm afraid the reputation of the family

396
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
will be ruined.

397
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,060
This is the plan of His Majesty's servant.

398
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Do your job well.

399
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,060
From now on, you are the son of the Xiao family.

400
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I can wait.

401
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,060
Isn't it?

402
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Go.

403
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,060
Go and kill someone for His Majesty.

404
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
I'll go to the West.

405
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
I'll go to the West.

406
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Go.

407
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
You just wait.

408
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,060
I'll find you when I need you.

409
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
What's going on?

410
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

411
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,060
Long live Your Majesty.

412
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Get up.

413
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Congratulations, Hero Xiao.

414
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
You didn't fail His Majesty.

415
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,060
We'll go now.

416
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
Go.

417
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Yiren.

418
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,060
Xiao Yi.

419
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
Look.

420
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,060
This is the plaque that His Majesty personally gave.

421
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,060
It's very important.

422
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,060
When did the Xiao family have such a flag?

423
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
It's personally given by His Majesty?

424
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
That's great.

425
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
You can leave now.

426
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,060
Yes.

427
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
Yiren.

428
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,060
I think we've found out about the South Heaven.

429
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,060
I'll let the people understand

430
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,060
the South Heaven.

431
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,060
Yiren.

432
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,060
I didn't mean to kill you.

433
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,060
I just thought

434
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,060
the plaque was strange.

435
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,060
The North Wilderness didn't find it.

436
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
Your reputation hasn't been restored.

437
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,060
How could His Majesty personally give you the plaque?

438
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
What do you mean?

439
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Are you saying that the Xiao family

440
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,060
isn't worthy of His Majesty giving the plaque personally?

441
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Or are you saying that the Xiao family

442
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
doesn't deserve the title of loyal and loyal?

443
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,060
You said you wanted to be with me to cherish the Xiao family.

444
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
But now I've done it.

445
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
Why are you so uncomfortable?

446
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Yiren, that's not what I meant.

447
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,060
Of course I'm happy for you.

448
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
It's just that I think

449
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
it looks lively here.

450
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
But it's really strange.

451
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
It's not as lively as

452
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,060
the time when the Flower Faction was in the top.

453
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
It seems that

454
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,060
the human heart is not here.

455
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,060
Where is the human heart?

456
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,060
Is it in the temple of the Water of the Gods?

457
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,060
Shu Qi, with the Holy Heart and the Holy Will,

458
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,060
you won't be afraid of the human heart not coming back.

459
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,060
I'll let you see the Flower Faction grow.

460
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,060
Little Qiu Shui,

461
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
why are you always

462
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
ruining my plans?

463
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,060
The situation has reached this point.

464
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,060
No one can stop me anymore.

465
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,060
They must be trying to do something.

466
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
What are they doing?

467
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
Let's go.

468
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
Let's go.

469
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,060
Let's go.

470
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
Let's go.

471
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Let's go.

472
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,060
Go.

473
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
Go.

474
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Go.

475
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
Go.

476
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Go.

477
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
Go.

478
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
Go.

479
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,100
You are more sincere

480
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,020
I want me

481
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,820
Give me give me

482
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,620
Give me

483
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,220
Wu Gui

484
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,860
You are here this time

485
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,340
Are you here to treat the disease?

486
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,180
Yes

487
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,460
Originally

488
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,380
We were greeted by Miss Tang

489
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,820
Just occasionally

490
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,860
Not listening

491
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,540
You did it on purpose

492
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,100
The current ones are used to it

493
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,220
We are walking together

494
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,420
It's hard to avoid

495
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,260
You said it

496
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,700
Sister Xuanyu is kind

497
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,940
Medical skills are good

498
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,460
Can cure us

499
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,340
Brother and sister came to find

500
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,180
Did not see

501
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,380
Come and find it again today

502
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,540
But now my sister

503
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,660
She is in the drug store

504
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,900
I came here this time

505
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,060
Also looking for people

506
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,260
You are the joint

507
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,460
There are some problems

508
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,060
How about this

509
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,260
I have a good friend

510
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,820
She is in the four corners of the Bichuan Temple

511
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,900
When you go to find her

512
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,180
Just say it's a friend of Xiao Qiushui

513
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,860
Good good good

514
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,580
Come and come

515
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,780
Go in and sit down

516
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,380
Good good

517
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,420
Go in and sit down

518
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,340
Good martial arts

519
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,420
The house is so big

520
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,620
Is there anything delicious

521
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,020
Yes, we are going to eat delicious food

522
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,180
Yes yes yes

523
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,820
How are you all recently

524
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,860
Pretty good

525
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,700
Pretty good

526
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,860
I saw people on my way here last time

527
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,140
Yes yes yes

528
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,980
Killing

529
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,180
It's that damn Tian Shen Bu

530
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,700
Yes, I want to kill him

531
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,140
I was pushed down by someone

532
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,340
Tian Shen Bu

533
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,700
Yes yes yes

534
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,620
Yes yes yes

535
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,300
Yes yes yes

536
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,220
It's him

537
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,660
Old thing

538
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,060
I want to kill him

539
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,060
A'Gun

540
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,140
What you just said is

541
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,820
The Iron Clothing Shenpu of the Sixth Gate

542
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,500
Yes yes yes

543
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,820
It's this old thing

544
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,940
Then you tell me

545
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,220
What happened

546
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,220
After we separated

547
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,140
We felt uncomfortable for the first time

548
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,820
Want to come and help Xue Yu

549
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,220
Then on the mountain road

550
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,420
See a man in black

551
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,100
Push the Iron Clothing Shenpu down the cliff

552
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,720
Pull it

553
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,460
What can i do

554
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,220
If everyone doesn't brush their teeth

555
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,300
My childhood's Purron

556
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,580
Roast

557
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,400
It's it

558
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,360
Barbecue

559
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,140
Toast

560
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Finish

561
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,580
I didn't expect you to be so merciful

562
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,180
and kill so many people.

563
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,140
Are you sure

564
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,660
you really saw the Iron Wings?

565
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,540
Yes, yes, yes.

566
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,020
How could it be wrong?

567
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,340
I saw it too.

568
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,140
We have eight eyes.

569
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,700
Yes, yes, yes.

570
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,620
How could it be wrong?

571
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,260
Yes, yes, yes.

572
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,220
How many years have you been fighting with that old fox?

573
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,820
How many years?

574
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,900
I even know him.

575
00:29:59,300 --> 00:29:59,820
Yes, yes, yes.

576
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,620
My father is right.

577
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,140
But if you don't believe me,

578
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,300
I'll take you there

579
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:03,940
and see.

580
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,020
It's right under the cliff.

581
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,100
Maybe the body is still there.

582
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,460
Yes, it must be there.

583
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:08,860
Let's go.

584
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,300
Let's go and have a look.

585
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:10,980
Let's go.

586
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
Let's go.

587
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:12,700
Let's go.

588
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,300
Let's go.

589
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,900
Let's go.

590
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,540
Wu Guang, Wu Guang.

591
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,340
Here, here.

592
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,740
Wu Guang.

593
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,460
It's here.

594
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,020
What is it?

595
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,580
Look.

596
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,660
This is Wu Guang's Feast.

597
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,980
Oo.

598
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,500
He's not good at losing.

599
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,340
Page Tomorrow

600
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,640
Youró

601
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,060
Page mirror

602
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,200
그

603
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,220
that who is he?

604
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,100
Youró

605
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,940
That Ten Ye?

606
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,240
I don't understand

607
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,320
If you want me to die

608
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,820
than you should tell us

609
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,500
the shape and meaning

610
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,480
Two

611
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,660
Let him die

612
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,220
Thank you

613
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,120
After you

614
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,480
Immortal

615
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,800
to make some pieces brighter

616
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,920
and make Queen momentary?"

617
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,600
Si Kun.

618
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,480
Tell them

619
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,360
to go and find the eldest prince's Photo realm immediately.

620
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,440
I'm afraid that the

621
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,440
people in the prison will be destroyed.

622
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,360
Could it be that Zhu Xia and Wu Yang

623
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,440
have been lurking in the prison?

624
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,040
Li Chen Zhou said that when Liu Sui Feng arrived that day,

625
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,480
the prison was already attacked from the inside.

626
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,320
The prison is impenetrable.

627
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,760
It's not a moment

628
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,200
that I can't see.

629
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,520
Boss, when I was training the body of Lord Yu Han,

630
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,120
I already found the chain lock behind the prison. It was opened by you.

631
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,720
This is a secret chain lock.

632
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,760
It's very hard to break.

633
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,080
The chain lock is small.

634
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,600
There are two mechanisms hidden on it.

635
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,320
Two mechanisms?

636
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,280
This is completely different from what you remember.

637
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,640
The way to open it requires

638
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,200
one reason and one reason.

639
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,840
At the same time, it's okay.

640
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,320
One reason and one reason?

641
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
One reason and one reason?

642
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,480
When the chain lock was opened,

643
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,840
only the person who knows the lock

644
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,320
killed everyone and took away the chain.

645
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,720
He pretended to be Lord Zhu.

646
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,360
Only father and mother and two brothers knew how to open it.

647
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,480
Impossible.

648
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,640
Big Brother and Second Brother all came back to the prison after me.

649
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,760
Impossible. This is impossible.

650
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,600
Did they kill my second brother?

651
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,240
My second brother...

652
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,360
Minute.

653
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,320
Minute, before being koy techniques,

654
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,360
they outputs.

655
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Then how did my second brother come back?

656
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:40,300
After he and I parted, he rushed to the county and rushed back to the arrow

657
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
It's you

658
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,300
Qiu Shui

659
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,300
I went to buy osmanthus cake and heard someone say you were back

660
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
I brought some for you

661
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Sister Xiao Yi

662
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,240
Is my second brother at the border now?

663
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,240
One person is not at home

664
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
It seems that he went to the pipa to eat wine

665
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Sister Xiao Yi

666
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
What's wrong?

667
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Nothing

668
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
I'm sorry

669
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
I'm sorry

670
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
I'm sorry

671
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
I'm sorry

672
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I'm sorry

673
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
I'm sorry

674
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
I'm sorry

675
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
I'm sorry

676
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
I'm sorry

677
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
I'm sorry

678
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm sorry

679
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I'm sorry

680
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
I'm sorry

681
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
I'm sorry

682
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,180
I'm sorry

683
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,180
I'm sorry

684
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
I'm sorry

685
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
I'm sorry

686
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
I'm sorry

687
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
I'm sorry

688
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
I'm sorry

689
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
I'm sorry

690
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,180
I'm sorry

691
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,180
I'm sorry

692
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
I'm sorry

693
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,180
I'm sorry

694
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,180
I'm sorry

695
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
I'm sorry

696
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
I'm sorry

697
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,120
I'm sorry

698
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
I'm sorry

699
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
I'm sorry

700
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
I'm sorry

701
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
I'm sorry

702
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
I'm sorry

703
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
I'm sorry

704
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
I'm sorry

705
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,120
I'm sorry

706
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,120
I'm sorry

707
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,120
I'm sorry

708
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
I'm sorry

709
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
I'm sorry

710
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm sorry

711
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
I'm sorry

712
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,120
I'm sorry

713
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
I'm sorry

714
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,120
I'm sorry

715
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
I'm sorry

716
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Third Brother

717
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
Why are you here?

718
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,720
Today, I happened to prepare a table

719
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,720
of my parents' favorite dishes.

720
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I'm so happy.

721
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,920
Try it.

722
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,920
Mom.

723
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,720
My mom

724
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,120
always made tea for us.

725
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,520
At that time,

726
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,920
she always liked to make cakes.

727
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,520
At that time,

728
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,320
I always felt that I could always be late.

729
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,720
It's a pity

730
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,720
that I can't eat

731
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,320
the taste that my mom made anymore.

732
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Why are you saying these things?

733
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,520
Why are you saying these

734
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,520
sad things?

735
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,720
My parents died so unknowingly.

736
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,920
Second Brother,

737
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,920
I still don't understand

738
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,520
who

739
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,320
hates him so much?

740
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,520
Time and time again,

741
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,520
life is unpredictable.

742
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,980
I really can't understand

743
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,920
what happened to the tea.

744
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,220
I don't understand what happened.

745
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,720
Miserableまあ

746
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,920
So restart it.

747
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,120
Give the character a golden finger.

748
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,720
What are you doing?

749
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,820
You little kid

750
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,320
is a little smart.

751
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Xiao Kanyin.

752
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,520
What are you doing?

753
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Your skills have improved so much.

754
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Qiuxue,

755
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,320
are you only allowed to have your own desires

756
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,320
and not allow me to use my skills?

757
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
Then tell me,

758
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:27,320
when did you learn these skills from others?

759
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Did you forget your own feelings?

760
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Did you forget your feelings?

761
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

762
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Stop pretending.

763
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,320
The magic of the illusion trap

764
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,320
is only for us three brothers.

765
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Are you still pretending?

766
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Who's outside?

767
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Father, it's Kanyin.

768
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
It's Kanyin.

769
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
You dared to go back to Qianlong in advance

770
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,320
and secretly learned the Heaven-forgetting Book.

771
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
You killed my parents

772
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,320
and brought down the whole family.

773
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,320
You're the one who killed my parents

774
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,320
and brought down the whole family.

775
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Tell me,

776
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
why?

777
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Why?

778
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,320
Why did you do this?

779
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Why?

780
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Father, mother,

781
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
you're fine.

782
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Where are your brother and your third brother?

783
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
The brothers who brought the Fengyuan brothers

784
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
will be here soon.

785
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,320
I didn't expect that Qiu Shui did it.

786
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,320
He did it.

787
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Why?

788
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,320
The most mysterious person in the Xiao family

789
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,320
always encounters good things and opportunities.

790
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,320
I don't know why.

791
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
I want to change my fate

792
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,320
with my own efforts.

793
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,320
I want to take back everything this time.

794
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
The wind blows, the leaves fall.

795
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,320
As if it were a song to bid farewell to a thousand songs.

796
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
Who can understand

797
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,320
the pain of love?

798
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,320
The sky and the earth are full of hope.

799
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:41,320
The human tears fall, the wind and the leaves are all gone.

800
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,320
The grey fog is like a sand.

801
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,320
I dream of a life that is hard to find.

802
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,320
How many branches are in the world?

803
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Where do the grass and wind grow?

804
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Love and hate are in the past, but the unfulfilled wishes are gone.

805
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,320
I miss the tangle in this world.

806
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,320
I can't get rid of it.

807
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Who can understand the love and hate?

808
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,320
The sword is cut off by the sharp sword.

809
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,320
I can't cut myself off.

810
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,320
The flowers fall, the leaves fall.

811
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:31,320
How many flowers are left in this life?

812
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,320
The wind blows, the leaves fall.

813
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,320
As if it were a song to bid farewell to a thousand songs.

814
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
Who can understand

815
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,320
the pain of love?

816
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,320
The sky and the earth are full of hope.

817
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:53,320
The human tears fall, the wind and the leaves are all gone.

818
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Who can understand

819
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,320
the pain of love?

820
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,320
The sky and the earth are full of hope.

821
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
How many flowers are left in this life?

822
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,320
The sky and the earth are full of hope.

823
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:18,320
The human tears fall, the wind and the leaves are all gone.

824
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,320
The flowers fall, the leaves fall.

825
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:29,320
As if it were a song to bid farewell to a thousand songs.

826
