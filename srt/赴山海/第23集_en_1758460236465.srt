1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Break through the distance of light

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let this battle be a new sea of mountains

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let the sword of light cut through the darkness

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let the sword of light cut through the darkness

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So that we won't forget this 100 years

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let this great battle be a new bloodline

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The sword of life has never changed

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let the thousand years be with me

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll open up my heart

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want to wait for you, who I can't forget

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let you watch Fushan Sea

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The sword of life has never changed

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let you watch Fushan Sea

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No way

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The sword of life has never changed

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The sword of life has never changed

17
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Fushan Sea is full of beauty

18
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The sword of life has never changed

19
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The sword of life has never changed

20
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who is it? Who is there?

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Sancai

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sancai

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You, who are you?

25
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What are you doing?

26
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you doing?

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let me ask you

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You once walked down the street

29
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Were you saved by a mysterious person?

30
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How do you know?

31
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because I'm that mysterious person

32
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How do you prove it?

33
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
When we parted, I left a secret code

34
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Secret code?

35
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Spring cotton is not a small thing

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There are mosquitoes everywhere

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A mountain in the night

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How much is worth to die?

39
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How much is worth to die?

40
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How much is worth to die?

41
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How much is worth to die?

42
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sir

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Really?

44
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are indeed a genius

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The script is written by the three-month-old

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Some people are in trouble and just one

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Then they show up as the undercover of the power bank

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Pretending to give the protagonist a message

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn't expect the system to be destroyed

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And ran to the town

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, okay, okay

52
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I forgot to ask for the name of my benefactor

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I am Xiao Qiushui

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You are Xiao Qiushui

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Didn't you say before

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't keep a secret when you do good things?

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why are you meeting me today?

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Have I said this?

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I know

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It must be my heart that touched the sky

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's why you came to me, right?

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you know

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Last time we parted

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I feel like I've been waiting for someone

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
To start my life mission

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I clearly thought that person was you

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So I kept blowing and playing

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Finally I waited for you

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Great

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There is one more thing

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I always feel that there is another world outside of us

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,940
Actually, I really want to find someone to clear the

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But no one can understand me here

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
For example, in my head

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I will always think of such a melody

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't sing

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's really good

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And a little familiar

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Come and sit

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Come and sit

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are so good

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I just said

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You are not only my benefactor

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But also my confidant

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
By the way

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There is one more sentence

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
In my mind

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's extremely exciting

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Passionate

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I don't understand what it means

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't understand

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What does it mean?

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't understand

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What?

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Which sentence

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
소 Oi

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Slowly

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Damn your alcohol

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This boss

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You don't want to suffer

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
this

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What do you mean

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm full of emotions.

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Only those who have experience

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
can understand.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You can't experience it yet.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I see.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I hope one day,

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can experience

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
such a unique life experience.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, right.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There's one more thing.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't dare to tell others.

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I always feel

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that this world

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
is a huge book.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is that what you think?

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you think

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm crazy?

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You know what?

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
As soon as I fall asleep,

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll see all kinds of strange words

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
in front of me.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, right.

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There's another one.

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I saw a sentence that goes like this.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It says you went to the Emei Golden Peak

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and became the martial arts leader

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
who has been admired by all the people in the world.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
was there to serve you.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I served you tea, rice, water,

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
no, I served you war.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You said eight words out of nowhere.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
God's state is invincible.

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The end is like blood.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Isn't this the bridge

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I wrote before?

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why do you say that?

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is it really like what the old doctor said?

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sick.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You don't have to think so much now.

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't think too much.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't think too much.

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't be nervous.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come on, sit down.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll tell you why.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're wrong.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh my god.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What am I talking about?

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
According to what you said,

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
there is another world that has affected this place.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You gave me the ability to predict.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So I know some future things.

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But you entered this world

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and became the current Xiao Qiu Shui.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Changed some parts.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So what I saw

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
will not change.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's right.

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So now you are not only the end of the power gang,

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but also my tacit partner.

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because you wrote it for me.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So you have another world in your mind.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But in my memory,

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the star of another world

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
is getting less and less.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It doesn't matter.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You have me.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll think for you.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's just that you wrote me so well.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So important.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But I left you in this world

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and bear so much alone.

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I really hate myself

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
for not finding you earlier.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Then what do you want to do next?

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I want to find the power gang first.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What a coincidence.

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm the undercover in the power gang.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I've been suffering for so long.

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't wait to fight with you.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
From now on,

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you are my brother Qiu Shui.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm your three-talented brother.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No matter what happens,

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
you can tell me at any time.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Three-talented brother.

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Come here.

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Come here.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you okay?

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Good idea.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What do I have to do?

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We'll move things

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and give them to this old fox.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's easy.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What do you need to move?

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The corpse.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I wrote you a good book.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't waste it next time.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll write it.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Lord Jian.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This man was watching outside the mansion.

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The guards found him.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Please punish him.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let Liu Suibong come out.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Qiu Shui.

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Your meridians are gone.

215
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Nonsense.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Since I can restore meridians,

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
one day,

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll kill you.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You actually came to my territory

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
to find Liu Suibong?

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Your territory?

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Is your power gang

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
a poor and only

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
a few meridians?

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hurry up.

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Give me Liu Suibong's people.

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You mean Liu Suibong's people are here?

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Stop pretending.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If you don't want to give them to me,

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't mind

231
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
tearing you up.

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is my house.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You said

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Liu Suibong's people are here.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What does he look like?

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What does he look like?

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He looks like a normal person.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He looks the same as the clothes they wear.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Qiu Shui.

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I haven't settled the account of Guang Ling yet.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We haven't settled the account yet.

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If I hadn't followed Liu Suibong,

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I would have seen him secretly

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
give a picture to the people in the mansion.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I wouldn't have followed him.

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What picture?

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Can you bear it?

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can draw it.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Maybe I can talk to you.

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Get out.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're too far away.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's almost like this.

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What are you drawing?

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I've never seen it before.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I understand.

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Liu Suibong can freely enter and exit the mansion of the King of Sword.

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But the King of Sword doesn't know about it.

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Enough.

259
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's no use asking for you.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Let's go.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's go.

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Little Qiu Shui.

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't think I don't know your mind.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You have an enmity with the Power Gang.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So you deliberately instigated a war here.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You keep saying that you want to kill Liu Suifeng.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't you want to kill me?

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I want to kill you.

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But compared to Liu Suifeng

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and the hatred of the Mian Sect,

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
what do you think you're doing?

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You want to kill Liu Suifeng?

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You have a good mouth.

274
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
For me,

275
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
it's really difficult.

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But it's not necessarily to add King of Sword.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Liu Suifeng is around you.

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If he were to be a human,

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I can't stand it.

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They say that King of Sword is the head of the Eighth King.

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now,

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you're being suppressed by a little kid.

283
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If I were you,

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
why didn't you take the position?

285
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You're so rude.

286
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're just a dog of a loser.

287
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You have no power, no power, and you're so weak.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You can't even defeat my guards.

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What right do you have to talk to me about cooperation?

290
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I have no power, no power.

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But I'm smart.

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now I have no power, no power.

293
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't you want the Hero's Order?

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why don't we have a talk about cooperation?

295
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What do you think?

296
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You have the Hero's Order.

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Liu Suifeng has been watching you.

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If he really had it, would he not notice?

299
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you want to trade, take it out first.

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you think I'm still so stupid?

301
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If I take it out now,

302
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't afford to lose to Bai Song.

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
How about this?

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I can tell you a secret first.

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The Hero's Order has the three masters' fingerprints

306
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
of Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei.

307
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The fingerprints are already there.

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The person who knows the tricks in the martial arts world is very familiar.

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Could it really be in his hands?

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
As long as you kill Liu Suifeng for me,

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll give you both hands after the matter is done.

312
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Are you really willing to give it to me?

313
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm the one who once asked you to kill yourself

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and destroy your meridians.

315
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You destroyed my martial arts.

316
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I took your identity.

317
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I had to let me know about the Guangling case.

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The Hero's Order is in my hands.

319
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Not only can't it play its role,

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
it also caused trouble for me.

321
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
My parents died because of the Hero's Order.

322
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
As long as you kill Liu Suifeng for me,

323
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll give you the Hero's Order after the matter is done.

324
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Master, I found Kang Chu Yu.

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let him in.

326
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You'd better come out and take a look.

327
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's go.

328
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Who did this?

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The body is heavily damaged.

330
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The wound is hard to heal.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I found this on him.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
A stone stone?

333
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The stone stone on Qiu Ran and Qiu Bo

334
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
is giving you a good protection.

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The eight kings are all made of gold.

336
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This ordinary stone stone

337
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
is only used to control the spies of the other clans.

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How can Kang Chu Yu have this?

339
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Besides Master,

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
only Liu Suifeng has the right to control the spies.

341
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Besides, he has been targeting you

342
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
to stop us.

343
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I think he must have used the stone stone

344
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
to control Kang Chu Yu

345
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and found out a lot of secrets.

346
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If he finds us...

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It seems that we must kill Liu Suifeng as soon as possible.

348
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But the gold on your body

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
is still less effective than the dead gold.

350
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This is too troublesome.

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We must solve it.

352
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
King of Sword,

353
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
you have to think it over.

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If you make a decision as soon as possible,

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
the Hero Order

356
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
will be taken away by Liu Suifeng.

357
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can cooperate with you.

358
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But before that,

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
you have to give me a name.

360
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you can't do it,

361
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
then you are useless to me.

362
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What are you talking about?

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Go to the Ghost King's base in Yimen Town

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and get something.

365
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Feng'er,

366
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
you have been worried about something

367
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
at home these days.

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Are you

369
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
thinking about Xiao Qiushui?

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm worried about you.

371
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm worried about you.

372
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm worried about you.

373
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm worried about you.

374
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Father, I...

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can see

376
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
your feelings for him.

377
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't want to stop you.

378
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But the most important thing now

379
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
is the way out of our family.

380
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The Three Realms have always been

381
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
careless about the position of the master.

382
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And I,

383
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm dragged by this old injury.

384
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think it's very useful.

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Father, don't say that.

386
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
When I find the Heaven's Love Book,

387
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
you will be fine.

388
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Actually,

389
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I just want to use the Heaven's Love Book

390
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
to heal my wounds.

391
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What I want more is

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
to protect me

393
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and our family

394
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and my Feng'er.

395
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Father.

396
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I understand.

397
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's go back to the room

398
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and take the medicine.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay.

400
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Father.

401
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What are you doing?

402
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
My father was so kind to you.

403
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Why are you so cruel to Jiang Chong?

404
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You are the only one

405
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
who can save my father.

406
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You are the only one

407
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
who can save my father.

408
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You are the only one

409
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
who can save my father.

410
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
My father was so kind to you.

411
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why are you so cruel to Jiang Chong?

412
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What's the problem?

413
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't run away.

414
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm sorry, master.

415
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But I can't control myself.

416
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm in pain.

417
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't want to live like this.

418
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Father.

419
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Poison pen.

420
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Father.

421
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Do you recognize this ancient bug?

422
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The power gang is more dangerous

423
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
than the dead.

424
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is the ancient bug.

425
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
No wonder your martial arts is so good.

426
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But our Tang family is heavily guarded.

427
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
How did the power gang get in?

428
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Tang Song must have done it.

429
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Thanks to your trick.

430
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Now the King of Jian

431
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
is suspicious of the people around him.

432
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The place is so crowded.

433
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You are the only one

434
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
who can send the King of Beis to protect the King of Jin.

435
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But he doesn't

436
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
trust me completely.

437
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I always feel that

438
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
he doesn't want to kill Liu Suifeng.

439
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He just has a deal with me for the time being.

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So

441
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
we can't help him

442
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
with a trick.

443
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You are so good.

444
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
if you can write me

446
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
smarter,

447
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I can help you more.

448
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Sancai.

449
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You are good at music

450
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and you are familiar with

451
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
many things in the past.

452
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's a good idea

453
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
to be a spy.

454
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Think about it.

455
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If a decision

456
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
has only advantages,

457
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
it's not fun.

458
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So

459
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
you are quite cute.

460
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Really?

461
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yes.

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Brother Chu.

463
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Thank you

464
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
for writing me so well.

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
By the way,

466
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
do you know

467
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
what the King of Jian

468
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
asked the Poet King

469
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
to do?

470
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's about the fate of the Eighth Prince.

471
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
As long as we can find him,

472
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the King of Jian

473
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
won't wait for Liu Suifeng

474
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and kill him at will.

475
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's an important point.

476
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But

477
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
the King of Ghosts is a man of nature

478
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and has a strong taste.

479
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
He usually

480
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
likes to keep people alive

481
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
in the coffin

482
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
to make medicine.

483
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
There is also a nickname

484
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
for his stronghold,

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the coffin nest.

486
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
We can definitely find his traces

487
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in the vegetable shop in the Yi Men Town.

488
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Rumor has it that the King of Ghosts

489
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
is a man of nature and is cautious.

490
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The more people,

491
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the more suspicious he is.

492
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This thing

493
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
is really good.

494
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Even if someone falls again,

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
he won't be obedient in the end.

496
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
There is only one left.

497
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Don't worry.

498
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
There are many things

499
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
that the King of Ghosts wants.

500
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
By the way,

501
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
have you done

502
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
what I told you to do?

503
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm ready.

504
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Let's go.

505
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Don't cry.

506
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Don't cry.

507
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You should die.

508
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The King of Ghosts wants the living.

509
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yes.

510
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Let's go.

511
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What are you doing here?

512
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm here to find the King of Ghosts.

513
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Mr. Tang.

514
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And Miss Tang.

515
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Miss Song.

516
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Why do you need

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
so many herbs?

518
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The King of Ghosts has been raising too many insects.

519
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They have lost their vitality.

520
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
He needs to take more blood

521
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
to get the herbs.

522
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But this is a water-based drug.

523
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If he wants to recover completely,

524
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
he must take him to the place

525
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that Mr. Tang said to be the best place to live.

526
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
By the way,

527
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
a few days ago,

528
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
the internal court of the Power Gang was attacked by traitors.

529
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I heard that

530
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Liu Fu and Dao Wang

531
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
killed the King of Ghosts together.

532
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
This matter

533
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
even the mysterious

534
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Chief Li and Madam Li of your gang

535
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
were involved.

536
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Is it true?

537
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You have good information.

538
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
In my opinion,

539
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Liu Fu's martial arts

540
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
can be done by only him

541
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
to get rid of the King of Ghosts.

542
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Why bother to make such a big fuss?

543
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Is it possible that

544
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
your Power Gang

545
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
likes some exaggerated styles?

546
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
What do you know?

547
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's not easy to kill the King of Ghosts.

548
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The eight kings in the gang

549
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
have their own strategies.

550
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
If there is no wisdom,

551
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
it would have been a mess.

552
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm curious, too.

553
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
How can Chief Li

554
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
let the eight kings

555
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and Liu Fu's chief

556
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
be safe?

557
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It is said that

558
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
more than eight kings in the Power Gang

559
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
were all planted with a thorn.

560
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's better to die than to die.

561
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Is it true?

562
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The best way to contain

563
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
the best target of the other party

564
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
is their own lives.

565
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If they

566
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
kill others,

567
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
they will die too.

568
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's a pity that

569
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
our Power Gang is smart.

570
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I don't want to live.

571
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Miss Song, don't be angry.

572
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's not the first time

573
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
we talk about the secrets of your gang.

574
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We are all young masters.

575
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
We have no second thoughts.

576
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
There is really

577
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
no secret in this world.

578
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The king of the stone wall

579
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
who can control the essence

580
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
is made up of

581
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
the blood of

582
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Chief and Shurong.

583
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's controlled by them.

584
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Even if others know,

585
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
it's useless.

586
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's useless.

587
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So the king of stone wall

588
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
is here.

589
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Miss Song, you misunderstood.

590
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
We are just worried

591
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
about the safety of Liu Fu's gang leader.

592
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Since he is safe,

593
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
we can rest assured.

594
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But

595
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
once the king of stone wall

596
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
has a good reputation,

597
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
all the stone walls

598
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
will be destroyed

599
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
if he is used to

600
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
re-educate and raise them.

601
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So if you want to

602
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
continue to control the people of Tang,

603
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
you have to make sure that

604
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
the king of stone wall can go there on time

605
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and be nourished by the spirit of heaven and earth.

606
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I understand.

607
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I will definitely take care of this.

608
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The young master has set out.

609
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Let's go too.

610
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yes.

611
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes.

612
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The king of stone wall is very powerful.

613
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't follow me.

614
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The king of stone wall is very powerful.

615
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Don't follow me.

616
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Don't follow me.

617
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Don't follow me.

618
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Don't follow me.

619
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Don't follow me.

620
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Don't follow me.

621
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Don't follow me.

622
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Don't follow me.

623
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Don't follow me.

624
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Don't follow me.

625
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Don't follow me.

626
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Don't follow me.

627
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Don't follow me.

628
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Don't follow me.

629
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Don't follow me.

630
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Don't follow me.

631
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Don't follow me.

632
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Don't follow me.

633
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Don't follow me.

634
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't follow me.

635
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Don't follow me.

636
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Don't follow me.

637
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Don't follow me.

638
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Don't follow me.

639
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't follow me.

640
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Don't follow me.

641
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Don't follow me.

642
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't follow me.

643
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
Vice Remembering Tower Master, sorry for keeping you waiting.

644
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,760
The head of Leng Touqing

645
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,280
who fancies the Guards of Equal Assets

646
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,420
bullies my Power Gang

647
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,400
Hm, Presbyter,

648
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,480
make a guess.

649
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,440
Where is he right now?

650
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:27,180
You are very

651
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,420
a**- up.

652
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,960
The most important thing is to invite the King of Shi Bin first.

653
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,600
Zege is too weak.

654
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,360
You should be extra careful.

655
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,840
I'm watching you.

656
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,520
You don't have to worry.

657
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,000
You have the smell of life.

658
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,160
Chief Fu, please take a rest.

659
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,720
I'll take the King of Shi Bin to have a meal.

660
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,640
Yes.

661
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,760
King of Ghost,

662
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,960
this is fresh fire blood.

663
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,040
It will be beneficial to the King of Shi Bin.

664
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,280
Please.

665
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It's good.

666
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,640
It's alive.

667
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,120
It can be used for a while.

668
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,600
That's the King of Shi Bin.

669
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,400
As long as I kill him,

670
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,800
I'll be able to save him.

671
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,720
The stone whip on the disciple of Tang Sect

672
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,000
can be used to solve it.

673
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,520
No.

674
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,680
There are other ghosts here.

675
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,400
Oh.

676
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,720
Qiu Shui.

677
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:42,780
Tang Xing and critical

678
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,040
go

679
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,080
Go

680
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
ここ

681
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
这里

682
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
这里

683
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
这里

684
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
这里

685
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
这里

686
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
这里

687
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
这里

688
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
这里

689
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
这里

690
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
他的内力

691
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
怎么可能

692
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
有水封

693
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,960
I will follow the wind.

694
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Today...

695
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,160
Qiushui!

696
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,800
There's an ambush down there!

697
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
Be careful!

698
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Tang Feng.

699
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,360
Tang Feng! Tang Feng!

700
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,080
Qiushui, be careful!

701
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,480
Tang Feng, how are you? Are you okay?

702
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,080
I'm trapped in the flower company.

703
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,960
I'll take you out first.

704
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Let's go.

705
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Boss!

706
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,480
Boss!

707
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,200
Miss Tang, are you hurt?

708
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
We're all fine.

709
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,200
Let's not talk anymore.

710
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Let's go save her.

711
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,080
Okay.

712
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,000
Let's go!

713
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,760
Everyone, please do your best

714
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,280
Boss, it's breathing.

715
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,680
Right, it's just they're poisoned.

716
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,640
Their lives are at stake.

717
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,240
Okay.

718
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,280
Help everyone out.

719
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,680
You check the hole in the mountain

720
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,040
and then go to Tangren Pavilion.

721
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Kuizhong has repaid his debt.

722
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,760
I'm sorry.

723
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,320
The Ghost King has taken the King of Shibian

724
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,240
to evacuate the Ghost Lord.

725
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,680
Young Master,

726
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,840
I think the water of Xiaoqiu

727
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,080
is not enough to make up for the water.

728
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,160
The water of Xiaoqiu

729
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,640
is not as strong as it used to be.

730
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Do you have anything to hide from me?

731
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,600
I...

732
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,000
I...

733
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,600
I did hide the water of Xiaoqiu

734
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
and ate the five-star menu.

735
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,080
Do you know the consequences of betraying me?

736
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,640
Young Master,

737
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,200
even if you want to kill me,

738
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,760
I will never betray you.

739
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,280
Really?

740
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,200
What did Xiaoqiu Water

741
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,440
give you?

742
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,720
I was never bewitched by the water of Xiaoqiu.

743
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,040
I just saw him

744
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,680
save me once in the hands of Shaoliu Tear.

745
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,120
I want to repay him for his kindness.

746
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
I swear that

747
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,640
I, Song Mingzhu,

748
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,040
will not have any relationship with anyone except you.

749
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,320
So,

750
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,680
as long as I have a kindness towards you,

751
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,040
I can bribe you.

752
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,680
I swear that

753
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,840
I will buy you.

754
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,840
I, Liu Suifeng,

755
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,480
am not a heartless person like you.

756
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
You are wrong.

757
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,560
Even if it's a great kindness,

758
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,440
it can't move my loyalty to you.

759
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,240
I'm just helping him

760
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,720
for the sake of the world.

761
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,120
I'm just curious

762
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,080
to see someone like him.

763
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,680
What can I do if I'm alive?

764
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
But if he threatens you,

765
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,360
I will never let him go.

766
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,520
What kind of person

767
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,040
is he?

768
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,800
Tell me.

769
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,920
I can't tell you.

770
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,160
I just think

771
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,840
he is different from everyone

772
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,920
I know in the past.

773
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I feel that

774
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't have to face the day

775
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,320
when I can't see him.

776
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,560
I can choose another life.

777
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,560
Where is he?

778
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,440
He's not here today.

779
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,440
Maybe he always does

780
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,640
something strange

781
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,320
and talked something strange.

782
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,000
It feels weird.

783
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,000
No matter what you said,

784
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,520
it is my fault.

785
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Irag everything.

786
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Don't drink water within seven days.

787
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,680
If it rains heavily,

788
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,960
you can turn to fire.

789
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,160
Yes.

790
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,720
During this time,

791
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,880
the most difficult thing to do is to cry.

792
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,520
I'm afraid that

793
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,200
this is a dangerous time.

794
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,920
You're always cruel.

795
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,000
You know it.

796
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,680
But I didn't expect

797
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
you wouldn't open your eyes to me.

798
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,400
I'm sorry.

799
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,920
I'm sorry.

800
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm sorry.

801
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,640
I'm sorry.

802
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
I'm sorry.

803
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
I'm sorry.

804
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I'm sorry.

805
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm sorry.

806
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
I'm sorry.

807
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
I'm sorry.

808
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
I'm sorry.

809
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
I'm sorry.

810
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
I'm sorry.

811
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
I'm sorry.

812
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
I'm sorry.

813
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
I'm sorry.

814
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
I'm sorry.

815
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
I'm sorry.

816
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
I'm sorry.

817
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm sorry.

818
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm sorry.

819
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
I'm sorry.

820
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
I'm sorry.

821
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
I'm sorry.

822
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,480
It's okay.

823
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,400
It's your suspicion.

824
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
You're wrong.

825
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,640
Prince Shiqing

826
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,640
can have this guy

827
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,000
However, he is not .

828
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,240
He did the wrong thing,

829
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
at last.

830
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:30,960
But every time these diesemus

831
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,300
F incorporated in the person

832
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,580
isAUDIO

833
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,560
Gerilim

834
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,240
I rushed over right away

835
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,040
As a result, I met two brothers on the way

836
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,840
Just go with them

837
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,240
But it's a pity

838
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Nothing in the ghost bell was found

839
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,840
They all took it away

840
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,440
Liu Suifeng is a very cautious person

841
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,240
So things must have been moved away

842
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,040
But it's not a loss

843
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,240
I saw Miss Tang today

844
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,640
I fell in love with our boss

845
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,840
Yes yes yes

846
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,240
I also saw

847
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
I saw the boss and Miss Tang

848
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,040
Cooperate so well

849
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,840
It's really a match

850
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,440
Yes yes yes

851
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Yes yes yes

852
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,240
What's right

853
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,440
Why are you talking so much

854
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,040
Come and drink

855
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,240
Drink drink

856
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Come to drink

857
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Come to drink

858
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Cheers

859
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,440
Cheers boss

860
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,240
Come to drink

861
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Cheers

862
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
Everyone is here

863
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,640
Finally, following the mark of Brother Zuoqiu

864
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
I found it here

865
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,440
Just in time

866
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,640
Sit down and eat

867
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,640
Just in time

868
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,040
Sit down and eat

869
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,240
Miss Xu, please sit down

870
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Two wine bowls

871
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,040
Zuoqiu

872
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
You don't introduce us to your new friends

873
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,240
These two are Uncle Qu's two uncles

874
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,840
Tian Xingyue

875
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Qiu Nanbu

876
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,440
it is good

877
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Today is the old friend meeting

878
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,240
Then we

879
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,640
Drink a few more today

880
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,040
it is good

881
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,840
Come

882
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,640
God's state is good

883
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,840
The world is invincible

884
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Look

885
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,440
I want to show you this thing

886
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,440
This is

887
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,840
World Hero Order

888
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,840
How did you find it

889
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,240
Old Mrs. Wu gave me a dagger that day

890
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Said that Mr. Zhang wanted to give it to me

891
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
And I accidentally found

892
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,240

893
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
