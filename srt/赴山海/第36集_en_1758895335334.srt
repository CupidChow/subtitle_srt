2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want to wait for you to come

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if the night is bright

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want to wait for you to come

Episode 16

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This cloak

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This cloak belongs to my sister Yuan'er

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Senior

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Before, there were many people

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I didn't have the opportunity to return to the original place

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is from Old Madam Wu

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And Master Zhichen

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I entrusted it to you

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Master Zhichen once mentioned

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That year, Lin Mei

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Was caught by Jiang's brothers

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
During the escape process

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Unfortunately, he was infected with a bad breath

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Fortunately, Zhichen closed the door

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And passed by the place

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But Zhichen

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Didn't have any news about him

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's all my fault

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is my lifetime

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The biggest regret

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Tang Gate has been controlled by me

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Xiao Qiushui

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
How should you deal with it?

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sancai sent a message

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
General Wu has received the order

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He wants to go to the Tang Gate

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But he can't

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He wants to go to the Tang Gate

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But he can't

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
General Wu has sent a message

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's okay, General Wu will return to the capital after receiving the order

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Brother, General Wu left the Magistrate Pass

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What if the North Emperor takes advantage of the crime

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Isn't it troublesome?

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Not only that

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
General Wu may also be on his way back to the capital

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
May be in the past

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So we have to act faster

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Later, General Wu will be in more danger

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Everyone has been investigating separately recently

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Also found some suspicious places

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
About the

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Organize the people

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Go to investigate immediately

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Search carefully

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes

54
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yuhan

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Brothers, the stronghold over there

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Has been occupied by the Power Gang

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Great

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This must be the stronghold of the British

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's the power gang's mission

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We should catch these spies

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Since the boss trusts them

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Go

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No more soup

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The old injury is a nuisance to the boss

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What injury?

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You don't know your age

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And you are running day and night

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's tiring

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are tired

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I will take care of all the small things in the gang

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All for myself

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How is it going over there?

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xiao Kanyan has used the twelve-leaf flower mist water knife as a stronghold

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The water knife is very large

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The water flow is very complicated

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And it's very complicated

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We can't find the result yet

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Then send more people over

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is the information

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
From the British

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
To Song Mingzhu

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Twenty thousand elite soldiers

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Walked through the south of Xianren Pass

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And encircled the west

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And formed a line

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If the North Wilderness people

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Should succeed in conquering the South

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They will completely destroy the people

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And resist the North Wilderness

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The North Wilderness is pretending to seek peace

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And gather twenty thousand elite soldiers

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
To fight in secret

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The court called General Wu

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The Xianren Pass is in a state of disarray

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Now the world is in a state of panic

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And there are spies

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Who are being bought by the water knife

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And they can make the enemy to attack the boss

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
General Wu is safe

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And can stay in the battle

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If he goes back to the capital

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The Xianren Pass will be changed

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If he doesn't go back

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He will be punished

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you report the collusion

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Between the water knife and the North Wilderness

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
To the emperor

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Can you make the court

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
To be more patient

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Suifeng

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hurry up and get rid of the British

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And stop the North Wilderness elite soldiers

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
To attack the South

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If only I could help you

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To be more patient

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I heard that the Shenzhou conflict

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is also causing the British to be strong

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The West

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Has always been like this

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Young Master

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think the Chief's body

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Is not in good condition

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Please help me

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hero Yan

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You should walk less

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Come, take the medicine

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Doctor Xiao

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
My wound is healed

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
These days, you need to

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Take good care of yourself

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The Soul-throwing Sting

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I and Qiu Shui are asking people to find a solution

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is nothing

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's nothing

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Chief Li

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What do you mean

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You are not in good condition

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You need to take the medicine

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I have to go

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will go

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You can go

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will go

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I will go

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will go

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will go

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will go

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I will go

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I will go

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What do you mean

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This Chief Order

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is the task of the Power Gang

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It is also

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
A duty to the whole martial art world

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
To the duty of all the sects

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because the Power Gang

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Is holding the handle of all the sects

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This Hero Xiao

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is really joking

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It seems that Hero Xiao is very

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Uncomfortable

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
With the banana, the strength is gone

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
With the banana, the strength is gone

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
With the whole banana, the whole body is gone

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
With the whole banana, the whole body is gone

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Chief Li

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You should use the cloth as a death net

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And the thousand-stripping paper

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
To force people to fight

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Good

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
In this chaotic world

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Only by using thunder

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
To defeat the enemy

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
To stabilize the situation

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Can we rest assured that the future generations will be able to

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
To communicate with each other

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
With a clear mind

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is how we can rebuild the new martial arts world

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is how we can rebuild the new martial arts world

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What you are doing is more like the book of the emperor

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It is not the way of the martial arts world

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If so

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Then Hero Xiao

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What about the future generations of the re-establishment of the martial arts world?

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
As long as the mind is narrow

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Everyone can become the future

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Chief Li

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Your chief spirit can also be taken back

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I am the same as you

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But now I can't communicate

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I am now in the sword

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I need to drink on time

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Could it be that it's poisonous wine?

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Drink it

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Poison has entered the tongue

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But now the poison has entered my body

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But now the poison has entered my body

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If you know that it's poisonous wine

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Then why are you still not drinking?

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Then why are you still not drinking?

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There is no other choice

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
I have no other choice.

206
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm not afraid of death.

207
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,680
I really can't imagine

208
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,600
who else I can give this peony to.

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,600
Chief Li,

210
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
you still don't understand.

211
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
This peony is like a sacred pearl.

212
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,400
Even if I run away from the high house,

213
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm still

214
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,680
a person who wants to change the world.

215
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,600
This is not my own way,

216
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,440
but the way of all the people.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,720
Fine.

218
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,200
The court wants to stop the war.

219
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,240
So they called General Wu to return to the capital.

220
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,680
But now,

221
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
the North Emperor colluded with the waterway

222
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,640
to let the elite troops sneak into the west.

223
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,080
I think this war

224
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,640
is inevitable.

225
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,160
So we can't let General Wu

226
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,880
leave the Immortal Temple.

227
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,920
Then we must unite

228
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,480
and try our best to save General Wu.

229
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,440
Art aligned or��려 Kyum.

230
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,080
No one needs to rule this pugilistic land in the future,

231
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,600
and everyone has fellow changes

232
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,840
through process and effort.

233
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,040
I mustn't upset the power of the cube

234
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,400
and tell Childe Tang anti-ekid.

235
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,940
She has said the way you followed her has allowed her to replace all the characters,

236
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,800
including new and new imports of weapons like Cont catching,

237
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,540
Blackги, Handling, and Sei.

238
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
What else did you mention?

239
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,540
You said that

240
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,540
the way of the Power Gang is already out of date.

241
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,540
Xiao Qiushui will lead everyone to change their faces.

242
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,540
And integrate new martial arts.

243
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
I really don't understand.

244
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,540
You have been working for the Power Gang for so many years.

245
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
How can you let him

246
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
pass the throne to an outsider?

247
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
Why would you pass the throne for no reason?

248
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,540
He's been acting differently lately.

249
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,540
Could it be that

250
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,540
his body is just like what I'm worried about?

251
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,540
He's completely fine.

252
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,540
Young Master,

253
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,540
you already know.

254
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Go somewhere with me.

255
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,540
I haven't seen you in years.

256
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,540
A group of cats and dogs who are looking for love

257
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,540
are all looking for me.

258
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
It's a pity that you're not surprised.

259
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,540
In the past few years,

260
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
the generation is not as good as the generation before.

261
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540
It's getting boring.

262
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
What are you two up to?

263
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,540
Who told you to let Yan Kuangtu

264
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,540
hand over Wang Quan and Tian Xiong?

265
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,540
You're so cowardly.

266
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,540
If you have the guts, go find Master Yan.

267
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,540
What's the difference between looking for death and finding him?

268
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
We're not stupid.

269
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Kill them!

270
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
Go!

271
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
Hurry!

272
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,540
The poison on the dart can't go far.

273
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Let's split up and search.

274
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,540
Go!

275
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Dr. Xiao!

276
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
Dr. Xiao!

277
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
It's Master Yan.

278
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,540
Dr. Xiao!

279
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Why is it so noisy?

280
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Master Yan!

281
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Dr. Xiao!

282
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540
Why is the fan on you?

283
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,540
Yuan'er.

284
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
You're Yuan'er.

285
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
You're really Yuan'er.

286
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
I finally found you.

287
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm your brother.

288
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
Brother?

289
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,540
You don't remember?

290
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
You don't remember that I can understand?

291
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
But look.

292
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Look at this gold fly.

293
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
Do you remember anything?

294
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
This is the only thing that Mother left us.

295
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,540
Only your young master's young master

296
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
can wake him up.

297
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
I'm your brother.

298
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540

I'm your brother.

312
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
I'm your brother.

313
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
I'm your brother.

314
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
I'm your brother.

315
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540

316
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,540

I'm your brother.

357
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
I'm your brother.

358
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,540
I'm your brother.

359
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Baixue.

360
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Can't you tell!

361
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,700
That child your brother gave you

362
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,920
will not be a property.

363
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,500
Will you be a guest in that coach?

364
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,460
Let's be friends.

365
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,540
Come!

366
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,120
Baixue.

367
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,660
Baixue.

368
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,140
Boss modest.

369
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,620
How about not saying it?

370
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,540
Okay.

371
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,020
I'd like to ask you a question.

372
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
I thought...

373
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,020
that everything was fake.

374
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
I thought...

375
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,020
I would never find my family again.

376
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
I didn't expect...

377
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,020
I didn't expect...

378
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,020
that you are my brother.

379
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Yuan'er.

380
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Brother.

381
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
I've been looking for you for so long.

382
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,020
Thank you.

383
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Yuan'er.

384
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
I'm sorry.

386
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
It's all right.

390
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,020
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Jingren is my sister.

393
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
I remember when I was a child,

394
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,020
I was once taken away by Jingren.

395
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Because of the excessive fear,

396
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
and the back-brain injury,

397
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,020
my memory of childhood was very blurred.

398
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
This time, thanks to Jingfeiyan,

399
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
we two brothers were able to recognize each other.

400
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,020
I'm really happy to see my brother again.

401
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,020
But,

402
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
when I was young, I came to the Xiao family.

403
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,020
They treated me like their own daughter.

404
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Don't worry.

405
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
Brother,

406
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
I've always let you suffer.

407
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
I don't know how to make up for it.

408
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,020
Brother,

409
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I have nothing else to ask.

410
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,020
I just hope you can promise me one thing.

411
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
Okay, say it.

412
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,020
The Soul-gathering Cauldron in your body

413
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
must be removed as soon as possible.

414
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
Okay.

415
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
Senior.

416
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
Okay.

417
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
Okay.

418
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Since you've agreed so painfully,

419
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
then you can't change it.

420
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Okay, sister.

421
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,020
Take care of your senior.

422
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
I'll go out for a while.

423
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Wait for me to come back.

424
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Qiu Shui,

425
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
thank you.

426
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
The Tang Gate has been changed.

427
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Tang Yangshu and Tang Laotai were killed by Tang Song.

428
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,020
The other side was controlled by Kui Lei Zhen.

429
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
It's strange.

430
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
The door is wide open.

431
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
There's no guard guarding the gate.

432
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Be careful.

433
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
If you take a step forward,

434
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
you'll get stuck in the traffic.

435
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
Okay.

436
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Thank you for your reminder.

437
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
The door is wide open.

438
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
It's not a guest.

439
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
It's a guard.

440
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
Should we go in or not?

441
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,020
Isn't there only one place to meet?

442
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Who are these people?

443
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,020
Why are they all locked up here?

444
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
The drug addict.

445
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
The blood is almost dry.

446
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
Don't go out.

447
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Don't go out.

448
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Don't go out.

449
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,020
Don't go out.

450
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,020
Don't go out.

451
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Finally, someone comes.

452
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
Did Tang Gong remind me?

453
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,020
I knew it.

454
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
He'll need me sooner or later.

455
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
He's a filial man.

456
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,020
Tang Gong is dead.

457
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,020
What?

458
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
How did he die?

459
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,020
I killed him.

460
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
Dead?

461
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
He's dead?

462
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,020
A drug addict

463
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,020
will suffer for his whole life.

464
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
I can only do this

465
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
for Tang Gong.

466
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
I can kill him to avenge him.

467
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
But you told me

468
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
you killed him

469
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
when he was dead.

470
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,020
You killed him

471
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,020
because you wanted to kill him.

472
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Kill him.

473
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,020
You old man.

474
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
You should take action first.

475
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Young man,

476
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
the drug on you

477
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
is the drug you were trained by Tang Gong, right?

478
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,020
But you're lucky.

479
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,020
You haven't become a real drug addict.

480
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Now that you killed him,

481
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,020
why are you here again?

482
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
I want Tang Gong's

483
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
blood-sucking magic.

484
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Since you're a drug addict,

485
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
you should listen to

486
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
other people's orders for your whole life.

487
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
Do you know

488
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
blood-sucking magic

489
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,020
is to trade your life for another?

490
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
Trade my life for another?

491
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Of course I know.

492
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,020
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
People should die

494
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,020
for their lives.

495
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
Go.

496
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Young Master, I found it.

497
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Zi Lian,

498
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
what should we do?

499
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
The pain of being a ghost

500
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
should be completely

501
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,020
buried by you.

502
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Tang Feng.

503
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
Tang Feng.

504
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
If you hurt me now,

505
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
he won't let you go.

506
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Feng.

507
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Tang Feng,

508
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,020
do it now.

509
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
He killed your father.

510
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
What are you talking about?

511
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Yin Zi, stop.

512
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
Feng.

513
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Feng.

514
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Feng.

515
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Go.

516
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
Tang Feng.

517
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Young Master and I are here to save you.

518
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
Go.

519
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
Young Master,

520
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
this...

521
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
It's okay to talk alone.

522
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
It's only a few days.

523
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
The spread of the poison

524
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
is much faster than I thought.

525
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
Young Master,

526
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
if you want to detoxify,

527
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
you should do as I said before.

528
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
I have the Tang family...

529
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
Young Master,

530
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
the Peiyuan Pill

531
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
has a special effect

532
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
on the original Peiyuan.

533
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
I hope it can relieve

534
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,020
the poison in your body.

535
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I can't cure the poison

536
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
that the chief has.

537
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
Demon King,

538
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
go to see Young Master Xiao first.

539
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,020
How is Miss Tang?

540
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
Yes.

541
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,020
I will use the method

542
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
they want.

543
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
I will use the method they want

544
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
to detoxify the poison for you.

545
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,020
Sui Feng,

546
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
you heard it just now.

547
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
Demon King gave me

548
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,020
a special Peiyuan Pill.

549
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,020
Since you are in the Power Gang,

550
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
it's a new life.

551
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,020
From now on,

552
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,020
you don't need to

553
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,020
be trapped in these old things.

554
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
I will never forget

555
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,020
what you did for me before.

556
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,020
Don't think too much.

557
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
Leave us.

558
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
Young Master Xiao,

559
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,020
the puppet needle in Miss Tang's body

560
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,020
has been deep in the bone.

561
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
If...

562
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
What?

563
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,020
Please tell me.

564
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
If you are careless,

565
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,020
the puppet needle will reflect the needle.

566
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Young Master Xiao,

567
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
please wait a moment.

568
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,020
Senior,

569
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
it's a matter of life and death.

570
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
Since it's deep in the bone,

571
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
we can't wait any longer.

572
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,020
Please tell me

573
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
how to cure it.

574
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
Young Master Xiao,

575
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
when you are taking the needle,

576
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,020
you must protect yourself

577
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
in case the puppet needle

578
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
goes into your meridians.

579
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
Be careful

580
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,020
and reflect it early.

581
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020

I will take the needle.

622
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Tang Fang.

623
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,020
Tang Fang.

624
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Xiaoshan,

625
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,020
I'm dying.

626
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
They're gone.

627
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,260
Everything is gone.

628
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,500

I'll go with you.

665
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,020
Ecstasy.

666
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,020
Nothingnessitis.

667
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,820
I will help you no matter what.

668
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,660
Do not website,

669
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,080
justドンbit,

670
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,280
send some departures.

671
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,100
you want to give it to your brother,

672
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980

💰🖤

679
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,780
I'll go to Qingcuan sooner or later.

680
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,820
Senior Yan,

681
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
you're a soul-saving nail.

682
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,740
Don't drink too much.

683
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,300
If your sister finds out,

684
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,500
you'll be in trouble.

685
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,220
You too.

686
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,980
Mm.

687
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,780
I didn't expect

688
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,660
that the first person in the world,

689
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,300
Yan Kuangtu, was afraid that Yuan'er would take a look at me.

690
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,700
Now, while he's away,

691
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,460
I dare to drink with you.

692
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,180
You're not afraid.

693
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,620
You're obviously concerned about him.

694
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,740
I didn't expect

695
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,260
that you'd invite the King of Medicine to the Power Gang for me.

696
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,700
You pulled out the Soul-saving nail in my body.

697
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,180
But the Soul-saving nail

698
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,500
has a deep impact on me.

699
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,780
I'm afraid that it's hard to recover.

700
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,020
Don't tell Yuan'er about this for now.

701
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,700
Mm.

702
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,380
Let me ask you.

703
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,900
Why are you alive?

704
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,500
I can die without regret

705
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,340
if I have the King of Medicine.

706
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,860
But I'll never die

707
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,220
if I have the King of Medicine.

708
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,500
Never die?

709
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,500
Find me

710
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,220
the medicine on the list.

711
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,060
I must find it.

712
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,180
Why do you need these medicine?

713
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,380
I'm sorry.

714
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,420
Just do it well.

715
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,660
You don't need to know about the others.

716
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,580
I shouldn't have asked.

717
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,660
I just want to help you.

718
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,580
You're questioning me.

719
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,340
I dare not.

720
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,980
Whatever your decision is,

721
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,780
I'll help you to make it.

722
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,140
I just want to be by your side

723
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,620
until the last moment of my life.

724
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,380
Be careful.

725
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,220
Don't let others know.

726
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,300
Okay.

727
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,740
I'll go get all the medicine for you.

728
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,860
Buns!

729
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,620
Come and eat buns!

730
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Hot buns!

731
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,660
Buns!

732
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,980
Come and buy buns!

733
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
Buns!

734
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,980
Buns!

735
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,980
Buns!

736
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Buns!

737
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,980
Come and buy buns!

738
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,020
Send the medicine back to the Prince.

739
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,780
Go from the back door.

740
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:05,980
Yes.

741
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,020
Boss, here's the money.

742
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,540
How did you get the time to come to the pharmacy?

743
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,860
I came here

744
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,860
to get medicine.

745
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,940
What's the difference?

746
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,420
It's very important

747
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,980
that you came here to get medicine.

748
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,700
I'm curious about it.

749
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
The Prince of Shu is so soft today.

750
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,460
He came here to get medicine.

751
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,860
He doesn't believe it.

752
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,060
Let me have a look.

753
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,820
You came here to get medicine

754
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,380
because you're so lucky.

755
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,060
I'll do whatever you want.

756
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,420
You can do whatever you want.

757
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,980
Now the whole gang is in a mess.

758
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,020
Who's the next traitor?

759
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,020
I don't want

760
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,740
the knife I made for Liu Suifeng

761
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,620
to be used one day.

762
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,620
In this way,

763
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,220
it will hurt the leader's heart.

764
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,100
Don't worry, Prince.

765
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,940
The knife you made

766
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,460
is useless in this life.

767
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,820
Thank you for your carelessness.

768
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,260
He's the most important person in the gang.

769
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,580
How can you guarantee his loyalty?

770
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,780
I don't need to worry.

771
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,500
I just want to follow up.

772
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,340
If he doesn't help me,

773
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,780
you can use the knife in your hand

774
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,900
to kill me.

775
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,540
Such a cold-faced Luo Cha

776
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,180
actually protects him in this way.

777
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,860
It's really surprising.

778
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,820
That's because all of you don't understand the Prince.

779
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,020
He only cares about Wuji.

780
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,980
But you never thought about

781
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,100
the deep love he has for the person he cares about.

782
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,260
You're willing to say so many good things for him.

783
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,660
He should also care about the person he cares about.

784
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,220
The person who can make the Prince care about

785
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,940
is the best.

786
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Your Highness.

787
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,500
I'm here to see you.

788
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,500

The moon and the moon are in love.

The flower falls and the star follows.

887
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Falling.
