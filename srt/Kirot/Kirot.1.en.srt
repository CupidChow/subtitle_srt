1
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,600
Close your eyes, Maita.
Close your eyes.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,688
When you open them,
you’ll be able to do anything.

3
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:28,630
You’ll be able to
dance until dawn.

4
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,333
You’ll be able to run

5
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,754
as fast as you can,

6
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,680
even though there's nowhere to go.

7
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:55,299
You’ll have your freedom, Maita.

8
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:59,397
You’re going to break free.

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,584
But for now...

10
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05,738
Close your eyes, Maita.

11
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:07,989
When you wake up,

12
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,851
you won’t be scared to live anymore.

13
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,478
Open your eyes now, Maita...

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,659
You won’t be scared
to die anymore.

15
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:15,425
No matter how many times
I look at myself in the mirror,

16
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,342
I still can’t believe

17
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:20,622
I have a new life.

18
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,746
A new chance to do things
I’ve never done before.

19
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,254
A new heart.

20
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,895
Maita...

21
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,925
Rico’s here.

22
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,094
Your heart donor’s husband.

23
00:03:57,982 --> 00:03:59,609
Can I hug you?

24
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:23,933
If it's okay to ask...

25
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:27,763
What happened to Angelica?

26
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:32,324
It was an accident.

27
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,570
But...

28
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,952
Can we not talk
about how she died?

29
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,711
Because right now...

30
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,665
she's very much alive.

31
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,692
She's alive in you.

32
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,831
Here. This is for you.

33
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:07,760
Some of these--

34
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,069
she just bought recently.

35
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,631
Others, had been tailored for her.

36
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,002
So you’d get to know her?

37
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,452
So the memories of her
stay alive in you.

38
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:26,045
Thank you.

39
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:47,629
Does it look good on me?

40
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:50,115
Hmm...

41
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,099
Don’t, babe. That’s not you.

42
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,056
Just because it’s sexy, it’s not me?

43
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:03,475
Yes, it doesn’t suit you.
The Maita I know is simple.

44
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:09,002
The one who doesn’t try to act flirty.

45
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:12,653
Just wanted to try it.

46
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,093
I wanted to know
if it suited me.

47
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,612
Maits...

48
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:20,632
Come here...

49
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:22,863
Please...

50
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:26,437
Please don’t— don’t even try, okay?

51
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:28,389
Because what?

52
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,105
Because I love you
just the way you are.

53
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,657
Her name was Angelica.

54
00:07:46,986 --> 00:07:49,739
My heart once belonged to her.

55
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,512
My heart’s previous owner.

56
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:56,217
And her name suited her well...

57
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,961
Because she’s an angel.

58
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:02,688
Not just because she saved my life...

59
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,673
But because she’s an angel
for her students before.

60
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:09,761
She was a teacher.

61
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:11,895
A noble teacher.

62
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,226
Wake up, Maita.

63
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,895
Your life is about to change.

64
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,457
Self pleasure.

65
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:05,810
Do you know how important this is?

66
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:09,180
The touch.

67
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:13,750
The touching...

68
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:20,250
Of every part of your body...

69
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:22,437
That you want...

70
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,681
to play with.

71
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,638
This is the first step...

72
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,630
to finding out...

73
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:37,959
how to feel joy.

74
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,367
Before giving your
body to someone else,

75
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:49,788
you need to know...

76
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,995
where...

77
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:56,871
and how to touch it.

78
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,199
Because no one else
will truly know your body...

79
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,346
except you.

80
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,131
How gentle...

81
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:34,782
and how wild.

82
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:39,599
It’s only you who knows.

83
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:56,362
What is this? A prank?

84
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,111
Babe, you should’ve thrown all that away.

85
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:03,730
Babe, please don’t.

86
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,869
Babe, listen...

87
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,211
You shouldn’t have looked for her
in the first place.

88
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:11,460
Alex, stop!

89
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,025
What the— Stop it!

90
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:18,360
I mean... didn’t you see that video?

91
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,471
It was filthy, right?

92
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:24,555
Alex, do you hear yourself?

93
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,896
She’s already gone.

94
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,238
I lived because she died.

95
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,430
Can we at least respect that?

96
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,626
What if she had a disease?

97
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,558
What if you got infected?

98
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,371
Please. Stop.

99
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,227
Babe, I’m sorry.

100
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:05,857
You woke up late, dear?

101
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:09,955
Weren’t you supposed to meet
with Pastor Orly and Alex?

102
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:13,754
They’ll wait.

103
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,641
Maita, is something wrong?

104
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,676
Why does it seem like
you don’t want to see Alex?

105
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:25,175
You need to start
planning your wedding.

106
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:28,587
The truth, Ma?

107
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,685
I don’t know but...

108
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:38,536
I don’t think I’m excited for my wedding.

109
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,392
Come on, honey...

110
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:45,113
After everything he
and his family did for us?

111
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,353
If not for him,

112
00:13:48,378 --> 00:13:52,595
we couldn’t have afforded your new heart.

113
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:54,681
Don’t you appreciate that?

114
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:18,680
Lord, our loving Father, we come
before You with grateful hearts,

115
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,600
thanking You for
the gift of this meal

116
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:26,521
and for the company of our beloved
Alex and his fiancée, Maita.

117
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:29,657
We thank You, O’ Lord,
for the good health of Maita,

118
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:32,420
for her new heart that sustains her,

119
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,582
and for the precious life...

120
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:36,766
Just close your eyes, Maita.

121
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,473
Just keep praying.

122
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,116
You can hear them, but
there’s nothing you can do.

123
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,815
In Jesus’ mighty name we pray,

124
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,884
- Amen.
- Amen.

125
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,389
So...

126
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:55,130
Maita, how’s your new heart?

127
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,724
Maita.

128
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,393
I’m still adjusting.

129
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,500
Uh... Everything’s okay?

130
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,802
Sometimes, in the middle of the night,

131
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:14,923
I wake up—

132
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,470
—feeling like I’m out of breath.

133
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,999
Like I hear things.

134
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:36,141
Maybe I’m just dreaming.

135
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,816
It must be stress.

136
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,674
But it feels real.

137
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:45,321
Just take a few deep breaths
every now and then,

138
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:47,778
to stabilize your heart rate.

139
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:51,551
Okay? If you want, I can schedule
your follow-up check-up.

140
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:52,606
Soon.

141
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,020
Maybe it’s just stress.

142
00:15:57,008 --> 00:15:58,468
But I’m okay.

143
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:02,967
Dad, thank you—

144
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:06,608
for everything you’ve done for Maita.

145
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:10,594
All the thanks belong to the Lord.

146
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:14,073
And by Grace, all this was given to us.

147
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:18,185
That means, Maita, the Lord still has
a purpose and a plan for you.

148
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:22,574
After the surgery, I suddenly want
to do so many things.

149
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,100
Really? Like what?

150
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:29,706
Hey.

151
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,536
Uh...

152
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,333
I don’t know where to start.

153
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:39,009
Maybe run a marathon.

154
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:43,498
Kickboxing class. Or skydiving.

155
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:46,259
Whoa, whoa, whoa—

156
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:49,368
Babe, one thing at a time.

157
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:53,299
Maybe you’re just overwhelmed.

158
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:58,465
We still have a wedding
to plan, remember?

159
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,863
Oh, right.

160
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:04,573
And that’s why we’re here.

161
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:07,849
So, what do you say?
I’ll officiate your wedding, Alex.

162
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:12,221
Of course, Dad.
You’re Pastor-slash-Doctor Orly!

163
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:18,134
The man who gave my future wife—

164
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:20,690
a future chance...

165
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:22,503
at life.

166
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:31,390
Weren’t you even planning
to give Maita a job?

167
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,057
Of course. Definitely.

168
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,071
But before that,
you two need to check out

169
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,515
some couple’s retreats
you can attend together.

170
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:41,265
It’s very important that
before you get married,

171
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:44,184
you both see and understand

172
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:47,036
God’s purpose in your lives.

173
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:49,586
He should be the center
of your relationship.

174
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:53,000
And another thing— you must
remain chaste for each other.

175
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,595
Right, Maita?

176
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,003
Right, Alex?

177
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:03,373
Ah— Thanks, Dad.

178
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:05,777
So far,

179
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:08,694
Maita and I have been able
to manage our schedule.

180
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:14,188
Maybe we’ll just prioritize the—

181
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:16,140
Uh—

182
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:19,664
We’ll just fix the—

183
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:22,895
Let’s prioritize the—

184
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,772
Alex?

185
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:31,228
I think this is okay enough.

186
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:34,699
Right, Maita?

187
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:51,643
Miss, your tattoo...

188
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,897
- It’s beautiful.
- Thank you.

189
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:00,460
- Where’d you get it done?
- Just nearby.

190
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:03,490
Thank you.

191
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,227
Maita, are you okay?

192
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:14,593
Huh?

193
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,879
You really had to do that in the café?

194
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,760
Right in front of Dad?

195
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:21,944
Sorry.

196
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:25,588
I thought that was your hand.

197
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:28,814
Really?

198
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:32,298
With everything we have to
think about for the wedding,

199
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,809
your concern is the server’s tattoo?

200
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,685
I was fine with everything your dad said.

201
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,746
I just thought the girl’s tattoo
looked nice, so I asked her about it.

202
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:45,021
So you're getting a tattoo now?

203
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,337
Yes. I want one.

204
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,255
Maita, let’s pray.

205
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:58,174
Why?

206
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,350
Either your mind’s still foggy

207
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,729
after the surgery,

208
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:06,266
or that woman possessed you last night.

209
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:08,914
Let’s pray.

210
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,189
Lord Father God,

211
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:15,192
we come before You

212
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:18,374
to ask for forgiveness

213
00:20:20,098 --> 00:20:21,891
for all our sins.

214
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:25,395
Guide us, Father God,

215
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:29,020
on our journey here on Earth.

216
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,530
In my experience,

217
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:34,729
- Lord, thank you...
- the most religious people

218
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:37,776
- In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
- are the horniest ones.

219
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,649
They hide their desires so well.

220
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:45,009
So when no one’s watching,

221
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:47,312
they’re ravenous.

222
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:53,841
Giving their all.

223
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,275
Wild...

224
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:00,426
I know that

225
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,212
because...

226
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,866
My wildest experience
is with an ex-seminarian.

227
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,679
Brother Rico,

228
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:15,700
the man who pounds
hard during sex.

229
00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:23,240
When he left the seminary...

230
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,558
for discernment,

231
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,931
that’s when he discovered—

232
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:33,392
that he won’t stay in the church...

233
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,984
but with me.

234
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:44,000
With his passion
and with his art,

235
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,933
my body became his temple.

236
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:56,452
- You son of a bitch—
- Go!

237
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,524
- Keep going!
- Son of a bitch!

238
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:04,765
- Go on—
- You bastard!

239
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:07,682
You asshole!

240
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:10,478
- One, two!
- Son of a bitch!

241
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:11,712
Let it all out!

242
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:22,364
Who hurt you?

243
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:24,216
That’s enough.

244
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,844
I had just left the seminary—

245
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:32,869
It was my discernment period,

246
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:39,315
to figure out whether I’d choose
a life in the Church,

247
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,116
or this kind of life.

248
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:45,660
This is her gym.

249
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:48,705
This is where I met her.

250
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:53,319
This is where I chose the life I wanted.

251
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:55,519
With her.

252
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,751
I saw her video.

253
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,478
So you found it.

254
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,621
I liked it.

255
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:12,714
My family raised me
to always be careful.

256
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,960
“Maita, don’t exhaust yourself,

257
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:18,432
your heart can’t take it.”

258
00:26:20,276 --> 00:26:21,861
“Maita, don’t stay up late,

259
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:24,370
your heart can’t take it.”

260
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:26,906
“Don’t go far.”

261
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:31,303
“Don’t make friends with just anyone.”

262
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:35,133
“No flirting.”

263
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:38,204
“No fighting.”

264
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,394
“Because your heart can’t
handle all of that, Maita.”

265
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,442
So eventually,

266
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,529
they used my condition as a reason

267
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,241
to make all my life decisions.

268
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,371
From what I wore,

269
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,418
they even decided who I should love.

270
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,429
They decided everything,

271
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:13,494
all in the name of protecting my heart.

272
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:20,560
Sorry...

273
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,695
Am I over sharing?

274
00:27:23,703 --> 00:27:24,787
Uh—

275
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,189
No. It’s okay. I’m listening.

276
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:31,669
That’s why she’s lucky.

277
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:34,163
She can say everything,

278
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,365
do everything.

279
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,570
No shame.

280
00:27:41,163 --> 00:27:42,665
No fear.

281
00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:45,259
Maita,

282
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,582
you have her heart now.

283
00:27:48,804 --> 00:27:50,223
You can do all that too.

284
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,015
If you want,

285
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:55,092
I’ll help you.

286
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:19,708
You can do it.

287
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,163
Angelica did it.

288
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,471
So can you.

289
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:40,969
Don’t close your eyes.

290
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,014
Don’t close your eyes.

291
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,102
Don’t shut your eyes...

292
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:54,398
Don’t close your eyes.

293
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:57,062
Don’t close your eyes.

294
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,696
Don’t shut your eyes...

295
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:01,424
Don’t...

296
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,992
Whoa, your heartbeat’s fast.

297
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,424
This isn’t your first time.

298
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:10,776
I’m about to do something
for the first time.

299
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,221
There you go again.

300
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,683
What kind of new adventure
are you planning this time?

301
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:27,345
With all the tattoos I have,

302
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,833
do you think I could
still be an organ donor?

303
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:34,796
Hey! What are you thinking?

304
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:38,670
Nothing, really...

305
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:42,512
What do you think?

306
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,245
How much would my heart sell?

307
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:52,903
If ever I die,

308
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:54,831
or get killed?

309
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:57,785
Just in case, I mean.

310
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:01,851
Do you want me

311
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:04,680
to appraise it?

312
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:06,933
Sure.

313
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,404
It’s priceless...

314
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,983
Priceless?

315
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,660
Very.

316
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,376
Sorry. I couldn’t help it.

317
00:32:55,054 --> 00:32:56,347
Do you miss her?

318
00:32:57,836 --> 00:32:59,087
Every single day.

319
00:33:00,816 --> 00:33:03,235
But it’s like she’s still here, right?

320
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:06,689
Here.

321
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,327
I don’t even know

322
00:33:18,989 --> 00:33:20,323
what happened.

323
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:22,797
I don’t know

324
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:25,472
why she decided to do that.

325
00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:28,629
If she wasn’t happy with me,

326
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,368
I wish she had just said so.

327
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:34,016
Not like...

328
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:36,574
just taking her own life like that.

329
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:46,807
You moved on so fast, huh?

330
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:49,913
Anj just died.

331
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,066
Or have you already forgotten?

332
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:08,586
Miss!

333
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,915
Miss, wait! Please!

334
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:16,697
Miss, please delete the photos.

335
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,431
Miss.

336
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:22,121
Miss, please delete those pictures.

337
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:24,652
My boyfriend might get the wrong idea.

338
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,276
Or my family.

339
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,397
It meant nothing.

340
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:32,323
Flirting’s like that, right?
It doesn’t mean anything.

341
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:35,736
So you didn’t even consider
the person you were disrespecting?

342
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:37,756
Sorry.

343
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:41,759
His wife was my heart donor.

344
00:34:43,173 --> 00:34:44,717
I just asked about her.

345
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:50,103
I just wanted to know the person
who helped save my life.

346
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:54,072
I’m sorry—

347
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:55,930
I’m sorry.

348
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,513
What’s your name?

349
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,555
Maita.

350
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,469
I’m Camille.

351
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,550
Angelica’s girlfriend.

352
00:35:39,572 --> 00:35:40,592
You know,

353
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:48,015
I’m excited to see that painting
replaced with your wedding photos,

354
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:50,679
or family picture.

355
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:53,162
Lex,

356
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:56,595
tell your dad thank you again, okay?

357
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:01,795
Ma, we’ve already thanked him
so many times.

358
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:05,758
Oh, honey, that’s never enough.

359
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:08,599
You know, I always thank God

360
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,335
that fate brought you two together.

361
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:13,988
Just imagine—

362
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:17,410
his dad’s a surgeon,

363
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,936
and also a pastor.

364
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:24,456
Healing you both
physically and spiritually.

365
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:27,720
Isn’t that such a blessing?

366
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:31,675
And he’ll be the one to
officiate your marriage.

367
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,898
I’m just so happy!

368
00:36:34,923 --> 00:36:39,803
Your wedding should
be grand, right, Maita?

369
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:42,397
Well, Ma...

370
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:44,322
Alex...

371
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,551
I’m fine with a small wedding, really.

372
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:54,763
To celebrate with just our family.

373
00:36:56,058 --> 00:36:58,560
But I have one request,

374
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:03,765
the family of my heart donor,

375
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:06,749
is it okay if I invited them?

376
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,763
Honey,

377
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:13,789
you don’t have to always consider
your heart donor.

378
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,839
Right, Alex?

379
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,736
That’s what I keep
telling her, Ma’am.

380
00:37:20,344 --> 00:37:23,543
Especially if our morals don’t align.

381
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:27,888
Yeah. Alex told me
about the website—

382
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:33,623
About Angelica’s vlog.

383
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:40,205
Sweetheart, it’s enough that
we gave thanks and prayed for her.

384
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:45,518
Thinking about her more
will only cloud your mind...

385
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:01,783
You’re beautiful.

386
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:05,994
No matter what they say,
you’re not dirty.

387
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:07,579
You’re beautiful.

388
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:34,739
A woman has needs

389
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,102
that only another woman can fulfill.

390
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:57,501
A woman’s touch is different.

391
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:18,481
A woman’s softness is different.

392
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:39,502
A woman’s taste is different.

393
00:40:04,598 --> 00:40:07,768
It feels different

394
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,565
when her hands

395
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:12,822
slowly caressing

396
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,895
my breasts...

397
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:22,650
Down to our vaginas.

398
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,456
Hello!

399
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,796
Hello!
I’ll erase the photos. I’m sorry.

400
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,514
“Two ladies, one heart.”

401
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,690
Can we meet?

402
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:27,417
Anj and I were classmates
before she got with Rico.

403
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,410
Her mural in her gym—

404
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:32,439
I painted that.

405
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,178
This used to be our home

406
00:42:37,174 --> 00:42:39,218
before she decided to move out.

407
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,393
She still came back here,

408
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:47,423
she never really totally left.

409
00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:50,230
She always came back to me.

410
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:56,240
Whenever she was running away
from something—

411
00:42:57,037 --> 00:42:59,998
You’re crazy. What’s the problem?

412
00:43:02,097 --> 00:43:04,165
I don’t want to think about it right now.

413
00:43:05,503 --> 00:43:06,921
Just make me happy.

414
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:09,559
This might be the last time...

415
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:13,046
Fine. Let’s go.

416
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:27,819
This was her hideout

417
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:31,269
when she needed to breathe.

418
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:35,353
To pour out her pain.

419
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,863
Or if she wants to

420
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,494
have sex.

421
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,365
Anj...

422
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:51,609
I’m just your
pastime again, huh?

423
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:53,081
That’s not true.

424
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,891
Let’s make the most of this,

425
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,828
before I face the consequences
of what might happen.

426
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:10,999
The night before she died,

427
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:13,801
she was here.

428
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,210
She came to see me.

429
00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:29,731
Damn it, Anj.

430
00:44:30,488 --> 00:44:33,450
Tell me, what did you do?

431
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:38,003
I’m just about to do it...

432
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,122
What is it?

433
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,892
I promised...

434
00:44:48,082 --> 00:44:49,917
that I wouldn't tell anyone.

435
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,524
But I’m going to help--

436
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:55,798
I’m going to help her.

437
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,408
I became a suspect because
she was last seen here.

438
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:08,223
But she came from Rico’s place.

439
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,750
She had a lot on her mind—

440
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,215
but she wouldn't say
what it was.

441
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:19,998
She just asked me

442
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,970
to make her happy

443
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:26,354
in case it was her last night.

444
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:06,698
Then,

445
00:47:09,798 --> 00:47:13,802
she asked to be left alone.
She said she wanted some time to herself.

446
00:47:18,348 --> 00:47:21,101
That ended up being
the last time I saw her.

447
00:47:23,244 --> 00:47:25,496
What happened after I fell asleep...

448
00:47:28,904 --> 00:47:30,238
I don’t know anymore.

449
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,743
But I’m sure—

450
00:47:40,312 --> 00:47:42,814
I’m sure someone pushed her.

451
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,618
Because no matter
how heavy Angelica’s burdens were,

452
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,622
she couldn’t have done that to herself.

453
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:47,124
Where have you been?

454
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:52,482
We have a counseling session today.

455
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,184
Sorry.

456
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,450
When did you get that?

457
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:08,735
Why? You don’t want it?

458
00:49:10,116 --> 00:49:11,909
Maita, what’s going on with you?

459
00:49:12,622 --> 00:49:14,415
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror?

460
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:17,472
You look filthy.

461
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:20,267
Didn’t I already tell you,

462
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:23,109
I don’t want to see you like that.

463
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:26,445
You don’t want to?

464
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,752
So just because you don’t want to,
I shouldn’t want it either, Alex?

465
00:49:32,266 --> 00:49:35,227
What if I want it?
This is my body, right?

466
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:36,442
Maita,

467
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:39,468
what are you trying to prove?

468
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,510
You’re the new owner
of that heart,

469
00:49:42,824 --> 00:49:44,868
so don’t let it own you.

470
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:48,079
Alex, it’s not like that.

471
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:49,568
I want this.

472
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:54,727
Can you just accept that?

473
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,602
What the!

474
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,356
What’s happening to you?

475
00:50:28,554 --> 00:50:29,930
We’re getting married soon.

476
00:50:30,872 --> 00:50:33,041
Can’t you wait a little longer?

477
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,369
I don’t want to get married.

478
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:46,799
I'm done with you!

479
00:51:15,783 --> 00:51:16,850
That's enough...

480
00:51:24,202 --> 00:51:25,243
Calm down...

481
00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:02,655
If only I had known

482
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:05,648
what was bothering her...

483
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,043
maybe I could’ve helped.

484
00:58:31,365 --> 00:58:34,176
After she asked me
to do that tattoo,

485
00:58:36,623 --> 00:58:37,665
she just seemed...

486
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:40,394
angry all the time.

487
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,818
She said she wanted
to tell me something about it

488
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:48,933
but she just couldn’t.

489
00:58:51,651 --> 00:58:54,862
She said not to me yet—

490
00:58:55,646 --> 00:58:56,856
not to anyone.

491
00:58:59,074 --> 00:59:01,868
She just said... she made a promise.

492
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:06,292
I wish...

493
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:09,517
I had kept my eye on her.

494
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,091
I wish...

495
00:59:14,803 --> 00:59:16,263
I had protected her.

496
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,498
Today, we’ll talk about

497
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:12,673
‘How others see you.’

498
01:01:14,935 --> 01:01:16,103
You’re a woman.

499
01:01:17,995 --> 01:01:20,080
Whatever you want to do—

500
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:22,559
or show—

501
01:01:23,756 --> 01:01:25,466
that’s your right.

502
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:38,294
And no one has the right

503
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,766
to do anything to you
without your consent.

504
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,956
Are we done?

505
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,959
I’m getting sore.

506
01:01:53,703 --> 01:01:55,997
We’re done. There...

507
01:01:58,029 --> 01:01:59,822
Let me see.

508
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:16,089
That’s beautiful.

509
01:02:16,674 --> 01:02:17,842
Of course.

510
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:22,780
It’s beautiful—

511
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,074
It’s so me.

512
01:03:16,205 --> 01:03:17,206
Camille.

513
01:03:28,612 --> 01:03:29,821
Do you know her?

514
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:31,866
Angel—

515
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:34,962
Angelica used to talk about her
all the time.

516
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,522
She loved that girl so much.

517
01:03:37,986 --> 01:03:39,488
To the point that...

518
01:03:40,412 --> 01:03:42,943
she even got that kid’s
cutesy signature tattooed.

519
01:03:43,644 --> 01:03:45,922
But after that,

520
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:48,990
Angelica got really paranoid.

521
01:03:49,474 --> 01:03:52,978
It’s like she regretted something—
I just don’t know what.

522
01:03:54,461 --> 01:03:55,629
Then eventually...

523
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,543
she just died...

524
01:04:04,984 --> 01:04:06,527
And the guy in the picture?

525
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,976
Do you know him too?

526
01:04:10,456 --> 01:04:12,208
He’s the owner of their art studio.

527
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:14,111
He’s...

528
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,186
Mr. Peter Bueno.

529
01:04:23,635 --> 01:04:26,346
Almighty Father, all-powerful God,

530
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:28,460
Almighty God,

531
01:04:29,271 --> 01:04:32,664
we come to you
tonight as a family

532
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:36,523
and we pray for your child, Maita.

533
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,833
Whose mind is troubled
by so many

534
01:04:39,858 --> 01:04:43,437
dark thoughts and afflictions.

535
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:47,451
Almighty God, clear her mind.

536
01:04:47,498 --> 01:04:51,804
Take away the pain
she’s feeling.

537
01:04:52,038 --> 01:04:56,042
Her spirit— renew her spirit...

538
01:04:57,778 --> 01:04:59,697
You’re applying in our studio.

539
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:03,201
Are you familiar
with our artists here?

540
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:06,239
I have some idea.

541
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,641
Like this one,

542
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,001
isn’t this by Angelica Carpio?

543
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,417
Actually, by her student.

544
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:23,730
Her name’s also Angel.

545
01:05:24,776 --> 01:05:27,320
Can’t blame you—

546
01:05:27,597 --> 01:05:30,982
they have the same name,
the same style.

547
01:05:32,463 --> 01:05:35,424
Angelica had a huge influence
on that girl—

548
01:05:36,315 --> 01:05:40,861
She even helped her
join a national contest in Bacolod.

549
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:44,900
We all chipped in
just to fly Angel there.

550
01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:48,050
It’s just sad because after that...

551
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:50,471
they both disappeared.

552
01:05:52,876 --> 01:05:54,211
What happened?

553
01:06:01,148 --> 01:06:02,441
Depression?

554
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:07,331
They really vanished
around the same time—

555
01:06:09,142 --> 01:06:13,063
Just like the other artists, they both
struggled with their demons.

556
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:18,516
One day, Angel
just stopped showing up—

557
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:21,175
like she lost her passion.

558
01:06:23,078 --> 01:06:25,080
She just never came back.

559
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,881
Then after that,

560
01:06:28,028 --> 01:06:29,237
Angelica.

561
01:06:31,972 --> 01:06:33,974
Excuse me.

562
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,610
Hello?

563
01:06:40,474 --> 01:06:41,474
Yes.

564
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:44,754
We hold exhibits every second
week of the month.

565
01:06:46,605 --> 01:06:49,867
This month we’re featuring artists
from our weekend workshops.

566
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:51,101
May I know your name, please?

567
01:06:53,023 --> 01:06:54,023
Ressa...

568
01:06:54,997 --> 01:06:56,178
Okay, sure.

569
01:06:56,203 --> 01:06:58,414
We can have your works appraised.

570
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,368
And we can take it from there.

571
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:10,359
I’m available tomorrow afternoon
or as early as 7 AM.

572
01:07:25,682 --> 01:07:26,766
Angel?

573
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,818
What is this for again?

574
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:40,007
I’m a friend of Angelica’s.

575
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:42,564
It’s a tribute video for her birthday.

576
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:46,088
Hey, Angel,

577
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,983
I heard you were her favorite student?

578
01:08:00,055 --> 01:08:01,390
You made this, right?

579
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:08,270
I still have something to do—

580
01:08:08,341 --> 01:08:09,425
Angel, wait.

581
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:11,656
Please?

582
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:13,776
For Ms. Angelica.

583
01:08:35,662 --> 01:08:36,997
Ms. Angelica,

584
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,777
I miss you so, so much.

585
01:08:51,716 --> 01:08:54,271
I’m sorry I got mad at you

586
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,133
when you didn’t come
with me to Bacolod.

587
01:09:02,377 --> 01:09:04,212
I couldn’t handle it, Ms. Angelica!

588
01:09:07,712 --> 01:09:08,921
Are you okay?

589
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:11,609
Is this about
your contest in Bacolod?

590
01:09:13,056 --> 01:09:15,941
I know everything
can be so overwhelming,

591
01:09:16,013 --> 01:09:18,391
but there’ll be other
contests that we can join.

592
01:09:19,729 --> 01:09:22,064
Why didn’t you come
with me to Bacolod?

593
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:27,731
Didn’t I tell you I had an event then?

594
01:09:29,718 --> 01:09:32,929
Besides, I knew
you could do it, even on your own.

595
01:09:36,288 --> 01:09:38,081
You didn’t come to Bacolod—

596
01:09:38,994 --> 01:09:42,400
You didn’t come with me.
You don’t know what happened!

597
01:09:46,698 --> 01:09:48,742
Someone entered my room...

598
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,932
Sir Peter raped me!

599
01:10:00,632 --> 01:10:01,675
Angel...

600
01:10:03,676 --> 01:10:05,140
It’s my fault—

601
01:10:11,576 --> 01:10:13,161
It’s my fault...

602
01:10:14,368 --> 01:10:17,130
I was raped, Ma’am Angelica—
I was raped—

603
01:10:17,155 --> 01:10:20,273
He raped me! He raped me!

604
01:10:20,298 --> 01:10:21,887
Angel—

605
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:24,193
Angel—

606
01:10:25,115 --> 01:10:26,850
I’m really sorry...

607
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:29,189
I’m really sorry...

608
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:30,940
I’m really sorry.

609
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,360
Because of my problem,

610
01:10:35,408 --> 01:10:36,868
she got caught up in it too.

611
01:10:37,994 --> 01:10:40,413
Ma’am Angelica took her own life.

612
01:10:56,344 --> 01:10:58,594
It’s okay—this isn’t your fault.

613
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,391
Open your eyes, Maita.

614
01:11:11,923 --> 01:11:13,466
Open your eyes.

615
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,942
Open your eyes, Maita! Scream!

616
01:11:32,432 --> 01:11:34,226
I’m just like Angel.

617
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,474
We both had our eyes
shut when it happened.

618
01:11:43,476 --> 01:11:45,187
We were both helpless.

619
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,172
He thought I was asleep
from the anesthesia.

620
01:11:55,488 --> 01:11:57,282
I thought I was dreaming,

621
01:11:59,104 --> 01:12:00,772
because I could hear everything.

622
01:12:01,611 --> 01:12:02,611
Close your eyes.

623
01:12:03,045 --> 01:12:04,236
Just close your eyes.

624
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:06,693
Close your eyes, Maita.

625
01:12:07,815 --> 01:12:08,857
Close your eyes.

626
01:12:08,882 --> 01:12:10,342
But I couldn’t do anything.

627
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:12,757
Close your eyes.

628
01:12:13,964 --> 01:12:15,634
I couldn’t feel anything.

629
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:17,880
The only thing I knew—

630
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:24,345
I just knew they were doing it already.

631
01:12:26,248 --> 01:12:28,042
Those sons of bitches!

632
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:32,618
I wanted to pray,

633
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,232
but the man doing that to me

634
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,771
was the same one
who taught us how to pray.

635
01:12:41,146 --> 01:12:43,146
I'm terrified that people
might find me disgusting.

636
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:48,063
So I never told anyone.

637
01:12:56,464 --> 01:12:58,466
And I’m still afraid until now.

638
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:04,569
Maybe that’s why you have Angelica’s heart.

639
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:09,130
So you can fight,

640
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,515
not just for Angel,

641
01:13:16,263 --> 01:13:17,889
but for yourself too.

642
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:46,922
I’m Maita.

643
01:13:48,436 --> 01:13:49,980
You don’t know me,

644
01:13:50,812 --> 01:13:53,106
but I know you know Angelica.

645
01:13:54,202 --> 01:13:56,454
The one who owned my heart.

646
01:13:58,842 --> 01:14:00,385
Angelica’s gone now...

647
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,898
And there’s only one person
to blame.

648
01:14:06,424 --> 01:14:07,884
Peter Bueno.

649
01:14:11,742 --> 01:14:15,037
The man who raped his student,

650
01:14:16,963 --> 01:14:19,129
and maybe even killed her.

651
01:14:31,455 --> 01:14:33,374
Are you really sure about this?

652
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:44,101
I have something to show you.

653
01:14:51,746 --> 01:14:52,872
It’s beautiful!

654
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,049
That’s Angelica’s heart in your chest—

655
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:07,321
That courage and strength,

656
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:10,964
that’s all yours, Maita.

657
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:14,384
All of it. Take care of it.

658
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,697
I knew it, it’s you!

659
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,824
How dare you stain my name!

660
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,639
I saw you with Angel—

661
01:19:55,887 --> 01:19:57,972
What the hell were you
recording, you demon?

662
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,741
You’re the real demon, not me!

663
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,383
- Demon?
- Rapist!

664
01:20:05,532 --> 01:20:06,677
Murderer!

665
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:10,430
Camille! Let’s go—

666
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:11,862
You bitch!

667
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:15,936
What were you recording, huh?

668
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,187
Where’s your recording?

669
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,398
You son of a bitch—let me go!

670
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,067
Anj?

671
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,027
Anj—

672
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:30,116
I begged you, didn’t I?

673
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,805
Whatever you heard
from Angel, just forget it.

674
01:20:34,843 --> 01:20:38,855
I have a family—
don’t you get that?

675
01:20:38,969 --> 01:20:42,264
You should’ve thought of that
before you did that sick thing to Angel!

676
01:20:42,605 --> 01:20:43,814
I’m sorry—

677
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,530
You disgusting piece of trash!

678
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:47,937
Trash? Weren’t you the trashy one?

679
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,470
- Help!
- Don’t bother asking for help—

680
01:20:52,398 --> 01:20:53,733
I’m turning myself in...

681
01:20:54,086 --> 01:20:55,504
This is all because of you.

682
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,035
You think I picked you as an artist

683
01:20:58,067 --> 01:20:59,547
- because of your talent?
- Let me go!

684
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:00,940
- Huh?
- Stop!

685
01:21:00,995 --> 01:21:02,997
I wanted you, Anj—

686
01:21:03,263 --> 01:21:05,138
I’ve wanted you for so long!

687
01:21:05,993 --> 01:21:07,304
Let me go—

688
01:21:07,502 --> 01:21:09,837
I want you so bad, Anj.

689
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:13,829
Everything you post online—
I wanted us to do all of that.

690
01:21:14,573 --> 01:21:18,287
You know, I thought something
would happen between us in Bacolod.

691
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:21,044
- But you didn’t go—
- You monster!

692
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:23,898
- So I used Angel instead—
- You monster!

693
01:21:23,923 --> 01:21:26,845
- You’re a monster!
- I used Angel instead.

694
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:32,360
I’m turning myself in, Anj...

695
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:34,723
Sor—

696
01:21:35,501 --> 01:21:36,850
Sorry...

697
01:21:37,972 --> 01:21:39,808
Sorry isn’t enough

698
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,780
for everything you did to Angel!

699
01:21:42,873 --> 01:21:45,000
- No! No!
- Sorry will never be enough!

700
01:22:04,637 --> 01:22:06,681
To the loudest heartbeat,

701
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:09,540
the noise becomes quiet.

702
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:15,764
To your heart that belongs to me now...

703
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,357
Something will end...

704
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:45,858
Come in, come in.

705
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:49,678
You brought so much food!
Looks delicious!

706
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:52,299
Did you make all of this?

707
01:22:52,442 --> 01:22:55,403
Oh! Come in, come in.

708
01:22:56,108 --> 01:22:58,402
Maita’s here—

709
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,391
Wow.

710
01:23:06,032 --> 01:23:07,992
Sweetheart, what is that?

711
01:23:08,446 --> 01:23:10,949
That’s embarrassing! Remove that!

712
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,054
- Maita, what is that?
- My God!

713
01:23:16,268 --> 01:23:17,353
Why?

714
01:23:19,171 --> 01:23:20,172
That’s me.

715
01:23:24,303 --> 01:23:26,722
That’s my body.

716
01:23:28,492 --> 01:23:31,787
My dirty body that
you liked so much,

717
01:23:32,690 --> 01:23:33,720
right, uncle?

718
01:23:36,698 --> 01:23:38,116
You thought I was asleep?

719
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:41,466
But I saw everything—

720
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:44,554
I couldn’t move,

721
01:23:46,046 --> 01:23:48,382
but I felt your weight.

722
01:23:49,105 --> 01:23:51,691
When you raped me
in the recovery room,

723
01:23:54,722 --> 01:23:55,722
you said,

724
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:58,950
“Close your eyes, Maita.
Close your eyes.”

725
01:24:01,527 --> 01:24:05,323
“Maita, when you wake up,
you’ll be able to do anything.”

726
01:24:07,312 --> 01:24:08,897
I heard every word.

727
01:24:13,836 --> 01:24:15,774
“Maita, wake up. Maita—”

728
01:24:18,542 --> 01:24:19,752
You said,

729
01:24:21,596 --> 01:24:25,329
“When you wake up,
you’ll marry my son.”

730
01:24:25,498 --> 01:24:28,459
- Maita, what are you talking about?
- What, Alex?

731
01:24:30,402 --> 01:24:32,863
You’re so disgusted
by people like Angelica?

732
01:24:34,573 --> 01:24:35,604
Well, what about me?

733
01:24:37,345 --> 01:24:39,514
Your dad violated me!

734
01:24:42,481 --> 01:24:47,028
Now that you know—
will you still marry me?

735
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:53,171
My God—

736
01:25:04,692 --> 01:25:06,860
God has to be the center of your life—

737
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,335
Right, Maita?

738
01:25:42,358 --> 01:25:44,860
Close your eyes, Maita.
Close your eyes.

739
01:25:46,467 --> 01:25:50,554
When you open them,
you’ll be able to do anything.

740
01:25:51,998 --> 01:25:56,377
You’ll finally dance
to your own music.

741
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:12,822
You’ll finally be able
to fight any battle.

742
01:26:18,668 --> 01:26:20,544
You’ll finally be free.

743
01:26:44,296 --> 01:26:46,774
Your life is in your hands now, Maita.

744
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:51,461
It’s time to open your eyes.
