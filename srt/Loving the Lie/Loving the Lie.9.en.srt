=Episode 9=

3
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,020
It's a full moon tonight.

4
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,219
Your mom loved the moon most.

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,490
When she was around,

6
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,859
she loved dragging me outside
to moon-gaze.

7
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,010
Dad.

8
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,610
Why did you ask Xu Ru
to go to the cemetery today?

9
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,610
Don't you know what she's up to?

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,200
Or you're aware of that,
and you just let her get her way?

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,850
I don't care what she's thinking.

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,210
I just need her to finish the painting.

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,450
What painting is that?

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,419
I found an artist like you asked.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,850
But you won't even tell me
what the painting's about.

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,130
What have you been doing
all these years?

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,370
You don't need to know.

18
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,650
It has nothing to do with your work.

19
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,490
Sometimes I really feel like
I know neither you

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,890
nor this family.

21
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,970
Guan Xin.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,930
You're capable and sensible.

23
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,530
But you're a woman.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,210
I don't want you to overwork yourself.

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,890
Besides, you're getting married soon.

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,770
Some things aren't for you
to worry about.

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,370
Dad.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,530
Did you ever love Mom?

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,499
No one in this world
loved her more than I did.

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,730
What about her?

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,490
I don't think she was happy with you.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,210
Mom...

33
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,930
Mom...

34
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,610
Dad...

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,019
How dare you!

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,339
If I hadn't caught you in time,

37
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,779
you would've burned everything!

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,010
Do you admit your mistake?

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,530
Do you?

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,290
I wasn't wrong.

41
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,339
Fine.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,419
You weren't wrong.

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,490
Don't expect to ever see your mom again!

44
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,730
Mom.

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,170
Mom!

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,290
Where are you?

47
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,810
Mom.

48
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,330
Let's go home, okay? Mom.

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,050
Mom!

50
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,290
Mom!

51
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,650
This was my mom's favorite fan.

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,570
Then why is it so badly burned?

53
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,250
Guan Shanhai did it.

54
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,299
Everyone thinks he's devoted.

55
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,210
But you could act devoted.

56
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,050
Act long enough
and you start to believe it yourself.

57
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,890
Does this fan matter a lot to you?

58
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,699
It was with my mom for years.

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,939
She really cherished it.

60
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,570
I didn't think it'd end up like this.

61
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,290
Xin Yi.

62
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,770
Can you help me fix it?

63
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,379
Who painted this on the fan?

64
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,459
What is it?

65
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,979
My mom had it before she got married.

66
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,290
Is there a problem?

67
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,290
It's by Cheng Raoshanren.

68
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,490
That little red mark is Beauty Rouge.

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,490
(This is the only clue Dad left
about Beauty Rouge.)

70
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,930
(If I restore this fan,)

71
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,530
(perhaps I can uncover the secret formula
for Beauty Rouge.)

72
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,530
Stop shaking.

73
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,779
Wait,

74
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,130
what are you gluing there?

75
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,370
You wouldn't get it even if I told you.
It's called fan surface restoration.

76
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,139
Dummy.

77
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,530
Are you really my brother?

78
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,210
I fix cars.

79
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,419
It's normal
that I don't know how to fix a fan,

80
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,170
Miss President of Guanhai.

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,619
Someone can't help at all,

82
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,559
- but he insists on hanging around.
- Don't you have better things to do?

83
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,199
Don't you have to deal with that old man?
What are you even doing here?

84
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,210
I'm here to supervise it.

85
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,739
If you can't help,

86
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,970
go make some food.

87
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,210
Time for lunch.

88
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,290
Don't worry,

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,970
I won't let you starve.

90
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,610
Xin Yi.

91
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,330
Thank you for this.

92
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,579
You're too kind, Miss Guan.

93
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,819
You trusted me

94
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,419
with something this important
to restore.

95
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,850
It's my honor.

96
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,299
Xin Yi.

97
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,659
You're talented.

98
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,339
Just your taste in men

99
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,570
could be improved.

100
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,939
Jealous much?

101
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,099
Xin Yi's into me now.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,139
What can I do?

103
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,290
Just be jealous.

104
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,179
Looks like if I made a move,

105
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,890
I might actually have a shot.

106
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,779
What now?

107
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,499
You're already ditching Xu Ru?

108
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,810
How heartless.

109
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,810
She was never on my side.

110
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,019
If you'd said that before,
I wouldn't believe it.

111
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,410
But now I do.

112
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,410
I really don't think
you'd be dumb enough to pick a stepmom.

113
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,459
That fan's been around
for at least twenty years.

114
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,379
But it's well preserved.

115
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,730
I assume Mrs. Ming Yun
had it maintained regularly.

116
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,370
The painting is by Cheng Raoshanren.

117
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,539
It makes sense that my mom treasured

118
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,690
his work.

119
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,979
But he wasn't famous yet

120
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,410
when he painted this fan.

121
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,610
I wonder
where Mrs. Ming Yun got it from.

122
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,810
She never said anything
about its origin.

123
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,560
But she came from a family of artists,

124
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,699
and she loved
collecting calligraphy and paintings.

125
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,890
Maybe she just came across it.

126
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,979
She took a liking to it

127
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,330
and bought it.

128
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,219
I heard Mrs. Ming Yun

129
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,170
was an exceptional
collector and appraiser.

130
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,730
She especially loved Ma Qingshan's work.

131
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,339
Chairman Guan got into Chinese painting

132
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,370
just to make her happy.

133
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,339
So it's all because
she liked Chinese painting?

134
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,659
And he liked Ma Qingshan

135
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,579
because she liked him?

136
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,010
What a joke.

137
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,659
Guan Shanhai is a mere dropout
who never even finished middle school.

138
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,339
He's tried to play the art lover

139
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,939
and a loving husband

140
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,690
in front of everyone.

141
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,339
He just wants them to know

142
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,610
that he married my mom for her money.

143
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,130
Money?

144
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,370
From his taste and demeanor,

145
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,779
I thought he came from a refined family,

146
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,339
making he and Mrs. Ming Yun
a good match.

147
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,419
He's nothing but a social climber.

148
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,139
Without my mom

149
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,299
the Ming family,

150
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,019
he'd never have built Guanhai.

151
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,659
Guan Huai.

152
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,179
Eat.

153
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,739
What did I say wrong?

154
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,650
Don't you know what kind of man he is?
Want me to jog your memory?

155
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,610
You knew what happened back then.

156
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,099
What are you talking about?

157
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,939
You're just scared

158
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,739
and avoidant.

159
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,099
Why are you still pretending
to be ignorant

160
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,219
and defending him?

161
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,299
I just don't get it,

162
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,290
Xin!

163
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,810
Because I'm his daughter.

164
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,739
Has he ever treated us like his kids?

165
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,659
Let me tell you.

166
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,099
You're just his tool.
He uses you when he needs to.

167
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,899
And when he doesn't,

168
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,330
he marries you off.

169
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,010
You're wrong.

170
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,979
You're my sister.

171
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,930
So heed my advice. Cut ties with the Qins
while you still can.

172
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,610
What's the next step?

173
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,979
Based on the original work,
I'll repaint the design on the fan

174
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,010
until it looks just like before.

175
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,859
If you want to keep it as a collectible,

176
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,570
I'd recommend mounting the entire fan,

177
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,770
so it doesn't get damaged again.

178
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,130
Sure.

179
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,050
We'll do it your way.

180
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,219
I ever saw these news reports

181
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,299
saying the Guan family
was both loving and harmonious.

182
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,770
Everyone was so jealous.

183
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,810
You're really curious
about our family affair, huh?

184
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,059
Who doesn't love

185
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,330
rich people gossip?

186
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,850
Fine.

187
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,570
If you insist, I'll spill a little.

188
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,970
Before I turned fifteen,

189
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,370
our family was peaceful and happy.

190
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,170
My mom was still around then.

191
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,939
Guan Shanhai was a decent father

192
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,130
and a good husband.

193
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,170
But after my mom's passing,

194
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,090
our family fell apart.

195
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,890
He can't keep up the act forever.

196
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,659
I'm going to expose him

197
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,899
sooner or later.

198
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,450
I will show the world who he truly is

199
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,650
And you?

200
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,810
Me?

201
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,370
What are you really like?

202
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,050
Haven't you figured it out yet?

203
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,170
No.

204
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,610
What if I get a little closer?

205
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,810
The closer I get,

206
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,570
the clearer you'll see.

207
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,970
I'm sleepy.

208
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,450
So I'm going to bed.

209
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,099
(It was only because
you looked at me once)

210
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,850
(It was only because
you looked at me once)

211
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:48,249
(that I miss you day and night.)

212
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,139
(That I miss you day and night.
Xin Cheng)

213
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,970
(Xin Cheng.)

214
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,450
Why would Dad write these words

215
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:58,201
on Mrs. Ming Yun's fan?

216
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,450
