2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,970
Miss!

4
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,179
Miss!

5
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,970
Is your name Xin Yi?

6
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,450
What do you want?

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,619
My name is Fang Jun.

8
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,450
I'm a Chinese painting enthusiast.

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,179
You're Xin Yi, the gold medal winner
in Chinese painting. I know you.

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,219
That peony painting you did
had such a vivid spirit.

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,099
I thought

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,379
it must have been painted
by some elderly master.

13
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,979
Then I saw the photo of the artist

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,579
and was completely shocked.

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,250
It was just a young girl.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,539
Can you believe it?

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,059
In a small place like Zhuguang Town,

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,219
I happened to run into you.

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,539
You're too kind.

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,539
Not at all.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,619
By the way,

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,770
how long are you two planning
to stay in Zhuguang Town?

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,059
Here's the thing.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,499
The Zhuguang Goddess's birthday
is coming up.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,059
The town mayor and I
are old acquaintances.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,779
He asked me to paint a portrait

27
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,899
of the Goddess.

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,939
To be honest,

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,699
I have completed most of it.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,099
But no matter how many times

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,459
I redo the eyes,

32
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,250
they just don't feel right.

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,659
So I wanted to ask if Miss Xin Yi

34
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,339
might be willing to give me

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,059
a few pointers?

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,619
She's busy. She doesn't have time.

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,579
If you don't mind,

38
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,219
I'd be glad to help.

39
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,099
Wonderful!

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,899
Let's meet tomorrow at 8 AM

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,939
in front of the Wen Temple
in the town center.

42
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,579
All right.

43
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,259
Thank you.

44
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,699
Let's go.

45
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,290
You're welcome.

46
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,419
Why did you agree to help that man?

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,619
I told you

48
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,299
we're here to lay low.

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,760
What if something happens?

50
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,139
I don't even know what danger
we're supposedly avoiding,

51
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,859
let alone what trouble
could come from it.

52
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,610
Still not behaving
even with the handcuffs on.

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,970
Your hand hasn't healed.
How are you going to paint?

54
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,219
When I write,

55
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,050
my left hand is steady too.

56
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,090
Don't think I don't know
what you're planning.

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,539
Relax.

58
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,970
I won't try to run.

59
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,650
Uncuff me.

60
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,819
After I finish the painting tomorrow,

61
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,290
I'll come back on my own.

62
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,650
I told you already.

63
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,090
I lost the key.

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,379
You...

65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,339
Put down the knife!

66
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,490
The key.

67
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,810
Give me the key!

68
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,619
What...

69
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,379
What are you doing?

70
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,970
I'll say it again.

71
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,659
Give me the key!

72
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,570
Put the knife down first. You're bleeding!

73
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,330
You win.

74
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,130
Put that down.

75
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,650
What are you doing?

76
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,179
Give that back to me!

77
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,299
That's my journal!

78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,610
Give it back!

79
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,539
To keep you from running,

80
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,899
I'll hold onto this for now.

81
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,730
You'll get it back
once you return tomorrow.

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,890
You better keep your word.

83
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,970
You've disappointed me.

84
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,690
As I've said,

85
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,410
I'm not marrying him.

86
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,050
All this did nothing

87
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,659
but disgrace you

88
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,250
and bring shame to the Guan family.

89
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,610
The Qin family is drowning in debt.

90
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,170
They only want
to leech off the Guan family.

91
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,090
Why are you so insistent
on this marriage?

92
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,330
You're not the type
to make a losing deal.

93
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,090
The only reason
you haven't cut off them off

94
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,610
is because
Qin Heng is still useful to you.

95
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,450
I won't ask what you're scheming.

96
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,930
I'll find out myself.

97
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,770
I refuse to be your puppet anymore.

98
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,530
Fine!

99
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,690
Leave! All of you, just go!

100
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,859
You're nothing

101
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,290
without the Guan family!

102
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,690
Here to enjoy my misery?

103
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,920
I know I shouldn't be here.

104
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,280
I shouldn't have shown up
at the family dinner either.

105
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,730
But Xin Yi is missing.

106
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,290
I just went to the Guan family
to gather information.

107
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,330
The Guan family's involved?

108
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,659
You.

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,459
Guan Huai.

110
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,570
Xin Yi.

111
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,770
What are the three of you doing?

112
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,410
And what part
does my father play in all this?

113
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,739
I won't be of any help

114
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,610
unless you tell me.

115
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,499
I refuse to be

116
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,410
a clueless pawn any longer.

117
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,810
What if

118
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,899
this ends up hurting the Guan family

119
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,450
and your father?

120
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,690
My dad worked hard to build all this.

121
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,810
How clean could his hands really be?

122
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,099
Besides, the Guan family

123
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,050
is already rotten on the inside.

124
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,770
Only by cutting out the decay

125
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,770
can this tree grow strong again.

126
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,170
The Zhuguang Goddess is the local deity
of Zhuguang Town.

127
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,419
Every year,
the town holds a grand ritual

128
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,739
to pray for her blessings.
Good weather, a bountiful harvest,

129
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,320
and great fortune in the coming year.

130
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,819
If there's anything
you need my help with,

131
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,170
please don't hesitate to ask.

132
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,939
Xin Yi,

133
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,539
the truth is,
that portrait is already finished.

134
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,939
(Yingxing Gate)
Yesterday, I only said what I said

135
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,690
because you looked like
you were in trouble.

136
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,339
Xin Yi,

137
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,699
forgive me for being blunt.

138
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,859
I saw yesterday that you and that man

139
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,210
were handcuffed together.

140
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,259
Don't worry, though.

141
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,179
Like I said,

142
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,659
I'm friends with the mayor
of Zhuguang Town.

143
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,779
If anything's wrong,

144
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,330
you can talk to me anytime.

145
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,419
We're friends.

146
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,859
We were just fooling around.

147
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,560
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Fang.

148
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,419
Whew,

149
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,859
you gave me a scare.

150
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,299
If you hadn't

151
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,099
shown up this morning,

152
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,650
I might have called the police.

153
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,139
Mr. Fang,

154
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,819
could I borrow your phone?

155
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,899
I forgot to bring mine.

156
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,339
Sure.

157
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,979
Of course.

158
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,050
Thank you.

159
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,850
Here you go.

160
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,699
Thanks.

161
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,139
Fang Jun!

162
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,850
Don't mention it.

163
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,419
Over here!

164
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,579
Give us a hand!

165
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,259
Xin Yi.

166
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,259
I'll be right back. Help yourself.

167
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,859
Thanks.

168
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,699
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

169
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,770
Don't worry about it.

170
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,530
Hello?

171
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,219
Hello.

172
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,730
Chaoyun Rehabilitation Center.

173
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,539
Oh,

174
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,019
hello.

175
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,219
May I ask if the patient in Room 1231
has returned?

176
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,459
I'm her sister.

177
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,899
I visited two days ago

178
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,499
and found that she had been taken away.

179
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,699
Has she come back since then?

180
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,530
Do you know where she went?

181
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,619
1231?

182
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,570
Yes.

183
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,530
We don't have a Room 1231.

184
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,290
What?

185
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,179
That's impossible.

186
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,419
It was definitely Room 1231.

187
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,259
The patient's name is Xin Nong.

188
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,530
Could you double-check?

189
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,880
We don't have any patient
by that name here.

190
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,219
Maybe you've got the wrong place?

191
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,699
I...

192
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,400
Please contact us again
once you've confirmed.

193
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,890
I... There's no way I got it wrong... Hello?

194
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:07,440
Ever since Guan Huai turned against us,

195
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,770
(A Big Repair Garage)
Xin Yi has been hiding

196
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,160
from his investigation,
so she has been staying here.

197
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,250
Is it possible that Xin Yi felt unsafe

198
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,250
and wanted to relocate?

199
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,819
No.

200
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,739
She wants Mr. Guan to find her.

201
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,800
Besides, she would never go
without contacting me.

202
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,730
Just waiting around like this
won't help.

203
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,370
We need to call the police.

204
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,730
I know

205
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,770
this will drag a lot of people into it.

206
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,770
But Xin Yi's safety comes first.

207
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,179
Hello?

208
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,699
Qin Shen?

209
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,970
It's me, Xin Yi.

210
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,819
Xin Yi,

211
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,899
where are you?

212
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,899
Are you safe?

213
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,579
I'm fine.

214
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,250
I'm in Zhuguang Town.

215
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,459
Zhuguang Town?

216
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,499
That's a remote town.

217
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,459
What are you doing there?

218
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,130
Guan Huai brought me here.

219
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,059
Wait there.

220
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,859
I'll come get you.

221
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,770
Qin Shen.

222
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,210
I just called the rehabilitation center.

223
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,539
They said there is no Room 1231,

224
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,539
and no patient named Nong.

225
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,019
Did they make a mistake?

226
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,899
What in the world is going on?

227
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,339
Chaoyun Town only has
one rehabilitation center.

228
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,490
There should not be any confusion.

229
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,339
Xin Yi,

230
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,659
listen to me...

231
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,730
Qin Shen.

232
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,130
Where is my sister?

233
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,850
Xin Yi,

234
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,059
it's a long story.

235
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,819
Look.

236
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,659
I'll come get you

237
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,299
and explain everything in person,
all right?

238
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,890
Just tell me.

241
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,890
Guan Huai.

242
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,010
(I accidentally knocked over the paints.
The bad guy locked me up again.)

243
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:20,332

I miss Daddy. I want to go home.)

I can't cry, or he'll punish me again.)

♪I turned away in tears, falling apart♪

369
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,849
♪You turned away
with a smile and goodbye♪

370
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,310
♪That moment blurred into a haze♪

371
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,579
♪Leaving only the sea, the sky♪

372
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,780
♪And the sound of me choking back tears♪

373
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:17,060
