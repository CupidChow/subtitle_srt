=Episode 20=

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,780
(M, South East Asia)

4
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,679
Hang in there.

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,870
We're almost out.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,959
Don't run!

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,870
Or I won't go easy on you!

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,030
Quick!

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,830
Nong.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,630
Go.

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,199
After them!

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,119
You brats!

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,910
You're not getting out of there,
even if you die today.

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,759
Big brother, you should go.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,839
Don't worry about me.

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,439
What are you saying?
We'll leave together.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,679
They're catching up.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,439
If you take me with you,
we won't make it.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,479
Just go.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,670
Dad and I will wait here for you
to come save us.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,390
Go.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,710
Hurry.

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,230
Okay.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,079
I'll definitely come back for you.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,190
I promise.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,159
Big brother, go.

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,559
After him.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,799
Don't look back.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,919
After him!

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,879
Don't let him get away.

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,879
Yes.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,919
Little brat,

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,790
I told you not to run,
and you still run.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,270
Mr. Xin.

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,390
Nong.

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,670
Dad.

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,199
What did you do?

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,199
She's just a kid.

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,470
A kid?

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,319
Your daughter is impressive.

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,759
She actually helped that brat
dig a hole and escape.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,830
You must be tired of living.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,879
If you touch us again,

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,550
I'd rather die than paint for you.

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,119
Nong,

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,470
are you hurt?

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,319
Don't be scared.

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,070
We'll go home soon.

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,230
Wang,

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,830
that brat is cunning.

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,959
We searched all night
and couldn't find him.

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,710
A bunch of useless fools.

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,430
He must be hiding in the mountains.

54
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,550
Block all the roads down the mountain.

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,719
I don't believe he can fly out of here.

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,870
Also,

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,439
don't tell...

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm talking to you.

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,830
Don't let Mr. Peng know about this.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,150
Who?

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,159
What shouldn't I know about?

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,670
Mr. Peng, what brings you here?

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,070
Useless fool.

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,519
All of you are useless fools.

65
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,550
Mr. Peng.

66
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,350
Why are you so mad?

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,710
Someone in the factory
called the police,

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,190
and none of you noticed.

69
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,630
It can't be.

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,350
Could it be that brat?

71
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,839
Mr. Peng,

72
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,790
this is impossible.

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,870
He couldn't be so fast.

74
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,990
Xin Cheng,

75
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,759
how have I treated you?

76
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,390
I give you good food every day.

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,439
I treat you the same

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,150
as I treat my buddies.

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,030
And you backstabbed me?

80
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,319
Huh?

81
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

82
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,030
You're still denying it.

83
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,990
Dad.

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,790
You said you were going out to sketch
the other day.

85
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,550
My men weren't paying attention.

86
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,470
What did you say to that woman secretly?

87
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,390
Huh?

88
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,799
What did you tell her?

89
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,950
Dad.

90
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,439
Come here.

91
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,119
Let go of her.

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,119
Dad.

93
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,710
Dad.

94
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,999
Luckily,

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,679
I've got eyes in the police.

96
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,590
If not, you would've gotten me
into trouble.

97
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,959
I'm begging you.

98
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,279
Don't hit my dad.

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,199
Wang,

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,279
don't hit his hands.

101
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,039
Go.

102
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,350
Teach him a lesson.

103
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,270
Dad!

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,510
Dad!

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,230
Dad!

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,510
Dad!

107
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,270
Stop hitting him!

108
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,190
Dad!

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,390
Dad!

110
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,870
Dad!

111
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,310
Dad!

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,879
Dad!

113
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,030
Dad!

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,990
Dad!

115
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,670
Dad!

116
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,430
Dad!

117
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,310
Dad!

118
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,310
Dad!

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,030
Dad!

120
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,790
Dad!

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,790
(Nong was so badly traumatized)

122
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,910
(that her memory became distorted.)

123
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,470
(She mistook Wang for me.)

124
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,990
But you promised you'd save her.

125
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,310
Why didn't you go back?

126
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,270
After I crawled out of the hole,

127
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,390
Wang sent his men after me.

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,550
I hid and ran all over the mountains.

129
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,150
I completely lost my sense of direction.

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,830
After two days,

131
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,359
I passed out

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,790
from exhaustion.

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,910
When I woke up, it was three days later.

134
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,230
Stone saved me.

135
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,470
He told me

136
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,110
the police had raided the factory

137
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,790
and rescued everyone.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,030
You're Guan Shanhai's son,

139
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,550
but how did you end up in that factory?

140
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,830
Because...

141
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,910
Because the blood the factory sent
for your dad's painting

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,470
was from my mom.

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,430
You've read the divorce agreement,
right?

144
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,470
If there's no issue, sign them.

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,750
Yun.

146
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,319
Why are you in a rush?

147
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,110
We agreed on this before.

148
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,630
I give you my blood,

149
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,310
and you agree to the divorce.

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,910
Aren't you curious about
what I'm doing with your blood?

151
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,470
Would it matter if I were?

152
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,830
Have you ever told me the truth
for once?

153
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,270
From the day you approached me,

154
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,630
everything you did
was a carefully crafted lie.

155
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,479
They don't matter.

156
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,630
Yun,

157
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,479
all you need to know is that I love you.

158
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,079
You!

159
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,830
The one you love isn't me.

160
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,830
You love yourself.

161
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,390
Guan Shanhai,

162
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,590
I don't care what you're trying to do,
it has nothing to do with me.

163
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,150
Right now, I just want a divorce.

164
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,150
I did all this just for you.

165
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,910
I used your blood to make a gift.

166
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,999
I believe you'll be happy

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,630
once you see it.

168
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,750
Then you'll understand

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,070
I'm the one who loves you the most
in this world.

170
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,870
Your senior is nothing.

171
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,150
Only I can give you the world.

172
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,350
Let go of me!

173
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,750
Yun.

174
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,710
Guan Shanhai took my mom's blood.

175
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,630
So I followed the clues

176
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,230
and traced it all the way
to a counterfeit factory abroad.

177
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,159
I wanted to find out

178
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,030
what exactly Guan Shanhai
was preparing for my mom.

179
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,710
I only found out later

180
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,870
it was that painting.

181
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,710
Can you even call that a gift?

182
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,590
Guan Shanhai just wanted to

183
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,350
satisfy his own obsession.

184
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,079
He liked "Spring Birds Competing"

185
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,319
by Ma Qingshan,

186
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,959
but couldn't find the original,

187
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,710
so he decided to make a fake one

188
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,510
to feed his desire.

189
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,830
Even the paint

190
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,030
was made with my mom's blood.

191
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,870
If everything you're saying is true,

192
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,230
why did you pretend to be Nong?

193
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,510
Where's my sister?

194
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,510
Actually, Nong died a long time ago.

195
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,030
Everything I said is true.

196
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,359
That bad guy bullied me.

197
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,670
Why won't anyone believe me?

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,910
It was him.

199
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,190
He bullied Dad

200
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,230
and me.

201
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,430
He has a butterfly on his back.

202
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,990
Dad, I miss you so much.

203
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,190
Nong wasn't herself

204
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,430
after she came back from the factory.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,070
She kept talking about the bad guy
in her diary,

206
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,910
but no one believed her.

207
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,310
It all happened so suddenly,

208
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,030
and we were afraid you couldn't
handle the truth,

209
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,910
so we kept her death from you.

210
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,470
When she walked into the lake,

211
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,959
where was I?

212
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,030
Why wasn't I with her?

213
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,390
Where did I go?

214
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,430
You were still young yourself

215
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,799
and were busy dealing
with your dad's situation.

216
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,910
It's understandable to overlook things.

217
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,230
Besides, we lied to you about her death.

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,070
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

219
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,390
Stop blaming yourself.

220
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,830
The ward that doesn't exist,

221
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,119
and the patient

222
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,199
who doesn't like people or talking.

223
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,710
All this time,

224
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,710
you all really put in a lot of effort.

225
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,710
Xin Yi.

226
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,830
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,390
I know

228
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,510
no matter how many reasons I have,

229
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,030
they all sound like excuses.

230
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:58,430
Even though it was a lie,

231
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,110
Nong

232
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,190
did give me a lot of comfort.

233
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,550
It was she

234
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,430
who helped me make it through all this.

235
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,270
I hate that you lied to me,

236
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,110
but I'm also grateful
for what you've done.

237
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,550
But I don't get it.

238
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,150
You all planned this whole thing
for so long,

239
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,319
but why are you taking me off

240
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,190
the plan now?

241
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,470
I know you want to find out the truth

242
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,430
and get your dad's painting back.

243
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,359
But Guan Shanhai
already knows your identity.

244
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,959
This man is ruthless.

245
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,790
He might betray you.

246
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,879
If you want to find the truth,

247
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,319
you have to take the risk.

248
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,830
How will I see the truth I want
if I don't play the game?

249
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:02,719
(A Big Repair Garage)

250
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,310
You've been up all night.

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,310
Get some rest.

252
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,294
I'm fine.

253
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:09,670
(A Big Repair Garage)

254
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,430
Getting anxious like this won't help.

255
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,279
She didn't call you.

256
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,279
Give her some time

257
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,790
to calm down.

258
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,070
She must be mad at me.

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,719
If I were treated the same way
you all treated her,

260
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,830
I'd probably want to kill you.

261
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,279
If she's angry,

262
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,910
that means she cares.

263
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,150
When we were kids,

264
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,950
our houses were so close,

265
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,550
only a wall between us.

266
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,350
We used to run around
the neighborhood all day,

267
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,790
playing with cats and dogs.

268
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,710
I still remember when we played house,

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,270
she'd be the mom,

270
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,670
I'd be the dad,

271
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,750
and stray dogs were our children.

272
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,270
Why are you looking at me?

273
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,310
You think I'll get jealous?

274
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,110
You know

275
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,950
you've only seen her as a sister.

276
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,359
No.

277
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,559
I like her.

278
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,710
Like?

279
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,999
After your mom passed away,

280
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,870
you were forced to live
in the Qin's residence.

281
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,999
Everyone there

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,390
treated you coldly.

283
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,599
You lived with no dignity,

284
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,310
as if you didn't even exist.

285
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,790
Later, when Xin Yi's family
ran into trouble,

286
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,590
you made yourself her savior.

287
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,759
You sought fulfillment

288
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,030
and a sense of worth through her

289
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,430
just to prove you were needed.

290
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,550
A pitiful boy saving a pitiful girl,

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,510
and you call that love?

292
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,039
If it were real love,

293
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,070
you and I would never have done that.

294
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,119
You!

295
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,430
You don't get it.

296
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:02,192
No, you don't get yourself.
