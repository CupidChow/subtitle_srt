3
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:52,970
If Xin Cheng hadn't taken you
to the factory.

4
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,970
If my son hadn't gotten there

5
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,450
out of suspicion.

6
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,490
If you two hadn't met there,

7
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,490
none of this would've happened.

8
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,810
Maybe I could've gotten the painting

9
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,010
and Yun...

10
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,930
It's fate.

11
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,370
It's all fate!

12
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,930
After everything I've done,

13
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,330
it's all gone.

14
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,410
Everything!

15
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,690
I...

16
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,170
Guan Huai and I

17
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,370
met

18
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:10,008
at the factory?

19
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,950
(May Xin Yinong be safe ang well.)

20
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,690
(May Xin Yinong be safe and well.)

21
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,330
Xin Yi...

22
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,170
nong.

23
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,050
The person at that factory back then

24
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,410
was me.

25
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,930
Dad!

26
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,410
Dad!

27
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,570
Big brother.

28
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,050
Dad!

29
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,530
Dad!

30
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,370
Let me out!

31
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:39,772
(There was never any Nong.)

32
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:44,290
(My name is Xin Yinong.)

33
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,450
(That summer,)

34
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,810
(the person who climbed into
Dad's trunk was me.)

35
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,810
(The one
who suffered through everything,)

36
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,210
(in the factory was me.)

37
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,890
(The one who met Guan Huai)

38
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,650
(and supported each other was also me.)

39
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,010
(After I came back from the factory,)

40
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,170
(my mental state broke down.)

41
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,530
(I was rescued,)

42
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,410
(but from that day on,)

43
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,330
(Xin Yinong became two people.)

44
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,010
(Elder sister, Xin Yi,
and younger sister, Nong.)

45
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,210
(I became Xin Yi,)

46
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,610
(and shamelessly let Nong)

47
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,290
(bear all the pain and nightmares.)

48
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,930
(Only by doing that)

49
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,250
(could I find the courage
to keep going)

50
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,170
(and carry out the revenge
for both Xin Yi and Nong.)

51
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,010
Nong,

52
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,810
let's move to a big city, okay?

53
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,850
Okay.

54
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,170
Hello?

55
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,850
The doctor said

56
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,050
she has dissociative identity disorder.

57
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,770
This condition comes with memory loss.

58
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,410
It's been a long time,

59
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,770
but in her mind,

60
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,170
Xin Yi and Nong are still
two separate people.

61
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,450
Her subconscious is protecting her.

62
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,410
That's why we have to
keep playing along.

63
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,090
A lie is still a lie.

64
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,930
It'll be exposed one day.

65
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,130
And when will that be?

66
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,930
When she's ready.

67
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,250
When she's ready,

68
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,890
we'll help her remember who she is.

69
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,450
(Yi,)

70
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,770
(I'm Nong.)

71
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,290
(You said last time you'd take me home.)

72
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,650
Chairman Guan,

73
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,050
the boat is ready.

74
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,130
There's still time if we leave now.

75
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,490
Leave?

76
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,570
Where would I even go?

77
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,770
Chairman Guan,

78
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,290
you should go.

79
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,570
I'll take the fall for everything.

80
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm just a rough guy

81
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,730
who grew up in the mountains.

82
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,250
My family is poor,

83
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,170
and I'm uncultured.

84
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,810
But I know

85
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,810
loyalty matters most.

86
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,890
If it weren't for you taking me
out of the mountains,

87
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,530
I wouldn't have gone this far.

88
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,770
Stone,

89
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,930
everyone around me has left.

90
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,050
But you're

91
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,610
still here.

92
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,330
It's worth it.

93
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,290
I know you're a loyal person,

94
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,250
but there are things
I need to face myself.

95
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,690
Just go.

96
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,890
Go!

97
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,930
(Yun)

98
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,210
The Guan family really can't be trusted.

99
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,730
I went through so much trouble
to get the painting for them,

100
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,250
and now they're turning on each other

101
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,490
and dragging me down with them.

102
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,010
I need to lay low in South East Asia
until this blows over.

103
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,890
It's you again.

104
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,290
You don't look guilty facing me.

105
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,090
You ungrateful punk.

106
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,490
What did the Qin family do to you?

107
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,530
We took your wretched mother in,

108
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,610
brought you back,

109
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,850
and fed you.

110
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,850
Look at what you've done.

111
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,450
You team up with outsiders
to take me down.

112
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,770
I never wanted to go
to the Qin's residence.

113
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,290
I didn't need your charity.

114
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,250
Listen to yourself.

115
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,170
When have you ever treated me
like a human being?

116
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,650
Human?

117
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,890
You?

118
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,690
Your mom is a tramp,

119
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,890
and you're a thankless ingrate.

120
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,250
Now I get it.

121
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,210
You've been clinging to the Qin family

122
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,250
and playing the good kid
in front of Dad,

123
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,010
all so for your plan.

124
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,170
You want to bring down the Qin family

125
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,210
and me.

126
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,210
For what you've done,

127
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,250
this is your punishment

128
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,170
and retribution.

129
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,290
You brought it on yourself.

130
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,010
It has nothing to do with me.

131
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:25,890
Really?

132
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,290
Punk!

133
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,850
Let go of me.

134
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,930
Stop it.

135
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,770
Let go of me.

136
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,810
Let go.

137
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,250
You're not getting away.

138
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,250
Take the punishment you deserve.

139
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,890

She's Nong,

143
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,010
your senior's daughter.

144
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,450
She might even be your daughter-in-law.

145
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,690
Please bless me so that I marry her.

146
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,490
Madam Ming Yun,

147
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,130
my dad spoke of you before.

148
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,850
He said you were

149
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,410
gentle, wise, and talented.

150
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,530
I always wanted to meet you.

151
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,130
Finally, I got the chance.

152
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,450
Mom,

153
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,410
you're free now.

they'll have to pay the price
of their actions.
