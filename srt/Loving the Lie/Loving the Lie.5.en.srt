00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:54,030
(M, South East Asia)

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,199
Please,

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,559
stop hitting him.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,119
Stop hitting him.

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,479
Please.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,199
Stop hitting him.

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,830
Stop it.

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,310
I hate it when people cry.

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,950
The more you beg like this,

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,870
the worse it makes me feel.

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,670
That's right.

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,430
A smile suits you best.

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,470
Give me a smile.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,479
If I'm happy,

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,790
I won't hit him.

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,390
That's right.

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,070
Smile.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,470
That's not a real smile.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,030
Smile like you mean it.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,990
Smile.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,830
Laugh out loud.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,750
Keep laughing.

25
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:02,050
(Qi Garden)

26
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:09,999
Senior.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,270
I'm here to start the job.

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,630
You did everything you could
to latch onto the Guan family.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,430
It can't be just for painting, right?

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,030
I heard you've been getting close
to Guan Huai lately.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,999
Why?

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,390
Trying to marry into money, huh?

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,270
Too bad.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,350
The Guan family
doesn't expect much from him.

35
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:43,030
So your dream
is about to go up in smoke.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,630
Senior.

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,670
Are you talking about yourself?

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,470
My shoes are dirty.

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,430
Clean them for me.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,870
I'm here as an assistant.

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,350
My assistant cleans my shoes.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,599
Why?

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,950
You don't want to?

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,679
If you don't want to,

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,070
you can leave.

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,990
Fine.

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,279
Oops.

48
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,430
Sorry.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,070
I didn't mean to do that.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,430
Senior.

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,310
Do you think this is fun?

52
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,590
Xin Yi, you...

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,359
Oops.

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,559
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that either.

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,870
You!

56
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,039
Senior.

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,799
It's not going to work.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,590
Because I'm not backing down.

59
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,070
We'll see about that.

60
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,959
(During the last interview,)

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,430
(Xu Ru dared pass off my work
as her own.)

62
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,270
(That means
she already suspects I can't paint.)

63
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,239
(Even though Guan Huai's harmonica)

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,919
(temporarily threw her off,)

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,670
(she's already made me her enemy.)

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,639
(The painting Father made,
Spring Birds Competing)

67
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,790
(is most likely hidden
in the Golden House.)

68
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,799
(To locate the Golden House)

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,719
(and that painting,)

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,390
(I must earn Guan Shanhai's trust.)

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,030
(And I need
to get rid of Xu Ru soonest possible.)

72
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,110
Who's there?

73
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,510
Weren't you all tough?

74
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,119
Didn't you love to smile?

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,079
Smile!

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,550
Keep smiling!

77
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,350
That's not a real smile.

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,910
Smile like you mean it.

79
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,630
Smile.

80
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,110
No...

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,790
I won't do it again, Grandpa.

82
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,950
Grandpa.

83
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,350
I was wrong.

84
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,070
I was wrong.

85
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,750
I won't do that again.

86
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,390
I was wrong.

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,910
She's not someone you can have.

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,199
If I ever see you near her again,

89
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,910
I'll gouge your stupid eyes out!

90
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,630
What are you doing here?

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,390
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

92
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,390
Just out for a walk.

93
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,830
You didn't see anything just now, right?

94
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,670
From the moment we met,

95
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,470
I knew you were no good.

96
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,110
What? Are you afraid
I saw something I shouldn't have?

97
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,590
It's not what you think.

98
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,510
Well...

99
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,030
You shameless man!

100
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,430
Keep it away after this.

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,759
Follow up on last quarter's report.

102
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,279
I want it before the end of the day.

103
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,639
Also,

104
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,919
cancel tonight's jewelry gala.

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,590
I'm meeting President Gu from Ansha
to talk business.

106
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,759
By the way, when's my new assistant starting?

107
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,560
She's in your office waiting
for the final interview.

108
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,110
Good.

109
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,559
You again?

110
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,990
I'm here to apply as your secretary.

111
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,110
Miss Guan.

112
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,670
Here's my resume.

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,710
The Qin family's business is huge.

114
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,320
It's hard to believe you'd stoop
to being a secretary.

115
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,511
(Resume)

116
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:22,680
Are you mocking me, Miss Guan?

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,399
You know full well that no matter
how big the Qin family's property is,

118
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,670
it has nothing to do with me.

119
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,990
Sorry.

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,190
That was out of line.

121
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,110
You might not believe this.

122
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,310
But I've been watching you
for a while now.

123
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
When you were 17, you got accepted

124
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,560
(Qin Shen's Information)
into one of the top business schools in the UK.

125
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,519
After graduation,

126
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,910
you trained
in both Wall Street and Singapore.

127
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,359
After joining Guanhai,
you started from the bottom.

128
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,190
And you reached
where you are in just three years.

129
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,799
Most people talk about your father

130
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,030
when they talk about Guanhai.

131
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,079
But I know

132
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,679
Guanhai's success

133
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,430
is all because of you.

134
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,910
You remember more than I do.

135
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,590
And it's well said.

136
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,639
The Qin family has given me nothing,

137
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,310
so I have to find my own path.

138
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,390
And my goal is you.

139
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,439
I want to learn from you

140
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,430
from as close as I can get.

141
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,390
Being my secretary
isn't as glamorous as you assume.

142
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,999
It's a temporary job,

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,919
but it's a heavy load.

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,639
- You'll have to work hard.
- No problem.

145
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,350
I'm not afraid of hard work.

146
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,710
Does the Qin family know you're here?

147
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,470
They never care about what I do.

148
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,270
Thus, I need not tell them about it.

149
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,190
One-month trial.

150
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,079
Any problem?

151
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,119
No problem.

152
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,670
In fact, I can start right away.

153
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,390
Senior.

154
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,879
I've been here for days now.

155
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,110
Shouldn't you assign me some tasks?

156
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,759
Getting paid for nothing

157
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,150
makes me uneasy.

158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,070
Can't wait any longer, huh?

159
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,830
Weren't you pretty arrogant then?

160
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,639
If there's no progress with the piece,

161
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,550
I'm afraid Chairman Guan might ask.

162
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,310
And that'll be hard on you.

163
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,550
Using Chairman Guan to pressure me?

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,150
Fine, then.

165
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,150
I happen to need a special pigment.

166
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,999
They say there's a plant called huai jing
on Mount Chaoyun.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,870
Its sap can be used
to make hibiscus red.

168
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,110
So I'll trouble you
to go fetch it for me.

169
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,110
Xin Yi!

170
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,190
Xin Yi!

171
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,630
Xin Yi!

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,390
I'm right here!

173
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,070
Xin Yi!

174
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,519
I'm here.

175
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,670
Are you okay?

176
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,830
Get up first.

177
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,119
Can you walk?

178
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,159
I'm fine.

179
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,439
It's just some scratch.

180
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,150
Seriously, are you dumb?

181
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,430
You just did as Xu Ru said?

182
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,790
It's a downpour here.
Were you trying to get yourself killed?

183
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,759
She treats me like a thief.

184
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,879
If I don't play along,

185
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,799
I won't get access to any real work.

186
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,470
What's more important,
work or your life?

187
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,550
You're wearing so little.
You might as well freeze to death.

188
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,479
Come on.

189
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,600
Let's get off the mountain now.
It's starting to slide.

190
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,030
I'm not dying up here with you.

191
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,070
Careful.

192
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,790
You okay?

193
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,910
Hold this for me.

194
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,110
I'll climb up first.

195
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,830
No way...

196
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,719
If this keeps up,

197
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,479
we'll stuck here

198
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,870
due to the heavy rain.

199
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,830
Step on me to get up.

200
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,279
What about you?

201
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,279
You go first.

202
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,510
After that, pull me up.

203
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,350
Okay.

204
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,030
Come on.

205
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,430
Yi!

206
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,439
The rain's too heavy here.

207
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,950
Soon it'll wash everything away.

208
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,030
No one will ever know what happened.

209
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,670
It hurts so bad!

210
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,270
