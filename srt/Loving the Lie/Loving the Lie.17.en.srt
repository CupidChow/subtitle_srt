00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:46,460
(Reception)

4
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,299
Come on. Let's get something to eat
and have a good rest.

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,570
We have to travel again tonight.

6
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,770
We still have to move?

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,299
You were never planning
to take me to see Nong.

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,059
What are you really up to?

9
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,859
Relax.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,659
As long as you behave,
I promise I won't lay a finger on her.

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,130
We rest during the day
and travel at night these next few days.

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,330
Guan Huai!

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,530
Stop fussing.

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,139
I've been driving all day. I'm tired.

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,579
Come on.

16
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,610
Let's eat something.

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,939
Small towns are like this.

18
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,250
Just make do.

19
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,299
You...

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,930
Why are you taking off your clothes?

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,299
What do you think?

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,730
I'm going to shower.

23
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,859
Don't pull me!

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,050
I'm not going!

25
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,059
Hey!

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,890
Where are you touching?

27
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,810
Sorry.

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,810
Ouch!

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,690
Why are you so rough?

30
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,410
You left a bruise.

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,219
Then,

32
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,250
uncuff me.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,210
Uncuff you so you can run?

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,690
What are you doing with my phone?

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,130
Hello?

36
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,219
Young Master,

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,530
where are you?

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,939
Xin Yi left Chaoyun Town last night.

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,899
I went after her.

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,379
I didn't have time to notify you.

41
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,330
Where are you now?

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,490
Shitan Town.

43
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,699
All right.

44
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,130
I'll head over now.

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,219
What are you doing?

46
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,810
Stone can track the phone's GPS.

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,840
Also saves me the trouble
of keeping you in check.

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,579
Are you taking me to Shitan Town?

49
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,139
I just told him that.

50
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,210
We're actually going to Zhuguang Town.

51
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,570
Aren't you tired from not sleeping?

52
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,419
We might not

53
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,139
find any inns after this.

54
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,250
Better to take the chance while we can.

55
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,219
You...

56
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,779
Get off me!

57
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,050
Don't touch me!

58
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,699
You used to be so gentle,

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,859
always smiling at me.

60
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,130
Now you're so mean.

61
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,450
But I like that too.

62
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,179
I should have stabbed you
with that fork last night.

63
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,699
Well, next time you get the chance,

64
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,010
don't hesitate.

65
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,939
All right.

66
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,779
I'll stop teasing. Let's get some sleep.

67
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,370
You may not be tired, But I sure am.

68
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,930
Get away from me!

69
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,330
Promise you'll go to sleep,
and I'll move.

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,010
Your feet.

71
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,570
Close your eyes.

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,179
My hand is almost healed.

73
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,570
You should report your achievement
to Guan Shanhai.

74
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,050
I just want your hand to recover.

75
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,930
What a faker.

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,450
Xin Yi.

77
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,610
Xin Yi?

78
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,890
(Where did she go?)

79
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,339
If you have the guts,
hide her to the ends of the earth.

80
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,539
Don't let me find her.

81
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,690
If I do,

82
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,290
you'll regret it.

83
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,339
Xin Yi,

84
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,139
where are you?

85
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,739
Hello.

86
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,410
Are you the owner of this phone?

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,779
I found it in the grass by the road.

88
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,570
You should come pick it up.

89
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,250
Hungry?

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,050
Have some bread.

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,250
I'm not hungry.

92
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,939
At least drink some water.

93
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,770
A whole day without food or water?
What are you? Immortal?

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,770
Slow down.

95
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,570
Do you know

96
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,481
what you are doing?

97
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,250
Aren't you thirsty?

98
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,059
Looking for the key?

99
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,099
I already threw it away.

100
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,490
You won't be able to unlock the cuff.

101
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,810
Actually,

102
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,050
I'm still thirsty.

103
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,610
Feed me a couple more sips?

104
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,570
All right.

105
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,779
I'll say a few words.

106
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,259
Today is a great day.

107
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,979
Mr. Guan.

108
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,130
I have to toast you.

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,090
I should call you my in-law now.

110
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,210
Indeed.

111
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,259
We never had a daughter.

112
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,259
We've always hoped Xin

113
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,139
would marry into our family

114
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,899
and fulfill our dream
of having a daughter.

115
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,570
I'm looking forward
to having Heng as a son too.

116
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,339
Good.

117
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,859
Here, here.

118
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,499
Cheers.

119
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,370
Guan Xin.

120
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,570
Join us, Guan Xin.

121
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,370
Here.

122
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,570
Thank you.

123
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,890
Cheers.

124
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,819
Mom. Dad.

125
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,019
This is a family dinner.

126
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,499
What are you doing here?

127
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,219
You're right.

128
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,730
This is a family dinner,
which means I definitely should be here.

129
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,330
My brother is getting married.

130
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,939
I had to come

131
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,690
and offer my congratulations.

132
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,019
Well, you're here.

133
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,250
Have a seat.

134
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,019
Excuse me.

135
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,330
I need to touch up my makeup.

136
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,970
Mom. Dad.

137
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,579
Entertain Mr. Guan.

138
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,010
I'll be right back from the restroom.

139
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,139
Let's talk.

140
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,890
There's nothing for us to talk about.

141
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,739
Not even if it's about

142
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,890
Qin Shen?

143
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,610
What are you getting at?

144
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,330
What do you think?

145
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,770
Nice shots, right?

146
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,890
I knew you and that love child
had something going on.

147
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,130
Caught you

148
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,570
red-handed.

149
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,419
Who would have thought

150
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,730
you were such an enchantress?

151
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,339
You showed me these photos

152
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,570
just to get a kick out of it?

153
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,210
I just wanted to let you know

154
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,539
that if you don't want
these scandals to go public,

155
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,530
then hand over all your shares
in Guanhai to me.

156
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,019
You wouldn't want all those years
of maintaining a spotless public image

157
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,290
to go up in smoke, right?

158
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,690
Getting involved
with your fiancé's younger brother...

159
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,050
People will talk about that
for the rest of your life.

160
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,539
Not my best angle.

161
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,520
I prefer to be photographed
from my left side.

162
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,330
Guan Xin.

163
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,610
Guan Xin!

164
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,570
You're really not afraid
I'll expose you? Guan Xin!

165
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,570
What are you two doing?

166
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,690
Guan Xin!

167
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,659
What exactly is your relationship?

168
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,610
Exactly what you saw.

169
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,290
Xin.

170
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,010
He is Qin Heng's younger brother.

171
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,250
You...

172
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,739
You are shameless!

173
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,930
It's not her fault.

174
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,410
I made the first move.

175
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,330
You're just like your tramp of a mother.

176
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,059
Shameless!

177
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,210
That's right.

178
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,059
Qin Shen seduced Guan Xin.

179
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,850
He never had any good intentions
staying in the Qin family.

180
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,010
We should kick him out

181
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,099
for the good of the family.

182
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,250
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,859
I didn't raise my daughter properly.

184
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,410
We have made a fool of ourselves.

185
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,050
Don't say that.

186
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,490
Guan Xin was just confused for a moment.

187
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,370
I'm willing to forgive her.

188
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,530
This marriage between our families
must not be delayed.

189
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,450
How generous of you.

190
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,090
But I don't need your forgiveness.

191
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,850
I'm not going through
with this marriage.

192
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,410
Sorry.

193
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,210
You just had to do that...

194
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,970
Why did you bring me here?

195
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,859
Zhuguang Town is far away.

196
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,499
My dad's influence can't reach here.

197
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,939
You can lay low

198
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,130
for a couple of days.

199
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,379
I thought you were using me
to win over Guan Shanhai.

200
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,330
What trick are you trying to pull?

201
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,010
Believe it or not,

202
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,939
I never intended to hurt you.

203
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,819
Miss!

204
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,970
Miss.

205
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,779
Write a prayer ribbon.

206
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,819
Hang this up

207
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,859
on the mountain.

208
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,059
The Zhuguang Goddess will see it

209
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,259
and help your wish come true.

210
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,370
It really works.

211
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,690
Write one.

212
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,010
Here.

213
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,930
You believe in this stuff?

214
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,579
Why not?

215
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,730
Okay, then.

216
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,259
Wait. Your right hand is still recovering.
Don't use it.

217
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,690
Use your left hand. I'll help you.

218
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,570
What do you want to write?

219
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,010
"Wish Nong peace and happiness."

220
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,010
(Wish)

221
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:42,140
(Wish Xin Yi)

222
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,840
(Wish Xin Yi peace and safety,
and everlasting joy)

223
00:14:56,881 --> 00:14:58,810
(Wish Xin Yi peace and safety)

224
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:06,060
(Wish Xin Yi and Xin Nong
peace and safety)

225
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,539
(Why can my left hand)

226
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,450
(write so smoothly?)

227
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,850
