=Loving The Lie=

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,700
You've really got guts, huh?

4
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,709
If I hadn't pulled the breaker,

5
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,340
how were you planning to get out?

6
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,989
I just wanted to know

7
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,500
what exactly Chairman Guan
asked Xu Ru to paint.

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,000
Did you see anything just now?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,380
I was busy with the breaker,
so I didn't manage to see anything.

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,340
You stood there for a long time.
Didn't you see it?

11
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,020
Then what were you even doing?

12
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,780
However,

13
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,029
my guess is,

14
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,749
what Guan Shanhai had Xu Ru paint

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,149
was probably a piece by Ma Qingshan.

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,029
That old man doesn't have many hobbies.

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,460
He's just into Ma Qingshan's work.

18
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,820
Ma Qingshan came up with this color

19
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,100
called Beauty Rouge.

20
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,869
I know.

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,460
But the method has been lost for years.

22
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,780
Over ten years ago,

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,389
the old man hired a painter
for a commission.

24
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,269
That painting used Beauty Rouge.

25
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,749
And that artist
actually managed to make it.

26
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,900
It's said

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,860
that he used human blood.

28
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,100
What happened, then?

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,429
After that,

30
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,789
the man died.

31
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,260
And the Beauty Rouge formula
died with him.

32
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,820
That so-called Beauty Rouge

33
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,349
was probably
just something Ma Qingshan made up

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,220
to get famous.

35
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,340
That artist might've figured out

36
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,029
some mysterious way to make it.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,069
Exactly.

38
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,189
As if there's something that spooky
in this world.

39
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,680
Only that old man would buy into it.

40
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,909
(Back then, Dad passed away
before Spring Birds Competing)

41
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,780
(was finished.)

42
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,109
(Now Guan Shanhai
is recruiting painters)

43
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,020
(to complete that painting.)

44
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,060
(But Xu Ru can't
reproduce Beauty Rouge.)

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,629
(If I can uncover Dad's method)

46
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,740
(for making Beauty Rouge,)

47
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,660
(I can completely replace Xu Ru.)

48
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,580
It's Dad and Nong.

49
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,980
Why were these photos torn up this way?

50
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,340
Why am I not in them?

51
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,060
If it weren't for me...

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,789
If it weren't for me,

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,300
Nong wouldn't have...

54
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,260
I shouldn't exist.

55
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,300
I shouldn't exist.

56
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,540
I shouldn't exist.

57
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,460
I'd like to apologize

58
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,189
for my brother's words.

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,380
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,420
Why are you apologizing?

61
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,540
It's not like it was your fault.

62
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,580
Besides, I'm long used to it.

63
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,940
All these years,

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,340
I've heard way worse than that.

65
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,300
I just don't get it.

66
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,820
Is it really just because I'm a woman?

67
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,949
No matter how hard I work,

68
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,460
I still can't escape
the fate of marriage and being a mother?

69
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,389
Even after all these years spent

70
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,300
giving everything to Guanhai,

71
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,620
to my dad,

72
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm still just someone to marry off.

73
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,340
Mr. Guan is old-fashioned.

74
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,860
He doesn't care about you.

75
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,740
But that doesn't mean no one does.

76
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,220
Who?

77
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,100
You?

78
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,980
Qin Heng wasn't wrong.

79
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,620
I really am a boring woman.

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,909
I've give it my all

81
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,100
just to gain a foothold in Guanhai.

82
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,980
There's no time left to love anyone.

83
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,420
And no one's ever going to love me.

84
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,980
Then why not give it a try?

85
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,860
Try loving someone.

86
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,300
Do you have a girlfriend?

87
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,620
Yun.

88
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,680
(Loving Wife, Ming Yun)
I brought the kids to see you today.

89
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,020
Yun.

90
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,580
This was your favorite thing.

91
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,140
I brought it to you today.

92
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,100
Let it go with you.

93
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,340
Who said you could burn Mom's fan?

94
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,469
What is wrong with you?

95
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,920
There's barely anything left from Mom.

96
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,040
If you don't want to see it, give it to me.
You don't get to touch her belongings!

97
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
You're the last person
who should talk about it.

98
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,229
If you really cared about her,

99
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,149
you wouldn't have let her down
again and again,

100
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,620
turning into some loser
like you are now.

101
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,740
Yun and I don't have a son like you!

102
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,900
Fine by me.

103
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,860
I don't have a dad like you either.

104
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,740
Guan Huai.

105
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,420
What are you doing here?

106
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,580
I heard today
is Mrs. Ming Yun's death anniversary.

107
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,180
I just came to leave some flowers.
That's all.

108
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,500
This isn't a place for you.

109
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,780
Don't bring stuff like that
to disgust my mom.

110
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,900
Chairman Guan.

111
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,100
She's my guest.

112
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,620
You have no right to be rude to her.

113
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,740
Chairman Guan.

114
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,509
Well,

115
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,900
please don't be angry.

116
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,020
I didn't know
they'd mind my presence here.

117
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,820
I shouldn't have come.

118
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,220
Why did you even invite her here?

119
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,660
You wanted my mom to see

120
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,900
you've already found her replacement?

121
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,869
And you.

122
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,220
You've schemed your way
into Guan Shanhai's life,

123
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,189
and desperately copied my mom's style.

124
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,220
Do you feel happy

125
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,300
and fortunate

126
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,020
from being with such a man?

127
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,020
The worst mistake my mom ever made

128
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,180
was marrying you.

129
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,109
(I've tried everything I could.)

130
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,180
(But I still
can't recreate Beauty Rouge.)

131
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,420
(How did Dad do it?)

132
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,560
Watch where you go!

133
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,620
You still managed to bump into me
on such a wide road!

134
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,280
It's you!

135
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,549
My bad, I should've been careful.
It was reckless of me

136
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,660
to have bumped into you.

137
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,160
I spaced out.

138
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,149
You dropped your rice cake.
I'll buy you another one.

139
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,949
It's okay...

140
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,829
You need not do that.

141
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,429
Miss.

142
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,469
Don't get the wrong idea.

143
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,189
I haven't tailed you

144
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,020
(since Huai caught me red-handed.)

145
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,109
(This time, I just ran into you
by accident.)

146
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,460
(I'm leaving.)

147
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,060
(I'll get out of your sight now.)

148
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,469
You were peeping outside the bathroom?

149
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,620
Miss!

150
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,620
I know I was wrong!

151
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,540
I'm still sore

152
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,780
from the beating Huai gave me then.

153
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,100
Miss.

154
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,460
I, Song, swear.

155
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,460
I'll turn my life around

156
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,720
and strive to be a better man.

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,920
I will never show up
within a kilometer of your home again.

158
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,389
Alright...

159
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,029
Just go.

160
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,300
Got it...

161
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,660
Well, I actually misunderstood him.

162
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:59,200
(North Courtyard)

163
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,420
Guan Huai.

164
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,580
Where have you been?
Why have you had so much to drink?

165
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,420
What's the matter?

166
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,300
I...

167
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,509
Well...

168
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,149
Hold on.

169
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,669
Let me help you inside first.

170
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,429
Don't go.

171
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,189
Please don't go.

172
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,580
Don't leave me.

173
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,100
Mom...

174
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,980
I miss you so much.

175
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,860
I really miss you.

176
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,580
Guan Huai...

177
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,100
I...

178
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,700
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,420
I'm so sorry.

180
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,780
I failed to take good care of you.

182
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,420
So you do cry.

183
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,140
I thought someone like you

184
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,020
would never shed a tear.

185
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,340
I...

186
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,980
