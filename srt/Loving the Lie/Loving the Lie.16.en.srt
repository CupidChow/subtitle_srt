=Episode 16=

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,270
My dad is unbelievable.

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,839
It's a small matter.
Why bother you with it?

5
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,070
Looks like he trusts you the most.

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,759
I heard you were the one who cleaned up

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,359
all that mess at the factory.

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,510
Young Master.

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,510
You do know Chairman Guan
doesn't like talking about the past.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,919
Indeed.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,959
My bad, I ran my mouth.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,519
You do know

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,950
that I've got a loose tongue.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,750
Stop the car.

15
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,060
(A Big Repair Garage)

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,990
You want to check out my garage?

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,950
Has this place been searched?

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,519
Why would she hide here?

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,710
The most dangerous place
is often the safest.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,719
Dali.

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,750
Let's go.

22
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,600
(A Big Repair Garage)

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,719
Stone.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,679
She hates me to the core.

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,550
Why would she hide at my place?

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,119
Open it.

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,319
I just want to take a look.

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,390
Go on.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,599
Go.

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,750
Fine.

31
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:11,519
(Just fix two wheels)
(One is fine too)

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,510
As you can see,

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,959
it's just some car parts

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,630
and my boxing gear.

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,710
What's this?

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,710
Isn't this paint?

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,039
Here's the thing.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,679
I learned some Chinese painting

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,310
just to please my dad.

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,110
But I really don't have the talent.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,879
Here. Open it, I want to have a look.
Come on. Open it up.

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,670
Well...

43
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,599
It's just

44
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,750
some imported motor oil and stuff.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,710
Here, Stone.

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,359
Here they are.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,239
These are my imported motor oil

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,790
and car parts.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,439
Tell them to be careful.

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,390
All my goods are stored here.

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,790
If you break anything,
you'll have to pay for it.

52
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,559
This worker of mine is unbelievable.

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,910
He didn't tidy up the place
before going on his holiday.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,390
Young Master.

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,110
Ever since your return from the factory,
you've been butting heads with the old man.

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,630
Why the sudden change
in attitude lately?

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,279
I was insensible back then.

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,670
I had always been stubborn.

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,479
No matter how much

60
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,199
we fought,

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,399
we're still father and son.

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,999
And that's a fact.
It's an unbreakable bond.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,350
I heard you were getting close
with Xin Cheng's daughter.

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,790
Now you've turned your back on her, huh?

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,679
Don't even mention her name, Stone.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,559
That woman

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,359
always acted high and mighty around me

68
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,630
because she thought she was pretty.

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,559
I noticed she had something to offer,

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,750
so I tolerated her.

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,839
Now that her hand was ruined,

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,279
and she was still playing virtuous.

73
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,319
I couldn't touch

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,199
or hold her.

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,319
I'm done entertaining her.

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,750
Well, do you think I can still care
about her or entertain her?

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,679
No matter how pretty she is,
she's just a woman.

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,039
I know what really matters.

79
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,519
Well,

80
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,399
a man

81
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,990
can have any woman he wants

82
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,150
as long as he's loaded.

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,750
Alright, then.

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,799
Let's go,

85
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,519
- Dali.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,559
Next station.

87
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,039
Let's go.

88
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,870
Come on.

89
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,630
Let's move.

90
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,430
I used to think
you stuck to Guan Xin like a leech

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,919
just to annoy me.

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,310
Looks like

93
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,630
you're up to no good.

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,119
When did you start it

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,950
with that Xin Yi?

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,030
Still pretending, huh?

98
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,190
Keep acting.

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,750
Keep pretending.

100
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,750
Are you mad now?

101
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,550
Here.

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,950
Hit me.

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,950
Go on.

104
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,230
Look at how pathetic you are.

105
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,830
I'm warning you.

106
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,910
You'd better keep your head down
from now on.

107
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,710
Don't stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

108
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,230
Resign from Guanhai immediately.

109
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,470
I don't care what happens to you,

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,710
but don't drag our family down with you.

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,879
I'm Miss Guan's secretary.

112
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,959
Whether I stay or go

113
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,510
isn't your decision to make.

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,070
Guan Xin?

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,390
She's in deep trouble now.

116
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,750
What authority does she still have?

117
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,790
So what if she's proud?

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,630
After marrying me,

119
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,070
she'll still be doing my laundry, no?

120
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,959
Miss Guan got to where she is

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,719
step by step, on her own.

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,119
Unlike someone

123
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,990
who wastes what they're given.

124
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,710
The Qin family only looks good
on the surface.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,279
Can you really handle

126
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,639
its debt worth tens of billions?

127
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,159
You want to marry Guan Xin

128
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,430
just to drag
the Guan family down with you, no?

129
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,750
How do you know all this?

130
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,679
There's no such thing as a secret,

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,670
Heng.

132
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,270
You're just like your shameless mother.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,870
You're scheming

134
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,310
and always digging for gossip.

135
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,319
I told you

136
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,639
not to bring up my mom again.

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,030
I insist on doing so.

138
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,599
That shameless homewrecker

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,350
gave birth to a low life like you

140
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,830
just to get into our family.

141
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,270
Good thing heaven had eyes.

142
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,390
She died at a young age.

143
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,150
Otherwise,

144
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,590
she'd either die in the hospital

145
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,670
or at my hands.

146
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,030
Oh, right.

147
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,110
Your mom finally got her wish
to enter the Qin family.

148
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,430
I flushed her ashes
down the Qin family's toilet.

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,119
So when you're using the toilet,

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,870
do you think of your mom?

151
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,790
Heng.

152
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,630
Your mouth is filthy.

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,310
Let me teach you how to talk.

154
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,190
You're being a glutton today.

155
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,470
Did Qin Heng mess with you again?

156
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,310
Sometimes I feel

157
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,790
I shouldn't have been born
into this world.

158
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,950
Did Qin Heng use your identity
to attack you?

159
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,270
When my mom was young,

160
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,350
she was beautiful.

161
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,510
She had big ambitions.

162
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,279
All she ever wanted was to marry rich

163
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,030
and live in high society.

164
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,590
So when she met my dad,

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,270
she did everything
to get pregnant with me.

166
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,910
She then gave birth to me in secret
to hold leverage over the Qin family.

167
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,790
I was just a tool for my mom's desires.

168
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,630
But she truly loved me.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,430
Even when the plan failed,
she never abandoned me.

170
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,590
Instead, she learned
to keep her feet on the ground.

171
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,479
She worked hard

172
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,870
and lived diligently.

173
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,150
She tried her best
to give me everything.

174
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,110
Until her final moment,

175
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,550
she knelt on her hospital bed,

176
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,430
begging my dad to acknowledge me,

177
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,870
so I'd have someone to rely on.

178
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,350
But my life in the Qin family
has been nothing but miserable.

179
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,030
The Qin family
has been a nightmare for me.

180
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,150
You didn't have a choice then.

181
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,030
But now you can break free
from the nightmare.

182
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,119
If they don't love you,

183
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,830
you need to love yourself more.

184
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,990
And you?

185
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,550
What will you choose?

186
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,230
The reason Qin Heng
is rushing to marry you

187
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,510
is to use the Guan family

188
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,430
to settle his massive debt.

189
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,030
Are you really going
to put up with that?

190
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,950
The Qin family is in debt?

191
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,150
That's their secret.

192
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,550
Why are you telling me?

193
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,550
Because I don't want
to see you get fooled.

194
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,830
Have you ever lied to me?

195
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,070
Happy birthday to you.

196
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,230
Happy birthday to you.

197
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,079
Happy birthday to you.

198
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,990
Happy birthday to you.

199
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,719
Nong.

200
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,359
Today is your birthday.

201
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,430
I prepared this strawberry cake
just for you.

202
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,439
I know you don't like sour things,

203
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,319
so I picked
extra big and sweet strawberries.

204
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,350
I'm sure you'll love it.

205
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,070
Nong.

206
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,199
Let's make a wish.

207
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,430
After blowing out the candles,
we'll eat cake, okay?

208
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,550
Nong.

209
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,950
Nong.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,430
I got you this delicious cake.

211
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,630
Hi.

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,230
Why is it you?

213
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,719
Why are you here?

214
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,070
Where is Nong?

215
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,759
This cake looks good.

216
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,990
Just a bit too sweet.

217
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,510
I'll ask you one last time.

218
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,110
Where is Nong?

219
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,759
The main artery is right here.

220
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,910
Harder.

221
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,239
Where exactly is Nong?

222
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,319
As long as you come with me,

223
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,870
I'll take you to see her.

224
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,799
How did you find Nong?

225
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,070
It wasn't hard.

226
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,919
With your connection to Qin Shen,

227
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,870
it just took me a quick lookup.

228
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,359
If you have a problem, come at me.

229
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,479
Don't touch her!

230
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,439
Relax.

231
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,950
I knew her way before you did.

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,159
This is the road out of Chaoyun Town.

233
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,710
Where are you taking me?

234
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,199
Stop the car!

235
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,350
Quit it!

236
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,239
Let me out!

237
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,839
Stop the car!

238
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,990
Stop it!

239
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,070
What are you doing?

240
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,230
What do you want to know?

241
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,190
You could've just asked me.

242
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,359
I...

243
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,510
I just...

244
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,079
No matter what you say,

245
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,510
it's meaningless now.

246
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,030
You hid it so well

247
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,630
that I completely let down my guard.

248
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,639
Even in moments

249
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,510
when my instinct told me
something was off,

250
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,430
I still chose to trust you.

251
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,990
I thought we were on the same boat,

252
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,070
but turns out everything was a lie.

253
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,550
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,190
There are things I must do.

255
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,550
If that's the case,

256
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,550
you need not apologize to me.

257
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,790
It was my own carelessness.

258
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,030
I deserved to be tricked.

259
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,750
Guan Xin.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,110
