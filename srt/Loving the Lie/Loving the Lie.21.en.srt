00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,050
It's so good to be home

4
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,730
after going out for so many days.

5
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,779
Xin Yi,

6
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,930
are you all right?

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,539
You just sat down

8
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,970
without an explanation?

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,419
I'm fine.

10
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,099
The person who messaged you last time

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,450
to come save me was him.

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,979
I thought you'd figured it out.

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,699
So, are my acting skills too convincing,

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,210
or are we just not in sync?

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,899
That's because you also act
on your whim.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,459
That's not true.

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,979
We've been gone for days

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,730
and missed out on many interesting news.

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,080
The elder daughter, Guan Xin,
left Guanhai Group,

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,779
and broke off the engagement
with the Qin family.

21
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,440
The youngest son of the Qin family
is suspected of having an affair

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,290
with his future sister-in-law.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,299
You brat are trying
to date my sister, huh?

24
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,330
Just because you don't speak
doesn't mean you're mute.

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,360
Not only do you want
to be my brother-in-law,

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,650
but you want me to shut up, too.

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,459
I knew you were up to something.

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,370
You want to be my brother-in-law, huh?

29
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,699
Enough.

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,610
Stop joking about us.

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,050
Where did you two go
these past few days?

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,410
We eloped.

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,659
It was just a misunderstanding.

34
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,450
Everything's been resolved.

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,219
Since I'm sitting here today,

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,130
it means I already know about
your plan and intention.

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,690
Guan Huai,

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,019
from now on,

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,970
you don't have to hide everything
from me.

40
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,979
We're family.

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,690
You can trust me.

42
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,379
You were right.

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,250
I was a coward,

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,050
and I didn't want to admit it.

45
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,410
I always knew Mom and Dad had problems.

46
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,970
I knew Mom wanted to leave.

47
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,330
But I was too caught up
in proving myself.

48
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,250
I wanted so badly to earn his approval,

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,250
so I ran away from the problem.

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,130
But I didn't realize

51
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,290
that running away
would only make it worse.

52
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,610
Now, when I think about Mom,
I feel that I failed her.

53
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,810
And I failed myself.

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,610
So I've made up my mind.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,459
From now on, I don't want to be

56
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,690
the perfect daughter and CEO
of the Guan family.

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,610
I just want to be Guan Xin.

58
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,770
I'm happy for you, Xin.

59
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,770
What are you waiting for?

60
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,050
Raise your glasses.

61
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,050
We're all in the same boat now.

62
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,490
Xin Yi,

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,259
I can explain about Nong.

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,819
Guan Hai told me everything.

65
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,570
He's not the bad guy from Nong's diary.

66
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,850
Nong died long ago.

67
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,410
All these years,

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,930
you two kept pretending
my sister was still alive for my sake.

69
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,970
Do you

70
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,850
hate me?

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,690
I'm mad at you. I blame you.

72
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,210
But I'll never hate you.

73
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,370
As a friend,

74
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,730
you've done so much for me.

75
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,970
I should be thanking you.

76
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,410
Friend?

77
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,219
(You sought fulfillment)

78
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,490
(and a sense of worth through her)

79
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,890
(just to prove you were needed.)

80
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,539
(A pitiful boy)

81
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,490
(saving a pitiful girl,)

82
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,010
(and you call that love?)

83
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,650
I don't want to be just your friend.

84
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,419
You're smart.

85
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,410
Haven't you figured it out?

86
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,930
I like you.

87
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,610
That's not love.

88
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,170
It's sympathy.

89
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,570
Because we're the same kind of people.

90
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,850
I know what it feels like to be in love.

91
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,450
When you can't help
but want to kiss them,

92
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,410
that's when it starts.

93
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,899
Oh no!

94
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,619
Xin Yi,

95
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,659
come look.

96
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,760
My hand got wet.

97
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,920
What if it gets infected,
and I have to get it amputated?

98
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,939
I told you not to do it.

99
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,210
I'll wash it.

100
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,739
Come.

101
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,930
Give it to me.

102
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,770
Go ahead.

103
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,050
You never listen.

104
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm fine.

105
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,850
Stop messing around.

106
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,130
I miss them.

107
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,610
Me too.

108
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,730
Let's get justice for them.

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,939
The appraisal event is about to begin,
and we still haven't found her.

110
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,499
How am I supposed
to finish that painting?

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,650
Chairman Guan,

112
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,139
we searched the address
Mr. Guan gave us,

113
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,090
but there was no sign of Xin Yi.

114
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,010
You're saying Guan Hai lied to you?

115
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,850
Who said I lied?

116
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,779
Stone,

117
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,370
don't accuse me like that.

118
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,459
Dad,

119
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,930
look who's here.

120
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,299
This woman

121
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,459
is so hard to catch.

122
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,819
I had to chase her all the way
to Zhuguang Town.

123
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,050
Let me go.

124
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,570
You've been saying that the whole way.
Can't you say something new?

125
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,259
You're trying to piss me off?

126
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,530
Don't force my hand.

127
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,250
Guan Huai.

128
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,970
Guan Huai,

129
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,459
you didn't tell me you went to
Zhuguang Town.

130
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,379
She's got legs.

131
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,539
If she decides to run to Zhuguang Town,
what can I do?

132
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,659
Then why didn't you tell me?

133
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,490
I lost my phone.

134
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,339
Dad,

135
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,499
I lost my phone

136
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,459
chasing her.

137
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,459
Look at my hand. It was almost ruined.
There's a hole right through my hand.

138
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,930
That's a work injury, right?

139
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,330
Let go.

140
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,970
Xin Yi,

141
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,219
don't worry.

142
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,730
I won't hurt you.

143
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,410
All I want is
the formula for Beauty Rogue.

144
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,970
If you will help me...

145
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,970
Impossible.

146
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,850
Forget it.

147
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,130
Xin Yi,

148
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,130
I'm not trying to make things hard
for you.

149
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,650
Take the money and do your job.

150
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,179
That's a deal between us.

151
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,040
There's no need to
drag things out like this.

152
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,250
What do you need Beauty Rogue for?

153
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,530
To paint that fake piece?

154
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,410
Who knows

155
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,170
if a fake can become real?

156
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,450
Chairman Guan,

157
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,130
don't waste your breath on her.

158
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,739
I'll deal with her.

159
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,739
You don't need to bother, Stone.

160
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,019
I'll handle this myself.

161
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,899
I can also

162
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,490
settle the score between us.

163
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,770
I should get going.

164
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,699
Let me go.

165
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,899
Put me down.

166
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,419
Bye.

167
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,330
Put me down.

168
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,010
Put down!

169
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,410
Let go of me.

170
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,459
This wasn't in our plan.

171
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,050
What are you adding this now?

172
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,619
Don't act all airs and graces with me.

173
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,370
Do as I say before I get mad.

174
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,210
Wretched woman!

175
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,530
What are you doing?

176
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,610
Scream.

177
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,579
Get off me.

178
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,930
Don't touch me.

179
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,739
You'd better save your energy.

180
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,290
You'll have more time to scream later.

181
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,090
Guan Huai.

182
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,579
Someone's outside.

183
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,690
Someone's out there.

184
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,690
Call me hubby.

185
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,819
Say it sweet and soft,

186
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,170
and I'll go easy on you.

187
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,530
I've always wanted a taste of you.

188
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,170
Xin Yi,

189
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,690
you've finally fallen into my hands.

190
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,779
Let's see

191
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,370
how well

192
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,170
you can take a beating.

193
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,859
Let go of me.

194
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,450
This is rape!

195
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,250
Are you okay?

196
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,890
I'm fine.

197
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,650
You!

198
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,410
You should've listened
to me when I asked you.

199
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,379
No.

200
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,699
I'm begging you.

201
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,019
Please.

202
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,379
Scared now?

203
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,659
Listen up.

204
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,099
If you don't paint for me,

205
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,650
I'll keep beating you.

206
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,699
I'll paint.

207
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,459
I will.

208
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,499
I promise

209
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,890
I'll paint for you.

210
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,650
Still trying to fool me?

211
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,499
Your hand is injured,
how are you going to paint?

212
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,459
My hand...

213
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,939
My hand's healing.

214
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,690
It won't affect anything.

215
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,099
Chairman Guan said

216
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,730
don't go too far.

217
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,290
She's still useful.

218
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,610
Okay.

219
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,730
Give me another thirty...

220
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,019
No.

221
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,250
A full hour.

222
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,930
He's left.

223
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,094
(Yunzhen Gallery)

224
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,810
Chairman Guan.

225
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,339
Madam Lan's painting
has arrived ahead of schedule.

226
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,419
The setup is all set.

227
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,570
Very well.

228
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,400
Before entering the gallery,
please turn in all electronic devices.

229
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,290
They will be returned after the event.

230
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,939
This is a private appraisal event.

231
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,699
It's not allowed to take or share photos.
The exhibit inside is priceless.

232
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,290
It's for safety purposes.

233
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,510
(Yunzhen Gallery)

234
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,859
Sir,

235
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,219
this is Madam Lan Ke,

236
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,250
the collector
of "Spring Birds Competing".

237
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,179
Chairman Guan,
I've heard a lot about you.

238
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,250
Hello.

239
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,259
Thank you so much

240
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,219
for offering such a great place

241
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,779
to display "Spring Birds Competing".

242
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,499
My greatest wish in life

243
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,530
is to see
the original "Spring Birds Competing"

244
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,430
I should be the one thanking you
for fulfilling my wish, Madam Lan Ke.

245
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,490
You're too kind.

246
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,440
I simply don't want this masterpiece
to stay hidden.

247
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,219
Being able to appreciate it
with everyone here

248
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,499
is my honor.

249
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,890
Madam Lan, please show us the painting.

250
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,299
Sure.

251
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,939
Here.

252
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,850
This way, please.

253
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,450
You're truly fond of this painting.

254
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,970
This was my late wife's favorite piece.

255
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,330
What a shame.

256
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,850
She never got the chance to see it.

257
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,850
Everyone has regrets,

258
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,490
that's why we should cherish the present

259
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,130
and seize every opportunity we have.

260
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,770
I don't know why

261
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,650
I feel uneasy

262
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,410
when I see this painting.

263
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,080
It's because these birds have
broken free from their cage,

264
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,930
but we're still trapped inside ours.

265
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,250
Exactly.

266
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,050
This thin sheet of paper

267
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,819
is a gateway between two worlds.

268
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,970
Look.

269
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,219
They're fighting so hard

270
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,410
for their freedom,

271
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,930
but we're still

272
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,850
trapped inside ours.

273
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,739
"Spring Birds Competing" shows

274
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,739
how exceptional
Ma Qingshan's skills are.

275
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,170
It also conveys a meaning
beyond its time.

276
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,450
I didn't know Ma Qingshan
also fought for freedom.

277
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,970
There's a theory
in the academic circles.

278
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,739
Some believe

279
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,490
all of Ma Qingshan's paintings
were done by his wife.

280
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,619
He took credit for all her work

281
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,570
to build his great reputation.

282
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,979
The reason "Spring Birds Competing"

283
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,570
was his final piece

284
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,810
is because her wife passed away
from illness

285
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,530
after finishing it.

286
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,170
So there's always some ungrateful man

287
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,130
who uses their wife as a stepping stone,
no matter the era.

288
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,619
In those days,

289
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,619
it was never good
for a woman to stand out.

290
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,539
Ma Qingshan not only

291
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,179
protected his wife

292
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,010
but also made a name for himself.

293
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,890
He was clever.

294
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,059
People just love

295
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,459
to make up stories.

296
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,410
How can we trust baseless rumors?

297
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,099
It's just a theory.

298
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,139
Whether it's true or not,

299
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,450
it's anyone's guess.

300
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,370
Look at the Beauty Rogue.

301
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,330
It's the essence of this painting.

302
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,899
However, due to the complexity
of its technique,

303
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,330
it was lost long ago.

304
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,739
Many have tried to replicate
the painting,

305
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,410
but this is where they all fail.

306
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,410
That's why Beauty Rogue is the key
to verifying the painting's authenticity.

307
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,339
Too bad

308
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,930
this event only lasts five days.

309
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,219
We must seize this chance

310
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,419
to study it closely,

311
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,330
observe it carefully, memorize it well,

312
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,130
