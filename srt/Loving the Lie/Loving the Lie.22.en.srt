Let's go.

6
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,669
I'll send you home.

7
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,820
No need.

8
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,340
I called my assistant.

9
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,260
He'll come fetch me later.

10
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,340
Maybe you should check

11
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,980
who you called.

12
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,180
Sorry.

13
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,669
I called the wrong number.

14
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,469
I'll call him again.

15
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,900
Never mind. No need to call him.

16
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,989
Don't bother him.

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,429
Come.

I'll drive you home.

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,860
You're not my assistant now.

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,740
You don't have to come when I call.

He confiscated
all of our sources of communication

97
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,300
and installed a jammer here.

98
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,980
We can't get out once we come in.

99
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,780

100
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,040

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,549
I didn't get the chance
to send it to him

102
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,709
but I was sharing my location
with him the whole way here.

103
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,340
He should know the area.

104
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,629
Guan Shanhai came prepared.

105
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,140
He planned to switch out
Madam Lan's original painting.

106
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,469
Given this situation,

107
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,389
we'll have to play it by ear.

108
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,220
We mustn't let him get his way.

109
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:42,260
This is the painting
your dad never finished.

110
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,460
I finally got to see it.

111
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,860
You all met Lan Ke earlier today.

112
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,060
She's not someone who's easily fooled.

113
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,429
Every detail in this painting

114
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,580
must be practically identical
to the original.

115
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,300
I believe you can do this.

116
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,949
Take a break

117
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,100
and eat something.

118
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,989
I don't have much time.

119
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,900
I won't make it in time
if I don't hurry.

120
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,340
You still have to eat.

121
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,869
Here.

122
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,980
Let me feed you.

123
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,949
No need.

124
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,709
I can do it myself.

125
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,069
Let your hands rest.

126
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,660
You'll be busy enough later.

127
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,869
Does it taste good?

128
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,869
Yes.

129
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,020
Have another sip.

130
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,060
Xin Yi,

131
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,300
once everything is over,

132
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,460
there's something I want to tell you.

133
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,780
Since when did you learn to
give a heads-up before you do anything?

134
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,789
I'm just trying to stay
a little mysterious.

135
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,300
Anyway, you can look forward to it.

136
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,389
Are you eating or not?

137
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,349
Don't you try
that hunger-strike nonsense with me.

138
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,860
I'll shove it down if I must.

139
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,789
I told you I don't eat scallions.

140
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,909
You think I'm being too nice?

141
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,869
You won't eat this and that.
You're getting picky.

142
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,189
You think this is your own house?

143
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,300
Shut up.

144
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,189
She's the painter I hired.
Show her some respect.

145
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,309
Exactly.

146
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,709
It's just a small thing.

147
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,789
No need to be so rude.

148
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,829
Go over there

149
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,220
and pick the scallion out.

150
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,700
Nice work.

151
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,860
You're not just good-looking,

152
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,980
you're also good at painting.

153
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,740
Once I finish the painting,

154
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,189
let me go.

155
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,340
No worries.

156
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,580
Once you're done with it,

157
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,820
I'll escort you down the mountain
myself.

158
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,180
How will you make Beauty Rouge?

159
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,189
It's my family's secret formula.

160
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,500
I'm not sharing it.

161
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,940
I hope there's no one in the room

162
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,020
when I apply the color.

163
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,700
Since when did the Beauty Rouge

164
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,309
become your family's secret formula?

165
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,429
If we're working together,

166
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,980
don't hold anything back.

167
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,860
Otherwise, we might think
you're up to something.

168
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,389
Given my current situation,

169
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,180
what tricks could I pull?

170
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,580
I just don't want to be distracted
by random people

171
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,100
while I'm painting.

172
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,069
What else do you need?

173
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,349
I'll have someone get it for you.

174
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,109
Like...

175
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,260
No need.

176
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,180
I'll prepare it myself.

177
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,460
All right.

178
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,540
You won't be distracted
during this time.

179
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,860
Guan Huai has been in contact with me
the whole way.

180
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,549
(Linshui Town)
But once he got close to Linshui Town,

181
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,820
I lost the signal.

182
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,309
None of my dad's galleries

183
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,229
is in Linshui Town.

184
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,460
I don't see any possible clue here.

185
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,679
But why does Linshui Town

186
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,359
(Linshui Town)

187
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,500
feel so familiar?

188
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,340
Got it.

189
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,740
Yunzhen Gallery.

190
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,120
(Yunzhen Gallery, Linshui Town
It's in Linshui Town you said.

191
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,949
This is a property under my mom's name.

192
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,820
No wonder I overlooked it.

193
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:48,478
(Yunzhen Gallery)

194
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:51,069
Do you remember
everything I told you just now?

195
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,340
Yes.

196
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,429
Move.

197
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,540
Get to work.

198
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,780
Stone, good morning.

199
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,549
The weather is hot.

200
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,549
Why are you supervising
the security guards yourself?

201
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,549
You must be tired.

202
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,709
Chairman Guan takes
this appraisal event very seriously.

203
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,500
There can't be any mistakes.

204
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,700
Understood.

205
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,380
Let me know
if there's anything I can help with.

206
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,829
All you need to do
is to keep an eye on Xin Yi.

207
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,140
Make sure she finishes
the painting on time.

208
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,049
The first floor is the exhibition hall,
what's upstairs? I haven't been up there yet.

209
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,469
That floor is for female guests.

210
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,820
Is Madam Lan up there, too?

211
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,960
You seem to pay special attention
to Madam Lan.

212
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,949
No.

213
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,069
I'm just asking.

214
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,389
I only saw her once here

215
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,660
last time.

216
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,269
I thought she'd already left.

217
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,160
Chairman Guan said

218
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,829
no one is allowed to disturb
the guests on the second floor.

219
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,260
Besides, there's access control.

220
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,949
You can't get in without a key card.

221
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,100
Understood.

222
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,700
Don't alert anyone.

223
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,229
This is private property.

224
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,420
You can't enter.

225
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,300
Who's outside?

226
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,580
Who's it?

227
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:50,829
Do you know who I am?

228
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,113
This is my mom's house.

229
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:53,389
Why can't I go in?

230
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,540
Xin?

231
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,269
What are you doing here?

232
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,420
Dad,

233
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,589
I was too impulsive before.

234
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,389
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,380
I shouldn't have talked
to you like that.

236
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,060
You were right.

237
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,660
I'm too young

238
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,269
and didn't think much.

239
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,540
I didn't understand
you made the best plan for me.

240
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,340
I've thought it through.

241
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,460
I'll marry Qin Heng.

242
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,020
How did you find this place?

243
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,989
Mom brought me here when I was little,

244
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,740
so I remembered this place.

245
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,180
I wanted to come here to clear my mind.

246
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,100
Back then, Mom said

247
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,549
we'd hold the wedding here

248
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,020
when I got married.

249
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,940
Since you're here,

250
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,820
enjoy yourself here for a few days.

251
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,469
After the appraisal event ends,

252
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,100
I'll arrange the wedding.

253
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,940
This event is very important.

254
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,700
Stay here quietly,

255
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,820
and don't make trouble.

256
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,509
Got it, Dad.

257
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,620
Have some tea.

258
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,340
(Separate the paper into three layers.)

259
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,900
(Paint each layer individually.)

260

(Fei red in the middle.)

262

(Tui red on top.)
