00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,619
I heard from Chairman Guan

4
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,659
that you wanted to see me

5
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,619
and make peace.

6
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,770
Why?

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,619
You heard Guan Huai's back

8
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,570
and gained Chairman Guan's favor,

9
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,890
so you got anxious?

10
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,930
That's right.

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,490
Will you give me a chance?

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,739
You won't even smile at me.

13
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,010
Miss Guan, you don't know
how to ask nicely.

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,570
I was too impulsive before.

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,570
For the sake
of the Guan and Qin families,

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,379
please don't hold this against me,

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,810
and let bygones be bygones.

18
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,290
What makes you think

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,379
I'd want

20
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,850
a woman who cheated on me?

21
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,970
You and all your flings out there.

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,850
I've lost count of how many times
you cheated on me.

23
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,059
Your reputation's already in tatters,

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,330
and you still dare to blame me?

25
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,050
At least I don't play with lowly men

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,770
like you did.

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,130
Of all people,

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,250
why do you have to mess
with that illegitimate son?

29
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,690
You want the Guan family's shares,
don't you?

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,259
Once we're married,

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,730
I'll transfer all my shares to you.

32
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,690
I'll also take care
of the Qin family's debts.

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,130
Do you mean that?

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,850
Are you willing to give up on that?

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,770
Kneel.

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,690
Show me your sincerity.

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,939
You want to show me your sincerity

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,939
but ask me to kneel?

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,050
Kneel.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,650
Give me your hand.

41
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,050
Once I put on this ring for you,
we're family.

42
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,330
From now on, what's mine is yours.

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,939
Let's have a drink

44
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,170
to celebrate.

45
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,290
Chairman Guan doesn't allow drinking
during the appraisal event.

46
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,250
I know

47
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,890
you must've hidden some booze.

48
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,739
I can't believe this fellow

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,050
actually fell for the same trap twice.

50
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,010
I wonder if you're innocent
or just plain stupid?

51
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:54,939
(Yunzhen Gallery)

52
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,379
You're closing the event early?

53
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,139
Madam Lan,

54
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,819
didn't we agree

55
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,019
that it would run for five days?

56
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,720
Why are you backing out
at the last minute?

57
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,490
Chairman Guan,

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,059
I'm so sorry.

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,410
Something came up.

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,499
The painting must be removed

61
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,850
by 6 PM.

62
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,370
Madam Lan,

63
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,330
if you have any concerns,
we can talk through them.

64
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,659
We gathered here

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,970
because we love Chinese painting.

66
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,770
I was hoping we could exchange
more ideas.

67
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,650
Besides, it's not safe
to end the event abruptly.

68
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,090
No need.

69
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,779
I'm the one breaking the agreement.

70
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,450
I'll pay the penalty
as stated in the contract.

71
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,610
I take my leave.

72
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,659
Madam Lan.

73
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,219
Madam Lan.

74
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,850
If you have any requests,
feel free to name them. Madam Lan.

75
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,970
She won't change her mind.

76
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,179
What do we do next?

77
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,410
I must get the painting.

78
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,890
There's still time before 6 PM.

79
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,499
Get ready.

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,930
We move early.

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,299
I'm afraid it's too late.

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,179
We're several days
ahead of schedule now.

83
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,770
Most of our people haven't arrived in town.
We're short on manpower.

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,339
And also Xin Yi.

85
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,650
Has she finished the painting?

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,650
How's the progress?

87
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,979
It's almost done.

88
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,450
Just some final touch-ups.

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,810
Good.

90
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,890
The student becomes the teacher.

91
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,330
Xin Yi,

92
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,250
you've done as well as your dad.

93
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,090
I could say that I'm helping my dad
to complete his unfinished work.

94
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,939
Putting this painting next to the one
in the gallery, they look exactly the same.

95
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,250
Who could tell them apart?

96
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,019
Can the rest

97
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,850
be finished before sunset?

98
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,730
Why the sudden rush?

99
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,770
The plan has changed.

100
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,810
It has to be done before 6 PM.

101
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,730
Dad.

102
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,850
Dad.

103
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,739
Lan Ke suddenly started packing up.

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,130
They're leaving.

105
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,059
No idea

106
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,330
what's wrong with her.

107
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,410
We have to move everything
ahead of schedule.

108
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,099
In that case,

109
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,410
I won't have time to age the painting.

110
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,210
I suspect Lan Ke has
found out something.

111
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,050
If we miss this chance...

112
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,850
We'll do it this evening.

113
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,570
Guan Huai,

114
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,810
you'll follow Stone later.

115
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,930
Don't disappoint me this time.

116
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:44,390
(Yunzhen Gallery)

117
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,290
(Lan Ke has sent her people)

118
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,650
(to pack up "Spring Birds Competing".)

119
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,939
(They'll move it out of Linshui Town
with a truck)

120
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,730
(and head straight to the airport
to board and leave the country.)

121
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,970
(We've planted our men in their convoy)

122
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,930
(to help us before they leave town.)

123
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,739
(I've got a truck ready.)

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,930
(From the appearance
to the license plate,)

125
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,530
(it looks exactly the same
as the one transporting the original.)

126
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,250
(When the time comes,)

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,859
(you'll drive our truck)

128
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,459
(with Xin Yi's painting)

129
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,130
(and follow behind their convoy.)

130
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,650
(There's a fork along the way,)

131
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,770
(make the switch there.)

132
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,899
(Blessing)

133
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,770
Chairman Guan,

134
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,850
the painting is here.

135
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,010
Good job.

136
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,530
Put it here.

137
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,890
The Beauty Rouge is pure and beautiful.

138
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,730
The "Spring Birds Competing"
is stunning and captivating.

139
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,490
Now that I have this painting,

140
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,850
I can die with no regrets.

141
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,219
Others may not see it,

142
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,370
but you definitely would, Chairman Guan.

143
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,370
You purposely painted the deepest part
of the wisteria with azurite instead of lazurite.

144
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,499
This skill is subtle.

145
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,810
If you look closely,

146
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,330
you can still tell
it's from a different era.

147
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,930
Why is it azurite?

148
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,730
It should be lazurite.

149
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,659
Your eyes are sharp, Chairman Guan.

150
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,890
You always catch my flaws.

151
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,650
This is fake.

152
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,059
Where's the original?

153
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,130
Madam Lan took it.

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,490
She should be on the plane by now.

155
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,090
How could it be?

156
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,810
I drove the truck
with the original painting.

157
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,939
No one touched it

158
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,299
after we switched it.

159
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,739
How could it be a fake?

160
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,659
Stone, is it possible that the painting
you were transporting

161
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,379
was actually Xin Yi's replica,

162
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,219
and the one on my truck

163
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,210
was the real "Spring Birds Competing"?

164
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,250
Luckily, we switched along the way.

165
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,490
I was able to safely deliver
the original to the airport.

166
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,610
There were my men in the convoy.

167
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,939
How did you manage all this?

168
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,010
I told Madam Lan

169
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,890
all your plans in advance.

170
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,099
We have evidence

171
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,499
of everything you've done.

172
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,890
We've called the police.

173
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,370
They're on their way.

174
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,930
No wonder she ended the event early.

175
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,130
Why are you doing this?

176
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,259
What do you gain from it?

177
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,410
Dad,

178
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,939
we didn't want you to
keep going down the wrong path.

179
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,010
Wrong?

180
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,690
What did I do wrong?

181
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,170
I just want the "Spring Birds Competing".

182
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,339
This isn't just my obsession,
it's also your mom's favorite.

183
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,179
What's wrong

184
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,410
with what I've done?

185
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,010
If I want something,

186
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,779
as long as it exists in this world,

187
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,259
it can only be mine.

188
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,299
Yun is mine. And so is this painting.

189
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,339
Guan Shanhai,

190
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,899
this was always about you

191
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,890
wanting this painting.

192
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,370
How dare you use my mom

193
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,890
to cover up your own greed?

194
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,179
What she wanted was never
the "Spring Birds Competing".

195
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,459
She wanted to leave you.

196
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,690
She wanted freedom.

197
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,490
It was you

198
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,539
who trapped her
with your fake, disgusting love.

199
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,130
You drove her to her death.

200
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,730
Why did Mom kill herself?

201
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,010
Yun,

202
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,570
this is my gift for you.

203
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,010
This isn't for me.

204
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,930
It isn't for me.

205
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,139
It's a gift you feed your obsession.

206
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,410
How can you say that?

207
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,050
We both like Ma Qingshan's work.

208
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,850
Did you forget?

209
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,970
It was Ma Qingshan
who brought us together.

210
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,650
Didn't you want to see
"Spring Birds Competing"?

211
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,050
I made your wish come true.

212
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,130
You tricked my senior into
going to that factory

213
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,650
just to paint this,

214
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,650
right?

215
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,690
For ten whole years,

216
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,210
I've been searching
for the original "Spring Birds Competing",

217
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,490
but it was never found.

218
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,930
Perhaps it no longer exists.

219
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,370
So I had the factory make a replica.

220
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,139
Your senior knew
how to make Beauty Rouge,

221
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,570
so I asked for his help.

222
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,819
Look.

223
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,970
This red shade

224
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,370
was made from your blood.

225
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,090
Isn't it beautiful?

226
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,610
Only a beauty like you

227
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,730
could make Beauty Rouge so vivid.

228
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,970
Where's my senior?

229
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,770
Where is he?

230
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,939
Where?

231
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,530
He had an accident at the factory.

232
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,130
It's a shame.

233
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,690
If he were still alive,

234
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,450
the painting could've been done
long ago.

235
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,170
Guan Shanhai,

236
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,490
you're terrifying.

237
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,619
Have you no conscience at all?

238
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,250
It's all right, Yun.

239
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,010
I'll find another painter soon

240
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,890
to finish this painting.

241
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,890
You promised me.

242
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,779
If I gave you my blood,

243
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,650
you'd divorce me.

244
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,659
- If I gave you my blood,
- Yun.

245
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,450
you'd divorce me.

246
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,450
I love you so much.

247
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,530
Why would you want to leave?

248
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,290
I won't let you go.

249
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,770
We'll be together forever.

250
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,730
Chairman Guan.

251
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,810
I don't get it.

252
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,619
I love her so much.

253
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,170
Why would she do that?

254
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,850
Why would she rather die
than stay with me?

255
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,050
Yun,

256
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,210
you were too silly.

257
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,099
Dad.

258
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,090
This punch is for Mom.

259
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,090
You still won't admit you were wrong.

260
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,379
You built that counterfeit factory

261
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,459
to create a fake replica.

262
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,730
I had nothing to do with that factory.

263
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,890
I was just a customer.

264
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,770
When I placed the order,

265
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,699
they didn't have a skilled painter,

266
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,770
so I recommended your dad.

267
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,059
Your dad was blinded by money

268
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,730
and got tricked into going.

269
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,450
That factory was involved
in shady dealings

270
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,290
and had been under watch.

271
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,459
After Xin Cheng died,

272
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,699
they immediately moved
the painting to me.

273
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,730
If anything, I'm also a victim.

274
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,059
I paid up,

275
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,730
but all I got was an unfinished piece.

276
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,650
Even though you're not the mastermind,

277
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,290
you're still an accomplice.

278
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,290
What are you trying to do?

279
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,530
No.

280
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,890
Stop it.

281
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,170
This is my dad's final painting.

282
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,859
A fake piece he despised most.

283
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,010
It's also Madam Ming Yun's nightmare.

284
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,010
It shouldn't exist.

285
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,610
Stop it!

286
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,130
Stop!

287
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,290
Dad.

288
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,299
Stop!

289
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,699
Dad.

290
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,779
I'm begging you.

291
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,890
