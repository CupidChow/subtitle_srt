1
00:00:07,558 --> 00:00:14,130
(Fifteen Years Ago)

2
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,450
(M, South East Asia)

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,970
Hello, sir.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,530
Don't you worry.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,450
Everyone is alright
with the goods for Guanhai.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,099
Got it.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,410
We're in this together, after all.

8
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,130
Stand still.

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,410
If you fall down again,

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,570
I won't be able to fix you again.

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,850
This is Mr. Wang's custom-made vase.

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,290
And you broke it, Nong.

13
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,850
Shouldn't you piece it back together?

14
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,410
That's what we call art.

15
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,170
It hurts so bad,

16
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,410
Yi.

17
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,382
=Loving The Lie=

18
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:15,540
=Episode 1=

19
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,019
(My father, Xin Cheng,)

20
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,339
(was once a household name
in Chinese painting.)

21
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,890
(He was known as Cheng Raoshanren.)

22
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,090
(That summer,)

23
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,690
(my father,
who was always busy traveling,)

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,530
(suddenly came home.)

25
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,410
Mr. Guan.

26
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,130
Dad!

27
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,010
Dinner's ready.

28
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,059
Dad.

29
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,499
I've missed you so much.

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,370
I've missed you too.

31
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,899
I'm going somewhere faraway tomorrow

32
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,179
to paint for someone.

33
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,219
But I promise you.

34
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,259
After that,

35
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,099
I'll have enough money

36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,779
to buy you a big house.

37
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,579
Then

38
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,899
I'll always be with you.

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,219
We'll never be apart again?

40
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,419
Yes.

41
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,779
Now let's wash up and eat.

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,770
Okay.

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,930
Let's go!

44
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,579
(The next morning,)

45
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,490
(Father left for the trip.)

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,979
(But we didn't know)

47
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,979
(my little sister
had snuck into the trunk)

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,130
(and left with him.)

49
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,290
(From that day on,)

50
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,890
(there was no word from them.)

51
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,570
(Until...)

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,930
Xin Yi.

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,979
There's news about your dad and sister.

54
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,450
Where are they?

55
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,120
Your dad was tricked
into working at a counterfeit factory.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,690
Your sister was rescued by the police.

57
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,090
But your dad...

58
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,130
He's dead.

59
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,339
(After my sister Nong was rescued,)

60
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,370
(she never spoke again.)

61
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,379
(I looked through the journal)

62
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,650
(she kept at the factory.)

63
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,450
(It's been raining heavily today.)

64
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,850
(I'm both cold)

65
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,210
(and hungry.)

66
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,899
(But that bad guy said)

67
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,539
(if I don't finish
cleaning the brushes,)

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,490
(I don't get to eat.)

69
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,730
(Dad got beaten.)

70
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,130
(It must hurt so, so much.)

71
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,090
(It hurts me too.)

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,010
(The bad guys hit us again.)
(He's so mean,)

73
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,859
(but there'sa pretty red butterfly
on his waist.)

74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,970
(It's such a beautiful butterfly.)

75
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,450
(Why doesn't it fly away?)

76
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,459
(All suspects at the factory)

77
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,579
(were arrested then.)

78
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,179
(All except)

79
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,530
(the bad guy mentioned
in my sister's journal.)

80
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,299
(The police said)

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,259
(this person doesn't exist.)

82
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,899
(But Nong would never lie.)

83
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,970
(And this blood-stained journal
doesn't lie either.)

84
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,219
(I've been investigating it in secret)

85
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,930
(and every clue
points to the Guan family.)

86
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,699
(Is Guan Shanhai)

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,120
(Suspects involved)
(the mastermind of the counterfeit factory?)

88
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,620
(in counterfeit goods case)
(How did my father die in that factory?)

89
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,130
(And the key to the truth)

90
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,450
(is that painting.)

91
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:16,579
(The last painting Father did
before he died in that factory)

92
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,690
(was Ma Qingshan's
"Spring Birds Competing.")

93
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:26,700
(Guan Shanhai,
Chairman of Guanhai Group)

94
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,720
Things will be easier
after your eldest child gets married.

95
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,419
Xin.

96
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,170
Uncle Li.

97
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,659
Once you're engaged,

98
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,059
I will be waiting
to attend your wedding banquet.

99
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,979
Once you're married,

100
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,610
you won't have time
to worry about Guanhai anymore.

101
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,779
You're a woman.

102
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,410
There's no point for you

103
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,219
to be competitive in the business world.

104
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,899
Just get married and have a baby.

105
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,579
Your dad wants a grandchild.

106
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,539
Exactly.

107
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,299
Your brother's not that young anymore.

108
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,530
He'll have to take over
the company sooner or later.

109
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,379
He's not exactly capable.

110
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,739
I hope you all can keep an eye on him.

111
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,699
Sure.

112
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,090
The guests have arrived.

113
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,450
I know you.

114
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,930
The youngest Gold Award winner
at the Hundred Flowers Awards,

115
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,130
Xin Yi.

116
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,570
Besides your interest in painting,

117
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,210
I didn't expect you
to be interested in my fiancé too.

118
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,890
I'm not interested in Mr. Qin.

119
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,330
I'm interested in you.

120
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,650
The CEO of Guanhai Group,

121
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,210
Guan Xin.

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,730
I never beat around the bush.

123
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,410
Are you really going
to marry such a man, Miss Guan?

124
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,410
You've sacrificed so much
for the sake of Guanhai.

125
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,379
But once you're married,

126
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,610
will there still be a place
for you here?

127
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,179
I believe

128
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,419
you wouldn't

129
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,819
be willing

130
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,450
to hand over everything
you worked so hard to build.

131
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,019
You're well informed.

132
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,130
But what does it have to do with you?

133
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,050
I can help you.

134
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,259
If a playboy like Mr. Qin

135
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,539
gets caught in a scandal

136
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,650
at his own engagement party,

137
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,739
will the marriage still go through?

138
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,339
He'll be humiliated

139
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,050
and the Guans will lose face.

140
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,579
You care about the Guans' reputation,

141
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,730
but not your own future?

142
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,570
If you help me,

143
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,410
what do you get out of it?

144
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,979
(Spend a small sum of money)

145
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,370
(to get rid of a big problem.)

146
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,370
(It's a steal)

147
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,730
(for you.)

148
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,287
(Fangfei Garden)
(My father used to live)

149
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:43,890
(in the Fangfei Garden at the back.)

150
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,449
(Qin Heng's lounge is located)

151
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,364
(on the second floor,)

152
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,480
(first room on the right corner.)

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,450
Yun.

154
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,730
Our daughter's getting engaged today.

155
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,730
If you were still around,

156
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,610
you'd be so delighted.

157
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,130
There's also your favorite painting.

158
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,450
After all these years,

159
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,840
I finally found the right painter
to do it.

160
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,250
I believe it'll be finished soon.

161
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,130
Yun.

162
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,050
I will

163
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,170
keep my word.

164
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,659
(Pardon me, Miss Guan.)

165
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,699
(Before I help you
deal with your fiancé,)

166
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,010
(I have something more important to do.)

167
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,819
(I heard there's a secret underground room
in the Guans' residence.)

168
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,330
(The "Spring Birds Competing"
might be there.)

169
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:01,450
(File Box, Ma Qingshan)

170
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,130
(Group File Coding Rules)

171
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,459
You!

172
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,610
You!

173
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,050
Quiet down.

174
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,779
Who are you?

175
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,130
Let go of me!

176
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,179
Be good

177
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,090
and we'll have some fun.

178
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,050
Sure.

179
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,290
Then let go of me first.

180
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,010
Guan Huai!

181
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,570
What are you doing here?

182
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,890
What else could it be?

183
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,090
I was getting cozy
with this pretty girl I just met.

184
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,019
Please knock on the door
next time, will you?

185
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,330
You rascal!

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,650
Pretty lady.
