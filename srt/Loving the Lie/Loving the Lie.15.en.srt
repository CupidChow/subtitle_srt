=Loving The Lie=

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,610
I knew you would invite me over for tea.

4
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,370
You're as smart as your dad.

5
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,330
I should've guessed it.

6
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,859
Other than Xin Cheng's daughter,

7
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,610
no one else could possibly

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,090
produce the Beauty Rouge.

9
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,010
Looks like you know it all.

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,210
Your dad and I went way back.

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,610
He painted for me long ago.

12
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,739
I bet you wouldn't mind me
following in his footsteps, right?

13
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,850
Of course not.

14
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,459
If you had told me who you were sooner,

15
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,939
I wouldn't have given Xu Ru the job.

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,410
You're the most qualified one
to complete your dad's unfinished work.

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,850
Then when can I start?

18
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,090
Tomorrow.

19
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,090
Nong.

20
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,410
I can't visit you today.

21
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,890
Tomorrow,

22
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,530
I'll get to see Dad's painting.

23
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,690
Your birthday is around the corner.

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,890
Once everything is over,

25
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,690
I'll celebrate it with you.

26
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,930
The boat is at the dock.

27
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,339
Get in the car.

28
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,099
Chairman Guan,

29
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,930
are we painting on the boat?

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,370
It's too bumpy on board,
so it's not very convenient,

31
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,619
The sea has been calm these days.

32
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,699
It's nothing but peaceful.
Most importantly, it's safe.

33
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,930
No one will disturb you.

34
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,130
Once the painting is done,

35
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,010
the boat will return the same way.

36
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,610
(Could the Golden House be on the boat?)

37
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,779
Dad. There's something wrong with her.

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,090
What are you doing here?

39
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,410
Leave!

40
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,059
Her hand is injured,
so she can't even hold a brush.

41
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,370
She's not here to paint at all.

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,290
Guan Huai.

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,530
We can deal
with our relationship problem privately.

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,650
Don't play games like this.

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,139
It's getting late,

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,059
Chairman Guan.

47
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,410
Let's head out.

48
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,219
If you don't believe me,

49
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,530
you can search her
for recording devices.

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,690
Just to be safe.

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,010
Please pardon me.

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,379
Xin Yi.

53
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,450
Get in the car!

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,890
Give chase!

55
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,299
Come back!

56
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,979
Chase her by car!

57
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,970
Yes, sir!

58
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,850
Yes, sir!

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,739
Split up.

60
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,619
You go straight.

61
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,770
I'll go this way.

62
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:16,360
(Suspects involved
in counterfeit goods case)

63
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,690
Dad.

64
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,659
I'm sorry,

65
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,419
but I lost her.

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,450
I even fell off the bike from the speeding.

67
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,650
Guan Huai.

68
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,250
Though you're my son,

69
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,530
truth be told,

70
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,930
sometimes I don't understand you.

71
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,090
Dad.

72
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,259
I used to be reckless

73
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,530
and willful.

74
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,139
I was young

75
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,370
and didn't know better.

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,450
I was being immature.

77
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,210
I did a lot of things
that broke your heart.

78
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,010
I know I was wrong.

79
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,490
What are you trying to pull now?

80
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,010
Dad.

81
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,610
I haven't been through much in my life.

82
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,419
But I've realized one thing
over these years.

83
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,779
Those with no money or power

84
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,410
live worse than stray dogs.

85
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,690
If I'd figured that out sooner,

86
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,499
everything in Guanhai
and our family would be mine.

87
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,450
I approached Xin Yi from the start

88
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,259
because of her talent.

89
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,659
I wanted to present her to you

90
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,130
as a way of pleasing you.

91
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,730
I really didn't expect her

92
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,690
to harbor ill intentions.

93
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,450
Dad.

94
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,970
Seriously, I know I was wrong.

95
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,250
I'm begging you.

96
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,059
I beg of you.

97
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,210
I beg you, please.

98
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,930
Please give me one more chance.

99
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,010
If you still consider me your son,

100
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,330
I'll do as you say.

101
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,010
Anything?

102
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,410
Anything.

103
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,850
Bring Xin Yi back to me.

104
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,579
Her hand is already ruined.

105
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,970
She can't paint anymore.

106
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,210
I'll find someone better for you.

107
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,530
I only want her!

108
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,520
Why are we here?

109
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,779
(Just fix two wheels)
(One is fine too)

110
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,139
They've figured out where I live.

111
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,819
Heading back there

112
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,610
is like walking into a trap.

113
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,170
Then why not stay at my place?

114
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,779
The most dangerous place
is the safest one.

115
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,259
They'd never guess

116
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,570
I'd hide in Guan Huai's repair garage.

117
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,130
Plus, I know
where he always leaves the key here.

118
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,539
Today, I got word

119
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,779
that you were in danger.

120
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,490
I was told to get you out immediately.

121
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,539
I rushed over

122
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,970
before I got to think through it.

123
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,570
But I didn't expect

124
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,339
that would happen.

125
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,050
Who sent you the message?

126
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,790
(Xin Yi is in danger.
Come to the gate of Qi Garden now.)

127
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,570
Did you try calling the number back?

128
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,450
I did.

129
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,690
It's a virtual number.

130
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,530
A virtual number?

131
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,779
Don't worry.

132
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,130
I'll keep digging into this.

133
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,419
Oh, right.

134
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,819
What happened with you and Guan Huai?

135
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,290
Why the sudden fallout?

136
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,779
He knew who I was from the get-go.

137
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,579
He got close to me

138
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,050
just to use me
to paint for Guan Shanhai.

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,259
Now that my hand is injured,

140
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,659
he just sold me out

141
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,419
to gain Guan Shanhai's trust.

142
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,690
Your hand's injured?

143
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,850
Where?

144
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,410
Why didn't you tell me?

145
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,419
Considering that situation,

146
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,410
the fewer who knew, the better.

147
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,530
Besides, I didn't want you
worrying about me.

148
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,850
You paint with this hand.

149
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,899
Was it even

150
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,050
worth it?

151
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,819
Yes.

152
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,490
And I've never regretted it.

153
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,450
Rest assured.

154
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,019
My hand will be fine.

155
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,930
It'll recover soon.

156
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,250
Despite Guan Huai's interference,

157
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,770
I still think there's still a chance.

158
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,019
Guan Shanhai may not trust me,

159
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,739
but he won't give up on that painting

160
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,410
and Beauty Rouge.

161
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,170
Xin Yi.

162
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,499
I know you don't want me involved

163
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,090
or to worry about you.

164
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,770
But I'm already part of all this.

165
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,770
Besides, I have my own reasons too.

166
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,810
From now on,

167
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,890
I'll walk this path with you.

168
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,890
Dad.

169
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,810
What does this transfer order mean?

170
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,890
Guan Huai will be in charge
of Qi Garden.

171
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,810
Vice President Guo
will oversee the company.

172
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,979
You don't need to do anything right now.
Just focus on the wedding.

173
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,130
Dad!

174
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,810
I don't want to get married.

175
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,770
You're all grown-up.

176
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,219
Stop being willful.

177
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,690
I'm serious.

178
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,179
I've wanted to say this for a while.

179
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,130
I don't like Qin Heng.

180
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,930
I want to call the wedding off.

181
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,250
You've always been obedient.

182
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,290
Why are you so defiant now?

183
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,179
I have to obey and be sensible

184
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,610
when it comes to my love affair.

185
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,179
My whole life,

186
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,539
I've done everything you told me to.

187
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,699
I did everything perfectly

188
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,859
and came first at everything

189
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,050
just to win your approval!

190
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,259
But even so,

191
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,130
you were never satisfied.

192
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,890
I'm well aware

193
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,730
it's because I'm a daughter.

194
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,170
Thus, I will never be able
to make you satisfied.

195
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,619
My best thing I can do
is to sell myself off

196
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,530
to gain some meager profit
for our family!

197
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,619
But you picked the wrong buyer!

198
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,410
The Qin family is nothing but rotten!

199
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,459
I'm not getting married!

200
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,579
This deal is a mere loss!

201
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,890
Are you done?

202
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,139
Did you know

203
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,570
your secretary, Qin Shen

204
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,730
had ruined all my plans?

205
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,010
Instead of overthinking here,

206
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,290
you should manage your man well!

207
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,090
Guan Huai!

208
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,139
Didn't we already part ways?

209
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,810
Why are you still coming to me?

210
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,259
You're pretty tough.

211
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,019
Why?

212
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,410
Sticking up for Xin Yi, huh?

213
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,610
What exactly are you trying to do?

214
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,099
I'm just helping her.

215
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,890
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

216
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,659
Have you ever considered it?

217
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,819
If she got on that boat,

218
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,770
would she come off in one piece?

219
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,299
Guan Shanhai isn't some benevolent man.

220
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,019
Once he's used her,
he'll toss her in the sea.

221
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,179
Even the gods can't save her.

222
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,259
And yet here you are,

223
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,979
playing a dutiful son.

224
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,419
So stop acting like some savior!

225
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,459
Yes!

226
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,099
I'm the Guan family's young master again.

227
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,570
So, why would I care about anyone else?

228
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,930
You jerk.

229
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,850
I was born this way.

230
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,019
What about you?

231
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,859
Go ahead
and hide her to the ends of the earth.

232
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,019
Just don't let me find her.

233
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,859
If not,

234
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,290
don't blame me for what I'd do.

235
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,650
Guan Huai!

236
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,930
Dad.

237
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,379
I really can't locate her.

238
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,050
She's too good at hiding.

239
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,499
I've turned Chaoyun Town upside down,

240
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,290
but there's still no sign of her.

241
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,500
Do you think she might have left town?

242
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,999
We've got our men keeping an eye
on the airport and train station.

243
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,290
She can't get away.

244
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,250
The appraisal event is approaching.

245
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,899
You have three days.

246
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,490
Find her, no matter what.

247
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,370
Dad.

248
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,259
I think we shouldn't
cause too much noise.

249
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,730
We don't want any unnecessary trouble.

250
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,579
Dad.

251
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,019
I know an old painter.

252
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,619
His skills rival Xin Yi's.

253
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,899
He just can't replicate Beauty Rouge,

254
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,619
but he can get close.

255
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,810
I'll send for him now...

256
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,459
Like I said,

257
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,730
I only want Xin Yi.

258
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,819
Chairman Guan.

259
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,970
Young Master.

260
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,779
Stone.

261
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,890
What brings you here?

262
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,330
You're back.

263
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,499
I had Stone return to help you find her.

264
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,330
Huh?

265
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,459
I can manage that, Dad.

266
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,739
Stone is usually busy.

267
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,019
Why make him work overtime?

268
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,930
As long as Chairman Guan doesn't mind,

269
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,690
I'm always ready.

270
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,659
Young people are unreliable.

271
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,290
I hope you'll assist him.

272
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,730
All I want is Beauty Rouge.

273
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,890
Once you find Xin Yi,

274
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,970
it's good if she cooperates.

275
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,530
If she doesn't...

276
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,290
Go.

277
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,850
