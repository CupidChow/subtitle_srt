=Episode 3=

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,731
(M, South East Asia)

4
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,599
I'm begging you.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,959
Don't lock me in.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,959
Please.

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,079
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,990
Please.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,639
Why didn't you behave just now?

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,510
Didn't we agree

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,070
that when you see your dad,
you have to smile

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,830
and say that you're happy
and doing great?

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,590
How could you cry?

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,030
Don't lock me in.

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,959
Please don't.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,239
I'm begging you.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,439
Please.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,359
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,270
Don't lock me in.

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,679
I hate it when people cry.

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,430
Don't lock me in!

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,879
Please don't!

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,439
Don't lock me in!

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,070
I'm begging you!

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,870
It's my fault!

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,310
Help!

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,030
It's my fault!

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,190
I'm sorry!

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,830
I'm sorry!

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,070
Let me out!

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,190
Coming.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,630
Hi.

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,830
I'm here to deliver flowers.

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,870
Qin Shen.

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,639
You always bring Roselily
every time you come.

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,519
Today's bouquet is the most beautiful.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,790
I know you like them.

38
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,959
Your brother Qin Heng
is marrying Guan Xin.

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,559
The Qin family must be busy.

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,030
How do you have time to come?

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,990
Even though my surname is Qin,

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,390
I'm not really one of them.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,470
I wasn't invited

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,390
to the engagement ceremony last time.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,399
You've had a hard time
with the Qin family,

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,190
yet you've always helped me.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,839
You also admitted Nong

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,150
to a good hospital.

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,790
Qin Shen,

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,590
thank you.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,239
We grew up together,

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,599
and Nong is your sister,

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,999
so she's my sister too.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,039
It feels distant

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,550
when you thank me, doesn't it?

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,990
Oh right.

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,270
Nong wrote you a letter.

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,670
She still won't meet people?

59
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,950
She's getting better now,

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,719
but she still refuses to meet people

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,360
(To my dearest sister)
or talk to anyone.

62
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:26,016
She says she's started to forget

63
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:27,990
the painful past.

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,550
Actually,

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,150
you could try to let go,

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,510
like she did.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,790
Nong can,

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,670
but I can't.

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,870
I don't have the right to do so.

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,270
I'm fully responsible

71
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,470
for what happened to her.

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,790
All these years,

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,670
the reason that keeps me going

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,679
is to uncover the truth

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,830
and make the Guan family pay
for what they did.

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,270
So,

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,830
how can I forget?

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,870
If you insist,

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,790
I'll help you.

80
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,070
You've done more than enough.

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,119
I don't want to drag you
into this mess again.

82
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,270
But...

83
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,479
Hello?

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,919
Time waits for no one.
When will you start painting?

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,959
If you keep putting it off

86
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,239
and won't work with me,

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,310
let's end it.

88
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,119
If you ask me to imitate
Ma Qingshan's painting,

89
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,190
you should at least show me
his actual pieces.

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,319
You should've told me earlier.

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,870
They're in that old man's studio.
Look or touch them all you want.

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,950
So?

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,470
("Spring Birds Competing"
isn't here.)

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,679
I heard Chairman Guan has
a collection hall called the Golden House.

95
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,790
It houses many masterpieces.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,199
He has several galleries
storing his collection.

97
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,639
As for the Golden House you mentioned.

98
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,639
That old man is crafty.

99
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,310
No one knows where it is.

100
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,519
My collection hall is just upstairs.

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,359
Go take a look.

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,350
What do we do?

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,990
Go over there.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,519
No.

105
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,430
Quick.

106
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,030
Don't make a sound.

107
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,990
The only one who could own
so many of Ma Qingshan's artworks

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,750
is you, Chairman Guan.

109
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,270
I've searched for them over the years.

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,030
Take a good look.

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,190
They'll help you with your work.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,670
Thick and sturdy bamboo.

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,670
Fine yet powerful branches.

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,550
Though it's heavy snowfall,

115
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,990
it's full of life.

116
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,910
Right.

117
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,990
This was her favorite piece.

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,550
Your late wife?

119
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,870
Yes.

120
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,110
Looks like she and I
have similar tastes.

121
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,910
I was wondering why
this old man came here at this hour.

122
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,030
Turns out it's because of this copycat.

123
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,150
I'm sorry!

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,310
Let me out!

125
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,799
Please let me out!

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,430
(Nong was trapped in the darkness
again and again.)

127
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,519
(And now,)

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,279
(I'm sharing her fear, too.)

129
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,350
I'm sorry!

130
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,430
What's wrong?

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,110
It's getting late.

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,430
Let's leave.

133
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,959
They're gone.

134
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,790
Should we go out first?

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,190
You scared me.

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,390
How many times do I have to tell you

137
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,110
not to enter my collection hall?

138
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,159
Wait.

139
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,159
You can bring women here,

140
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,199
but I can't?

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,159
Don't worry.

142
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,879
I won't burn your treasures.

143
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,559
How dare you...

144
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,590
Chairman Guan,

145
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,239
I asked Guan Huai to bring me here
to see the paintings.

146
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,430
I want to apply for the painter's job.

147
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,950
I remember

148
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,270
you didn't pass the interview.

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,599
No.

150
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,919
I didn't do well

151
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,519
and disappointed you.

152
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,119
I heard that you're a big fan
of Ma Qingsheng's art.

153
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,599
I can replicate his style

154
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,879
and create a new piece.

155
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,310
Lots of people imitate him.

156
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,230
What makes you think you can?

157
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,350
I can make it very convincing.

158
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,399
Young lady,

159
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,790
you sound confident.

160
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,359
Whether or not I'm bragging,

161
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,430
you can test me and find out.

162
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,390
Two days.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,710
Don't disappoint me.

164
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,039
Instead of painting at home,

165
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,279
you came out just to buy this?

166
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,439
It's upside down.

167
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,039
This painting is lame.

168
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,719
It doesn't matter how it looks.

169
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,879
What I need is the paper.

170
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,919
Your dad is an expert.

171
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,399
To make the painting more convincing,

172
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,919
I need old paper

173
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,639
and pigments made from natural stones.

174
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,119
That makes pretty much sense.

175
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,830
Are you good at appraising?

176
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,350
I just know the basics.

177
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,030
Do you think

178
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,590
this is real or fake?

179
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,359
This?

180
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,510
Mister,

181
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,079
watch your word.

182
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,479
Everything here is authentic.

183
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,470
If you don't believe me,
look at this. This one.

184
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,719
Take a look.

185
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,630
The flower

186
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,799
and its color.

187
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,599
It can't be a fake.

188
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,959
Come.

189
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,870
Take a look.

190
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,430
Oh no.

191
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,399
You're careless. This is an artifact
from the late Ming dynasty.

192
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,279
You actually broke

193
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,879
a fine piece like this.

194
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,679
Wait.

195
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,639
You dropped it yourself.

196
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,679
Why are you blaming me?

197
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,480
What do you mean
by "I dropped it myself"?

198
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,580
You dropped my bowl.

199
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,880
This is a blue-and-white porcelain bowl from
a famous kiln during the late Ming dynasty.

200
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,999
Judging by its appearance,
it's worth 120,000 on the market.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,519
Pay up.

202
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,630
You have to pay.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,879
Interesting.

204
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,119
He's trying to scam me.

205
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,479
Jeez.

206
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,910
Do you know who I am?

207
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,999
Mister,

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,199
it's a misunderstanding.

209
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,999
How about this?

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,159
We'll give you 500 yuan,

211
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,719
and you let this slide, is that okay?

212
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,039
We won't want to make things worse,

213
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,150
right?

214
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,390
500?

215
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,439
Listen up.

216
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,759
I have high blood pressure,

217
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,639
heart disease,

218
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,679
and hormone imbalance.

219
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,390
Don't you stress me out.

220
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,719
80,000.

221
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,079
Not a dime less.

222
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,039
Listen.

223
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,550
She says it's worth 500,
so it's worth 500.

224
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,990
Stop faking illness.

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,679
The floating blue flower pattern

226
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,559
is obviously done with synthetic cobalt.

227
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,999
Everything you have here
isn't worth even 80,000.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,110
Nonsense!

229
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,359
Come.

230
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,159
Neighbors and folks,

231
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,039
ladies and gentlemen,

232
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,239
everyone.

233
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,719
Come and take a look.

234
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,599
They're bullies.

235
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,319
They claimed that all my things here

236
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
aren't worth even 80,000.

237
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,990
How about this?
Let me show you this piece.

238
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,039
This piece.

239
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,119
Come and have a look.

240
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,639
Do you know what it is?

241
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,479
This is the Aztec bronze goblet

242
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,999
of the Mayan civilization.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,999
Both the goblet and bowl

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,119
are porcelain.

245
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,310
Porcelain?

246
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,519
Listen to the sound.

247
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,279
Does it sound like porcelain?

248
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,959
If it is,

249
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,870
I'll swallow it right here.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,119
Do you have hearing issues?

251
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,950
Go see a doctor.

252
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,199
It's really porcelain.

253
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,390
Look.

254
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,279
It looks so real.

255
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,599
This is a scam shop!

256
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,359
You're barking at the right tree.

257
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,399
Scam shop!

258
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,279
Scam shop!

259
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,559
This is a scam shop!

260
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,359
Buddies,

261
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,359
come out.

262
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,910
Scam shop!

263
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,590
What are you looking at? Let's go.

264
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,870
Guan Huai.

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,830
Don't be scared.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,079
Buddies,

267
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,199
that tall guy.

268
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,550
Get him!

269
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,310
He's tall.

270
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,030
So what?

271
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,110
Go.

272
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,830
After him!

273
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,750
Stop right there.

274
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,270
Out of the way!

275
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,070
Hold me tight.

276
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,990
Don't let him get away.

277
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,919
Why? Are you scared?

278
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,319
What's there to be scared of?

279
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,759
Right.

280
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,399
With me around,

281
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,839
there's nothing to be scared of.

282
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,759
Look,

283
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,830
the rainbow is following us.

284
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,360
(A Big Repair Garage)

285
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,136
What are you doing?

286
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:16,159
You sprayed me.

287
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,999
I'm washing the car.

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,510
Look, it's dirty.

289
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,759
Luckily, the cop showed up in time.

290
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,799
That scammer's stuff was so fake.

291
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,430
It's clearly robbery.

292
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,999
You smashed the goblet without thinking.

293
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,190
What if I misjudged it?

294
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,670
Who would put a real treasure out
like junk?

295
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,279
You're pretty dirty.

296
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,150
Let me wash you off.

297
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,550
Guan Huai.

298
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,430
Stop it.

299
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,394
No.

300
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:52,910
