Run?

Trying to run?

Run all you want!

Run on!

Run!

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,720
Darn it.

00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,960
Come, Nong.

00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,320
Wipe the blood off my shoes.

00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,320
You know what?

15
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,569
This is what you get
when you try to run.

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,960
Even the toughest bug can't leave here.

Mr. Liao,

26
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,960
are you home?

27
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,769
I called you before.

28
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,640
I asked if you could paint something
for me.

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,209
Okay.

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,440
I'll come by now.

31
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,960
Chairman Guan?

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,209
I wonder how's your painting going,
Miss Xin?

33
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,680
You don't mind if we watch, don't you?

34
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,169
Junior,

35
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm looking forward to seeing your work.

36
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,520
(People always say)

37
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,649
(that time heals everything.)

38
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,129
(It didn't heal me.)

39
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,089
(Instead, it let my hatred)

40
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,160
(drive me crazy.)

41
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,400
(Every time I pick up a brush,)

42
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,249
(it reminds me of the pain and despair)

43
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,720
(my sister and dad went through.)

44
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,040
Dad!

45
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,809
Dad!

46
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,280
Dad!

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,360
(Calm down.)

48
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,689
(Just calm down.)

49
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,280
(These are only hallucinations.)

50
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,000
(This is the only chance.)

51
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,880
(I mustn't miss it.)

52
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,240
(2:55 PM)

53
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,489
Tell Qin Heng

54
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,280
I'll only wait until 3 PM.

55
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,529
Miss Guan,

56
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,609
should we cancel the shoot
that was scheduled earlier?

57
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,249
No need for a refund. Just cancel it.

58
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,200
Okay.

59
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,680
Good. One, two, three.

60
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,529
Well done.

61
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,600
Nice.

62
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,680
Who are you?

63
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,369
I'm Qin Heng's younger brother,
Qin Shen.

64
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,369
He got held up today,

65
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,040
so he sent me over to keep you company.

66
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,320
You're the illegitimate son
the family just acknowledged.

67
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,440
From what I know,

68
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,560
you two are at each other's throats.

69
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,080
No way Qin Hen
would send you to meet me.

70
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,129
He's probably in some woman's bed

71
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,600
and hasn't woken up, right?

72
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,320
You're right.

73
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,769
He never intended to come.

74
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,249
I thought it was rude,

75
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,049
so I decided

76
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,489
to come in his place.

77
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,960
I don't want him to affect
the relationship between our families.

78
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,249
So, if there's anything I can do,

79
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,600
I'll do my best.

80
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,929
If so, please tell him

81
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,520
that I want to call off the engagement.

82
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,080
We can negotiate the terms.

83
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,880
Tell him to come find me
once he's ready.

84
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm afraid Chairman Guan
wouldn't agree to that.

85
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,640
Sure.

86
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,840
Please leave the contact number
of your assistant.

87
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,000
My assistant resigned.

88
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,240
Just contact me.

89
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,649
Miss Guan,

90
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,529
the ring is ready.

91
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,280
Would you like to try it on?

92
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,400
Beautiful things are never guilty.

93
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,360
It suits you very well.

94
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,200
Am I close to you?

95
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,230
(3 PM)

96
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,240
I don't need beautiful trash.

97
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,969
Ma Qingshan never painted rain scenes.

98
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,089
Although I was only imitating him,

99
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,009
I still took a bold step.

100
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,920
Even if you show this to others,

101
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,640
no one can tell
whether it's real or fake.

102
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,649
Others might not be able to,

103
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,160
but you definitely would, Chairman Guan.

104
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,209
You chose to paint
the deepest part of the wisteria

105
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,529
with azurite

106
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,000
instead of lazurite.

107
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,849
This skill is subtle.

108
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,920
If you look closely,

109
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,440
you can still tell
it's from a different era.

110
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,609
(She's skilled,)

111
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,889
(but why did she make this mistake
during the interview?)

112
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,680
(Why didn't she expose me?)

113
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,240
(Xin Yi,)

114
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,640
(what are you up to?)

115
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,240
What a shame.

116
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,160
I've already found a painter.

117
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,320
You're a little late.

118
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,489
You misunderstood me.

119
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,249
I don't mean to compete with my senior.

120
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,560
I just want a chance to learn.

121
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,809
If possible,

122
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,489
I'd love to assist her.

123
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't need an assistant.

124
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,880
Xin Yi,

125
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,840
with your skills,

126
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,320
you'll have plenty of opportunities.

127
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,040
But I don't have good opportunities

128
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,649
or someone like you

129
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,200
who truly appreciates my work.

130
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,720
You're ambitious.

131
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,240
I like that.

132
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,249
Come to Qi Garden tomorrow

133
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,280
and work with Xu Ru.

134
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,840
Thank you, Chairman Guan.

135
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,520
I knew I was right about you.

136
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,449
You've won that old man over

137
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,160
in no time.

138
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,440
Were you playing the harmonica earlier?

139
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,200
I bought it from a street store
just now. Just for fun.

140
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,200
I came to see if there was anything
I could help with,

141
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,120
I didn't expect the old man to show up
in person.

142
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,729
Nice painting.

143
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,569
It's way better
than those street scammers'.

144
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,409
I like it.

145
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,640
Can I have it?

146
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,160
A fake

147
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,840
shouldn't exist.

148
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,520
A fake

149
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,480
shouldn't exist.

150
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:20,780
(A Big Repair Garage)

151
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,489
Her condition keeps changing.

152
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,289
She was fine when she last wrote to you.

153
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,369
But now she's scared of
light and people.

154
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,249
Just take a look at her
through the veil.

155
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,080
Don't startle her.

156
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,520
Thank you.

157
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,760
Nong.

158
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,849
Nong,

159
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,440
I came to see you.

160
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,120
Nong,

161
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,840
I received your letter.

162
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,409
You asked me why

163
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,120
I haven't drawn anything for you
for so long.

164
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,769
Actually, I couldn't draw

165
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,680
because of some reasons.

166
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,409
But now I think I've found a way

167
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,560
that might help.

168
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:38,358
The person who made me unable to paint
was him.

169
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,840
But the person who helps me paint again
is also him.

170
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,600
The person you hate the most

171
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,000
control everything
you were once proud of.

172
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,960
How funny.

173
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,369
Anyway, Nong,

174
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,600
don't worry.

175
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,129
I'll end all of this very soon.

176
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,929
Then, I'll take you home,

177
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,080
okay?

178
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,200
Nong,

179
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,440
