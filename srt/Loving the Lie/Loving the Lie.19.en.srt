00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,550
I always knew

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,670
you'd find out sooner or later.

5
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,350
I just didn't expect it to be now.

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,190
Xin Yi,

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,070
I'll tell you

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,310
the truth behind that diary.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,830
May I?

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,366
(M, South East Asia)

11
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:30,679
This brat has been sneaking around here.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,679
I saw him yesterday

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,950
but couldn't catch him.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,239
While they were burying the tiles
earlier today, he poked his head out,

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,910
and they grabbed him right away.

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,070
Who are you?

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,830
You know what this place is?

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,959
I...

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,470
I was passing by.

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,599
Give...

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,830
Give it back to me.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,799
Trying to call the police?

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,390
You're faking the artifacts.

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,110
I must report you!

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,439
This place is beyond the law.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,710
Calling the police is pointless.

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,479
A young brat

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,190
wants to play hero?

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,430
Let me teach you a lesson.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,670
Beat him.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,990
Stop.

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,799
Not too rough.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,110
He's still useful.

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,870
Wang,

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,470
what should we do with this brat?

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,519
We're short on workers.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,830
Put him to work.

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,350
Okay.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,359
Big brother,

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,710
are you all right?

41
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,790
I'm fine.

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,190
Not dead yet.

43
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,039
Did they catch you too?

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,710
They are bad guys.

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,079
Little girl,

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,279
what are you doing here?

47
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,439
I'm Nong.

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,119
They caught me and my dad.

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,759
They're making my dad paint.

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,910
We can't leave until he finishes.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,710
A bunch of punks.

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,230
Big brother.

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,279
Big brother, your butterfly is injured.

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,559
Here.

55
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,230
Let me patch it up.

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,790
It'll get better soon.

57
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,070
(Why does it smell like blood?)

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,439
What are you looking at?

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,590
Get lost.

60
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,230
When you see your dad later,

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,959
behave well,

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,190
understand?

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,079
I'm so kind to you,

64
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,590
cheer up.

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,950
Dad.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,630
Nong,

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,790
did they bully you?

68
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,119
Enough nonsense.

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,510
Great painter,

70
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,959
your daughter is doing great.

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,550
We feed her well
and take good care of her.

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,750
What else are you unhappy about?

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,270
Don't think about nonsense.

74
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,039
I take care of your daughter,

75
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,630
and you focus on the painting.

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,710
By the way,

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,510
The Boss mentioned the Beauty...

78
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,359
Oh.

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,470
Pig!

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,479
No, not that.

81
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,270
Wang.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,310
The Boss said the Beauty Rouge

83
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,510
must be painted using human blood.

84
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,590
I noticed you haven't used

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,470
the blood we've been sending regularly.

86
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,950
Beauty Rouge isn't human blood.

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,239
I don't need that.

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,830
It's not about what you need.

89
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,519
It's the Boss's decision.

90
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,879
It's what the client requests.

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,870
The client is God.

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,070
Don't you go against God.

93
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,119
If you don't paint it exactly the same

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,399
using human blood,

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,879
I'll pour it out.

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,030
Pour it out.

97
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,630
Or else, it stinks up the place.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,670
Like what we agreed.

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,399
When you finish the painting,

100
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,590
I'll let you and your daughter go.

101
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,879
Dad!

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,399
Let go.

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,839
Dad!

104
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,599
Let go.

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,479
Don't take her away.

106
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,399
Let go.

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,839
Nong!

108
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,679
Dad!

109
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,119
Nong!

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,079
Dad!

111
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,510
- Come here.
- Dad!

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,350
Dad!

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,590
Come here.

114
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,710
Focus on your painting.

115
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,679
Dad!

116
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,150
Dad!

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,070
Dad!

118
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,879
Nong!

119
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,910
Stay still.

120
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,110
Dad!

121
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,239
Dad!

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,310
Shut up.

123
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,639
I told you to behave,
but you won't listen.

124
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,830
You'll see how I deal with you later.

125
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,390
Please don't lock me in.

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,550
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,079
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,079
I told you

129
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,559
to smile when you see your dad

130
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,590
and tell him you're doing great.

131
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,510
How could you cry?

132
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,319
It's my fault.

133
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,630
Don't lock me in.

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,390
Don't lock me in.

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,319
No!

136
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,159
Help!

137
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,079
No!

138
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,190
I hate it when people cry.

139
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,830
I'm sorry!

140
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,790
Please don't lock me in!

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,550
I'm sorry!

142
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,750
Let me out!

143
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,519
I'm begging you.

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,999
It's my fault.

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,750
Don't lock me in.

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,470
Let me out.

147
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,910
Nong.

148
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,390
Nong.

149
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,230
Big brother!

150
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,439
Big brother!

151
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,150
I'm here,

152
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,679
big brother.

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,839
Help me!

154
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,439
Nong.

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,550
I'm here.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,199
It's so dark in here.

157
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,710
I've been locked in for so long.

158
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,879
Don't be scared.

159
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,910
Big brother,

160
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,550
help me.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,830
Big brother.

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,590
Help me, big brother.

163
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,399
Big brother.

164
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,470
Big brother.

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,910
I'm so scared.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,190
Big brother.

167
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,670
Big brother.

168
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,079
Big brother,

169
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,799
I'm so scared.

170
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,350
Big brother.

171
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,190
Big brother.

172
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,550
Big brother.

173
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,910
Dad said

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,839
if he finishes the paintings for them,

175
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,670
we can go home.

176
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,230
Like father like daughter.

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,110
You're also a painter.

178
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,510
You're drawing your house, right?

179
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,110
It looks just like it.

180
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,590
Just missing one thing.

181
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,310
A tree.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,150
Come.

183
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,630
Stand still.

184
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,910
Move over a bit.

185
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,310
Raise your hands.

186
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,910
You're a trunk now.

187
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,750
Let me add some color.

188
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,750
Hold still.

189
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,750
You're now a little tree.

190
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,279
Don't move until the sun goes down.

191
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,470
All right.

192
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,390
Nong,

193
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,550
they bullied you again?

194
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,839
Come with me.

195
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,950
I can't.

196
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,239
The bad guy said I'm a tree.

197
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,110
I can't move before the sun sets.

198
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,039
Don't be scared of them.

199
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,550
I'll take you to wash up.

200
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,670
No.

201
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,199
If you're a tree,

202
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,950
I'm a house.

203
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,159
The house will block the sun
for the tree.

204
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,310
Is that okay?

205
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,559
Big brother,

206
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,030
where are we going?

207
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,430
Let me show you something.

208
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,270
Come.

209
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,950
Big brother.

210
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,599
I dug this hole at night.

211
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,870
Good thing it's made of earth.
Not too thick.

212
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,519
Big brother,

213
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,110
are you trying to escape?

214
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,999
I'll take you out with me.

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,719
Once we get out,

216
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,999
we'll go to the police

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,519
and get your dad out, okay?

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,239
Okay.

219
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,390
What are you doing?

220
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,270
You two are slacking off again.

221
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,950
You always stick together.

222
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,079
What are you plotting?

223
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,230
Big brother.

224
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,790
I always think
there are rats in the factory.

225
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,990
Do as much work as the food you eat.

226
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,710
Don't you understand?

227
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,639
Yet you're stealing?

228
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,839
Big brother.

229
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,990
Beat him.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,879
Nong, run.

231
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,910
Run.

232
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,910
Run.

233
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,990
Run.

234
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,510
Big brother.

235
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,639
I'm begging you.

236
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,430
Please don't hit him.

237
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,110
I'm begging you.

238
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,559
Big brother.

239
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,110
Go.

240
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,270
I hate it when people cry.

241
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,830
If you're going to beg me like that,

242
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,230
it only makes me even madder.

243
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,750
Nong, smile.

244
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,190
Give me a smile.

245
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,790
If I'm happy,

246
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,990
they won't hit him.

247
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,279
That's not a smile.

248
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,710
Smile happily.

249
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,670
Smile.

250
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,950
Laugh.

251
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,510
Keep laughing.

252
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,110
You're not happy enough.

253
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,590
Boring.

254
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,550
That's enough.

255
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,750
Stop hitting him.

256
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,630
Big brother.

257
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,150
Big brother.

258
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,630
Are you okay?

259
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,990
Nong, good girl.

260
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,110
I'm all right.

261
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,150
There, there, Nong.

262
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,470
