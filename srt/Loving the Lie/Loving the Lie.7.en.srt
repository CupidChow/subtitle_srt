00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,590
Are you hurt?

4
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,830
I dare you to move.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,910
I don't usually go easy on women.

6
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,310
What's all the noise?

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,910
Miss Guan!

8
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,079
Xin Yi...

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,959
Xin Yi failed to find the material
I asked for.

10
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,759
I used a substitute

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,270
and she slapped me!

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,630
Xin Yi.

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,150
Apologize to Xu Ru.

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,919
I'm sorry, Miss Guan.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,070
I refuse to do so.

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,070
Don't blow this out of proportion.

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,990
Who's making the scene now?

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,719
Xin Yi went out in the rain last night

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,070
and worked hard to find
the pigment material.

20
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,839
And she just stepped on it.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,839
The old man didn't send Xin Yi here

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,199
to be her servant.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,719
Aren't assistants supposed to help?

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,390
If you can't take it, you can leave.

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,000
So assistants
should be treated unfairly?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,510
Don't they deserve respect?

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
If you abuse your assistant like this,

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,870
it affects more than just you.

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,310
It reflects on both Chairman Guan
and Guanhai too.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,999
Who do you think you are?
What gives you the right to lecture me?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,110
That's enough!

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,270
My dad hired you to paint,

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,990
not to fight and play power games.

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,510
If he hears about this,

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,750
both of you will have to leave.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,030
You're not the impulsive type.

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,070
Did Xu Ru say something to you?

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,919
Whatever games she plays with me,

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,270
I don't care.

40
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,750
But I can't let it slide

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,470
if she insults my dad.

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,870
I know.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,390
You care about your family the most.

44
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,910
Why are you working
as Guan Xin's assistant?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,030
Well...

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,430
You don't want me near her?

47
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,110
I told you.

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,630
There are some paths
I have to walk alone.

49
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,910
I don't want you caught
between me and the Guans.

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,990
Don't worry.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,550
I'm doing all this for my own sake.

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,559
With my background and status,

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,350
the Qin family
won't lift a finger for me.

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,030
The Guans and Qins
have business dealings.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,479
I can learn how the business works

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,430
by working for Guan Xin.

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,119
You're capable enough

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,639
to make something of yourself

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,590
without the Qin family's support.

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,990
Xin Yi.

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,590
Give me a hand, Xin Yi.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,319
What are you doing?

63
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,479
It's all because of you.

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,799
I rushed out to find you yesterday

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,059
and left the garage open.

66
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:45,400
The place is completely flooded,
so I can't live there anymore.

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,470
Therefore...

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,270
You owe me this.

69
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,919
Your place is flooded.
What's that got to do with Xin Yi?

70
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,630
I'll just stay at her place.

71
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,990
What does it have to do with you?

72
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,120
She hasn't said anything,
so why are you butting in?

73
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,479
This city's full of hotels.

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,679
If you can't afford one,

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,830
I'll pay for you.

76
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,830
Trying to act rich, huh?

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,190
Fine.

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,470
Here.

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,479
Transfer me 800,000 or 900,000.

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,790
Let's see what you've got.

81
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,839
No money?

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,270
Shut your mouth, then.

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,470
What's your relationship with Xin Yi?

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,919
Who are you to tell me what to do?

85
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,030
We're...

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,679
We're childhood friends.

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,839
Besides, you don't care
about your reputation, but she does.

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,799
I can tell you're up to no good.

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,950
Well, you've been yapping.

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,190
I almost thought you were her boyfriend.

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,390
So what if I'm up to no good?

92
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,799
You're otherwise,

93
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,950
but you've got no guts.

94
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,670
What a coward.

95
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,390
Say that again.

96
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,990
Guan Huai.

97
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,999
It wasn't me.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,750
He pushed me.

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,639
Qin Shen.

100
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,439
You should go.

101
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,639
Leave this to me.

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,319
But it was him...

103
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,239
Got it.

104
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,830
I know what to do

105
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,710
Fine.

106
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,830
Call me if you need anything.

107
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,390
Take care.

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,910
Watch out for cars.

109
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,990
That friend of yours

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,239
is way too aggressive.

111
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,399
You should ditch him.

112
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,070
Did you see how hard he pushed me?

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,470
Because you talked too much.

114
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,839
Spill it.

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,159
What are you up to?

116
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,790
My garage is really flooded.

117
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,199
Your attic looks pretty decent.

118
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,199
How about this?

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,399
I'll pay you 500 a month.

120
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,199
I'll do laundry, cook

121
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,559
and wash the dishes.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,870
It's nothing but a great deal.

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,430
Once your shop's fixed,
you're moving out.

124
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,079
The shop's fixed,

125
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,110
but I'm still injured.

126
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,790
It's evidence of your crime.

127
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,590
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,750
What does that mean?

129
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,159
You know what?

130
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,079
I hold grudges,

131
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,470
so I'll make you pay eventually.

132
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,479
(Moonlight on Plum Blossoms)

133
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,630
(Xu Ru.)

134
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,870
(Your junior is something else.)

135
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,999
(Xin Yi is no amateur.)

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,830
(If you don't want her replacing you,
don't let my dad down.)

137
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,079
(Xu Ru.)

138
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,639
(This jealousy of yours)

139
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,710
(is just to cover up
your own failure and insecurity.)

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,208
I won't lose.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,679
I can't lose.

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,399
I won't lose!

143
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,550
I won't lose to you!

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,959
(Beauty Rouge.)

145
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,390
(It's made of the blood of a beauty.)

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,190
Would you be willing
to give your blood for it?

147
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,670
Xin Yi!

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,870
Xin Yi!

149
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:36,609
(Xinggong Pavilion)

150
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,359
(Cang Ying Coiled Dragon)

151
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,510
Come out.

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,350
Why did you go off on your own?

153
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,319
Didn't you already give me a shove?

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,110
Why are you still harping on it?

155
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,479
Besides,

156
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,679
since when do I need your approval
to do things?

157
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,159
Moving in with Xin Yi

158
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,830
isn't part of our plan.

159
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,279
Having my garage flood

160
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,070
isn't part of the plan either.

161
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,999
There, there.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,879
Stop being jealous.

163
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,030
Let's get down to business.

164
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,639
We missed something important.

165
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,590
Xin Yi seems to have a mental block,
and she can't use a brush.

166
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,239
But I found out

167
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,879
that when I play harmonica,
it helps her condition.

168
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,599
Thus,

169
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,079
I need to stay by her side

170
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,830
and be ready whenever she needs me.

171
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,550
No way.

172
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,430
She wouldn't keep that from me.

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,359
Well,

174
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,070
you're just her friend.

175
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,079
Why should she tell you that?

176
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,710
I wish I could

177
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,390
punch that mouth of yours.

178
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,630
Pardon me.

179
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,599
Unlike you,

180
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,990
Xin Yi is totally
into this mouth of mine.

181
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:51,800
(Cang Ying Coiled Dragon)

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,150
(Why are there so many drafts?)

183
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,470
(But I've never seen Xu Ru paint
in the studio.)

184
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,430
(She seems to be trying
to come up with a special shade of red.)

185
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,439
I'm sorry,

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,470
Miss Guan.

187
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,470
We've been drinking
until this late hour.

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,150
And now you have to drive me home.

189
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,079
Actually, you didn't

190
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,870
have to cover for me back then.

191
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,670
I've had that kind of situation
all this while.

192
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,759
A few days ago, I saw you
switching from iced Americano to hot milk.

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,510
I figured it's that time of the month.

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,799
If you had drank just now,

195
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,190
it would've made you unwell, no?

196
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,750
You're pretty observant.

197
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,550
I sure am.

198
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,039
Aren't you already engaged?

199
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,870
Why are you still coming to me?

200
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,350
So what if I'm engaged?

201
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,150
Does it matter to you?

202
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,670
Of course it does.

203
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,759
That's Miss Guan from Guanhai Group.

204
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,119
She's both rich and influential.

205
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,710
I can't afford to offend her.

206
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,950
Miss Guan.

207
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,990
It just sounds nice.

208
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,279
No matter how hard she works

209
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,030
and how well she runs the company,

210
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,079
her dad just wants to marry her off.

211
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,030
Once she's part of my family,

212
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,599
she'll still be stuck doing laundry,

213
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,399
cooking,

214
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,750
and cleaning the house.

215
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,150
Miss Guan is so pretty.

216
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,590
And you're okay with that?

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,390
Pretty?

218
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,070
What's the use of being so?

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,790
She's all stern and uptight.

220
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,630
Just another boring old maid.

221
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,350
I'm kind-hearted enough to marry her.

222
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,830
If not, who else would want her?

223
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,470
Don't listen.

224
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,510
Don't look.

225
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,670
Sit tight.

226
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,670
What on earth? Who is that?

227
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:26,629
(The garden is full of fragrance)

228
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,520
(Elegance in zither and books,
peace in the hall of paintings)

229
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,519
(To guard against me,)

230
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,670
(Xu Ru has certainly gone all out.)

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,790
(She's actually back in Qi Garden
to paint alone at this late hour.)

232
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,110
(That's...)

233
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,390
(Spring Birds Competing!)

234
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,679
(Guan Shanhai recruited artists)

235
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,910
(to create this very painting.)

236
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,439
No!

237
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,350
Why is it still not working?

238
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,470
Why must Beauty Rouge
be made with human blood?

239
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,679
Who's there?

240
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,950
Who's out there?

241
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,750
