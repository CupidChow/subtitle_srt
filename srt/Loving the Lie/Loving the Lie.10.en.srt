00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,150
Here.

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,479
A toast to you, sir.

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,630
Cheers.

6
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,990
Well, well.

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,559
If it isn't my future wife.

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,239
Come.

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,390
Have a seat with us.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,390
You two head back first.

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,630
Wait for my call.

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,030
Stop it.

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,150
What brings you here today, Miss Guan?

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,910
I heard that low life
is working as your secretary.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,639
I forgot to tell you.

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
Don't worry about saving face for me.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,079
He's a good-for-nothing.

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,350
So you just find some excuse
and fire him.

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,159
Take a look at this.

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,719
If it's okay,

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,150
just sign it.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,039
What's this?

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,670
Didn't Qin Shen tell you?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,630
I'm calling off the engagement.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,990
Why?

26
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,519
Are you mad?

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,870
Let's talk things through.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,670
Don't simply call off the engagement.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,519
This engagement

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,399
wasn't even my choice to begin with.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,919
It was arranged between you and my dad.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,959
I thought I'd just put up with it if both
of our families benefit from it.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,470
But then I thought

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,470
I might not be that generous.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,239
We've had the engagement banquet.

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,950
Isn't it too late now?

37
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:16,679
To be honest,

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,150
you're not impressed with me.

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,919
I'm not that into you either

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,110
However, having born
into a family like ours,

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,870
we don't always
get to make our own choices.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,079
I promise you.

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,159
After we marry,

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,399
we do our own thing

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,790
and stay out of each other's way.

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,270
If you still want to stay at Guanhai,

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,039
I don't mind as long
as your dad's okay with it.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,230
Pardon me.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,510
I have no time for you at all.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,839
Also,

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,319
stop using my dad against me.

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,470
It won't work.

53
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,510
Fine.

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,670
I won't force you.

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,590
Drink all those in front of you.

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,870
And then we'll talk.

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,950
Miss Guan.

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,070
Please.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,719
(After all that liquor,)

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,359
(she'll totally black out.)

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,310
(Once things are done and dusted,)

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,790
(let's see
how long she keeps that pride.)

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,670
Can you sign it now?

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,310
Answer me.

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,070
Can you sign it now?

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,710
Who is this?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,319
Hello.

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,879
This is the Chaoyun Town Traffic Police.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,919
Your car caused scrape
due to illegal parking.

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,510
Please come handle it immediately.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,150
Tell him to get lost.

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,439
I'm all loaded,
so he needs not compensate me.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,559
But your car caused the accident
due to illegal parking.

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,279
By regulation,

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,599
if you don't show up,

76
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,350
we'll have your car towed.

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,950
What on earth?

78
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,839
Wait.

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,990
I'll be right there.

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,030
Baby.

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,550
Wait for me.

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,839
It's such a small matter

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,230
and I have to see to it myself.

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,390
Where is she?

85
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm dreaming again.

86
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,310
It's you again.

87
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,079
You're drunk,

88
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,270
Miss Guan.

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,110
Why have you always
shown up in my dreams

90
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,230
ever since that night?

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,430
What exactly are you after?

92
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,790
Miss Guan.

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,710
Miss Guan.

94
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,630
Do you know who I am?

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,790
I do.

96
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,230
You're Qin Shen.

97
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,110
Since it's a dream,

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,230
why not indulge just this once?

99
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,399
(I searched through everything
my father left behind.)

100
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,559
(But I found nothing)

101
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,350
(about his past with Mrs. Ming Yun.)

102
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,799
(Looks like I'll only)

103
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,039
(figure out the whole story)

104
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,510
(when the truth comes to light.)

105
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,750
So this is how Beauty Rouge is made?

106
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,070
Well...

107
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,390
You had too much to drink last night.

108
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,910
I...

109
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,679
Are you blaming me?

110
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,830
No...

111
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,150
That's not what I meant.

112
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,430
I just meant...

113
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,710
I'm sorry

114
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,110
about last night.

115
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,630
You don't need to say sorry.

116
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,119
I was the one
who made the first move anyway.

117
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,270
I thought you'd be mad.

118
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,279
Why would I be so?

119
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,310
Didn't you have fun then?

120
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,910
I did.

121
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,639
Didn't you say you never allow yourself
to make mistakes?

122
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,199
Perhaps our encounter

123
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,230
has awakened
my long-overdue rebellious streak?

124
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,590
It's true.

125
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,919
I did see rules

126
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,159
as sacred commandments,

127
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,879
and I never allowed myself
a single misstep.

128
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,150
But I realized

129
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,959
I seem to have ignored
what I really want deep down.

130
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,470
We may be a mistake.

131
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,670
Perhaps it's a beautiful one.

132
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,439
Your brother's a jerk.

133
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,710
But you're not like him.

134
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,870
I actually like you.

135
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,190
See you at work.

136
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,390
This is the Cangshan Snow Green
I've just acquired.

137
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,590
Have a taste.

138
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,479
It's both smooth and refreshing.

139
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,950
What a fine tea.

140
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,119
It's too bad that my parents probably

141
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,479
won't be tasting tea
served by Miss Guan.

142
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,719
Well,

143
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,439
I bet you haven't heard, Mr. Guan.

144
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,950
Guan Xin came to me
and asked to call off the engagement.

145
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,390
That girl is unbelievable.

146
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,910
It's a serious matter,
but she didn't even discuss it with me.

147
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,590
However,

148
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,270
the engagement is indeed rushed.

149
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,479
She's a woman after all.

150
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,879
It's normal

151
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,919
that she resists the idea.

152
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,839
I'll talk to her

153
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,550
when I get a chance.

154
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,919
Mr. Guan.

155
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,119
You know as well as I do.

156
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,790
With our families' standing
in the business world,

157
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,870
if word of this gets out,

158
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,839
the stock market

159
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,750
and our business operations
will take a hit.

160
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,670
Don't panic.

161
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,470
Our families go way back.

162
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,910
There'll still be chances
for elaborate cooperation.

163
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,390
Since you say so,

164
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,950
I feel rest assured.

165
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,990
Oh.

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,159
By the way,

167
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,559
I know you've always
admired Ma Qingshan's work

168
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,350
and have been looking for that painting
called Spring Birds Competing.

169
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,599
So I've had my men
keeping an eye out for it all this while.

170
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,639
And guess what?

171
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,150
There's good news.

172
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,630
You're sure it's Spring Birds Competing?

173
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,879
Yes.

174
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,199
The painting is currently owned by

175
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,239
a female collector overseas.

176
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,070
She says it was passed down
from her grandfather.

177
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,519
I've been searching for it,

178
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,030
but I never found a trace of it.

179
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,390
Everyone said it was lost forever.

180
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,439
The collector keeps a low profile.

181
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,030
She never reveals her name or looks.

182
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,719
She only
enjoys her collectibles privately

183
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,550
without exhibiting them.

184
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,110
If it's confirmed to be authentic,

185
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,559
just buy it

186
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,710
no matter how much it costs.

187
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,559
I already asked about that.

188
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,950
But she said

189
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,119
it's a family heirloom.

190
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,590
She won't sell it.

191
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,310
However,

192
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,110
if you'd just like to see it,

193
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,430
I could try to pull some strings

194
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,870
and get you
a small private viewing session.

195
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,439
If you can make that happen,

196
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,679
I'll agree

197
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,519
to whatever you want.

198
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,159
You're too kind, Mr. Guan.

199
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,190
We'll be family sooner or later.

200
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,959
I just want to marry Guan Xin
as soon as possible.

201
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,110
Don't worry.

202
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,830
She doesn't get the final say
in this family.

203
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,270
The marriage still counts.
