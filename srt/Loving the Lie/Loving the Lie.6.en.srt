Xin Yi. I know you're tired,
but you need to remove the wet clothes.

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,110

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,679
Well...

56
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,190
Since you're tired,

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,630
I'll help you remove the wet clothes.

58
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,230
No...

59
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,790
What are you talking about?

60
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,319
If you don't remove the wet clothes,

61
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,750
you'll feel worse.

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,230

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,830
Are you aware what you're doing?

64
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,310
The fever has made you muddle-headed.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,990
Don't worry.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,750
I won't take advantage of you.

67
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,799
Look at how dedicated I am
in serving you.

68
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,790
Yet you always give me a hard time.

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,710
Do I even owe you anything?

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,910
It's so hot.

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,190
Stay still.

72
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,550
Sleep well.

73
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,550
You started it first.

74
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,590
How's the painting coming?

75
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,270
I want to refine it a bit more.

76
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,039
I'll work on the original piece

77
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,830
when I'm totally ready.

78
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,430
It's not an easy piece.

79
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,390
But I don't have that much time.

80
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,239
Got it.

81
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,790
I'll speed up, then.

82
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,910
That junior of yours is quite capable.

83
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,799
Let her help you.

84
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,350
There's a unique red in that painting.

85
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,750
I still haven't found an exact match.

86
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,079
So I asked her
to look for raw materials.

87
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,670
I plan to mix it myself.

88
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,630
Have you heard of
a red called Beauty Rouge?

89
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,319
It's said to be a special red
created by Ma Qingshan.

90
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,279
But ever since then,

91
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,190
no one's managed to replicate it.

92
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,750
Ma Qingshan became famous at twenty

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,710
thanks to Beauty Rouge.

94
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,150
Did you know how it's made?

95
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,239
I'm not as knowledgeable

96
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,790
as you, Chairman Guan.

97
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,630
Beauty Rouge.

98
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,790
It's made of

99
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,030
the blood of a beauty.

100
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,759
Chairman Guan.

101
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,470
You're kidding, right?

102
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,319
Those stories about Ma Qingshan

103
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,070
are mostly made-up nonsense.

104
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,550
Forget whether Beauty Rouge
is even real.

105
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,879
Even if it were,

106
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,950
the method would've been lost ages ago.

107
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,399
But what if I found

108
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,590
the secret formula for it?

109
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,590
Would you be willing
to give your blood for it?

110
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,790
This flower

111
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,430
still looks best by your temple.

112
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,079
You low life.

113
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,590
Who do you think you are

114
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,310
to be going after Guan Xin?

115
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,270
Brother.

116
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,910
I'm just looking for a job.

117
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,119
Don't think I don't know your angle.

118
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,830
Your mom seduced my dad.

119
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,110
Now you want to seduce my fiancée, huh?

120
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,790
I guess shamelessness
runs in your family.

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,470
Excuse me, brother.

122
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,910
I'm not into your future wife.

123
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,710
Even if you were,

124
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,750
Guan Xin wouldn't be interested in you.

125
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,390
Your mom died
without ever stepping foot in our house.

126
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,550
If it weren't for Dad's blood in you,

127
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,390
he'd have never
taken in a trash like you.

128
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,150
Bear this in mind.

129
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,270
As long as I'm around,

130
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,790
you will never rise above.

131
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,990
Luckily, it's not damaged.

132
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:20,070
(If I had walked away back then,)

133
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,510
(I'd have blood on my hands too.)

134
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,950
(And I'd be no different from them.)

135
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,319
Xin Yi.

136
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,510
Time to eat.

137
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,279
You have no idea
how much you put me through last night.

138
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,999
Your fever didn't break

139
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,319
until five.

140
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,719
I did your laundry

141
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,230
and got your food this morning.

142
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,119
Where else can you find

143
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,390
a perfect househusband like me?

144
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,790
Oh no!

145
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,034
Can you keep an eye on your stalker?

146
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:53,940
He comes after me

147
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,550
whenever he can't find you.

148
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,919
Senior.

149
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,350
Here's your huai jing.

150
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,510
I don't need it anymore.

151
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,030
I've found something else to replace it.

152
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,479
Only huai jing can make hibiscus red.

153
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,839
Nothing else comes close.

154
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,599
Even if it looks similar,

155
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,959
it's always a hair off,

156
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,350
which makes all the difference.

157
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,950
Why?

158
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,990
Are you trying to teach me
how to do my job?

159
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,230
Yes.

160
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,910
You do work hard.

161
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,510
And you're talented.

162
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,950
But some things

163
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,990
mean nothing

164
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,830
in the face of choice.

165
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,830
For example,

166
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,830
this thing you fetched in the rain

167
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,790
from the mountain.

168
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,230
I can still choose not to use it.

169
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,830
And

170
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,710
that Cheng Raoshanren you admire.

171
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,030
He painted for most of his life

172
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,190
and still chose
to take the easy way out.

173
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,390
Why?

174
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,230
Because he chose fame and fortune.

175
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,839
He didn't forge anything.

176
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,310
He was tricked into it.

177
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,239
Says who?

178
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,519
Maybe

179
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,959
he jumped at the chance
to make forgeries.

180
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,879
Anyway,

181
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,479
it's a good thing
that he died in the factory.

182
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,990
Otherwise, he'd have ended up in jail.

183
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,479
Come to think of it,

184
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,359
it really was for the best.

185
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,510
Shut up!

186
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,959
Xin Yi.

187
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,350
How dare you slap me!
