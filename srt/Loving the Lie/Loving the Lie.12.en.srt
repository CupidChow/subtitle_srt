=Episode 12=

3
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,499
You should've stayed in the hospital
for a few days

4
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,819
and gotten checked properly.

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,770
Was that so hard?

6
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,290
Why did you have to come back tonight?

7
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,899
The wound's already stitched,

8
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,259
and I've had antibiotics.

9
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,530
Why do I have to stay in the hospital?

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,659
It's just that the metal

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,970
is at a tricky angle.

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,610
It might hurt the nerves.

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,299
I won't know for sure

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,050
until a follow-up in three months.

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,780
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see Xu Ru.

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,050
Guan Huai.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,170
Let's not be impulsive.

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,450
Xu Ru has already been kicked out.

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,619
Now, I'm the only person
who can paint for your dad.

20
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,459
If you make a scene

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,099
and he finds out my hand's injured,

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,619
he'll drop me.

23
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,530
Seriously?

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,250
You're still thinking about that right now?

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,930
If I hadn't shown up on time,

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,690
it wouldn't just be your hand.

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,130
You could've died.

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,650
I know.

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,050
But I can't think about that right now.

30
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,490
Tell me,

31
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,730
if your hand can't paint anymore,

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,930
what will you do?

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,610
The sadness can wait.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,610
Right now, something
more important matters.

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,459
Once this is all over,

36
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,530
I'll deal with her myself.

37
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,659
But for now, I can't let

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,739
Guan Shanhai write me off

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,490
because of a minor injury.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,650
Guan Huai.

41
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,650
There's something you would fight for,

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,699
no matter the cost,

43
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,770
right?

44
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,010
Xin Yi,

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,450
you sure know how to punish yourself.

46
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,414
(Tinghai Resort Hotel)

47
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:54,850
(Southeast Asian Cuisine,
Coffee and Tea, Designer Hotel)

48
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,930
You're late again.

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,690
I was busy.

50
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,499
The repair garage is shut down.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,850
What could a jobless guy
possibly have to do?

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,619
I cook for Xin Yi, do her laundry,
and clean her house every day.

53
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,610
When she's upset, I cheer her up.

54
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,859
I'm busy.

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,859
Stop using Xin Yi as an excuse.

56
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,730
She doesn't need you to do that.

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,450
Don't forget our mission.

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,480
Some people wish they could help,
but they don't get the chance.

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,850
Don't be jealous.

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,579
Fine.

61
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,730
Let's get down to business.

62
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,699
Xin Yi pretended to be Xu Ru
and painted,

63
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,579
trying to find the Golden House

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,739
and her dad's painting.

65
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,330
But Guan Shanhai found out.

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,050
No wonder he shut everything down
at Qi Garden.

67
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,970
Did he confront Xin Yi?

68
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,739
Xin Yi is still useful to him,

69
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,939
so he won't do that yet.

70
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,299
It's just that he's suspicious

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,650
and keeping her at a distance.

72
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,099
That means

73
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,490
you're around her all the time

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,059
and only found out

75
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,499
after all this happened?

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,410
Being around her doesn't help.

77
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,570
She doesn't trust anyone.

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,850
Her heart

79
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,210
is locked up tight.

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,299
That's why

81
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,130
we can only help her this way.

82
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,890
No matter how high the walls are,

83
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,930
I'll break a crack.

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,010
I made you congee.

85
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,770
It's been cooling for a while.
Should be just right now.

86
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,250
I forgot to ask you.

87
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,699
Why did you suddenly show up
at Qi Garden?

88
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,050
Were you following me?

89
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,939
Don't flatter yourself.

90
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,259
Why would I follow you?

91
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,259
I was watching Xu Ru.

92
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,370
Why?

93
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,579
I kept seeing her stick close
to Guan Shanhai,

94
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,939
I thought something was going on,

95
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,530
so I wanted to catch them in the act.

96
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,730
Forget it.

97
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,690
I didn't expect you to tell the truth.

98
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,530
Right back at you.

99
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,130
All right.

100
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,810
The congee is getting cold. Have a sip.

101
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,280
I don't have an appetite.
I don't feel like eating.

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,259
Just a sip.

103
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,459
I spent three hours making it.

104
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,219
I added dates,

105
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,259
goji berries,

106
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,059
and walnuts.

107
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,539
Take a sip.

108
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,379
Come on.

109
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,139
I said

110
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,250
I don't want it!

111
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,010
You!

112
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,539
I remember you once said

113
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,410
you don't mind hitting women.

114
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,690
Stop trying to provoke me.

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,819
Drink it or don't.

116
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,970
Whatever.

117
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,610
Xin Yi.

118
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,610
What brings you here?

119
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,379
Why?

120
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,139
Am I not welcome?

121
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,450
Of course you are.

122
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,530
It's for you.

123
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,690
Thank you.

124
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,330
By the way,

125
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,970
I heard

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,259
Xu Ru got fired,

127
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,970
and the studio work has been suspended.

128
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,059
I realized the painting
Guan Shanhai asked her to copy

129
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,979
was my dad's

130
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,819
"Spring Birds Competing".

131
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,770
But she didn't grasp
the most crucial technique,

132
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,010
so I painted it for her.

133
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,099
But I didn't expect Guan Shanhai
to find out.

134
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,379
That's risky.

135
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,979
Guan Shanhai is bad news.

136
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,299
He hates being lied to.

137
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,080
If he gets angry
and does something to hurt you,

138
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,130
you could be in danger.

139
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,610
Don't worry.

140
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,419
Right now, I'm the only one
who can finish the painting for him.

141
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,810
He won't dare touch me.

142
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,090
The work might be on hold now,

143
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,330
but I believe

144
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,970
he'll come to me.

145
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,499
I support everything you do.

146
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,570
But...

147
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,659
Can you give me a heads-up next time?

148
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,170
Don't make me worry.

149
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,530
I will.

150
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,579
Xin Yi,

151
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,850
are you home?

152
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,330
Why is Guan Xin here?

153
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,330
She can't find out about us.

154
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,410
- I'll hide in the bathroom.
- Go.

155
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,290
Coming.

156
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,699
Wait.

157
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,650
What are you doing?

158
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,859
Ah, your sister is here.

159
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,090
I need to hide.

160
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,810
What brings you here, Miss Guan?

161
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,610
I came to discuss a collaboration.

162
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,379
I noticed your talent

163
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,050
was way ahead of Xu Ru.

164
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,250
Maybe there were some misunderstandings
between us

165
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,810
because of Guan Huai.

166
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,170
So I hope this time

167
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,579
we can give each other a chance

168
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,890
to work together.

169
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,810
There are many painters better than me.

170
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,139
Now that Xu Ru's out,

171
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,419
you could hire someone else.

172
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,290
Why me?

173
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,299
Are you sure

174
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,170
Chairman Guan will be satisfied with me?

175
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,010
There may be plenty of good painters,

176
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,210
but only a few can imitate
Ma Qingshan's style.

177
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,210
My dad admires Ma Qingshan,

178
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,410
and only hires painters
to replicate his works.

179
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,899
If I already have someone

180
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,810
who's an expert at that,

181
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,170
why would I look elsewhere?

182
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,939
Miss Guan, you once suspected

183
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,779
I was working with your brother.

184
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,619
Aren't you worried

185
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,090
we'll gang up on you this time?

186
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,010
A wise bird picks the right wood
to perch on.

187
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,219
I don't know

188
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,019
what Guan Huai offers you.

189
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,890
But whatever it is,

190
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,970
I'll double it.

191
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,939
Whatever he gives you, I can, too.

192
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,530
Whatever he can't give you,

193
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,930
I still can.

194
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,810
Think about it.

195
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,619
I'm meeting a client later,

196
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,819
I should get going.

197
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,970
Sure.

198
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,410
Roselily.

199
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,690
I like it, too.

200
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,579
Sorry.

201
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,930
May I use your bathroom?

202
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,250
It's over there.

203
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,499
Wait.

204
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,610
Miss Guan.

205
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,490
Who's there?

206
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,250
Who's inside?

207
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,739
I'm taking a shower.

208
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,810
Guan Huai?

209
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,250
(That shadow doesn't look like
just one person.

210
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,179
Guan Huai.

211
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,699
What are you trying to do?
Are you a pervert? I said I'm showering.

212
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,770
Go out.

213
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,850
Alone?

214
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,290
Of course.

215
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,610
You think I'm taking a couple's bath?

216
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,659
I'm naked here.

217
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,339
Can I get you some privacy?

218
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,690
Respect me, will you?

219
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,659
You ran around naked in front of me
as a kid,

220
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,179
and now you're talking about privacy?

221
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,979
Oh, come on.

222
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,179
I'm thirty now.

223
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,490
I was three or four then.

224
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,770
You're still my brother,
even if you're thirty.

225
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,939
Fine.

226
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,339
Yes,

227
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,330
ma'am.

228
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,139
Miss Guan,

229
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,259
I forgot to tell you
someone's in the bathroom.

230
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,659
There's a sink outside.

231
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,539
I'll take you there.

232
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,259
Right.

233
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,019
It's bigger.

234
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,699
Super big.

235
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,450
It's fine. I'm done.

236
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,090
Thank you.

237
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,299
Bro,

238
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,539
get off me.

239
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,010
She's gone.

240
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,570
Should this tile cat be on the roof
as an amulet?

241
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,810
Why's it here?

242
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,170
These must be her childhood paintings.

243
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,050
My Art Exhibition.

244
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,459
(My dream is to be like Dad,)

245
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,690
(to hold my own art exhibition!)

246
00:11:57,103 --> 00:11:59,790
(Copying 22 projects to USB.)

247
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:06,240
(Copying 22 projects to USB,
Guanhai Group)

248
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,950
(Copying 10 projects to USB.)

249
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,610
Qin Shen.

250
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,410
Work hours are over.

251
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,090
What are you doing in my office?

252
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:28,360
(I won't tie you up.)

253
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,530
I thought you wouldn't watch these.

254
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,530
Why not?

255
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,410
I'm a man.

256
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,379
Guan Xin.

257
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,099
Mr. Qin.

258
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,659
Guan Xin.

259
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,730
Mr. Qin.

260
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,170
Mr. Qin,

261
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,139
Miss Guan isn't here.

262
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,210
Get lost.

263
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,059
Mr. Qin.

264
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,890
Guan Xin.

265
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,010
Guan Xin.

266
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,010
Mr. Qin.

267
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,619
Guan Xin,

268
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,699
I know you're here.

269
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,199
Listen.

270
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,600
- What are you doing?
- I won't agree to call off our engagement.

271
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,650
Guan Xin.

272
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,210
Guan Xin.

273
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,779
Is she really not here?

274
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,339
No,

275
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,210
Mr. Qin.

276
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,530
She left work early today.

277
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,370
