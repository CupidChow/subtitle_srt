00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,650
What are you looking for?

4
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,690
Xin Cheng and my mom knew each other.

5
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,130
Why are you asking about this? Get out.

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,379
This is Xin Cheng's seal.

7
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,770
It matches my mom's.

8
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,019
Why do you have Xin Cheng's seal?

9
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,490
That is not the point right now.

10
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,739
Tell me.

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,330
What was their relationship, really?

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,220
That was a matter
of the previous generation.

13
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,210
You don't need to know.

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,530
You know.

15
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,170
You've known everything all along.

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,450
The reason Xin Cheng started painting.

17
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,290
It was all part of your plan.

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,970
You picked him out from the start.

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,890
We just used each other.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,179
He had talent.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,330
I had ambition.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,099
He painted.

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,250
I funded him.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,930
What is wrong with that?

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,810
But Xin Cheng never knew
you were the one who hired him.

26
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,219
You were deceiving him.

27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,250
Deceiving?

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,490
You all keep saying I lied.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,459
But if he was not willing,

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,979
if he had not wanted my money,

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,290
could I have forced him?

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,850
Yes.

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,899
I had my eye on him from the beginning.
Because he was your mom's senior.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,480
Because he could recreate Beauty Rouge.

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,370
Because he could paint
Spring Birds Competing.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,250
If he didn't have those talents,
I wouldn't have cared about him at all.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,970
My mom and he were

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,610
more than that, weren't they?

39
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,930
Guan Shanhai.

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,050
What are you afraid of?

41
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,130
Afraid?

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,010
What would I be afraid of?

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,979
Your mom and he studied

44
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,810
under the same master.

45
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,219
Xin Cheng liked her,

46
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,970
but he didn't even have the guts
to say a word.

47
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,050
All he knew was painting. Nothing else.

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,810
The only man in the world
worthy of your mom was me.

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,450
She didn't love you.

50
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,170
You know that.

51
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,019
That is why you destroyed Xin Cheng

52
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,170
by any means necessary.

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,159
You didn't really love her either.

54
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,899
All that talk about love, about remembrance,
but what did you really do?

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,000
You burned all her belongings
without a second thought.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,250
You brought other women home
like it was nothing.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,650
What was she to you?

58
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,410
A trophy?

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,770
A prize?

60
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,370
Neither.

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,330
She was proof of your success.

62
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,890
From the beginning, she was nothing
but one of your many collectibles.

63
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,370
Yes.

64
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,139
Yun was the most beautiful

65
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,530
of all my collections.

66
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,819
I cherished her.

67
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,619
Protected her.

68
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,890
Desired her.

69
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,010
If I could,

70
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,850
I would have made her eternal,

71
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,330
like all the world's masterpieces.

72
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,610
How could you use her blood
for Xin Cheng's painting?

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,170
She was a person.

74
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,259
A beauty's rouge.

75
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,530
A beauty's blood.

76
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,859
This was how I reunited her

77
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,170
with Xin Cheng.

78
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,570
What's wrong with that?

79
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,899
(My dad and Mrs. Ming Yun...)

80
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,010
(had that kind of past...)

81
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,970
(Dad being tricked
into that forgery factory.)

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,090
(That was all Guan Shanhai's scheme.)

83
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,810
(Guan Huai knows who I am.)

84
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,210
(He knows.)

85
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,979
(He has known all along.)

86
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,130
(He has known who I am
from the very beginning.)

87
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,210
(Xin Yi.)

88
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,290
(Xin Yi.)

89
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,730
(And you actually... with him...)

90
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,810
(How could you?)

91
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,779
(How could you?)

92
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,290
(How dare you?)

93
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,850
(Dad...)

94
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,970
(Dad...)

95
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,250
(I'm sorry...)

96
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,370
(Nong...)

97
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,579
(Nong...)

98
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,930
(I'm sorry...)

99
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,890
Xin Yi!

100
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,530
Xin Yi!

101
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,930
Xin Yi!

102
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,610
Xin Yi!

103
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,370
Xin Yi!

104
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,090
It's all my fault.

105
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,499
Xin Yi...

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,499
Dad...

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,379
You're afraid of closets, aren't you?

108
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,499
Please come out.

109
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,650
Please?

110
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,450
It's all my fault.

111
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,130
I'm sorry,

112
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,530
Dad...

113
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,410
Is this fun for you?

114
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,250
You knew all along
I was Xin Cheng's daughter.

115
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,090
You must have laughed
watching me try everything

116
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,450
to get close to you.

117
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,770
You knew my hands
couldn't paint anymore.

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,850
And yet I let your harmonica
calm me down.

119
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,090
Ironic, isn't it?

120
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,570
You played me like a fool
while I knew nothing.

121
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,450
Are you proud of yourself?

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,650
Xin Yi,

123
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,739
I can explain...

124
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,090
Explain what?

125
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,690
Are you going to keep lying to me?

126
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,330
I thought

127
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,050
I was the one in control of this game.

128
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,930
Turns out, I was just
your plaything all along.

129
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,299
Stop it. You were never a plaything.

130
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,379
Let me go.

131
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,730
Let me go!

132
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,290
Let go of me!

133
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,730
Let go!

134
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,770
I know you're upset.

135
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,890
Bite me.

136
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,130
Take a piece of flesh if it helps.

137
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,930
Guan Huai.

138
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,770
You disgust me.

139
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,250
One day,

140
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,810
I'll explain everything to you.

141
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,930
I'll prove to you

142
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,730
that I love you.

143
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,450
Someone like you

144
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,570
doesn't deserve to cry.

145
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,610
Get out.

146
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,730
I didn't expect the appraisal event
to get finalized so quickly.

147
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,970
Good work,

148
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,210
Heng.

149
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,499
Not at all.

150
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,379
We are about to become family.

151
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,219
What matters to the Guan family
matters to me.

152
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,970
Of course, I'll do my best.

153
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,379
You have no idea

154
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,499
how hard it was

155
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,699
to convince this collector

156
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,379
to display Spring Birds Competing.

157
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,090
I pulled many strings

158
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,059
and favors I could

159
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,130
just to get her to agree.

160
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,690
The only issue is the time. They're only
letting us display it for five days.

161
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,090
Five days

162
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,970
will do.

163
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,339
Decades of devotion,

164
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,130
and all you get is five days.

165
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,970
I feel bad for you.

166
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,610
Right.

167
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,019
I heard you have a collection hall

168
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,250
filled with Ma Qingshan's works.

169
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,819
Do you not want to add

170
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,410
another masterpiece to that gallery?

171
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,819
Didn't you say

172
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,610
that painting was a family heirloom,

173
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,819
never to be sold?

174
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,690
Some things in this world
are not about price, only desire.

175
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,259
As for how to get them,

176
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,859
well, that depends on one's ability.

177
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,779
Just say the word,

178
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,330
and I'll make it happen for you.

179
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,330
All right.

180
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,859
Just like before,

181
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,619
if you can pull it off,

182
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,090
I'll agree

183
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,490
to any condition.

184
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,170
Mr. Guan.

185
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,179
Well then,

186
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,530
I'll take my leave.

187
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,410
Xin Yi is no ordinary character.

188
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,250
I checked Guan Xin's computer.

189
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,170
Nothing else but Guanhai's
public-facing business dealings.

190
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,530
That old man has always been cautious.

191
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,099
Guan Xin's just a tool

192
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,859
managing Guanhai for him.

193
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,379
He would never let her know

194
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,870
about the dirty stuff.

195
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,690
Qin Heng has already secured
the appraisal event for Spring Birds Competing.

196
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,299
They'll never pass up the opportunity

197
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,810
to pull something at that event.

198
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,419
Xin Yi needs
to win Guan Shanhai's trust quickly

199
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,179
so we can get into the appraisal event.

200
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,619
That old man has already started

201
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,579
investigating who Xin Yi really is.

202
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,259
If he finds out anything,

203
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,530
she will be in danger.

204
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,419
All the more reason for us to speed up.

205
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,619
If what you say is true,

206
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,669
that Guan Shanhai plans to swap the original
for a forgery at the appraisal event,

207
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,730
then he'll definitely get Xin Yi
to paint that forgery.

208
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,410
Who else could he use?

209
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,699
It's just a fake painting.

210
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,459
Anyone could do it.

211
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,699
Why does it have to be her?

212
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,419
From the start, our goal was

213
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,899
to locate Guan Shanhai's Golden House

214
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,139
and Xin Cheng's original
Spring Birds Competing.

215
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,979
That's why we pushed Xin Yi

216
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,690
step by step closer to him.

217
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,739
Guan Shanhai is obsessed
with that painting.

218
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,459
He'll want someone to continue it.

219
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,099
Xin Yi was the best candidate.

220
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,370
But now he has found the original.

221
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,210
The fake won't matter
as much to him anymore.

222
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,930
What do you mean?

223
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,619
Xin Yi isn't
in the best state right now.

224
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,650
She isn't fit to carry out
the next part of the plan.

225
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,339
I'll find someone else to replace her.

226
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,739
Before the appraisal event,

227
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,059
Guan Shanhai will keep working
on the painting.

228
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,579
As long as he picks someone on our side,

229
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,939
we can still follow the trail

230
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,019
to the Golden House
and Spring Birds Competing.

231
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,579
We're already this far in.
Why change the plan now?

232
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,650
Are you and Xin Yi
hiding something from me?

233
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,939
That's settled.

234
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,810
I'll find the right person.

235
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,419
Do you even remember why we started

236
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,730
this whole operation?

237
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,379
We're not the only ones looking

238
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,970
for the Golden House and that painting.

239
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,730
This has been Xin Yi's obsession
for years.

240
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,099
She needs to know the truth,

241
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,659
whether Guan Shanhai really
was the mastermind behind that factory,

242
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,130
and how her father died in it.

243
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,310
I'll get her those answers.

244
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,920
You think she'll believe those answers
if they come from someone else?

245
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,819
My biggest regret is working with you.

246
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,379
I regret ever letting you
get close to her.

247
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,690
Using her, then tossing her aside
like she was nothing!

248
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,050
I used her?

249
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,410
What about you?

250
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,960
You claim this is all for her good,

251
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,960
but don't act like you aren't driven
by personal motives.

252
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,659
Why did you team up with me?

253
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,139
Wasn't it because of the shady dealings

254
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,650
between the Qin family and Guan Shanhai?

255
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,899
Because your brother, Qin Heng,
is helping Guan Shanhai

256
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,720
organize this appraisal event for money?

257
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,939
If that scandal comes to light,

258
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,920
neither of them will be able
to escape unscathed.

259
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,730
Let's be real. You're doing this out of revenge
against the Qin family and Qin Heng.

260
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,530
If you won't help her, I will.

261
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,690
From now on,

262
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,090
