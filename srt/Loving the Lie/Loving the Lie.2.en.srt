3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,800
(M, South East Asia)
Dad said we can go home

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,520
if we're done with the painting.

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,800
Like father, like daughter.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,440
You're all painters.

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
You're drawing your home, aren't you?

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,000
It's quite decent.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,240
But something's missing.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,440
We need a tree.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Arms up.

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,680
Move over here.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,080
You're now a little tree trunk.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,720
And I'll paint you.

15
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:46,780
(Qi Garden)

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,320
Xin Yi.

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
It's really you.

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,640
I thought I got the wrong person.

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,000
What a coincidence, Senior.

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,960
Guanhai really knows
how to draw a crowd.

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Even our aloof Xin Yi

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,680
came to apply as a painter.

23
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,320
But I heard

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,240
you haven't painted at all

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
since winning that award.

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,720
I didn't expect you'd still
be keeping tabs on me

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,320
after all this time.

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,680
Me? Keeping tabs on you?

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,080
Don't be too full of yourself.

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,960
Chairman Guan is here. Look.

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,200
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
You are all the best in the field.

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,760
Thank you for being here.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,200
I recently acquired a painting.

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,360
(This is my work from college.)

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,280
(How did it end up with Guan Shanhai?)

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
I heard the artist is from Chaoyun Town.

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,640
So I'd like to ask you all

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,840
who painted this?

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,880
Or who knows who painted this?

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,240
I did...

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,040
I painted it.

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
One painting, two artists?

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,960
If you don't believe me,

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,920
I can replicate any detail on the spot.

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,160
Chairman Guan.

47
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,960
Pardon me.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,720
Junior.

49
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
Dare to try?

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,720
(She hasn't produced anything
in a year.)

51
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,760
(Considering her character,)

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,560
(she wouldn't just stop painting.)

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,680
(Unless...)

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,160
(It's not that she doesn't want to.)

55
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,640
(She just can't.)

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,920
(Dad!)

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
(Dad!)

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,760
(Dad!)

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
(Just as I thought. I still can't manage it.)

60
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,000
You like wearing white camellias too?

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,160
What's your name?

62
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Xu Ru.

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,680
What's with that Xu Ru?

64
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,240
She totally ruined our plan.

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,960
I went through all that trouble
to get that old man

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,080
Xin Yi's painting,

67
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,720
so he'd go to Chaoyun Town
to look for her.

68
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,640
Then Xu Ru popped up out of nowhere

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
to throw my whole plan off.

70
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,440
Xin Yi's style is hard to imitate.

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Is that Xu Ru really that good?

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
I don't know if she can paint.

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,400
But she is quite a seductress.

74
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,320
She copies my mom's look every day

75
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,080
and has that old man
wrapped around her finger.

76
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Whose side is she on?

77
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
Who else?

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,040
Guan Xin's, obviously.

79
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,320
Now that the game's started,

80
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,600
whoever wants in
or intends to get in my way

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,900
(Xinggong Pavilion)
better follow my rules.

82
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
Bro, look at that hot lady.

83
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,240
Not bad.

84
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,000
She's lovely, no?

85
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,920
Pretty girl.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
Playing alone?

87
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
If you're willing to join me,

88
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,960
then I'm not alone anymore.

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,400
Sounds good.

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,920
Let's play a round, then.

91
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
Ten grand a ball.

92
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
How about it?

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,680
She's bold.

94
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,360
What if you lose?

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
If I miss one shot,

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
I take off a piece of clothing.

97
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Deal!

98
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,640
Nice!

99
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,160
Brilliant!

100
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,520
Awesome!

101
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,240
Great shot!

102
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,360
Great!

103
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,880
She'll miss it!

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,080
She will...

105
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,760
Who's he?

106
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,880
What is he doing?

107
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,840
What's with him?

108
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
Focus.

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Aim properly.

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,160
Who is that?

111
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
What's going on?

112
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,520
Who is he?

113
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,160
No idea.

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,120
I don't know him.

115
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
Isn't this against the rules?

116
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,880
Who are you? I was playing with her.
What's your problem?

117
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,040
How much money you even got?
Stop acting like a big shot.

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,960
You didn't even realize
she's been toying with you.

119
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,120
- Don't you stop me!
- Forget it...

120
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,560
What are you looking at?
Leave or I'll gouge your eyes out.

121
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,600
Don't take that to heart.

122
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,480
Let's go.

123
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,240
Forget it...

124
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Why were you removing your clothes
in front of those guys?

125
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,200
Because it was fun.

126
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,800
Your name's Xin Yi, right?

127
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,840
You were
at the old man's painting test too.

128
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
Do you still want to be a painter?

129
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,960
I do.

130
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
But I didn't pass the interview.

131
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,160
So what?

132
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm his son.

133
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,480
I can put in a word for you.
It's no big deal.

134
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,280
Are you even that kind-hearted?

135
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,520
Of course not.

136
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,280
I may be the Guan family's eldest son.

137
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,040
But I fix cars all the time.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,920
Isn't that ridiculous?

139
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,920
If it weren't for a misunderstanding
with the old man and my sister's sneakiness,

140
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,680
I'd already be in charge of Guanhai.

141
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
I need your help

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,880
to charm my dad.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
You're his son,

144
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,040
and you can't manage that.

145
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm just an outsider.

146
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
How am I supposed to do so?

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,720
He loves Ma Qingshan's work.

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
If you paint something in his style,

149
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,400
he'll be over the moon.

150
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
I can't help you with that.

151
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
Because I can't paint anymore.

152
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,680
I looked it up online.

153
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,880
They say it's something
like psychological pressure.

154
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,840
So I brought you out to relax.

155
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,440
You really want
to work with me that badly?

156
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,960
Of course I do.

157
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,680
I've seen your work.

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,600
You're even
the youngest Gold Award winner

159
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
of Hundred Flowers Awards,

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,720
right?

161
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,080
You'll definitely win him over
with your skills.

162
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,440
So? How do you feel now? Well, look at
your surroundings and the scenery.

163
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,880
Feeling inspired?

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Maybe a little.

165
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,400
If so,

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,320
start painting.

167
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,560
You didn't bring paper, huh?

168
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,712
Here.

169
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Use my T-shirt.

170
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,280
Sketch on it.

171
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,680
(I'm both cold)

172
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,040
(and hungry.)

173
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,840
(But that bad guy said)

174
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,360
(if I don't finish
cleaning the brushes,)

175
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
(I don't get to eat.)

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,960
(It's so dark in here.)

177
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,840
(I want to go home.)
(I miss Dad so much.)

178
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,240
(He poured the paint all over my body,)

179
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,720
