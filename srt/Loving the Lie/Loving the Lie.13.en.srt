00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,019
Why do I need to be blindfolded?

5
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,979
Don't worry.

a little easier on me?

Look what you splashed on me.

109
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,560
You're one to talk.

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,280
Look at this. I've got a meeting after this.
I can't show up like this.

111
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,939
Oh, relax.

112
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,210
I already booked us a hotel
at the foot of the mountain.

113
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,010
I wouldn't let you walk around
looking like this. Let's go wash up.

114

You brat!

115
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,890
Get back here!

116
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,010
You seem happy today.

117
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,099
Hosting an art exhibit
was my childhood dream.

118
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,730
I never thought
it would actually come true.

119
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,640
It's been a while
since I've seen you smile like this.

120
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,570
Not since that incident.

121
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,370
Is it because of Guan Huai?

122
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,290
Xin Yi.

123
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,570
Are you falling for him?

124
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,299
I know who he is.

125
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,610
I'd never fall for my enemy.

126
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,770
What's the hurry?

127
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,499
The exhibit might be over,

128
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,339
but I've got

129
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,370
one more surprise for you.

130
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,250
After you.

131
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,499
(When I grow up,)

132
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,579
(I want to build a candy wrapper house.)

133
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,379
(My daddy said)

134
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,859

135
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,930
(the sweetest dreams inside one.)

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,850
What do you think?

137
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,179
I ate eight cans of candy in a day

138
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,730
just to collect all this for you.

139
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,170
The candy house didn't work out,

140
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,450
but this candy tent isn't half bad,
right?

141
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,139
It might be a little drafty,

142
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,770
but it comes with its own speakers.

143
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,050
Listen.

144
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,570

Why what?

150
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,570
Why are you doing all this?

151
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,130
Why are you being so nice to me?

152
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,539
Do we always need a reason?

153
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,499
Just think of it as an act of kindness.

154
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,570
