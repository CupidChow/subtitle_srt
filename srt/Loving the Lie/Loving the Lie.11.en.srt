00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,320
=Loving The Lie=

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,330
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,839
Mr. Guan,

4
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,830
why are you suddenly in such a rush?

5
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,519
I'm not ready yet.

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,470
Spring Birds Competing
must be done this month.

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,239
Come on,

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,719
this is a tough piece to finish.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,439
It's even harder
to continue on the original.

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,990
And I haven't finished
preparing the colors.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,630
If you can't do it,
I'll find someone else.

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,399
Mr. Guan,

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,799
that's not what I meant.

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,999
Can you just give me a bit
more time with the Beauty Rouge?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,319
I'll figure it out.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,430
I...

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,670
The color is rich and smooth,

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,470
bright red like blood.

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,790
Beauty Rouge!

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,230
You painted this?

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,510
You really pulled it off.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,550
Didn't you just say
you weren't sure you could?

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,790
Tomorrow,

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,230
start on the original painting.

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,950
As long as you finish on time,

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,110
whether it's fame

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,910
or fortune,

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,150
you shall have it all.

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,190
Xu Ru,

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,350
I'm going to make you
the top artist in Chinese painting.

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,230
I won't let you down.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,550
Good.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,439
Get ready.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,150
Someone will pick you up tomorrow.

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,550
I didn't paint this.

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,070
Then, who did?

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,550
I did.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,279
Senior,

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,670
take a closer look.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,310
Isn't this the same red
you've been secretly testing

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,430
every night in the studio?

42
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,310
So it really was you
in Qi Garden that night.

43
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,719
How did you know?

44
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,750
You think I'd tell you?

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,270
The one I should tell

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,470
is Mr. Guan.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,879
Senior,

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,150
whether you like it or not,
it's your turn to step aside.

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,630
Xin Yi,

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,439
why are you always
trying to compete with me?

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,350
I told you a long time ago,

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,070
I'm not backing down from this job.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,910
You think you're so great?

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,390
I'll be able to make
Beauty Rouge one day too.

55
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,039
I believe it.

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,479
With your skills,

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,839
you'll figure it out eventually.

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,359
But Mr. Guan just said,

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,799
this painting has to
be finished this month.

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,270
Looks like he's not
going to wait for you.

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,310
And don't forget, Senior,

62
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,519
I've never tried to fight you.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,590
You're the one always fighting me.

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,639
How did you win your Gold Award?

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,079
How did you land this job?

66
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,159
Back then, you copied my work

67
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,479
and won the award.

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,719
Now you're claiming my painting

69
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,199
and using it to get ahead.

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,279
Xu Ru,

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,870
everything you have was stolen from me!

72
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,870
What do you think Mr. Guan would do

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,150
if he found out?

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,319
Xin Yi,

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,030
I'm begging you, okay?

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,550
Xin Yi,

77
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,430
I swear this will be the last time.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,030
Help me one last time.

79
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,590
Please?

80
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,950
Hard work can't beat talent.

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,590
I'm not as noble as you.

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,070
I want fame.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,270
I want money.

84
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,310
Since you don't care about any of that,

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,750
then let me have it.

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,870
I swear this is the last time.

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,630
From now on,

88
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,630
I'll quit the painting world.

89
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,870
Is that not enough?

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,390
Senior,

91
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,270
you're making me
look like the bad guy here.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,150
Get up.

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,630
What else do you want me to do?

94
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,310
If it's something I can do, I'll do it.

95
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,750
We were classmates after all.

96
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,070
It's not like I won't help you.

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,799
How about this?

98
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,479
Once this is over,

99
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,759
you clear it up publicly.

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,830
Tell the world you copied my work
to win the Gold Award.

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,430
How about that?

102
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,110
What about my reputation?

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,550
Once you become Mrs. Guan,

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,830
will any of that still matter?

105
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,319
Besides, what Mr. Guan cares about most

106
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,150
isn't your reputation.

107
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,079
What matters to him now,

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,710
what matters most...

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,070
is finishing that painting.

110
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,710
Fine.

111
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,350
I'll do it.

112
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,630
I knew you were smart, Senior.

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,670
Did Mr. Guan say
where you'll be painting tomorrow?

114
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,590
No.

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,710
He just said
someone would come pick me up.

116
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,390
I'll go in your place tomorrow.

117
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,110
With your identity,

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,710
I'll finish the painting.

119
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,519
Ma Liang tapped his brush,

120
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,910
and a golden mountain rose from the sea.

121
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,519
The official was thrilled

122
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,030
and said to Ma Liang,

123
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,199
"Paint a boat.

124
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,790
I want to go to that mountain."

125
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,919
So then,

126
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,510
Ma Liang painted a boat.

127
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
The official boarded it right away

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,510
and sailed toward the center of the sea.

129
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,439
But he thought it was too slow,

130
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,959
and rushed Ma Liang again,

131
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,110
"Make the wind stronger!"

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,399
Ma Liang added a few more strokes.

133
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,550
Suddenly,

134
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,839
a wild wind picked up,

135
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,470
and waves surged across the sea.

136
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,399
The official screamed in fear,

137
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,390
"That's enough wind!"

138
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,519
But,

139
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,230
Ma Liang ignored him.

140
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,350
The wind howled even harder.

141
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,479
The sea roared in fury.

142
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,190
The boat capsized.

143
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,310
And the official sank
to the bottom of the sea.

144
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,359
Every greedy person eventually

145
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,710
pays for their greed.

146
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,470
I'll find Guan Shanhai's golden mountain

147
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,350
and I'll sink it into the sea too.

148
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,470
I'll be the storm and waves you paint.

149
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,999
Xin Yi has already figured out

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,870
how to make Beauty Rouge.

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,399
What about Xu Ru?

152
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,199
I've had her watched for days.

153
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,399
She's been toiling away
in Qi Garden every night,

154
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,910
and still hasn't come up with anything.

155
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,719
The piece Guan Shanhai
asked Xu Ru to paint

156
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,839
must be Spring Birds Competing.

157
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,390
To paint that piece,
you need Beauty Rouge.

158
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,150
Xin Yi has mastered the technique now.

159
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,919
That old man will come to her.

160
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,679
When he does, we can use her

161
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,439
to locate the Golden House.

162
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,150
Spring Birds Competing

163
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,150
is definitely inside.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,110
Xin Yi wants that painting. I get it.

165
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,310
It was her dad's final work.

166
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,590
But what about you?

167
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,550
Why the obsession?

168
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,910
Because it was my mom's final work.

169
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,150
Qin Heng has already
found the original painting.

170
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,759
He's in contact with the collector now.

171
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,439
Guan Shanhai will
probably find out soon too.

172
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,119
What do you think he'll do?

173
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,990
He's not giving up that painting.

174
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,239
Why do you even need
to record my harmonica?

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,159
If you want to hear it,

176
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,550
I'll play it anytime.

177
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,830
Don't talk.

178
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,350
I've already started.

179
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,639
With this recording,

180
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,110
I should be able
to paint alone just fine.

181
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,839
(The black van will be downstairs)

182
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,630
(at 8 o'clock.)

183
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,199
(I already asked.)

184
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,870
(Mr. Guan won't be there tomorrow.)

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,839
(Be extra cautious.)

186
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,470
(Don't let anyone find out.)

187
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,190
Who painted this?

188
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,279
Of course I did,

189
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,119
Mr. Guan.

190
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,870
You already knew that.

191
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,270
You still dare lie to me?

192
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,599
I was overjoyed at the time.

193
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,950
I didn't question it.

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,070
But then, I thought about it.

195
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,039
If you really formulated
the Beauty Rouge,

196
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,510
you would've come running
to show off right away,

197
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,310
not keep stalling this job.

198
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,310
You painted it.

199
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,270
Why didn't you come to me right away?

200
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,750
Why put Xu Ru up for this trick?

201
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,830
What are you after?

202
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,230
Because you don't trust me, Mr. Guan,

203
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,590
due to my relationship with Guan Huai.

204
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,759
Even though you knew

205
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,319
I was more skilled than Xu Ru,

206
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,879
you still chose her.

207
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,279
All you wanted from me

208
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,510
was to help her when she got stuck.

209
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,039
You didn't trust me.

210
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,070
You didn't dare let me
touch that painting.

211
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,910
You're a smart one.

212
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,550
But you wouldn't
just help someone for free.

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,350
Tell me.

214
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,670
What did Xu Ru offer you?

215
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,919
She once copied
my work for a competition

216
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,119
and won an award.

217
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,990
It's haunted me ever since.

218
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,199
She promised me

219
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,399
if I helped her this time,

220
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,039
she'd admit it.

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,959
You're lying!

222
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,630
I never copied your work!

223
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,359
So,

224
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,110
the Kingfisher and Dried Reeds
from the interview was yours?

225
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,439
I painted that in college.

226
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,759
Mr. Guan,

227
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,199
don't believe her!

228
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,759
I painted that piece!

229
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,159
Mr. Guan!

230
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,990
Enough!

231
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,839
Never come back again.

232
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,950
Mr. Guan!

233
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,879
You have feelings for me too, don't you?

234
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,320
We've been together so long.
You must have feelings for me.

235
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,230
Can't you give me one more chance?

236
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,399
You want Beauty Rouge, right?

237
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,479
It takes human blood to make it.

238
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,639
Use mine.

239
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,470
I'll donate it, okay?

240
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,839
As long as you say the word,

241
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,079
plenty of people would line up.

242
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,710
Why would he use yours?

243
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,959
You're but a liar,

244
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,359
a woman drunk on vanity.

245
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,470
Your blood will taint
Mr. Guan's painting!

246
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,110
I had a feeling you reminded me of her.

247
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,230
But a fake is still just a fake.

248
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,399
Work is suspended.

249
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,630
Don't come to Qi Garden for now.

250
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,790
Guan Shanhai!

251
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,759
(Phoenix on parasol, Qilin in the wild)

252
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,910
Xin Yi!

253
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,870
Senior, what do you want now?

254
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,759
Xin Yi!

255
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,719
Why did you lie to me?

256
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,679
Why did you betray me?

257
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,150
You liar!

258
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,479
The truth's already out.

259
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,279
Guan Shanhai is suspicious now.

260
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,950
What else can I do for you?

261
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,239
Now, tell me

262
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,030
why he was in the car.

263
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,999
Didn't you tell me

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,319
he wouldn't be there?

265
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,990
How would I know why he was in the car?

266
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,710
It was you.

267
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,879
You told him!

268
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,719
Why else would Guan Shanhai reject me?

269
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,919
You ruined me!

270
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,070
It was you!

271
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,710
You brought this on yourself.

272
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,470
You're just reaping what you sowed.

273
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,119
You think kicking me out

274
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,070
will make Guan Shanhai trust you?

275
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,470
Keep dreaming!

276
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,879
Listen up!

277
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,270
What happened to me will happen to you!

278
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,590
Not necessarily.

279
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,950
I'm not like you.

280
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,750
I have what he wants most.

281
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,670
If I can't have it, no one else will.

282
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,079
Xin Yi!

283
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,310
Are you okay?

284
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,230
Xin Yi!

285
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,630
Are you hurt?

286
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,390
