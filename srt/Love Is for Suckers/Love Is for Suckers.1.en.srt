What...

163
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,370
What don't we have?

164
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,930
Chemistry...

165
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,950
I'm not into you, so we...

166
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,990
Let's just stay in a good older sister and younger brother relationship from now on.

167
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,000
Hello, I'm John Jang.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,100
Okay, today's star of the show is the penis fish; penis fish.

169
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,970
Wow, just look at the size, the size!

170
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,870
We're going to take the prepared penis fish and add it to the ramen.

171
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,550
[Penis fish added.]
The penis fish contains glycine and alanine

172
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,400
- Wow, every... single thing he does is unappealing.
- which makes it taste sweet.

173
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
Gosh.

174
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,510
Chef John.

175
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,560
You could've said that over the phone or by text,

176
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,520
but why did you go through the trouble of coming here and telling me face-to-face?

177
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,790
Manners.

178
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,380
You.

179
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,140
A face-to-face is better than "uncontact."

180
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,230
And moreover, Sis, you're six years older than I am,

181
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,120
so "age before beauty." (Jang you you seo)

182
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,760
Do you want to write a will?
(Yoo Seo also means "will")

183
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,330
I'm sorry?

184
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,900
Anyway, I understand what you're trying to say.

185
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,590
A close older sister and younger brother... fine.

186
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,570
Let's do that.

187
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,750
As expected, Sis, you're really chill and charismatic!

188
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,210
Don't act awkward on the film set, just in case.

189
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,720
And let's just focus on our work from now on.

190
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,670
That sounds perfect to me.

191
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,130
If you're done, then let's go.

192
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,680
I'll take you home.

193
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,410
But... Chef John...

194
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,470
Who is it?

195
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,260
Gosh...

196
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,370
2,000,000 won.

197
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,770
You slept with him?

198
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,590
That son of a bitch...

199
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
Listen to me.

200
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,940
This is the last thing I said to John Jang,

201
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,080
and I want to know how this sounds to you.

202
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,560
I mean... no matter who I'm with,

203
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,630
my energy explodes like hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid.

204
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,810
How would you know your chemistry with me when we haven't even done anything yet?

205
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,930
"How would you know your chemistry with me when we haven't even slept together yet?"

206
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,960
That's what it sounds like.

207
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,660
That's honestly not what I meant.

208
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,310
"How would you know when... you haven't even dated me?"

209
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,020
That's what I meant...

210
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,320
Look at you, gosh.

211
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,310
How would you know your chemistry with me when we haven't even done anything yet?

212
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,390
It would've been nice... if we did.

213
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,510
I believe you'd be skilled.

214
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,080
But the chemistry I was talking about was our tiki-taka.

215
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,600
Tiki... taka...

216
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,820
Give and take, you know?

217
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,780
I don't think we have good communication.

218
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,450
Damn it!

219
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,070
That bastard and I... don't have good communication.

220
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,370
We absolutely don't!

221
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,710
Goo Yeo Reum, you've been humiliated.

222
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,110
How old is John Jang again?

223
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,880
31.

224
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,470
You've just been rejected by a guy six years younger than you?

225
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,860
Huh?

226
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,790
Wow, disgraceful. So disgraceful.

227
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,580
Let's stop eating and go to sleep, please!

228
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,410
Jae Hoon,

229
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,460
my wound from breaking up is so painful.

230
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,210
Hey, how is a break-up when it ended after some flirting?

231
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,500
Sometimes, failed flirting is

232
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,280
much worse than breaking up in a relationship.

233
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,980
Yeo Reum, be a bit more cool.

234
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,240
I... hate the word "cool."

235
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,810
And I abhor the word "some."
(Flirting, as in "something" is going on between two people)

236
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,520
Why do you hate "some"? It's so rational.

237
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,420
I want to raise an uprising

238
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,250
against the malicious social phenomenon in which

239
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,050
I feel similar feelings of love without any responsibility.

240
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,880
I mean, try resetting your mindset.

241
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,250
While enjoying the excitement and joy of dating,

242
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,900
you get to avoid commitment and the tiring cons of being in a relationship.

243
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,380
Sounds like bullshit.

244
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,640
Accept "some" as part of your daily life. Like eating and pooping.

245
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,060
Is eating and pooping light to you?

246
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,530
If we don't do those things, we're dead.

247
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,800
No! This is why John Jang cut it off with you.
- Shit...

248
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,600
- Who dates an old fogey like you these days?
- Who are you calling an old fogey?

249
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,390
How is treating someone's feelings seriously being an old fogey? Huh? How?

250
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,480
What kind of old fogey did this?

251

[Program Name: "Ramen Chef," Viewer Ratings: 0.92%]

253
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,910
- Yeo Reum, are you okay?
- I'm not okay.

254
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,000
What's with this public execution?

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,460
He could've just sent it to our group chat, but he troubled himself with personally writing it...

256
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,700
He said in order to survive in a new media environment,

257
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,320
we will have to revamp our organization in an analog and intuitive way.

258
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,870
I wasn't expecting him to use this kind of debilitating shock therapy.

259
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:09,840
To be honest, this situation isn't entirely your fault.

260
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,780
Other channels are pitting against us with major dramas and well-known variety shows,

261
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,870
but you just joined the fight as a human shield!

262
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,200
Exactly.

263
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,220
And this poster...

Isn't this too cruel?

We're not back-in-the-days anymore.

266

What kind of...

267
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,370
I'm about to feel offended!

268
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,470
You're the one who offended me.

269
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,020
Whenever I check the viewer ratings of "Ramen Chef,"

270
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,830
I feel like my lifespan decreases.

271
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,140
But, Director,

272
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,310
I don't think... I'm entirely at fault.

273
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,270
Everyone uses OTT service. Who watches live broadcasts these days?

274
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,300
Look at you. You're coming at me, now?

275

- You're such a headache.

All right, PD Goo from Generation M.

279
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,940
What might this be?

280

There's a program that started from 3% and increased to 20%,

but how did yours fall from 5% to 0%?

282
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,040
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,900

284
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,660
Gosh.

She's in a bad mood.

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,600
Be quiet.

287
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,080
PD Goo, are you okay?

288
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,690

Senior! I'll start by ripping down that poster in the hallway.

294

- I'll rip it down, burn it to flames, and write an apology!
- Sure.

- Sang Woo, sit down.
- Okay.

296
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,040
PD Goo, did you watch "Kingdom of Love" last week?

297
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,780
I couldn't because I was up several nights in the editorial room.

298
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,270
I see...

299
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,970
- They had octopus on the show!
- Octopus?

300
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,520
But that's our item for this week.

301
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,000
Exactly...

302
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,890
Octopus was a top search word all weekend.

303
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,810
The community has also been doing parodies of octopuses.

304
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,050
Isn't that a good thing?

305
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,380
Since it's like this anyway, let's do an octopus parody, too!

306
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,830
Stay put!

307
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,120
Senior, if you want to change it to Webfoot octopus or baby octopus—

308
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,140
Why would I change my item because of "Kingdom"?

309
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,980
Sorry.

310
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,390
PD Goo, I heard you were college alumni with Kang Chae Ri from "Kingdom of Love"?

311
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,620
Was she always a sociopath?

312
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,740
I don't know. I didn't even know she existed in college.

313
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,450
I was an insider,

314
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,040
and she was a total outsider.

315
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,450
She couldn't even dare to talk to me back then.

316
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,980
You've grown a lot, Kang Chae Ri.

317
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,300
Unni, where did you buy your swimsuit?

318
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,220
It's so pretty!

319
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,870
Hey, you f***ing bitch.

320
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,170

when a three-legged octopus suffers hair loss?

443
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,670
The answer is a one-legged octopus. Why?

444
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,830
Because he's missing hair.
(Also sounds like "two legs.")

445
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,470
Now, octopuses are—

449
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,360
Why did I play rock? Why?

450
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,410
Yes!

Okay, have a seat and rest.

Of course, he's my servant.

You startled me.

470
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,290
Are you even getting paid for this?

471
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,350
Of course, I do. Five bills every month.

472
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,580
You only get 500,000 won?

473
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,240
50,000 won. Wow!

474

Hey, Oh Hye Jin, he's not your servant. He's your slave.

00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,510
You know,

476
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,970
whenever I'm sad, I clean this sink.

477
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,810
Moisture, moisture. Humidity, humidity!

478
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,050
Hey, let me use your truck today.

479
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,710
Why the truck, all of a sudden?

480
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,970
It's been long since I made Yeo Reum smile.

If you do this, the innards will come out, but you can just put them aside like this.

502

I'll start by making vegetable broth.

503
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,790
Cut the radish into pieces.

504
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,440
When you make the broth... can you show them the vegetables?

505
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,060
Just cut them up into large pieces.

506

Okay, we'll film you tasting each other's now.

We'll have Chef John taste the master's first.

515
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,660
The taste of the ocean is very rich.

516

The noodles are so chewy. It's the best.

You also said last week's penis fish would be a big hit.

Senior, supporting directors learn it's a virtue

Older women are cost-effective.

You don't know much yet,

541
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,410
but when you're too lazy for a relationship and you just want "some,"

542
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,810
meet an older woman.

543
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,360
But... why?

544
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,400
Older women aren't bothersome to men.

545
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,650
They play well alone and are good at using money.

546
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,020
And once in a while, you also learn a thing or two from conversing with them.

Wow, what a useful tip!

00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,200
Why is it so hard to see your face?

646
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,480
When we live under the same Seoul sky.

647
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,100
We message each other every day.

648
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,710
You haven't forgotten about your blind date at noon, right?

649
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,350
When did I agree?

650
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,850
I told you I'm not going on any blind dates!

651
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,430
When did you ever?

652
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,800
You said you don't stop women from leaving or coming.

653
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,130
I told you I don't do blind dates, though!

654
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,720
Oh, so you have preferences, too?

655
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,570
I thought you met with just about anyone.

656
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,430
It's good manners to refuse women who come seriously

657
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,540
on the premise of marriage in the first place.

658
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,390
Did you age through your ass?

659
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,960
You're almost a 40-year-old mid-elderly.

660
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,160
How long are you going to live that carefreely?

661
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,690
Did you go through something today?

662
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,430
And what do you mean mid-elderly?

663
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,810
Mom, I just turned 37 years old!

664
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:45,740
Yeah, Mom. How is Brother a mid-elderly?

665
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,310
You went too far.

666
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,110
Then is your brother in his youth?

667
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:53,500
Not exactly in his youth, but mid-elderly is a bit extreme.

668
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,070
Middle-aged is more like it.

669
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
That's more annoying.

670
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,090
She's a gentle young lady, so go and show some good manners.

671
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,470
I told you I don't like blind dates.

672
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,760
No way...

673
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,930
is she not home yet?

674
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,460
Gosh, I was just playing around.

675
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,270
Goo Yeo Reum, are you on your way to editing?

676
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,100
Hey, why didn't you pick up your phone— Hey, why are you ignoring my calls?

677
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,830
Do you know me?

678
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,180
A stranger keeps talking to me.

679
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,770
Hey, come on. I was just playing around.

680
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,600
It wasn't funny to me.

681
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,510
I mean, was it that humiliating that I wore some joggers and drove a truck?

682
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,870
Why are you materialistic?

683
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,760
Fine. I'm materialistic.

684
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,230
If a man who looked well off picked me up...

685
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,770
I thought I would feel less humiliated in front of John Jang, so I asked you a favor.

686
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,190
It wasn't even that hard, but you couldn't even do that for me?

687
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,820
That's what I don't understand.

688
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,900
Who the hell is John Jang that you're trying to look good in front of him?

689
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,760
It's not that I want to look good in front of him!

690
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,590
Seriously...

691
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,470
You don't even know.

692
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,280
Hey, what's wrong? Are you crying?

693
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,950
I just feel so petty.

694
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,970
I don't care if I'm not in a relationship...

695
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,790
My life is busy and exhausting enough without that stuff...

696
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,360
But...

697
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,750
I just feel shabby sometimes.

698
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,670
After I reached a certain age,

699
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,230
there was no one who liked me.

700
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,770
And that made me feel like I was flawed.

701
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,540
Why are you digging yourself into a hole?

702
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,440
When your "some" comes to an end, acting nonchalant is difficult.

703
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,090
Trying to look good for a man makes me feel cheap, too.

704
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,970
Working hard, trying,

705
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,050
and having expectations...

706
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,090
makes me feel unattractive.

707
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,900
So just do it lightly.

708
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,790
Take the easy road.

709
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,860
Either have light flings with men,

710
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,040
or just don't meet them at all if you can't.

711
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,930
If it's not a really good man, there's no need to meet anyone else.

712
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,340
Why do you try so hard with such ambiguous bastards?

713
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,000
Since no one tries hard with me.

714
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,190
At some point,

715
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,340
no one is curious about me anymore.

716
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,210
You wouldn't know how this feels.

717
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:51,760
God...

718
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,080
[Delete]

719
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,770
Excuse me!

720
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,160
Are you okay? Someone call 911.

721
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,600
Yeah, that's good.

722
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,820
Emergency?
- Are you okay?

723
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,740
There was an accident, and the person is unconscious.

724
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,650
Please hurry over to the intersection at...

725
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,150
Is he hurt anywhere else?

726
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,080
[Cosmetic Surgery, Park Jae Hoon]

727
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,800
Nice to meet you.

728
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,970
Now, I'm going to... start the filler procedure.

729
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,840
It's going to sting.

730
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,820
You're all accomplices.

731
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,630
Hey, Goo Yeo Reum, what's wrong with our truck?

732
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,130
I think it has vintage swag to it.

733
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:57,030
Honey, do you think that swag will have an effect on John Jang?

734
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:01,320
I'm the one at fault for having the slightest expectation of

735
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,810
Park Jae Hoon's function as a man.

736
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,350
Jae Hoon's manly function is actually incredible.

737
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:11,000
I went to wake him up a few days ago. And inside his pants stood waiting...

738
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,200
Honey!

739
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,550
We're not talking about that function right now!

740
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,610
Yeah?

741
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:31,250
It's my fault, my fault, and my fault again.

742
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,580
Cheer up.

743
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,820
You want more black beans?

744
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,200
Forget it. I don't want any.

745
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,290
- Hey, Dae Shik.
- Hey, Jae Hoon,

746
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,170
we were pulverized because of you.

747
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,050
Yeo Reum was there? What did she say?

748
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,980
Geez, man. You should've gotten dressed up!

749
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,800
How desperate must Yeo Reum have been to ask you that favor?

750
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,230
I was just playing around, but she— Gosh.

751
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,400
Playing—

752
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,170
Hey, Park Jae Hoon!

753
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,090
That John Jang or ssamjang, the ridiculous bastard
(Fermented soybean sauce.)

754
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,840
said our Yeo Reum was cost-effective.

755
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,500
He said having "some" with older women,

756
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,390
is extremely cost-effective because they're good at spending money and aren't bothersome!

757
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,960
He said that about Yeo Reum?

758
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,710
I heard you're very busy.

759
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,030
Did you set time aside to come here?

760
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,530
Pardon?

761
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,360
Oh, yes. Yes...

762
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,530
Then for lunch... The brunch menu here is nice.

763
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,560
You should eat something and...

764
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,490
It's okay.

765
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:09,150
If you're a cosmetic surgeon, you must have very high standards.

766
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:12,070
And you must see a lot of pretty women.

767
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:16,590
Rather than pretty women, I meet a lot of women who want to become pretty.

768
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,410
That's true.

769
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,020
I heard you even graduated first in medical school.

770
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,740
And your father is also a medical school professor.

771
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,640
You must take after your father's intelligence.

772
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,740
Father... was a professor.

773
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,460
He passed away.

774
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,330
You must not have known that.

775
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,750
Oh... I had no idea.

776
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,120
I don't specialize in cosmetic surgery, either.

777
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,240
I carry my medical license and move from place to place.

778
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,390
To put it simply, I'm a part-timer.

779
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,100
I don't care about those things.

780
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,540
Why not? Of course, you need to measure specs.

781
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,070
I think you could meet a way better man than me.

782
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,350
Look at the time.

783
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,770
I'll leave first.

784
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,800
It was nice to meet you.

785
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,510
Please charge this card.

786
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,090
I'll pay for the coffee.

787
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,060
No. I think you were dragged out to this meeting.

788
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,060
It's on me.

789
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,370
I'm sorry, but if you're going to embarrass someone like this,

790
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,370
just don't come out next time.

791
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:01,830
When a blind date is set, I'm curious about who I'll end up meeting,

792
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:05,370
and I harbor expectations that this man might be my soulmate.

793
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,370
I put effort into what I'd wear for the past couple of days,

794
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:11,440
and in order to look pretty to you, who I've never even seen before,

795
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,250
I went to the shop early in the morning to do my makeup and hair.

796
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,830
That's how I came out to this meeting.

797
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,800
You think you were to my liking?

798
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,290
This man that's sitting in front of me in joggers,

799
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,310
might happen to be a good person,

800
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:29,780
and he might... be a suitable person for me,

801
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:36,590
so I did my best to keep an open mind and get to know you.

802
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,780
Excuse me, Han Ji Yeon!

803
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,570
I'm sorry. I was rude.

804
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:05,980
If I might explain, today's blind date was set by my mother one-sidedly.

805
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,150
I just found out last night.

806
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,890
Your excuse is cliche.

807
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,450
Yes, you might hear it as an obvious excuse,

808
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,720
but it's the truth.

809
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,900
You provided your valuable time,

810
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,900
so I'm sorry.

811
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,080
Thank you for the coffee.

812
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,960
Take care.

813
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,100
Look at this. Oh, my gosh!

814
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,780
This is too extreme.

815
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,660
Gosh.

816
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,350
Look at her weird expression.

817
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,730
What's so funny?

818
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,920
A celeb I like posted a funny photo.

819
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,860
A funny photo?

820
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,680
Her front teeth are...

821
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:04,930
[#ramenPD, #mudspirit, #riseviewrate, #handsomechef]

822
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,770
PD Goo, this is today's film concept.

823
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,920
- Thank you.
- Sure.

824
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,160
- Yeah.
- Goo Yeo Reum, where are you right now?

825
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,260
Why? I'm working.

826
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,670
Are you on your way to film?

827
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,100
What are you filming this time?

828
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,020
Soy sauce ramen, why?

829
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,190
Soy sauce ramen?

830
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,460
Where are you going to film that?

831
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,450
- There are quite a lot of jars.
- Yes.

832
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,990
- We're the 9th generation of a 350-year tradition.
- Oh, I see.

833
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:20,950
Ma'am, we're just going to get a brief sketch of you introducing your soy sauce.

834
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,860
We boil it every week during the winter solstice and ferment it for three months,

835
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,240
and we do this once a year on New Year's month.

836
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,280
We'll start filming now. Everyone, fighting!

837
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,340
Cue!

838
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,340
Today, we have a soy sauce master with us.

839
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,930
What ingredients have you prepared?

840
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,810
Maybe it's because of the quality, but it smells so nice.

841
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,870
The ramen is complete.

842
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,930
We'll get an insert of the completed dishes.

843
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,630
Ramen Chef.

844
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:00,970
Cut!

845
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,980
Good job!

846
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,300
- Thank you!
- Good job.

847
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,360
Anyone who's hungry should. Good job.

848
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,140
Today's film was really...

849
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,400
What the?

850
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,040
My necklace.

851
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,620
Huh?

852
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,300
- Where did my necklace go?
- Good job.

853
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,590
What's wrong?

854
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,440
My necklace disappeared.

855
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,820
Man, my necklace!

856
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,110
I'm going nuts.

857
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,500
What's wrong with Chef John?

858
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,770
He lost his sponsored designer necklace.

859
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,190
Good for him.

860
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,080
But he thinks he dropped it in a soy sauce pot.

861
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,010
You don't think it might cause a problem with the soy sauce, do you?

862
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,310
No way.

863
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,950
He didn't drop it in their old soy sauce jar, did he?

864
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,180
Senior, I can do it.

865
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,930
It's a seven-year-old soy sauce.

866
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:57,450
We need to find it in one try, so I'll do it.

867
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,970
That's my necklace! Amazing!

868
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,640
PD Goo,

869
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,970
incredible!

870
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,160
This is really expensive.

871
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,450
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

872
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,300
Sis, I really love you!

873
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,130
God, I love you.

874
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,300
Sis, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to eat dinner with me?

875
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,040
I didn't find it for you because I like you.

876
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,430
I found it because I didn't want to ruin their soy sauce.

877
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,580
Anyhow, it doesn't change the fact that I'm grateful.

878
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,710
I'll buy you something delicious.

879
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,070
Chef John,

880
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,030
I heard everything.

881
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,300
Heard what?

882
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,150
You should be careful when you're wearing a mic.

883
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,750
Any one of the staff might be able to hear you.

884
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

885
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,830
Meeting an older woman is cost-effective.

886
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,240
I heard everything.

887
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,490
Sis, you see what I meant is...

888
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,830
Men speak comfortably when they're alone.

889
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,130
No need to make excuses.

890
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:57,660
And don't call me Sis.

891
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,220
I'm not that chill of a person,

892
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:03,900
so let's just save face with each other. Okay?

893
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,600
Honestly, it's not like I'm wrong.

894
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,780
To put it bluntly. You also enjoyed playing around with me.

895
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,230
We both enjoyed our time with no strings attached.

896
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,540
That's called being cost-effective.

897
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,200
Dating and cost-effectiveness shouldn't be used in the same context.

898
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,430
Wait! Were you actually trying to become legitimate with me?

899
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,050
You liked me?

900
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,980
Get out of the way. You're blocking the road.

901
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,140
We're in Korea, don't "hey" me.

902
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,240
Little Brother Joon Jeong,

903
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,790
- give me your phone.
- What?

904
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,440
I said, give me your phone.

905
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,710
Who the hell are you...

906
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,090
to ask for my phone?

907
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,920
You little...

908
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,670
Hand it over.

909
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,490
Why?

910
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,660
Hurry up and give it to me.

911
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,540
That's what I thought.

912
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:03,530
Gosh, this isn't right.

913
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,070
Don't infringe on her portrait rights.

914
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,690
Upload your face.

915
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:09,870
And...

916
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:12,240
treat PD Goo Yeo Reum with respect.

917
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,710
If you act up one more time, I'll...

918
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,370
- Did you serve in the military?
- Yes.

919
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,950
You have the right posture.

920
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,010

You're hungry, right?

924
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,480
Should we eat Korean beef rib eye?

925
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,820
I said, what's going on?

926
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,850

I'm just some guy who's trying his best to look good to her. Why?
