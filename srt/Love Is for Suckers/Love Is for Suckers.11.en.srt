00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,740
Han Ji Yeon had a totally crappy look on her face earlier.

165
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,600
They're... high school friends.

166
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,750
Really? Friends?

167
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,950
I'm aware that Jae Hoon joined this program because of PD Goo.

168
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,540
What the? Is it friend chance or something?

169
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,320
And where might our bro John get that kind of top intel?

170
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,850
You should be friendly with the staff.

171
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,540
You might get some special treatment.

172
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,830
That's how I happened to find out.

173
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,030
But if you consider Ji Yeon,

174
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,060
he shouldn't have done that even if they're friends, no?

175
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,460
Exactly!

176

All that trouble to go back.

Don't you guys have any female friends?

182
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,410
Me? When?

183
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,270
I'm not someone who takes sides.

What brings you to my room?

202

I usually don't stick my nose where it doesn't belong,

203
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,920
but it kept bothering me.

204
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,730
This.

205
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,630
What is this?

206
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,040
What do you mean?

207
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,170
It's the string that you severed before you left last night.

208
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,970
Did you know people on the internet

209
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,040
call you superior Jae Hoon, inferior Ji Yeon?

210
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,190
Superior Jae Hoon... Inferior Ji Yeon?

211
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,660
You're superior, and Ji Yeon is inferior.

212
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,730
Just because Han Ji Yeon likes you more,

213
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,010
she's getting ridiculed online.

214
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,970
I had no idea about that.

215
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,180
That string...

216
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,060
Everyone severed it as soon as we got back to our rooms.

217
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,600
But... it holds a different meaning when the man severs it one-sidedly.

218
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,450
Women get hurt, Superior Jae Hoon.

219
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,530
I happened to come across her last night.

220
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,400
Han Ji Yeon was crying a lot by herself.

221
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
I grabbed it out of the trash,

222
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,180
and it's up to you whether you officially sever it again or not.

223
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,640
Whether you explain to her why you left her behind or not.

The male cast will ask the female cast out on a date today.

229
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,980
When the female cast member you want to date passes by,

230
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,940
you just need to walk along with her.

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,370
It's only fun with variants.

253

We even added a random date, but they won't mix.

Why are they all so obvious? So boring.

We can just add another random date next time.

257

I don't think that will be enough to shake things up.

258

Then...

259
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,700
shall we release some gossip, so they can yank on each other's hair?

260
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,180
We can tell the kids to do so. Do it subtly.

261

We did that in Season 1.

262

We need to bring in something new.

263

Why not?

266
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,390
She said during her interview that she was treated for bipolar disorder.

267
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,680
That's why I chose her. So she can cause trouble.

That's true, but not now.

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,050
back then.

331
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,210
Why all of a sudden?

332
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,750
When "Ramen Chef" was at its high,

333
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,050
I came out on TV and people recognized me,

334
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,710
so I must've turned arrogant with no regard for anything else.

335
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:20,060
But after coming here and spending each day with you,

336
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,900
I realized you're a very good person.

337
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,520
You have a great sense of responsibility and are very considerate.

338
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,370
I don't have other intentions.

339
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,630
Really, as I said...

340
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,710
I recently started thinking I should apologize to you.

341
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,900
And well, perhaps,

342
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,240
I think you could've been the best woman I had flirted with

343
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,230
and realized I have very poor taste in women...

344
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,400
What's this? You're embarrassing me.

345
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,930
We could at least say hi from now on, right?

346
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,500
You've been ignoring me all this time.

347
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,320
Sure.

348
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,480
Let's at least greet each other from now on.

349
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,850
Okay.

350
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,160
Then I'll get going.

351
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,070
Chef John.

352
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,310
Thank you for saying that.

353
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,340
My pleasure. Yeah.

354
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,130
Who is it?

355
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,800
What were you doing?

356
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,470
I was just taking a break.

357
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,950
I came to see if you're doing okay.

358
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,010
Oh, I see.

359
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,160
I'm okay.

360
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,370
Are you really okay?

361
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:30,320
You couldn't get selected even once and couldn't go on a single date.

362
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,540
If it were me, I would go crazy with humiliation.

363
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,550
I'm... really okay.

364
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,540
Is there a male cast member you're interested in?

365
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,420
It's okay to poke around here and there.

366
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,410
The love line hasn't been finalized yet.

367
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,370
You're trying to have people badmouth me, aren't you?

368
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,430
Trying to get me to hit on the guys.

369
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,840
Isn't that better than being a wallflower?

370
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,660
If it were me...

371
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,200
I would choose to be a villain rather than a nameless side character.

372
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,440
Or you can continue with no presence.

373
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,270
The decision is up to you.

374
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,920
Ji Yeon.

375
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,850
Thank you.

376
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,300
Ji Yeon,

377
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,670
I'm very sorry for leaving like that... last night.

378
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,710
It's okay.

379
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,760
You don't need to speak any more about last night.

380
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,800
There's a camera, too.

381
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,630
Okay.

382
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,030
Ji Yeon, what would you like to drink?

383
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,650
Isn't that Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon?

384
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,590
It is them! Whoa, amazing!

385
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,140
I'll get fruit juice.

386
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,180
I'll get a hot Americano.

387
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,040
Hey, look.

388
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,100
I got a good shot.

389
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:40,280
When I went off the grid, thank you for coming to find me.

390
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,590
I never properly thanked you.

391
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,360
I didn't... believe in the malpractice rumors.

392
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,230
Why didn't you?

393
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,250
It could've been true.

394
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,310
Oddly... I wanted to trust you.

395
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,880
You know what they say.

396
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,690
Liking someone means...

397
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:06,950
trusting that they possess a kind heart.

398
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,560
I guess...

399
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,150
I just wanted to believe you.

400
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,100
How did you hurt your hand?

401
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Oh, during the haunted house date.

402
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,680
Let me see.

403
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,110
The wound is pretty deep.

404
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,880
Oh, it's fine. It'll heal with time.

405
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,390
No, give me a second. I'll go to the pharmacy.

406
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,900
Oh, I'm really fine.

407
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,760
No, the wound is open. How can you be fine?

408
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,610
Stay here for a sec.

409
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,530
Hey, this is amazing!

410
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,240
Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon are on a date right now.

411
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,520
What are they like in person? Hey!

412
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,910
Inferior Ji Yeon is totally bending over backward for him.

413
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,310
For real! For real, yes!

414
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,500
She must not have any pride.

415
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,470
I wouldn't be able to do that.

416
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,250
You, too? Yeah.

417
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,290
Anyway, hurry up and get over here.

418
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,020
Ji Yeon, get up.

419
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,650
- Come with me.
- What?

420
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,140
I don't want to make you wait by yourself.

421
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,040
Come with me to the pharmacy.

422
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,270
How are you with your parents?

423
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,100
Me? Well, I really don't listen to them.

424
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,390
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, do you have a good relationship?

425
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,570
Me?

426
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,390
It's been a while since I buried my younger sister... in my mind.

427
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,710
- Why, why?
- I don't see her as a human being.

428
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,920
- Why?
- Even this morning...

429
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,170
It'll scar.

430
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,020
It's fine.

431
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,810
You shouldn't leave a scar on your hand.

432
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,930
It doesn't hurt?

433
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,050
It's tolerable.

434
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,550
Are you usually good at tolerating things?

435
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,940
My wound?

436
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,280
It heals well, even if I leave it alone.

437
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,910
My regeneration skills are better than you think.

438
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,660
Did you know people look at us

439
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,510
and call us Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon?

440
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,940
- Yes.
- It doesn't bother you?

441
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,430
It's true, though.

442
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:19,500
I like you more, so I am inferior.

443
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,470
- Ji Yeon...
- Must you...

444
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,040
kill me twice with that?

445
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,420
You could just act like you don't know.

446
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,970
Saying it to my face...

447
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:39,180
Hearing it directly from you...

448
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,560
does hurt a bit.

449
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,660
Did you know people look at us and call us Superior Jae Hoon and Inferior Ji Yeon?

450
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,050
- Yes.
- It doesn't bother you?

451
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,270
It's true, though.

452
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,820
I don't like it.

453
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,440
I wish you were the superior one.

454
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,530
Thank you for liking me first.

455
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,200
But from now on, I'll like you more.

456
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,930
Lovely view here, isn't it?

457
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,070
Yes, it's nice.

458
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,230
Oh, try the macarons, too. They're delicious.

459
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,660
Okay.

460
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,720
By the way...

461
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Yes.

462
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,020
Joon Ho... what do you like about me?

463
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,770
Why do you ask, all of a sudden?

464
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,770
I get curious once in a while,

465
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,540
why an attractive man like you is being nice to me.

466
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,500
Well, I think you're...

467
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,900
overall a bit...

468
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,180
I like almost everything about you.

469
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,130
Okay.

470
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,900
Oh, but... um...

471
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,040
sometimes I get upset because of you.

472
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,720
Why?

473
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,360
You're still having trouble opening your heart to me.

474
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,250
Does it seem like I can't open up to you?

475
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,980
Yes.

476
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,420
I think you're... scared of men.

477
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,030
What?

478
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,440
Ji Wan,

479
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,610
I'll be honest with you.

480
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,380
You know how you told me last time that as a child...

481
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,720
you were sexually harassed.

482
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,340
I think you're scared of men because of that,

483
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,470
and that's why you can't open up to me, either.

484
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,020
That's absolutely not true. It's really not!

485
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,640
But that's how I feel.

486
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,260
If I... upset you...

487
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,470
in any way...

488
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,170
that's...

489
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,020
because I've never been in a relationship...

490
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,170
and don't know how to express my feelings.

491
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,720
I've never thought of you...

492
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,060
as a bad person because of my...

493
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,230
personal history... or trauma of being...

494
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,300
