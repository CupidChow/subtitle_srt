163
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,020
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,950
I should've called to say hello first.

165
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,200
How are you doing these days?

166
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,020

I'm working as a paid doctor at a local plastic surgery place.

This is the abstract of the thesis that I published this time. Try and read it once.

169
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,990
Then, I want to...

170
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,160
work on the next thesis with you.

Also... I don't belong in the medical office anymore...

175
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,620
and I'm mindful of the juniors as well...

I'm sorry, Professor. I don't think this is a place for me.

Jae Hoon, a lot of time has passed.

Yes, this is the Ramen Chef team.

An abolition? Director...

191
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,770
I'm not saying that it'll be done right away.

192
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,990
We decided to choose after next week's viewer ratings.

193
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,360
Just how... many people's livelihoods do we have that depend on this program?

194
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,820
How could you just cut their livelihoods without notice?

195
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,140
That's why I said... we'll decide after next week's viewer ratings at least.

196
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,420
If it gets closed down all of a sudden like this... we lose our source of income right away.

197

Not even talking for myself, but what do we do for our young ones?

198
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,180
Writer, since they said they'll decide after next week's viewer ratings...

199
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,700
PD Goo, do you trust those words?

200
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,720
We're all done for.

201
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,870
Not at all. We're not done yet.

202
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,140
Even if your neck is sliced at the slaughterhouse,

203
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,210
you need to at least let out a proper scream, no?

204
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,560
That way or the other, you still die.

205
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,660
Let's scrap all the ideas that we had on the line... and make a whole new plan.

206
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,000
If the ratings go up even by 0.1 percent,

207
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,990
I'll strike a deal with the director somehow.

- Why? Do you have a good idea?

212

- Blue crabs.
- Blue crabs?

213
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,470
It's the blue crab season. A blue crab in ramen?

214
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,150
They can't switch the channel.

215
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:59,050
Also, tell Chef John... to flash his upper body while catching the crabs.

216
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,810
Why? Apparently, Kingdom's going to have his butt flashed.

217
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,740
Will he take it off?

218
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,580
He takes it off all the time.

219
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,470
Look here.

220
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,650
Nobody told him to do it, he's taking it off himself.

221
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,250
Let's do it. Come on.

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,050
Okay.

Hello.

230
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,140
Wait... how did you know about this place, Ms. Han Ji Yeon?

231
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,920
You want to have a consultation about...

232
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,070
- your bosom.
- Yes.

233
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,130
Did you come here knowing that I work here or is it a coincidence?

234
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,090
I came knowing this.

235
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,990
I asked the center director about where you work.

236
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,730
You knew my mother personally?

237
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,840
Artist Han Yoon Gi, who is exhibiting this time at the art center, is my father.

238
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,870
I know the center director well because I act as his manager and driver.

239
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,130
Let's have a meal together.

240
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,490
I'm sorry but... I have no intention of seeing someone right now...

241
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,880
or of getting married.

242
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,720
Did I ask you to marry me?

243
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,600
I said let's have a meal.

244
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,520
Studying in the U.S. since high school, I also did my master's and Ph.D. in the U.S.

245
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,330
I don't have friends in Korea.

246
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,920
I returned for now because my parents kept nagging me to get married, so...

247
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,080
it's been a while since I got to eat comfortably with someone because of the weekly blind dates.

248
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,810
Let's... just have one meal comfortably.

249
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,880
I guess you bought new a gym outfit?

250
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
How did you know?

251
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,310
You should still take off the tag first.

252
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,990
I didn't think you liked to wear gym outfits.

253
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,610
I tried to match your style since it looked like it was comfortable.

254
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,410
You can choose the menu, Ms. Han Ji Yeon.

255
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,390
Something you want to eat, comfortably.

256
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,140
Why don't we have it this weekend?

257
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,210
I have a blind date during lunch, so I'll be free in the evening.

258
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,860
Okay then, have your blind date and let's see in the evening.

259
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,500
So you're not having the consultation, right?

260
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,470
Do I...

261
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,970
- need the surgery?
- Well...

262
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,580
that's not the case...

263

- Well...
- John Jang... was rejected by Yeo Reum.

297
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,540
Whoa, incredible!

298

- Well, Hyeon So—
- John Jang...

302
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,390
was just someone Yeo Reum toyed with and discarded of, refreshingly.

303
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,460
Wow, you rock.

304

Unni, I'm going to age like you.

No, you must never become like me. Never.

Why? You're my role model.

307
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,790
Yeo Reum said she likes the taste of burning fire.

308
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,380
Yeo Reum, the burning flavor.

309
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,750
The way I see it, Yeo Reum has bad luck.

310
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,320
Who was it again? The one she almost married...

311
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,960
In Woo!

312
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,230
After her wedding with In Woo fell apart,

313
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,820
she was never once in a real relationship.

314
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,610
Honey, why would you bring up Kim In Woo, right now?

315
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,740
What's wrong with you?

316
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,450
Summoning an ex-boyfriend on her birthday is really crappy manners.

317
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,280
Is that bastard just any old ex-boyfriend?

318
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,980

I don't know what came over me at the time.

I rejected the man of my life who proposed to me,

360

because I prioritized my work before love.

Not to the point of regret,

but sometimes... I think about it.

01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,630
- How do you do it?
- This...

806
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:09,270
Here.

807
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,570
The bar that protrudes is male.

808
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,380
The one with the hole is female.

809
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,010
Put the male bar into the female bar like this.

810
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,270
- And?
- Turn.

811
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:21,320
Okay.

812
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:25,960
Put the male bar into the female bar hole and turn.

813
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,540
The bar...

814
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,470
Put it in.

815
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,700
Male... female...

816
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,470
Is it going in?

817
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,900
Female bar...

818
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,550
- Male bar...
- Female bar...

819
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,560
Male bar. Female bar.

820
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,820
Female, male bar...

821
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,540
Female, male bar.

822
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:54,040
Jae Hoon, not there.

823
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,180
Lift your leg.

824
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,290
You can put it in nicely.

825
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:58,560
Wait, wait, wait!

826
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,720
Wait. No, no, no...

827
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,200
Okay. Got it.

828
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,490
- Okay, okay. Okay, okay.
- Got it?

829
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,240
Okay...

830
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,480
Assembly is more complicated than I thought.

831
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,930
Thanks to you, I'll get a goodnight sleep tonight.

832
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,080
Thank you!

833
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,500
- It's cozier than I expected.
- Right?

834
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,880
I should've gotten it a long time ago.

835
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,170
Did you catch the mosquito?

836
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:22,620
Not yet.

837
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:25,930
It bit your face and you let it live?

838
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,810
I have to see it to catch it.

839
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:31,890
Gosh, I bought an electric fly swatter to catch it. It's not here, though.

840
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,520
What if it's in here by chance?

841
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,670
Don't get bitten all night. Check before you go to sleep.

842
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,350
All right.

843
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,340
♫ What can make me flutter in the wind like this ♫

844
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:44,320
♫ Carrying pink imaginations between the two of us ♫

845
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,360
♫ I don't even blink ♫

846
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:51,660
♫ I can't believe this feeling ♫

847
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:59,810
♫ You gently blow into my bleak daily life ♫

848
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:05,430
♫ In the flow, something changed. Oh stop it, no! ♫

849
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:08,580
[Love is for Suckers]

850
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,600
So? You hugged and then what happened after?

851
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,200
Describe it in more detail.

852
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,130
- It's been so long since someone gave me that look.
- What look?

853
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,570
You're mine!

854
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,330
How is my son?

855
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,710
I really like you, Ji Yeon.

856
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:23,330
We're slowly getting to know each other.

857
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:25,280
Jae Hoon and Yeo Reum aren't in a man-and-woman relationship.

858
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,890
It's more like human-to-human.

859
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,280
We should help them, so they get together.

860
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,600
You let a man into your house at 1:00 a.m.?

861
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,910
Yeo Reum, I'm still not over you.

862
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,900
♫ Wrap your body around me ♫

863
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:40,200
♫ Even with your subtle breath, I feel dizzy ♫
