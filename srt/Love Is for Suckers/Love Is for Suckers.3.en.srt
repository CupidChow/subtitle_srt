But will you be okay?

153

There was a lot of talk about you going in under Kang Chae Ri.

154
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,460
What can I do?

155
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,030
The path of the cross. The path I must take.

156
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,200
Gosh, what can you do? Huh?

157
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,060
You'll have to take all her crap.

158
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,390
We're going there to be sacrifices.

159
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,620
I'll fight crap with shit.

160
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,990

Why are you doing this? I'm fine, so you eat.

164

Watching you throw yourself into "Kingdom of Love,"

I watched all of "Ramen Chef"

328
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,880
and enjoyed the pilot program you debuted with as well.

329
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,320
What did you watch it for?

330
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,460
I broke up with you because of that.

331
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:12,170
I like the programs you make because they're heartwarming.

333
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,740
Yeah.

334
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,670
I... haven't yet.

335
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,210
I haven't gotten over you yet.

336
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,020
She brings home a guy at one in the morning?

337
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,570
Goo Yeo Reum is so liberal.

338
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,080
I think I have indigestion. What will make it go away?

339
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,300
What do I do?

340
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,650
Gosh, I have indigestion at this time. What can I do?

341
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,000
That's right. At this time...

342
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,640
exercise is the way. Arm exercises.

343
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,740
Here we go.

344
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,120
Should I work out my biceps? Or my shoulders? The triceps?

345
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,690
All right.

346
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,630
I don't have strength in my arm!

347
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,950
What was that sound?

348
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,260
Jae Hoon lives upstairs.

Yeah.

352
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,530
Cleaning is best when done at dawn.

353
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:21,350
All right, I think I'm almost done,

354
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,950
so should I do the rest tomorrow?

355
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,330
Metal pots are best when dented.

356
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,650
Right?

357
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,340
At dawn... we listen to hip-hop.

358
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,530
All right. Music, start.

359

- Okay.

Is it usually this loud?

361
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,910
No. He's usually not like this, but...

362
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,200
maybe he's blasting the music, thinking that I'm not home?

363
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,720
At least you won't be bored since your schoolmate lives upstairs.

364
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,820
It does feel safer than being alone.

365
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,690
Next time, let's eat out at a nice place.

366
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,950
Thanks for today.

Doing what?

373
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,230
You're doing this on purpose because you knew that I was with Kim In Woo!

00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,510
Kim In Woo was here? I didn't know at all.

He was here, huh?

My dad...

380
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,800
got an emergency stent treatment because he was diagnosed with angina.

381
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,220
How is he doing now?

382
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,820
The procedure was done well, so we just need to keep a watch for a few days.

What do you think about the art display path?

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,410
It's nice.

391
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,040
My dad would also be satisfied, I think.

392
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,660
This exhibition is getting a lot of attention from everyone in the art field and

393
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,490
also from ordinary people, so it's quite a bit of pressure.

It's been three years.

405
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,660
I told my dad, and he was also quite surprised.

406
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,700
Back then, I was too shocked and

407
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,510
couldn't accept my husband's death,

408
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,060
so I didn't make it known to anyone.

Could you tell us what you think makes you attractive?

It feels so good to sweat it out for once.

656
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,080
I know. Going to work?

657
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,160
No, it's my day off.

658
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,790
- I'm going.
- Okay, take care.

659
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,860
Yes, Honey. It's me.

660
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,070
Damn.

661
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,460
Hey, bring rice from the rice cooker.

662
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,940
What's this?

663
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,330
You said you made something delicious. Where is the delicious stuff?

664
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,520
It's here. The spinach.

665

You've finally gone mad.

666
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,500
Is spinach something delicious?

667
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,850
Just have a bite.

668
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,160
I'm being fooled again.

669
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,380
It tastes good, right? This is Hye Jin's cooking.

670
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,150
Spinach just tastes like spinach.

671
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,140
The smell of spring is dancing in your mouth.

It's going to get soggy. Hurry up and eat.

673

Kim In Woo and Goo Yeo Reum are seeing again, I heard?

674
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,760
They're seeing again?

675
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,680

- No.

676
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,920
I don't know. What?

677
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,630
What's that? They're seeing again?

00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,460
What are you saying? Are they dating again or not?

679
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,130
Well... thinking about it,

680
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,280
it's not that they're dating again but just seeing each other.

681
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,080
You know, "Long time no see."

682
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,180
Hey, that bastard suddenly showed up

683
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,610
in front of Yeo Reum's house looking all cool.

684
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,570
You almost had me.

685
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,430
It's good for her.

686
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,800
Right, it's good for her.

687
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeo Reum did like that guy a lot, right?

688
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,550
- I'm going.
- Okay.

689
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,720
Take care.

690
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,870

- Yes, I'm leaving.

00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,150
Okay, take care.

692
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,810
Honey, as you told me to,

693
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,970
I lured him with the spinach and interrogated him.

694
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,240
Yes, and...?

695
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,360
You were completely...

696
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,510
off the radar.

697
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:08,750
What did I tell you?

698
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,270
Why? What did he say?

699
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,840
He doesn't care at all.

700
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,010
He didn't care even though you talked about Kim In Woo?

701
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:17,190
Then what? Did you think he'd flip the table or somethinhg?

702
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,450
No, even if it's not that much of a reaction...

703
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:24,980
maybe he flinched or he looked like he was uncomfortable?

704
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,700
Completely no interest.

705
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,770

Gosh, that can't be, though.

707
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,110
Honey, you seem to be greatly mistaken, but

708
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,000
Jae Hoon and Yeo Reum are not in a man and a woman relationship.

709
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,100
That makes me want to puke. They're more like...

710
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,640
a human and another human.

711
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,300
No, not at all.

712
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,830
I gave this some thought.

713
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,990
We need to help them, so they end up together.

714

Why do you keep making it a melodramatic romance?

Gosh, never mind! You never get what I'm saying.

720
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,140
- That can't be, seriously!
- No, it's not!

721
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,470
Even Park Jae Hoon and I have more possibilities.
