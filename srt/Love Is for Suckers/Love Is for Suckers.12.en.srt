[The names of places, organizations, characters, agencies, and incidents in this drama are fictitious]

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,670
Why did we name our show "Kingdom of Love"?

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,080
It's exactly what you're thinking of.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,410
It's because it reminds you of the animal kingdom.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,740
How's the dating behavior of humans especially different from the mating of animals?

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,390
Wouldn't it be sadness?

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,270
Feelings of delight or pleasure might be the same,

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,360
but humans feel pain even at the end of a short fling.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,360
And even though they experience sadness, they chase after love again.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,750
I feel like... there's no right answer when it comes to love.

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,990
Well, I'm not really sure.

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,480
Among animals, males and females have a parity exchange based on their rank.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,620
If you look closely into it, there's not that much difference between animals and humans.

23
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,010
At times, our dating relationships are also a parity exchange based on our rank.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,300
I believe that we all go through life loving and loving again

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,700
as we dream of that perfect love

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,710
that we wouldn't regret to the very end.

[Q. Is there anything you want to demonstrate through "Kingdom of Love"?]

28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,220
What I am seeking to show is something 100% real.

29
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,270
The true face of human beings in the face of love.

30
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,600
[Q. What is the reason for the popularity of "Kingdom of Love"?]

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,140
During a time when it's difficult to get married, virtual marriage shows have become popular,

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,580
and when it gets challenging to raise children, child-rearing shows have become popular.

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,680
Since it's a world where it's difficult to date,

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,400
I feel that's why a dating reality show like "Kingdom of Love" is popular.

35

[Q. Do you believe in love?]

36

That's a pretty deep question.

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,710
Well, I'm not sure.

38
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,820
Of course! I... believe in love.

39
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,560

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,600
Yes.

45
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,310
Geez. Even if viewer ratings are important, this is too much.

46
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,760
That's what I'm trying to say.

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,700
Releasing a conversation like that without even consulting us!

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,820
It's my fault.

49
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,050
Anything said in front of cameras can always be put on broadcast...

50
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,010
We're all now so used to the cameras

51
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,380
that sometimes we don't even realize they're there.

52
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,620
It's true.

53
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,110
We end up saying our inner thoughts comfortably.

54
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,690
Isn't that why there's a production staff?

55
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,430
The staff has the responsibility of protecting their cast.

56
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,730
And that's why there's an editing process.

what kind of a bastard he is for you to have him on the show?

143

with all sorts of sweet talk

145
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,780
and conned them out of their money.

146
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,060
You took our money!

147
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,960
You think I'm the only victim?

148

Do you know how many families were destroyed because of him?

You're also an accomplice.

From what I'm hearing, it seems a bit of a stretch.

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,290

166
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,800
And yet, even after the Supreme Court ruled on this, you trespassed onto someone else's filming location

167
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,760
and attacked an innocent supporting director with a knife.

168
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,090
From what I can tell,

169
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,970
you seem like the bad guy.

170
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,260
What do we do...

171
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,500
No.

172
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,560
No!

173
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
That's not true!

174
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,310
Die, everyone!

175
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,100
- Hold still!
- Are you okay?

176
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,390
Hold still!

177
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,520
No! It's not true...

178
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,140
It's not true!

179
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,070
I'm going to kill you!

180
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,320
No...

181
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,150
Give me back my life!

182
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,590
Hold still!

183
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,890
It's not true...

184
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,570
Give me back my life...

185
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,380
Senior.

186
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,110
Sang Woo... you...

187
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,760
A-Are you okay?

188
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,120
What in the world...

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,010
What's going on?

190
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,500
What is this...

191
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,620
Don't worry about me.

192
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,030
- All right.
- You've gone through a lot.

193
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,730
You all must be in so much shock.

194
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,190
It seems like the situation has been taken care of somewhat,

195
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,120
and it's already late so please return to your rooms and rest for the day.

196
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,610
Tomorrow, we will inform you all

197
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,500
regarding our official stance on this incident and the future schedule.

198
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,970
I sincerely apologize for the unfortunate event that took place.

199
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,870
All right. Understood.

200
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,910
- It's all right.
- Let's go inside.

201
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,200
Let's go.

202
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,830
I'll walk you to your room.

203
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,080
Yes. Okay.

204
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,950
Go inside and rest up.

205
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,890
Could you be with me for just a bit longer?

206
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm afraid to be by myself.

207
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,020
Okay. Sure.

208
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,580
I'll be by your side until you fall asleep.

209
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,800
What are you doing here?

210
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,870
Oh, that...

211
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,380
I didn't want to be alone in my room.

212
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,320
And that's why you're cleaning right now?

213
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,880
Yes.

214
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,130
Are you okay?

215
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,550
I'm okay...

216
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,320
Jae Hoon.

217
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,810
Yes?

218
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,930
Have you ever regretted... your decision to appear on "Kingdom of Love"?

219
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,980
No, I haven't.

220
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,490
Even after going through what we just went through,

221
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,130
you have no regrets?

222
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:52,340
♫ There's a trace of kindness that came and went ♫

223
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,520
Appearing on this show...

224
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,530
was the best option I had.

225
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:06,120
♫ And the today and tomorrow that I've been looking forward to ♫

226
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,920
♫ I become saddened all by myself ♫

227
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:20,710
♫ Sitting on two swings that are side by side ♫

228
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,830
♫ Even if I love you in my excitement ♫

229
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:32,620
♫ I'm still in the same spot like this ♫

230
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,720
♫ Saying it's okay ♫

231
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,540
♫ This is what I tell myself as a wish ♫

232
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:49,000
♫ But that's just what I want to hear from you ♫

233
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:00,110
♫ Or probably just telling myself ♫

234
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,100
♫ As I endure ♫

235
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,080
Didn't I tell you to do a proper background check on the cast?

236
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,540
A knife attack on the filming location?

237
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,400
Like, gosh...

238
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,830
Hey. I can see getting involved in a civil lawsuit during a broadcast, but isn't getting into a criminal case a bit too much?

239
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,100
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

240
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,450
Before this gets on the news and things get noisy,

241
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,310
make plans to wrap up the show earlier than scheduled.

242
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:50,150
- End the show next week.
- I can't do that.

243
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,950
I will rally up the cast and finish it off as scheduled.

244
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,060
PD Kang Chae Ri, don't be stubborn.

245
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,170
- Director...
- If we don't wrap this up quickly,

246
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,150
this issue will become too big to cover up!

247
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,990
If this gets on the news and things get noisy,

248
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,290
not only will it be a big blow to you but also to the company.

249
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,990
Goo Yeo Reum.

250
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,270
Yes, Director.

251
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,490
Make plans to wrap up the show in the next episode.

252
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,100
Help Kang Chae Ri to remediate this issue.

253
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,030
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

254
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,190
Supposedly you knew about it.

255
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,140
- About what?
- Kim Joon Ho.

256
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,200
You knew there were problems with him.

257
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,380
He had many lawsuits against him, and you knew he was pretty much a fraudster.

258
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,270
Why did you still decide to have him on the show?

259
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,740
Are you asking me because you don't know?

260
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,090
That's his role. To cause trouble and draw attention.

261
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,380
If only people who are perfectly fine are on the show,

262
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,710
would that be entertaining?

263
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,090
I can understand having people who are a bit eccentric,

264
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,270
but don't you think a conman is too much?

265
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,980
You believe the words of a crazy man who came holding a knife?

266
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,560
Even Park Ji Wan's sexual harassment issue...

267
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,450
Kim Joon Ho purposefully and intentionally mentioned that.

268
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,830
Did you really have to put that on the air?

269
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,380
- Hey, Goo Yeo Reum.
- What, Kang Chae Ri?

270
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,640
- Stop acting like you're all righteous.
- What?

271
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,940
I want... to make what sells.

272
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,080
I want to bring in the viewers by making my show entertaining and making people go wild for it.

273
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,370
I don't want the resources and energy invested in my show to go to waste.

274
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,300
Everything you said is right.

275
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,440
They're all correct, but still.

276
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,970
There's something called appropriate boundaries.

277
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,860
Appropriate boundaries...

278
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,400
Who sets that standard?

279
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,950
There's an unspoken rule—

280
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,210
You and I just have different standards.

281
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't you dare judge or look down on

282
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,980
my pure aspiration to succeed at all costs.

283
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,250
So what's going to happen?

284
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,420
- What's going on?
- I wonder what will happen.

285
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,220
Are you okay?

286
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,740
Are you okay?

287
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,620
She's coming.

288
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,490
She's here.

289
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,300
Regarding the unfortunate incident that took place last night,

290
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,290
I apologize for not being able to maintain control over the filming location

291
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,410
as the director of the show.

292
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,620
For the next two days,

293
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,210
we will stop filming the show.

294
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,740
Then, do we have to be here for those two days?

295
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,890
I will update you all again regarding the future schedule.

296
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,280
Kang Chae Ri.

297
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,890
Why didn't you tell them that we're going to wrap up the show early?

298
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,600
Because I'm not going to do that.

299
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,030
Then, what are you going to do?

300
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm going to resolve this my way.

301
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,970
You sure have a talent for causing every show you touch to fail.

302
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,990
What?

303
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,180
I'm talking about you.

304
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,660
But I refuse...

305
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,590
to get sucked into the curse that you bring with you.

306
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,060
So... is this show even able to go on?

307
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,770
PD Kim Sang Woo seemed to be hurt pretty badly.

308
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,310
Yeah, he was bleeding quite a bit.

309
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,710
Even if a person gets stabbed with a knife and the police come out,

310
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,870
they'll probably still go on with the show.

311
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,680
You know how it goes in this industry.

312
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,170
Forget the show.

313
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,900
Shouldn't we file a complaint together seeking compensation for psychological trauma?

314
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,270
Hey, hey. Everyone, we should all calm down and go inside.

315
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,090
Since we won't be filming for the next two days,

316
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,810
let's organize our thoughts while resting up and catch our breaths.

317
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,600
If we're not going to be filming,

318
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,210
is it okay if we go home and come back?

319
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,090
I don't want to stay here...

320
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,350
Oh, can we do that?

321
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,090
Until we start filming again,

322
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,500
we ask that you don't leave the premises, if possible.

323
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,960
They're too much.

324
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,310
What's this? Having a daytime drink alone?

325
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,840
I mean, we're not filming,

330
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,610
Right.

331

Oh, I'm not really good at English.

336

It just means it's quite surprising.

Oh, right.

338

I'm not good at English, either, but you're even worse!

339
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,280
It's because I was busy training,

340
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,910

Yeah, it's fine.

You're very handsome, Hoon Hui,

In any case, they say that it's really hard to see into someone's heart.

Kim Joon Ho... I've got a bitter taste in my mouth.

346

It's really hard to see into someone's heart...

I'm sorry.

But, what that man said is not true at all.

353
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,180
It's really unfair to me.

Business is like that.

If things go well, it's great. If they don't, then you lose everything.

357

It's a high-risk, high return.

358
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,510
But just because it failed,

359

♫ We're so beautiful, no need to envy anyone ♫

490
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,690
♫ Needing nothing more ♫

491
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:15,290
♫ We were in that moment ♫

492
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,680
[Mom]

493
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,050
Yeah, Mom.

494
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,110
My daughter, what are you doing? Are you busy?

495
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,740
No, I'm not busy.

496
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm just resting for a bit in my room.

497
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,670
I called because I just suddenly wanted to hear your voice.

498
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,130
Mom...

499
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,260
Yeo Reum, what's wrong?

500
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,210
Did something happen?

501
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,250
- My daughter, why are you crying?
- Mom...

502
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,340
Why am I like this?

503
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,500
I feel like...

504
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,800
I feel like I just messed everything up.

505
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,670
Yeo Reum, what's wrong?

506
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,680
What are you talking about?

507
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,340
I just...

508
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,550
It's not that anything happened.

509
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,160
Just...

510
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,400
work was a bit of a struggle today.

511
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,370
Work was a bit of a struggle today for my daughter, I see.

512
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,050
It's okay.

513
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:25,850
There are times when work goes well, and times when it doesn't.

514
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,280
Yeo Reum.

515
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,140
Should I make some tasty food and go see you?

516
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,610
I'm already full from just hearing you say that, Mom.

517
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,640
I'm okay, Mom. Don't worry about me.

518
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,510
I just...

519
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,190
got teary from hearing your voice, Mom.

520
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,970
If you ever want to see me, just say the word.

521
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,960
I'll come up to visit you with Dad.

522
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,620
All right.

523
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,200
I'll make some time on the weekend and come down to visit.

524
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,000
So don't worry too much about me, okay?

525
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Okay. I won't worry.

526
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:07,530
Mom, I'll call you back some other time.

527
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,410
Yeah. I love you, too.

528
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,220
Yeah.

529
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:35,290
But what's the Chinese character for your name, Chef?

530
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,830
Well,

531
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,380
i-it's probably pure Korean.

532
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,720
Or am I wrong?

533
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,290
But weren't you surprised, Park Ji Wan?

534
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,770
Why?

535
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,150
About what?

536
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,010
I mean...

537
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:57,570
Everyone thinks of me as someone who comes from a rich family in Gangnam.

538
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,700
But...

539
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,490
this is who I really am.

540
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,810
I grew up in a small fishing town under a single mother,

541
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,980
was always poor, and wanted to be successful,

542
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,220
so I've struggled so hard in my life.

543
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,630
A country boy with only his body and guts.

544
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,250
But, Chef, your face looks so classy

545
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,050
that you don't look anything like a country boy.

546
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,830
- What did you say?
- It's true.

547
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,950
You really have a knack for making people laugh once in a while.

548
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,750
Chef, I can understand why

549
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,930
the food that you make is so warming and tasty.

550
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,970
I think you've inherited your mother's cooking ability.

551
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,740
Park Ji Wan, why are you always talking so prettily?

552
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:04,150
I should at least talk prettily, since my face isn't pretty.

553
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,210
Your face is pretty, too.

554
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,040
I've never heard that before...

555
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,800
It really is pretty, though.

556
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,400
Ji Wan.

557
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,260
What you talked about on the show...

558
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,800
What happened to you when you were little...

559
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,570
That's not your fault, Ji Wan.

560
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,660
Honestly, I know I have no right to say any of this to you,

561
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,870
but I just wanted to tell you that it wasn't your fault.

562
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,620
Let's go back up.

563
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,940
Oh, I'm curious about something, Ji Wan.

564
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,910
Do you go to an academy?

565
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,540
Like an academy where you learn to talk prettily.

566
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,880
Yeah, Hee Chang.

567
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,000
Did the stationary cameras in the garden of the Kingdom capture the incident?

568
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,200
Kang Chae Ri.

569
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,050
What is this?

570
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,950
Do you know how hard I worked to prevent this from getting publicized?

571
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,740
And you post the footage online?

572
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,070
Are you out of your mind?

573
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,890
We can't hide it forever.

574
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:08,100
It's not like we can have the staff and the cast sign a confidentiality agreement.

575
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,040
If it's bound to get out at some point, it's better for us to release it first.

576
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,820
Even so, how could you post the footage online—

577
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,540
Have you seen the public response?

578
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,190
A crazy person broke into the set and Park Jae Hoon, Hwang Jang Goon, and Lee Hoon Hui...

579
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:25,270
The three of them bravely subdued the culprit.

580
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,450
They were truly like a prince riding on a white horse.

581
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,850
They're amazing, brave, and cool.

582
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,620
Overall, the response is positive.

583
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,510
Hey, this was a gamble.

584
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,820
The response could have been completely the opposite.

585
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,170
You told me to end the show early.

586
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,110
From my end, I had nothing more to lose.

587
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,870
So I used the last card available to me.

588
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,950
Kang Chae Ri, you really...

589
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,600
Now that it's resolved, I can go on with the original number of episodes, right?

590
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,260
No, you can't.

591
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,660
- Director...
- Have the cast members make their final decisions as soon as possible,

592
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,830
and wrap up the show by next week.

593
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,240
Why?

594
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,300
I fixed the problem.

595
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,610
- Chae Ri.
- So why do I have to end the show early?

596
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,360
Kang Chae Ri,

597
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,090
from what I can see, nothing's been fixed.

598
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,660
Wrap up the show and take some time to cool your head.

599
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,290
Have you heard?

600
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,110
They're going to wrap up the show early.

601
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,320
It came to this in the end.

602
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,240
I feel like it's for the better.

603
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,520
So Yeon, you must've had a hard time in the Kingdom.

604
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,200
Honestly, I did.

605
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,800
Nobody took an interest in me.

606
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,810
There are so many guys out there in the world.

607
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,120
It's much more difficult to choose one of the five guys here.

608
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,660
So, don't get down on yourself because of it.

609
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,290
What's this? Are you comforting me?

610
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,170
No, no. I'm not trying to comfort you.

611
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,960
I'm just telling you like it is.

612
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,610
Why did you choose to come on this show, Hwang Jang Goon?

613
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,790
Didn't everyone have the same motive for coming?

614
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:39,040
If you meet a good match for you, then great!

615
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,490
And even if you don't, you can still gain some popularity.

616
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,100
Didn't you come here for the same reason?

617
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:51,380
I've ruined my image, and I've received 0 votes from start to finish.

618
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,550
I'm going out on a gloomy note, so I haven't gained anything but losses.

619
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,290
Still, it's not over until it's over, so don't think too pessimistically.

620
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,030
The final decision is taking place this weekend, so what can I do?

621
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,480
What do you mean what can you do?

622
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,320
You can wrap things up with confidence and swag.

623
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:09,960
How do I do that?

624
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,040
Well, as for that...

625
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,340
You should think hard about that one, So Yeon.

626
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,290
That's easier said than done.

627
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,160
So Yeon, cheer up a little!

628
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,070
It's okay. It's okay!

629
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,660
Fighting!

630
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,940
You've heard that we'll make our final decisions this weekend, right?

631
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,770
Yes.

632
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,950
What are you going to do?

633
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:53,820
I'm willing to work things out with you even after we leave, Oppa.

634
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,690
I can call you Oppa, right?

635
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,070
Do you really want to work it out with me even after we leave here?

636
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,900
- Yes.
- Why?

637
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,770
We look good together.

638
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,860
People say that we're a perfect dutch face.

639
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,090
Our faces are equally good-looking.

640
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,990
Is that so?

641
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,280
If we do a couple live shows or couple vlogs...

642
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,040
I feel like anything we do together would produce great synergy.

643
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:27,980
It's not that you like me, but you want to do business with me.

644
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,280
It's because I like you that I want to do business with you.

645
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,450
I'm not very good at lying, so I can't do something unless I really mean it.

646
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,840
Speaking of which, what are you doing tonight?

647
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,450
Do you want to go on a date?

648
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,590
Let's go eat something good.

649
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:54,580
PD Kang.

650
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,710
Let's cheer up.

651
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,240
Come on.

652
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,350
What can we do? Things have gotten pretty messed up.

653
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,080
And it's not like it's your fault, PD Kang.

654
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,010
Let's wrap this up nicely, okay?

655
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,960
The viewer ratings for the last episode are going to be crazy.

656
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,170
Everyone is anticipating it.

657
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,740
- Writer.
- Yeah?

658
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,960
Since things have turned out like this already,

659
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,550
I'm going to end this as bizarre as possible.

660
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,960
Yes, Director.

661
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,960
We've passed it on to the cast,

662
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,410
and the staff are discussing how we should wrap up the show.

663
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,870
Yes, understood.

664
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,470
Yes.

665
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,050
I heard what's happening.

666
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,750
Are you okay?

667
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,050
It's times like this that I really need to keep my wits about me.

668
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:14,030
Yeo Reum.

669
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,340
Yeah.

670
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,720
The house...

671
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,170
It's still vacant.

672
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,270
What do you mean by that?

673
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,020
The first floor.

674
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,700
Where you used to live.

675
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,300
Even though you moved out, it's still vacant.

676
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,600
How?

677
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,120
Because I got the lease.

678
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,590
Just in case...

679
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,110
After what happened at your wedding,

680
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,270
I called the landlord and got the lease...

681
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,090
because I thought you might return.

682
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:57,840
Your stuff that Kim In Woo sent to Chuncheon were also brought back.

683
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,680
Your mother said there wasn't any space in her home for your stuff,

684
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,430
so I just... did that.

685
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,720
Why did you do that without even telling me?

686
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,690
Is it easy to find a room in Seoul all of a sudden?

687
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,830
When we're done filming here, you would need to vacate your room next week, too.

688
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,470
What would you do without a place to go right after?

689
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,110
Just use it comfortably until you find a house to move into

690
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,820
since you used to live there anyway.

691

♫ On this long winding road ♫

692
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:17,820
♫ There's a trace of kindness that came and went ♫

693
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:23,680
♫ A smile you take for granted ♫

694
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:31,690
♫ And the today and tomorrow that I've been looking forward to ♫

695
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:37,580
♫ I become saddened all by myself ♫

701
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:14,520
♫ But that's just what I want to hear from you ♫

702
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,950
♫ Or probably ♫

703
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,370
Hey, Jae Hoon. Come down to my place quickly.

704
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,540
Come on, hurry up!

705
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,470
It's an emergency, an emergency!

706
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,940
- Why? What is it?
- Hurry up! Come here!

707
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,770
What is it?

708
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,310
- What is that?
- Hurry up and kill it.

709
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,100
But it's so big!

710
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,470
- If I kill it for you, what will you do for me?
- Come on, go.

711
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,920
- Oh, no, I don't think I can kill it.
- Hey!

712
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,530
Hurry up and kill it!.

713
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,110
- I'm going to kill it.
- Kill it.

714
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:41,180
Kill it.

715
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,060
Go throw it out.

716
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,530
Oh, it's moving.

717
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,430
Go throw it out!

718
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,900
I think we'll have to negotiate.

719
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,730
- Don't. Don't do it...
- A negotiation. We'll need to negotiate.

720
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,690
Stop it! I'm going to kill you.

721
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:54,250
I asked you what insect this was.

722
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,600
Hurry up and throw it out! Hurry!

726
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,930
I told you to add more kimchi juice.

727
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,520
I told you it'd get too salty.

728
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,540
If it's too salty, don't eat it. I'll eat it all.

729
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,260
- Why?
- What's that!

730
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:35,100

♫That I dream of once again♫

741
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,420
When did you get here?

742
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:01,070
What brings you here?

743
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:06,060
Well, it's been a while since I turned off the gas,

744
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,360
and it's also been a while since I used the water...

745
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,610
We're starting to film tomorrow afternoon again.

746
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,320
So I came to check on the house.

747
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,060
And why are you here?

748
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,320
Aren't you guys in a state of emergency since the final decisions got pushed up?

749
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,830
Jae Hoon.

750
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,400
Yeah.

751
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,850
Why are you nice to me?

752
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,680
Why do you keep being nice to me?

753
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,030
You want me to answer you?

754
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,500
Should I really answer you?

755
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,000
You should tell me why you're saying this.

756
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,260
Why do you confuse me every so often?

757
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,160
Did I confuse you?

758
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,530
You're doing it right now.

759
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,740
I'm also...

760
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,140
going crazy because of me.

761
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,990
I don't know why I keep doing this.

762
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:17,500
My heart doesn't listen to my mind.

nervous,

765
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:24,840
and why I keep hurting.

766
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,750
I don't know why my feelings are like this.

767

What's the big deal about dating...

What's so great about love...

769
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,570
What's the big deal about all of that stuff...

770
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:37,580
that I want to do it again?

771
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,550
Why does my heart keep pounding and keep breaking?

772
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:50,410
My heart breaks because of you.

773
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,030
Why are you doing this now?

774
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,070
