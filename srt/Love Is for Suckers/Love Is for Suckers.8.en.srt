They say the first kiss for mankind

38
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,470
took place between God and a human.

39
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,250
God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,620
and the man became a living being.

41

If this Hebrew creation story is true,

42
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,480
it seems life flowed into our soul through a kiss.

At some point, kissing became an easy thing to do.

At some point, kissing became something I took for granted.

50
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,920
The moment where the other person's mood,

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,930
the restlessness, and their breathing

52
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,250
are directly delivered to you.

53
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,840
The moment when your souls should be shaken upside down.

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Why is it that there isn't much inspiration from time to time?

55
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,310
They say kissing is...

56
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,550
a behavior where you perceive the other person's DNA instinctively.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
If that's the case,

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,800
if the kiss is so-so,

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,230
is it a DNA problem?

60
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,480
Perhaps the kiss that used to be so sweet and radiant...

61
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,990

63

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,330
I heard you had left the film location earlier.

170
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,050
What are you doing and not going in?

171
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,870
I was waiting for you, PD.

172
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,430
Can you talk to me for a second?

173
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,640
This time, I'll ask you a rude question.

174
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,160
What could it be...

175
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,260
Do you have...

176
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,200
feelings for Jae Hoon?

177
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,620
Ji Yeon...

178
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,410
I saw earlier... the two of you.

179
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,700
Honestly, I got hurt.

180
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,660
Seeing the man I have a crush on

181
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,550
kissing another woman...

182
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,830
I was tormented.

183
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,370
Ji Yeon...

184
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,690
- What happened earlier—
- But it will air as if I kissed him.

185
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,460
Did you think I would be okay that?

186
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,660
Because I like Jae Hoon so much,

187
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,750
since I say okay to everything,

188
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,840
you had no care for how I might feel?

189
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,760
That's not what it was.

190
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,150
I sincerely apologize if you're upset about it.

191
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,600
But there is misunderstanding.

192
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,810
What misunderstanding?

193
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,800
Well...

194
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,510
I wanted to drop out of the Kingdom

195
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,930
so I'm here to pack my things.

196
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,190
- Drop out?
- But all of a sudden,

197
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,550
I started feeling it was unfair.

198
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,670
Jae Hoon's feelings are

199
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,720
so far from me.

200
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,790
But for you, PD... it's so easy.

201
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,630
If you also like Jae Hoon,

202
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,740
I'd like to drop out.

203
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,050
But if that's not the case, I don't want to step back.

204
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,780
Jae Hoon and I are...

205
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,630
friends.

206
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,340
Then draw a clear line from him.

207
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,350
Don't shake him up for no reason.

208
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,310
For me,

209
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,290
it's not easy to gain his heart.

210
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,360
I will.

211
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,050
And what we recorded today won't be aired.

212
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,710
I wasn't going to go that far.

213
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,850
As long as you draw a clear line, it doesn't matter to me.

214
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,420
- What do you mean—
- I don't care if it's just work.

215
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,090
I don't care if you air it.

216
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,340
Jae Hoon's heart is what's important to me.

217
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,900
Jae Hoon.

218
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,600
How come you two are together...?

219
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,620
I explained the situation from earlier at the set

220
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,400
and asked her if it was okay to air it as though it was her.

221
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,780
What?

222
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,710
As long as you're okay with it.

223
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,050
I want to air it as though it was a kiss between you and Ji Yeon.

224
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,050
Goo Yeo Reum.

225
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,880
Must you take it that far?

226
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,220
Our faces didn't show anyway.

227
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,390
As long as both of you are okay with it,

228
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,580
I'd like to do that.

229
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,240
You two can discuss it and let me know what you decide.

230
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,980
Then...

231
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,350
I'll get going first.

232
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,600
Ji Yeon, I'm so sorry. I don't know where to begin to explain.

233
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,130
I saw you earlier.

234
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,930
The two of you kissing.

235
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,450
Tell her you don't want them to air it, Ji Yeon.

236
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,970
You can refuse.

237
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,670
Do I seem like someone who can't even refuse something like that?

238
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,850
No, that's not it.

239
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,610
I'm really sorry about what happened earlier.

240
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,760
I was on a date with you, Ji Yeon.

241
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,890
I'm so sorry.

242
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,310
People's eyes don't lie.

243
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,570
You can't hide what your glances say.

244
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,010
Especially when you're looking at someone.

245
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,540
You can't hide the eyes of love

246
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,260
and you can't imitate them.

247
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,410
Because of your glances, my heart...

248
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,370
is breaking.

249
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,420
Ji Yeon...

250
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,340
Glances are like a spotlight.

251
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,970
A spotlight that is lit up on only one person.

252
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,250
A shining spotlight that does not move toward me, not even by a little bit.

253
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,010
- I was going to drop out of the Kingdom.
- Drop out?

254
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,200
I don't want to burden you anymore

255
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,500
and I don't like being in this pathetic one-sided love.

256
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,940
But...

257
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,230
I can't control my heart.

258
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,570
I can't just give up on you like this.

259
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,540
To the extent that I don't care if I get hurt even more...

260
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,700
I like you...

261
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,080
Jae Hoon.

262
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,250
So I would like to say that it's okay one more time.

263
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,380
I'll say "it's okay" this time once again.

264
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,800
I just don't know what I should say to you, Ji Yeon.

265
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,400
You don't have to give me an answer.

266
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,530
Until the end of the program,

267
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,600
it means I have a chance.

268
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,560
Did you sleep well?

269
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,330
Aren't you going to work today, everyone?

270
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,900
- I'll go after breakfast.
- A little later.

271
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,190
I saw you on TV, Tae Mi.

272
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,100
- You looked so pretty!
- Really?

273
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,310
Thank you!

274
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,190
- I'm so jealous.
- Really?

275
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,390
I got a text.

276
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,280
- Not me.
- It looks like only women got it.

277
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,770
"Ladies, write down your ideal date

278
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,610
on the card that's on the table and put it in the mailbox."

279
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,580
Table where?

280
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,450
When did they set that up?

281
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,590
We got a text, too.

282
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,690
"The first episode of the Season 2 of Kingdom of Love will air today.

283
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,840
The viewers will vote for the most compatible couple

284
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,680
right up until the episode ends.

285
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,800
The best couple bought to you by the viewers will get to go on a date."

286
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,490
Whoa! This sounds so interesting.

287
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,300
There wasn't anything like this in Season 1. Right?

288
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,510
No, there wasn't.

289
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,390
I had no idea there would be voting.

290
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm nervous for some reason.

291
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,510
A date?

292
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,360
A date?

293
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,590
- A date.
- He thinks he could get it.

294
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,740
Jae Hoon, see me for a second.

295
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,650
I'm here.

296
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,370
Sit down.

297
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,900
You know, you're always so good to me.

298
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,540
Yeah.

299
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,630
It's so fun to hang out with you.

300
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,900
So there were days when I was confused as well.

301
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,410
"Do I like him?"

302
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,670
But...

303
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,960
it became clear to me yesterday.

304
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,850
That we're friends.

305
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,800
- It became clear to you?
- Yeah.

306
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,940
That we're friends?

307
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,540
Yeah.

308
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,780
Look me in the eyes and tell me.

309
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,660
But for me, it has to be you.

310
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,130
That became more clear to me.

311
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,610
Yeo Reum, are you sure...

312
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,410
I'm not the one for you?

313
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,350
Yeah. You're not.

314
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,150
Let's just say nothing happened last night.

315
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,430
When we look back later, this will be our embarrassing moment.

316
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,730
It will be hilarious.

317
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,660
Hye Jin and Dae Shik will tease us for the rest of our lives.

318
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,010
Hey, Yeo Reum...

319
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,700
If you're saying this because of the program,

320
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,470
I'll wait until this is over.

321
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,340
I'll do my best in the Kingdom.

322
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,880
That's not it.

323
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm just saying you're not the one for me.

324
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,550
What?

325
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,340
I didn't feel anything last night when we kissed.

326
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,730
Isn't that game over?

327
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,970
You mean, I'm mistaken all by myself?

328
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,460
I can't help it even if things become awkward with you.

329
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,930
No is a no.

330
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,130
All right. I'll do as you say.

331
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,700
I'll stop right here.

332
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,560

00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,980
- What is it?
- Not here.

Follow me.

He deleted the recording?

389
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,460
Is he crazy or not?

390
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,500
I definitely taught him a lesson.

391
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,690
- Let's just let this one slide.
- Who says?

392
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,550
Is he a serpent or something? Slide through what?

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,100
We can't air that anyway.

394

The cast members said no.

395
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,150
I said we'll air that part!

396
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,090
I will not let this one slide.

397

Hey! Kang Chae Ri!

399
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,410
Just let him off this once.

400
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,160
Telling me to let him off easy when he deleted the recording

401
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,090
is much more shocking to me.

402
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,220
Is this some school broadcasting club?

403
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,030
If disciplinary action is necessary, I'll be disciplined.

404

- Did you tell him to?
- Yeah...

405
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,590
I told him to do it.

406
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,020
No matter how much you lack the feel for a show, you're not that bad.

407
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,410
Don't try to cover up for him.

408
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,780
I have one more thing to tell you.

409
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,800
What now?

410
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,680
You know the kiss scene between Park Jae Hoon and Han Ji Yeon? That was me.

I know.

412
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,500
You know?

413
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,670
How did you find out?

414
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,210
Because I have eyes.

415
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,720
I could tell right away it was you.

416
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,710
Gosh, you're up to all kinds of things now...

417
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,070
Well, to explain what happened...

418
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,460
No need to explain.

419
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,140
- I can use it, right?
- Yeah.

420
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,380
The two people agreed.

421
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,320

425
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,820

426
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,400
I'm sorry.

427
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,460
But I couldn't help it.

428
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,460
What you asshole?

429
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,880
Look at this guy. Hey! Who says you could mess with the recording?

430
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,130
Who says?

431
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,350
Have you lost your mind?

432
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,260
Have you lost it? Come, get over here!

433
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,940
- You rat! Get over here!
- Hey!

434
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,020
You! I didn't like you from the get-go.

435
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,760

- Get out!

436
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,620
You, you!

437
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,960
Where do you think you're going?

438
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,540
Ji Wan.

439
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,450
Ji Wan.

440
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,450
What are you doing out here?

441
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,800
I was just spacing out.

442
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,450
Well...

443
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,490
You know what you said yesterday during our date?

444
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,510
Thank you so much for telling me something like that.

445
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,590
It couldn't have been easy since the camera was rolling.

446
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,810
I just couldn't help it. It just came out.

447
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,470
I think you're so brave.

448
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,070
You were really, really amazing.

449
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,800
I wanted to tell you that.

450
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,170
But that's not going to air on the show.

451
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,260
- Oh, why?
- I asked.

452
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,240
Since I just blurted it out,

453
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,200
I asked them to be sure to edit it out.

454
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I see...

455
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,570
So, you did that.

456
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,880
Well...

457
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,100
But if it airs, I'm sure it will be a hot topic.

458
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,830
Do you think the production crew would edit that out?

459
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,400
It can never air.

460
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,640
The broadcasting company would want to air it, though.

461
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,430
They can't. Never.

462
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,980
Ji Wan,

463
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,370
if...

464
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,710
Really, if it doesn't get edited out,

465
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,150
don't you worry too much.

466
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,790
I'm here for you.

467
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,960
Why did you do it?

468
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,620
- I'm sorry.
- I'll consider the circumstances, but...

469
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,630
your method was wrong.

470
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,290
How you went about it was wrong.

471
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,920
You could've resolved it in a different way.

472
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,690
Why did you delete that?

473
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,610
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,130
Director, it's my fault.

475
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,480
Why are you stepping forward?

476
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,830
I strongly pushed him by saying we couldn't air that part.

477
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,860
I might as well have ordered him to do it.

478
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,960
It was my fault.

479
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,810
Director?

480
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,180
I won't let this slide.

481
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,760
Please discipline him properly.

482
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,310
Kang Chae Ri, let's let this one slide.

483
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,370
- Director!
- I heard you threw things at him, too.

484
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,570
That's assault.

485
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,680
Then discipline me for that separately.

486
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,200
Then it becomes an outrageous cheesy melodrama.

487
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,680
Right?

488
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,620
Let's not open this up for discussion and resolve it internally.

489
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,700
Within your team.

490
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,470
Kim Sang Woo, don't let me see you on the film location going forward.

491
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,200
I can't let you produce outdoor scenes. Editing goes without saying.

492
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,650
Backup, settle payments, move things, miscellaneous tasks. That's all.

493
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,170
Hey, send him to another team if you can't stand to see him.

494
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,120
- For whose benefit?
- It was my fault...

495
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,960
so I'll receive whatever the punishment.

496
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,070
I'm sorry.

497
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,600
That's all then, right?

498
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,350
Then, we'll wrap this up like this.

499
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,010
Why do you discriminate?

500
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,010
What? What do you mean?

501
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,950
Why do you cover up for Goo Yeo Reum?

502
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,420
- Why?
- When did I?

503
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,780
Besides, you're not the type to dwell on other people's affection for others.

504
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,360
I may not dwell on it!

505
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,820
But it still offends me.

506
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,020
I said I'm offended.

507
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,380
Kim Sang Woo,

508
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,340
are you okay?

509
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,790
Yes. I'm okay.

510
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,300
Let's stay on the down low for a while.

511
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,480
Try to avoid Kang Chae Ri for now. Okay?

512
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,320
Yes, I got it.

513
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,400
Sang Woo.

514
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,990
- Don't do that going forward.
- Yes.

515
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,750
I'm not saying this as your senior at work, but

516
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,270
I'm telling you as someone who cherishes you.

517
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,930
Was I that unreliable?

518
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,910
It's not that...

519
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,160
I thought that for me to take care of it

520
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,500
would be the cleanest and the most precise way to get rid of it.

521
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,190
You were very brave, but you still can't do that.

522
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,390
Even if we were to delete the recording, I should've done it.

523
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,530
I have a bigger responsibility than you and more authority, too.

524
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:45,250
I'm saying don't be too brave when you don't have enough power.

525
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,720
- Senior...
- We could just fight head-on,

526
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,700
throw a fit...

527
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,240
Do stuff like that first.

528
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,100
As for taking responsibility, do that later.

529
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,350
Do you understand?

530
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,750
Yes.

531
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,020
Nice, nice!

532
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,970
Behind you.

533
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,860
Soo Mi.

534
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,400
Do you want to ride the floater?

535
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,330
Sounds good.

536
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,370
Tae Mi, do you want to ride one, too?

537
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,510
I'll let you ride one.

538
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,130
No. I don't like to go in the water.

539
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,510
But instead, take some pictures for me.

540
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,330
Gosh, I'm practically a photographer. This is crazy.

541
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,650
I'm a great photographer.

542
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,870
Really?

543
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,330
Give it to me.

544
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,000
- Then, okay. From over there.
- Okay.

545
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,300
Your proportion is so...

546
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,820
How do I look?

547
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,880
Good, good.

548
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,100
Good, good, good!

549
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,070
Why are you so nice to me?

550
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,410
Because I'm interested in you.

551
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,420
What got you interested in me?

552
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,090
- I fell for you after seeing you do the chicken fight.
- What?

553
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,390
I usually like women who are aggressive like a fighting chicken.

554
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,570
Come on...

555
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,970
What the heck does that mean?

556
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,220
It doesn't sound like a good thing.

557
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,970
A glamoritor-like woman.

558
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,190
Isn't that cool?

559
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,870
Glamoritor?

560
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,350
What's that?

561
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,950
Don't you know glamoritor?

562
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,930
You know, a long time ago in Greece,

563
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,750
inside a round stadium, they used to fight with swords.

564
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,060
Kind of like pro wrestlers of our time.

565
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,740
By chance do you mean gladiators?

566
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,860
In the Roman Empire?

567
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,470
Rome is Greece.

568
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,840
Greek and Roman myths.

569
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,570
They're the same country.

570
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,430
I see...

571
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,240
You don't even know that?

572
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,040
Shall we go?

573
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,410
Wow, looking good! That pose!

574
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,100
Turn just a little bit. Just a little bit...

575
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,550
Okay! Great!

576
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,900
Where are the others?

577
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,420
Isn't So Yeon coming out?

578
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,280
I asked her to come out with us earlier, but

579
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,760
I think she wanted to stay inside.

580
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,380
Really?

581
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,310
- Make my legs look long.
- They're long already.

582
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,880
Wow! Your proportions are awesome.

583
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,520
Wow... wait...

584
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,160
Slightly.

585
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,910
Good!

586
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,160
Good, good! Good! Wow!

587
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,180
Tae Mi, turn slightly.

588
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,540
Wow, it's a work of art.

589
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,760
Wow! Okay. Slightly. Slightly to the left.

590
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,920
I think you grew tall in that short time. What a work of art.

591
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,750
Send me one later, okay?

592
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,970
Does it look okay?

593
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,280
Okay...

594
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,930
Here, here.

595
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,800
- Isn't it nice?
- My face looks like it's in the shade.

596
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,900
Could you take it once more?

597
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,350
I'll take it from this angle.

598
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,270
Great! Wow! Nice!

599
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm practically a national athlete.

600
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,520
This is totally...

601
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,970
So...

602
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,580
It doesn't seem level.

603
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,250
Be sure to line up horizontally. Like this.

604
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,850
Just this much.

605
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,300
Good, good. Keep going.

606
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,490
Horizontal. It's leveled.

607
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,990
My legs look too short.

608
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,040
Wow, nice! We'll move over here...

609
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,080
- Geez!
- No, no.

610
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,830
Again, again.

611
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,760
Whoa, so pretty.

612
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,800
This photo is amazing. It came out so good!

613
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,350
I totally love it.

614
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,220
I know. Since the model is so beautiful.

615
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,970
Please take pictures over on this side.

616
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,500
Again?

617
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,860
Tae Min, let's sit down and grab a drink...

618
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,330
No. I'll go change into another swimsuit.

619
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,300
Excuse me?

620
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,150
I thought animal prints might be too much.

621
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,830
So I hesitated bringing it here, but I bought it just in case.

622
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,670
I think I could wear it.

623
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,470
I'll be right back.

624
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,590
All right.

625
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,980
I'll take all the pictures for you when you get back.

626
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,920
Hey, little brother Jang!

627
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,420
Yes?

628
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,860
While waiting, put some tanning oil on my back for me.

629
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,080
I don't do stuff like that for men.

630
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,490
If you put it on for me, I'll give you a tip.

631
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,430
You crazy? What tip—

632
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,740
Why would you give me a tip?

633
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,280
Not that kind of tip.

634
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,160
A tip on how you can get together with Jang Tae Mi.

635
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,920
It'd better be helpful.

636
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,660
Listen up.

637
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,720
Women who look like a goddess like her

638
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,480
All they hear are, "You're so pretty, I like you, Date me."

639
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,600
- So?
- You can't be taking pictures for her.

640
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,410
- Only the low-class kiss asses do that.
- What?

641
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,210
Fucking high-class dudes like you shouldn't do that.

642
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,460
If you want things to work out,

643
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,270
keep a distance from her.

644
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:34,840
Push and pull.

645
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,060
That's totally my specialty.

646
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,710
Then why are you doing that? W-Why are you so submissive?

647
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,350
Geez, when was I so submissive?

648
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,360
I wasn't like that.

649
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,920
- You weren't?
- No!

650
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,100
Okay.

651
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,710
Then I'll be watching you from now on.

652
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,080
But...

653
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,040
who are you interested in, Hyungnim?

654
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,810
Well, I'm just watching them for now.

655
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,630
I tend to be the cautious type.

656
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,730
I think you're just unpopular.

657
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,390
Wait and see. They'll all fall for me.

658
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,020
This guy is very good putting on oils.

659
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,210
- Is it okay?
- You're pretty much an expert.

660
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,350
To the right. Can you do a thorough job under my arm?
