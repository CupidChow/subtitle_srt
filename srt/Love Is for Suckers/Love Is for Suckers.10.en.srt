It's either all or nothing. It's great if we can capture some good footage,

00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,170
and if it's a dud, then too bad.

We can't just barge in there with a camera.

Only after I talk to Jae Hoon first.

145
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,870
Yeah, like Park Jae Hoon would openly share his story on broadcast?

146
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,770
Do you think he's capable of that?

147
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:29,500
You said you're his friend. Isn't it pretty obvious?

148
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,900
A non-celebrity cast member isn't capable of discerning the situation.

149
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,570
Whether it's poop or soybean paste,

150

whether they're headed toward the abyss or to their grave...

151

They can't tell anything apart and end up doing whatever they feel like.

152
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,560
If you want to fix the situation for him,

153
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,090
then act like a broadcaster and be thick-skinned.

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,020
You don't have to worry about me like this.

163
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,390
Do you think I'll stop worrying just because you tell me not to?

164
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,610
You think I'll be like that?

165
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,910
Eat up.

166
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,960
Thank you for the food.

167
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,800
It's good, right?

168
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,290
Your food is the best, Ma'am.

169
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,140
It's good.

170
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,750
I really enjoyed the meal.

171
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,190
Good job.

172
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,860
You shouldn't skip meals just because you're going through a difficult time, okay?

173
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,370
Yes.

174
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,470
Hey...

175
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,020
I saw the article on you, Dr. Park.

176
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,070
Gosh, people are just so mean-spirited.

177
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,200
I mean, there are context and overarching circumstances,

178
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,790
excuses for why things happened the way they did and reasons why they did what they did.

179
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,030
But they skip all that and just badmouth you calling you names.

180
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,980
I don't believe that's right.

181
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,650
Even if I don't know what happened.

182
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,470
The context, overarching circumstances...

183
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,410
excuses and reasons...

184
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,460
I don't have anything like that.

185
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,120
Then... Dr. Park...

186
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Did you actually kill someone?

187
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,010
By accident?

188
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,040
My father...

189
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,600
passed away because of me.

190
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,500
Your father?

191
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,560
He was transported to the emergency room due to an accident,

192
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,570
but I wasn't able to recognize my father.

193
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,470
There was only one space...

194
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,460
open for the operating room,

195
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,690
but I took a different patient,

196
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,160
and my father died alone in the emergency room...

197
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,400
as a nameless patient...

198
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,990
without anyone by his side.

199
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,380
My goodness...

200
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,900
How could something like that happen?

201
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,210
"It's not your fault."

202
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,290
"You made a logical judgment call as a doctor."

203
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,770
After my father passed away, other people said that to me,

204
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,080
but those reasons and those excuses...

205
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,950
I couldn't accept them.

206
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,260
How I could possibly not recognize my father?

207
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,230
I just can't bring myself to forgive myself for that.

208
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,260
I even checked his pupils.

209
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,950
And to check his mental capacity,

210
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,610
I even pinched my father's leg.

211
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,310
And the way he flinched...

212
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
I can still feel it...

213
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,240
Had I recognized my father then,

214
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,250
I don't know if I would have made the same call.

215
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,900
So I feel guilty toward everyone.

216
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,120
[Park Jae Hoon still on "Kingdom of Love 2" after a medical accident scandal? No response from the production staff]

217
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,940
Ms. Han Ji Yeon. Let's go somewhere with me.

218
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,250
Where?

219
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,030
To find Park Jae Hoon.

220
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,750
Excuse me. What is this?

221
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,330
Who are you?

222
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,340
Excuse us...

223
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,690
Miss.

224
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,630
Hello.

225
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,270
What brings you here?

226
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,990
You came here to find Dr. Park?

227
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,610
Yes.

228
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,200
Jae Hoon came here, right?

229
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,750
I mean, he did come here.

230
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,060
W-What are those people doing over there?

231
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,280
What's with all those people?

232
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,180
Jae Hoon... Where is he right now?

233
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,770
Hey, Jae Hoon. What are you doing here alone?

234
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,670
How did you come here?

235
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,060
I came looking for you.

236
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,680
How come you never...

237
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,510
tell me anything?

238
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,220
You've always been by my side when I struggled.

239
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,290
Why don't you give me a chance to do the same?

240
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,970
Yeo Reum...

241
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,500
And regarding your dad, why didn't you tell me?

242
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,440
I thought that you were having a hard time

243
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,630
just because he passed away from an accident...

244
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,600
Why didn't you tell me you were going through something much more painful?

245
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm fine now.

246
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,510
I'm sorry.

247
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,300
It's all my fault.

248
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,870
It's because I told you to come on the show

249
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,460
that the public scrutinized and tore into your wounds.

250
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,960
I'm so sorry.

251
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,460
I feel like it's all my fault.

252
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,330
Goo Yeo Reum. Don't cry.

253
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,610
You didn't do anything wrong.

254
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,730
Why is any of this your fault?

255
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,060
Don't cry.

256
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,080
Ms. Han Ji Yeon, you go first.

257
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,910
We'll grab the full shot, so go and explain the situation.

258
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,830
Let's start the shoot at the B&B.

259
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,350
Let's zoom in when the two meet.

260
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,740
Jae Hoon.

261
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,580
Han Ji Yeon, how did you come here...

262
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,010
Are you okay?

263
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,680
I was worried after seeing the article on you.

264
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,210
I'm sorry for disappearing suddenly without a word.

265
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,760
You must've been shocked, too, Ji Yeon.

266
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,220
Rather than being in shock,

267
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,380
I was worried because it pained me to think about...

268
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,770
what you were going through.

269
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,470
You were so worried that you came to get me?

270
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,940
Bringing all those cameras with you? Yeah?

271
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,700
There is someone you must meet so we came together.

272
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,590
Someone I must meet?

273
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,530
Doctor...

274
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,070
I'm Myeong Hoon.

275
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,180
Doctor, I'm sorry.

276
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,980
After hearing that you quit the hospital because of me,

277
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,010
I was so sorry and distressed.

278
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,260
And the person who saved me was...

279
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,770
Dr. Park Tae Woo.

280
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,560
I found out that he was your father, Doctor.

281
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,710
Who am I... that just because of me,

282
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,510
both of your lives were ruined...

283
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,880
I've been so sorry and distressed, Doctor.

284

[A Letter of Acceptance]

285
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,870
I made it into medical school.

286
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,000
After I received this,

287
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,340
I wanted to meet you so badly that

288
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,300
I asked around here and there

289
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,790
and ended up going to your plastic surgery clinic.

290
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,650
But... I felt like I was so shameless

291
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,080
and couldn't muster up the courage, so I just went home.

292
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,230
If you would just allow me,

I want... to become a doctor like you.

294
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,820
I want to be... a neurologist, Doctor.

295
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,890
You've suffered a lot.

296
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,110
You've done well.

297
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,020
I'm sorry, Doctor.

298
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,170
I'm sorry.

299

You managed to pull it together again.

I wonder how high the viewer ratings will be.

301

I'll edit... what we filmed today.

302
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,430
Okay.

303
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,940
Do you like Park Jae Hoon?

304
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,790
- What?
- Why are you making me repeat myself?

305
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,800
I said do you like Park Jae Hoon?

306
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,090
It's not like that.

307
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,060
Then, why do you look at him with such gentleness?

308
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,120
Even if I liked him,

309
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,760
there's no need for me to tell you. Right?

310
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,490
Well, I'm a bit interested in him.

311
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,080
- What?
- Are you a repeat symbol or an echo?

312
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,610
Why do you keep asking me back?

313
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,010
I'm telling you I'm getting interested in him.

314
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,310
That I'm starting to crave Park Jae Hoon a bit.

315
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,150
How do you use the term "crave" for another person?

316
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,800
Is he a late night snack? He's not ramen or fried chicken.

317
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,540
And especially at this timing!

318
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,160
My gosh...

319
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,950
If I crave him, I'll say I crave him. How else would I put it?

320
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,270
In any case, I'm thinking of sleeping with him.

321
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,040
Did Jae Hoon say he'll sleep with you?

322
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,350
I'll suggest to him that we do it once.

323
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,890
You know...

324
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,580
I've observed you for what could be considered a long time.

You're really something.

326

Typically for me,

327
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,780
I need to sleep with someone once for me to lose interest.

328
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,760
This feeling of getting concerned and bothered...

329
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,430
I absolutely hate this feeling.

330
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,750
So if I sleep with him, all of that would dissipate.

331
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,080
Kang Chae Ri. You know it, too, right? That you are a nutcase.

332
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,840
I think I'm perfectly normal.

333
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,930
At least, I am 100 percent honest about my feelings.

334
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,870
About what I just told you, I didn't need to tell you,

335
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,240
but your gaze toward him was so gentle.

336
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,360
That's why I decided to tell you.

337
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,970
Jae Hoon.

338
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,400
Yeah.

339
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,590
You were a bit taken aback by the filming today, right?

340
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,180
A little bit.

341
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,940
I wanted to discuss it with you beforehand...

342
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,500
It doesn't matter.

343
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,830
There was a controversy because of me,

344
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,030
and they needed a way to fix it from the point of view of the show.

345
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,110
Thanks for understanding.

346
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,560
I'll take my car with Han Ji Yeon.

347
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,410
Oh, okay. And I'd like it if there was no cameras in the car.

348
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,710
Yes, of course.

349
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,500
I didn't even bring them from the start.

350
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,140
I'll be on my way.

351
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,510
Yeah, go.

352
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,820
Where did Han Ji Yeon go?

353
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,200
Oh, Park Jae Hoon is here!

354
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,110
Where did you go?

355
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,010
We waited for you!

356
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:17,420
Did you bring back Jae Hoon, Ji Yeon?

357
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,300
Wow, great.

358
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,150
It's not a prince on a white horse. It's a princess on a white horse.

359
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:24,940
Right? She's dressed in white as well.

360
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,350
Well, in any case, I am sorry for causing you all to worry.

361
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,260
We heard from the staff that the articles were all rumors.

362
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,760
But usually, when there's smoke, there's a fire...

363
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,080
They're really just rumors, right?

364
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,380
Hey, come on!

365
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,070
Joon Ho! Shut the mouth!

366
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,670
I'm just joking.

367
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,280
Han Ji Yeon, you worked hard to bring back your partner.

368
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,290
You didn't let him go.

369
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,580
Welcome back to the Kingdom of Love!

370
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,100
Welcome!

371
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,760
Welcome back.

372
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,070
- You're not happy with this, right?
- What?

373
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,340
- You're not happy with this, right?
- No, no, this is all good!

374
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,050
Oh. Well...

375
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,700
I know because I've received a lot of negative comments online,

376
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,420
but it just means you're famous now.

377
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,300
Don't get hurt or anything like that.

378
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,650
It's just your loss.

379
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,750
Wow, you're worried about me, Chef?

380
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,450
Making me feel grateful and all.

381
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,520
What do you mean, worry?

382
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm just giving you advice

383
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,180
as a senior in the influencer world.

384
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,890
I see...

385
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,760
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

386
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,470
Cheers?

387
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,360
Ji Yeon.

388
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,680
I just wanted to give you this.

389
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,240
What is this?

390
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,350
It's ginger tea.

391
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,310
Have a warm glass and rest well.

392
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,840
Thank you. I appreciate it.

393
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,410
Goodnight.

394
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,190
Thank you.

400
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,100
You took care of that nicely!

401
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,160
The viewer ratings are amazing, too.

402
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,630
The higher-ups are thrilled.

403
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,400
This is... nothing.

404
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,030
Good job.

405
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,040
Well, I admit I did well,

406
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,730
but Goo Yeo Reum worked hard as well.

407
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,730
How's it like working together on the same team?

408
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,300
You two have good chemistry, right?

409
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,840
- Chemistry?
- Yeah.

410
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,290
Well... No. Absolutely not.

411
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,840
I put you guys together so you can balance each other out like a seesaw.

412
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,090
It was all part of the big picture that I drew up.

413
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,450
- Director.
- Yeah?

414
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,730
I don't like her.

415
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,270
Come on.

416
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,020
You guys are colleagues from the same school and major, and entered the company at the same time.

417
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,520
That's a tremendous connection. Why do you hate her so much?

418
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,910
You should be good friends. Right?

419
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,970
It's annoying because she's just too pure and innocent.

420
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,420
So annoying.

421
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,170
So, she's annoying, huh...

422
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,340
Do you still do it nowadays?

423
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,360
I'm not able to do it much nowadays but I want to.

424
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,310
- Do you want to try it with me?
- That would be great.

425
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,690
When should we do it?

426
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,420
When should we do it?

427
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,810
How about tomorrow?

428
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,480
Last time, you wore it when you came to my hospital.

429
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,260
- Oh!
- The tracksuit.

430
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,530
Then, you can wear the tracksuit that you wore to the blind date...

431
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,980
- Yes?
- Senior, eat some fried chicken.

432
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,600
- Fried chicken?
- Yes.

433
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,390
Wow, looks tasty.

434
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,150
Wow, that looks so good!

435
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,310
- All right! One whole chicken per person?
- Eat up, eat up!

436
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,730
All right. Let's enjoy it.

437
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,910
Director bought it for us.

438
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,870
But man, the viewer ratings skyrocketed, and this is it?

439
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,640
It's fried chicken for today, and they'll treat us to dinner soon.

440
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,170
And supposedly, the higher-ups are discussing something like a reward vacation somewhere.

441
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,230
Great. Wow!

442
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,620
Great!

443
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,740
Wait, wait. Senior, you should have the first drumstick.

444
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,120
- Me?
- Okay.

445
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,550
Well then...

446
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,890
Shall I try it?

447
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,570
How is it?

448
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,220
Thank you for the food!

449
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,020
Wow, this is so good!

450
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,330
- Man, this is so delicious.
- Hey, Sang Woo! Come here.

451
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,910
- Come here and eat!
- Yeah, hurry up and eat. It's so good!

452
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,050
Hey! I told you, don't let me see you.

453
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,080
I'm sorry...

454
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,500
Geez.

455
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,810
Kang Chae Ri! PD...

456
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,520
It's so petty to be like that over food.

457
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,040
Hey! Where are you going with the fried chicken?

458
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
I don't want to eat together with you,

459
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,190
so I'm going to eat in the editing room. Why?

460
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,340
Then why are you taking two colas?

461
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,770
I'm thirsty!

462
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,030
Gosh, she's so annoying.

463
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:13,430
Hey, Sang Woo. Why are you slouching over the table like that?

464
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,630
Because I'm afraid that I might be seen by Senior Kang Chae Ri.

465
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,420
Come out. Let's go to the editing room.

466
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,290
All right.

467
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,330
Here, eat it.

468
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,140
You should eat the drumstick, Senior.

469
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,790
Hurry up and eat it.

470
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,010
Eat this one as well, and eat the rest of these two as well.

471
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,210
It is my love.

472
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,200
Thank you.

473
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,100
- Sang Woo.
- Yes?

474
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,800
Look for the right timing, go to Kang Chae Ri and apologize to her profusely.

475
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,490
It's about time she stopped being angry.

476
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,690
Go to her around this timing and sincerely apologize to her

477
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,570
and tell her that you'll do better.

478
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,110
She's the type where once she lets go of her anger, she doesn't hold any grudges.

479
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,490
I'm not usually the type to be afraid or anything like that.

480
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,810
But being on the bad side of Senior Kang Chae Ri is really scary.

481
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,070
We joined the company the same year. I get scared of her at times, too.

482
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,240
You too, Senior?

483
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,580
There are times when she acts like a bitch,

484
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,820
but... there are quite a few things to learn from her

485
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,500
and she has a unique style...

486
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,010
so I respect her directing ability.

487
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,980
In any case, don't be so timid.

488
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,550
Look for the right timing. Okay?

489
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,940
All right.

490
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,790
- Hurry up and eat.
- You should eat, Senior.

491
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,800
- Is it good?
- Yes.

492
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,710
Should I try a bite too?

493
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,480
It's good.

494
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,620
Hey, we were so shocked while watching the show!

495
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,710
Why would you hold all of that pain to yourself?

496
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,620
You've gone through a lot. Are you okay?

497
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,750
I see...

498
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,680
In any case, yeah...

499
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,540
It all got resolved well in the end,

500
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,680
so come to the restaurant, so we can have some soju together.

501
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,080
Yeah. All right.

502
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,470
Okay.

503
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,560
What did Jae Hoon say?

504
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,960
Well, he says he is currently filming at the Kingdom.

505
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,340
He says he's okay.

506
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,630
It must have been so difficult for Jae Hoon all this time.

507
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,410
Right?

508
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,810
You know that punk is more thoughtful than you might think.

509
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,310
He's the type to keep everything buried inside him.

510
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,650
As I watch him from the sidelines, I feel bad for him at times.

511
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,440
You do that too, Honey.

512
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
I do what?

513
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,970
You always... worry about others and listen to other people's concerns,

514
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,150
but you don't and can't tell others about your own problems.

515
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,740
- Right?
- When did I do that?

516
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,820
I tell you everything, whatever it may be.

517
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,920
I have something to tell you.

518
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,920
What is it?

519
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,460
I...

520
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,630
told Yeo Reum that we're trying IVF.

521
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,260
What?

522
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,840
- I told you we should keep that a secret!
- I'm sorry.

523
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,370
Why would you tell her that?

524
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,980
She's already so tired and busy!

525
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,480
She's already so caught up with work.

526
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,010
The difficulties you face while you go through IVF...

527
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,080
I can listen to and accept everything you say to me. But...

528
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,190
if by any chance...

529
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,600
there's a chance that there might be something you can't tell me.

530
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,870
Something that you can only tell another woman.

531
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,550
Who could you talk to, if not Yeo Reum?

532
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,690
Don't you think so?

533
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,650
There's nothing I can't tell you.

534
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,510
What do you mean, there's nothing? Without my knowledge—

535
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,260
You cry by yourself in the bathroom all the time without me knowing.

536
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,650
How did you know?

537
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,230
Every time you come back from the bathroom, your eyes are red.

538
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,420
How could I not know?

539
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,310
Hye Jin...

540
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,650
It's the same for me and Yeo Reum.

541
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,370
To see you suffer alone and struggle...

542
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,270
It really hurts a lot.

543
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,130
Don't cry by yourself.

544
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,210
Don't cry by yourself, and cry when someone is next to you.

545
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,100
I beg you.

546
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,660
Gosh. Speak of the devil. That Goo Yeo Reum.

547
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,410
Yeah, Yeo Reum.

548
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,880
No, no.

549
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,470
Why?

550
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:17,180
You want to go to the sauna tonight?

551
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,280
That'd be great for me!

552
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,740
Feels great.

553
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,130
As expected, as I get older,

554
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,660
a hot sauna is the best.

555
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,960
- Right?
- Absolutely.

556
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,380
Now that we've sweated out the toxins, let's apply some collagen.

557
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,980
Okay! Sounds good!

558
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,020
Sounds good, sounds good!

559
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,520
All right.

560
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,820
Look over here.

561
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,280
Hurry up and apply it.

562
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,950
Lift it like this from the bottom up.

563
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,840
Your neck as well.

564
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,850
How is it? It's really firm, right?

565
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,110
Absolutely firm.

566
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,720
Firm?

567
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,230
Here.

568
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,510
Drink some persimmon vinegar, too. Hurry, hurry!

569
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,140
Let's drink.

570
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,550
Yeo Reum.

571
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:47,100
I heard Dae Shik told you that we're trying IVF.

572
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,980
Yeah. You were shocked. Right?

573
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,780
Why didn't you tell me?

574
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,910
Just because.

575
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,600
You're going through a lot right now, too,

576
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,820
so I didn't feel comfortable telling you things like that.

577
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,100
I felt really sorry and upset.

578
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,970
- What?
- It's just that...

579
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,460
you're always by my side when I'm going through hard times

580
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:19,670
and listen to me and cry with me.

581
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,770
But it felt like I couldn't be that kind of friend for you.

582
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,030
Hey, why would you be sorry?

583
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,670
It's just that I wasn't able to tell you.

584
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,620
I wanted to be a comfortable and reliable friend,

585
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,490
but it seemed like I always talked about my problems first.

586
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,420
It's not like that.

587
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,050
It's just that... doing IVF...

588
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,360
is something that is difficult to talk about, even to a close friend.

589
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,510
"Will I be able to get pregnant this month?"

590
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,170
"Will an awesome miracle like that happen to me, too?"

591
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,110
I keep expecting but keep getting disappointed.

592
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,000
Once this keeps repeating, the disappointment

593
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,310
turns into despair.

594
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,220
"Do I have a defect?"

595
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,900
"What did I do wrong?"

596
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:18,150
When I walk down the streets and I see people walking holding a baby's hand,

597
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,760
I feel like going crazy from jealousy.

598
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,510
I develop something like an inferiority complex

599
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,500
and I start hiding it.

600
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,920
And even to my most precious best friend...

601
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,540
I just can't start talking about it.

602
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,690
IVF is like that.

603
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,750
Hye Jin, if you get pregnant,

604
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,390
that baby will be really happy.

605
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,920
Because you're the mom, Hye Jin.

606
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,000
Don't cry.

607
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,550
Park Jae Hoon.

608
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,000
Are you going to your room?

609
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,570
Yes.

610
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,270
There's... something...

611
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,010
I want to say to you.

612
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,920
What is it?

613
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,060
We found the original spreader of the rumors.

614
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,250
The one who spread the rumors about you.

615
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,220
Oh, really? Who was that person?

616
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,160
When you were in the neurology department,

617
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,720
he worked in public service at the same hospital.

618
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,820
Supposedly, he did it because he was jealous.

619
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,980
He found you aggravating every time you passed by him at the hospital,

620
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,560
then you started showing up on TV one day, so that annoyed him.

621
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,350
What should we do with him?

622
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:09,620
Do you want him to be punished?

623
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,140
How about we just forgive him?

624
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,860
Without getting an official apology?

625
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,870
Not sure if that's necessary. It's okay.

626
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,810
Don't you want to see his face, at least?

627
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:28,010
Checking out someone's face is a basic rule for Koreans.

628
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,660
I'm fine. Really.

629
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:40,630
Ever since I started appearing on TV, a lot of people started liking me for no reason.

630
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:45,320
Just like I can't go around thanking each person who likes me,

631
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:51,370
how can I go around meeting each person who hates me for no reason to receive their apology?

632
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,960
I'll just forgive him.

633
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,620
I'll leave it to you to wrap up the rest, PD.

634
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,260
All right then.

635
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,660
I don't know why...

636
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,500
I keep craving him.

637
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,260
He's really not my style.

638
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,700
Tonight, at a haunted house,

639
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,540
we are going to have a horror experience date.

640
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,360
And your date partners will be chosen by picking lots.

641
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,430
A horror experience at a haunted house sounds fun.

642
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,710
I really don't like this.

643
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,960
I really hate scary things.

644
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,090
Go with me, then.

645
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,970
Ji Wan, do you get scared easily too?

646
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,810
Actually, I don't get scared easily.

647
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,580
Oh, really?

648
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,350
Hello.

649
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,640
Hello.

650
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,130
Oh, you have to put that over here.

651
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,940

00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,370
I'm really about to throw up.

816
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,640
We're done, we're done.

817
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,540
- It's really hard for me right now.
- Okay.

We're done. Let's go.

God... I'm getting motion sickness.

820
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,090
You're getting motion sickness? Just hold on a bit longer.

821
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,480
All right. It's our final couple.

822
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,770
Ji Yeon and Jae Hoon couple, get going, please.

823

- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,650
Try to get a hold of yourself.

825
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,100
Be careful. There are a few things to watch out for.

826
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,750
- Gosh.
- You look tired.

827
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,090
I keep yawning.

828

What's going on? Was there rain in the forecast?

No, there wasn't...

833

First, cover all the cameras and equipment with a plastic tarp, and let's wrap up what we're shooting.

- Are you okay?
- N-No.

837
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,210
I should have had you stay at the entrance.

- No.

At this rate, I'm going to end up scared.

840

- Hold on tight.
- Okay.

Whoa, that scared me.

842
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:41,730
Gosh... Well, the blackboard is here,

843
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,730
so I think we should find the chalk quickly.

844
