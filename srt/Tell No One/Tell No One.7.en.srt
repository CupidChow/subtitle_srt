Zheng had been transferred to the logistics.

After I interrogate Chen Jingming,

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,110
I'll interrogate Lei Naiwu

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,440

I just

99
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,870
don't understand one thing.

100
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,650
How could it be Uncle Chen?

101
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,610
My dad told me

102
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,680
he had two good friends.

103
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,190
One was you,

104
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,910
the other was Chen Jingming.

105
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,100
Every Chinese New Year,

106
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,090
my dad would take me

107
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,550
to Chen Jingming's house.

108
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,660
I watched them

109
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,440
playing cards,

110
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,630
drinking,

111
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,740
and chatting.

112
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,460
Sometimes,

113
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,650
they talked all night.

114
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,780
They were really good friends.

115
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,470
On the day Aunt Yan passed away,

116
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,280
it was the first time my dad asked for a leave

117
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,630
for personal matters.

118
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
He went to accompany Chen Jingming.

119
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,400
They used to be so good friends.

120
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,020
How come?

121
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,990
But if Chen Jingming is the one

122
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,390
who ordered Huang Bingde to take the blame,

123
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,550
then the one who killed my dad...

124
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,230
I'll ask him

125
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,190
everything.

126
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,190
Fine.

127
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,730
You ordered Huang Bingde to kill Qin Yong

128
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,270
and made him lie

129
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,620
that he killed Zheng Ying

130
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,080
and took the blame for you.

131
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,310
According to ballistic examination results,

132
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,610
the gun used by Huang Bingde

133
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,360
was indeed the one used to kill Zheng Ying back then.

134
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,680
You gave him the gun.

135
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,230
Then you told him

136
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,840
what happened that day.

137
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,260
Why?

138
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
What do you think?

139
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,680
I wanted to make money.

140
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,230
Back then,

141
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,410
when I was doing small business,

142
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,010
not only did I not earn money,

143
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,580
but also be looked down upon

144
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,340
bullied,

145
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
and trampled on.

146
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,740
That time, I was cheated

147
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,510
until I had not a penny left

148
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,310
and was being treated like a dog.

149
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,310
Back then, I remember

150
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,540
seeing Jiadong and Xueying,

151
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,230
two motherless children,

152
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
so thin and small.

153
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,470
In my heart, I swore

154
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,660
that no matter what,

155
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,190
I would earn money.

156
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,510
I want to make all those

157
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,630
who look down on me

158
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,290
be trampled under my feet.

159
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,520
I want to wash away

160
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,110
the humiliation on me.

161
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,280
I want to take revenge on them.

162
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,660
So?

163
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,940
So,

164
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,069
I worked with Liu Qing.

165
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,500
He can give me what I want.

166
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,660
He needed smuggled ink

167
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,010
and acid-free paper.

168
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,319
I have a way to get them.

169
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,940
You had been colluding with Liu Qing all along

170
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,150
until

171
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,109
Zheng Ying appeared as Lu Sheng.

172
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,770
You recognized Zheng.

173
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,490
I found it by accident.

174
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,940
Why didn't you tell Liu Qing

175
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,910
right away?

176
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,390
Why did you wait until

177
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,940
the day of the incident, half a month

178
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,870
after Zheng was detained,

179
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,590
to send him the photo?

180
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,140
Are you stupid?

181
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,630
If I told Liu Qing that Zheng was an undercover agent,

182
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,830
wouldn't that be betraying Zheng

183
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,780
and harming him?

184
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,350
Did I want him to die?

185
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,320
After I found it was him,

186
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,880
I was very nervous.

187
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,670
I wanted him to leave quickly.

188
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,480
I sent him

189
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,170
many messages to him that day.

190
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,910
I told him

191
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,970
her wife went to the hospital

192
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,750
and she was dying.

193
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,700
I told him to come back

194
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,730
quickly.

195
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,230
But he didn't

196
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,430
reply to my messages.

197
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,830
He didn't

198
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,790
even get to see his family

199
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,990
when they were dying.

200
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,020
You are really inhumane.

201
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,090
Li Dengyuan.

202
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,050
You killed Zheng!

203
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,900
Why are you shouting?

204
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,110
Zheng Ying is

205
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,330
a heroic policeman.

206
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,230
You don't deserve to call him brother.

207
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,350
What else did you do

208
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,860
after you texted Zheng Ying?

209
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,510
Liu Qing

210
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,340
kept

211
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,340
postponing the time of the transaction.

212
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,340
I thought about what to do every day.

213
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,820
If Zheng succeeded,

214
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,450
and Liu Qing was arrested,

215
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,180
he would definitely expose me.

216
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,100
I would go to jail.

217
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,590
Jiadong and Xueying were still young.

218
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,030
I didn't want to go to jail.

219
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,090
I suddenly thought

220
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,310
if

221
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,870
I sent Zheng's

222
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,750
police identification photo to Liu Qing,

223
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,950
Liu Qing

224
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,990
wouldn't dare to continue.

225
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,310
He would run away

226
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,790
or drive Zheng away.

227
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,150
Anyway,

228
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,910
he would never break up with me.

229
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,790
Because I know

230
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,260
Liu Qing had

231
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,190
wanted to change his image.

232
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,610
At that time, he wouldn't

233
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,230
or dare not kill a cop.

234
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,110
When they were waiting to

235
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,970
start the deal,

236
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,720
Liu Qing suddenly came to me

237
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,710
and gave me a gun.

238
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,630
When?

239
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,930
It was the day Zheng disappeared.

240
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,740
April 11th.

241
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,470
What was the exact time?

242
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,340
About noon.

243
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,600
Why did Liu Qing give you a gun?

244
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,430
He asked me to set off

245
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,630
to sail the boat

246
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,270
to the bottom of Mount Xiaocang,

247
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,530
then go up the mountain

248
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,630
and wait for him at the designated location.

249
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,190
He said

250
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,930
if the deal went wrong,

251
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,330
the worst situation was that he ran away

252
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,390
and I would help him

253
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,350
and send him abroad by boat.

254
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,100
This proved my thoughts.

255
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,060
Self-preservation

256
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,590
was Liu Qing's only choice.

257
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,910
I sent a photo to Liu Qing,

258
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,700
waiting for Liu Qing at the back mountain,

259
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,230
and got ready to assist him.

260
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,110
Then you police took action.

261
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,470
Someone in the dark

262
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,900
came over in a rush.

263
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,870
I thought Liu Qing ran out.

264
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,410
I was going to help him.

265
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,870
But at this time,

266
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,190
I had a scary thought

267
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,990
in my mind.

268
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,510
I was thinking

269
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,430
if Liu Qing died,

270
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,910
no one would know

271
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,150
I did it.

272
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,710
Because he and I

273
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,970
had always been in one-on-one contact.

274
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,030
As long as Liu Qing died,

275
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,890
I would be cleared of my crime.

276
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,410
So...

277
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,020
Bro!

278
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,540
Bro!

279
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,130
I...

280
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:31,990
Bro!

281
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,260
Bro!

282
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:33,990
I...

283
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,030
Bro!

284
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,830
Bro!

285
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,540
I didn't do it on...

286
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,550
Bro!

287
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,270
How did I know it was Zheng?

288
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,940
I never thought it was Zheng.

289
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,720
I really...

290
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,470
And then?

291
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,540
But I forced myself to calm down.

292
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,990
I was thinking

293
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,700
since it has happened,

294
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,310
there were police officers down there.

295
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,540
I must...

296
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,050
I must

297
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,860
get rid of the body.

298
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,280
Is he in the Long River?

299
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,380
Yes.

300
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,660
In Long River.

301
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,460
The water area near the downtown.

302
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,750
It's all over.

303
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,750
All these years,

304
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,470
I've never

305
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,710
slept well.

306
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,910
When I closed my eyes,

307
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,900
I thought of how Zheng looked

308
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,340
before he died.

309
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,550
He told me...

310
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,200
He told me secretly

311
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,060
that he knew

312
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,820
he might sacrifice one day as a police officer.

313
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,680
But he really didn't expect

314
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,780
he would be killed by his bro.

315
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,000
It's over.

316
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,540
Call the doctor.

317
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,380
Did he do it?

318
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,790
He said so.

319
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,640
Then...

320
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,150
Where is my dad?

321
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,840
In the river.

322
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,150
Okay.

323
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,670
Do you know the richest man in Linjiang,

324
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,530
Chen Jingming?

325
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,270
I know.

326
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,790
I heard

327
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,910
something happened to Chen Jingming's family

328
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,790
a few days ago.

329
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,470
His daughter

330
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,320
was kidnapped.

331
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:43,750
Really?

332
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,440
You don't know, do you?

333
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,630
Chen Jingming's daughter

334
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,520
is from our city's dance troupe.

335
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,110
She's so pretty.

336
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,160
Since she was kidnapped,

337
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,230
wouldn't the kidnapper do something to her?

338
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,110
I understand if you don't tell me.

339
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,590
Why did you hit him?

340
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,430
We know

341
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,610
what happened.

342
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,490
Since you agree to reconcile,

343
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,250
I'll go in

344
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,370
and explain to him.

345
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,450
Did you call the police?

346
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,090
Yes.

347
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,670
Is everything settled?

348
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,350
Yes.

349
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,390
He's inside.

350
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,430
I'll take you in.

351
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,550
Chen Jiadong.

352
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,060
Your family is here.

353
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,990
Dongyu.

354
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,630
I'm sorry.

355
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:51,820
I...

356
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,740
I really

357
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,240
didn't know who to call.

358
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,210
He agreed to mediate.

359
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,140
He asked you to apologize first.

360
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,670
Impossible.

361
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,320
They insulted Xueying first.

362
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,430
Okay.

363
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,030
Just stay in.

364
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,970
Wait.

365
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,620
I'll go.

366
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,690
Dongyu.

367
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,280
Dongyu, wait for me.

368
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,020
Sorry.

369
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,410
Dongyu.

370
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,590
I know.

371
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,310
I know you have discipline.

372
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,100
I shouldn't ask questions.

373
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,580
Can you tell me

374
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,380
what my dad did?

375
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,140
Tell me

376
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,380
did he hurt you?

377
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,970
We've known each other for more than 20 years.

378
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,360
Why can't you tell me?

379
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,390
Dongyu.

380
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,140
Let bygones

381
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,200
be bygones.

382
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,450
We also hope

383
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,270
you can get over it soon.

384
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,070
Sis, don't worry.

385
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,910
Uncle Zheng will come back.

386
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,570
Go ask your dad.

387
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:59,400
[Criminal Investigation Detachment of Linjiang Public Security Bureau]

388
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,640
Chief Li.

389
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,500
Chief Li.

390
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,390
Have you taken the medicine?

391
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,290
Are you feeling better?

392
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,330
If you want to drink water and rest,

393
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,920
we can stop anytime.

394
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,210
Talk about what happened

395
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,670
between you and Lei Naiwu.

396
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,540
Lei Naiwu

397
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,190
is a beast.

398
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,620
Lei Naiwu.

399
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,870
Do you know Qin Yong?

400
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,020
I know.

401
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,940
I'm not

402
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,980
an uneducated person.

403
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,940
Because I read a lot of books

404
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,060
in prison.

405
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,710
I've read a lot of TV programs and news.

406
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,390
What you were talking about was the Terracotta Warriors.

407
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,910
The Terracotta Army of Qin Shi Huang.

408
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,770
It's in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province.

409
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,030
What’s wrong?

410
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,400
Are you kidding me?

411
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,910
The man in the photo.

412
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,250
He's Qin Yong. He is not in Xi'an.

413
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,590
Look carefully.

414
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,840
I don't know him.

415
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,990
Weren't you the one who instructed him

416
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,690
to kidnap Chen Jingming's daughter,

417
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,500
Chen Xueying?

418
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,140
No.

419
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,870
I wouldn't do such a thing.

420
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,610
Let me take another look.

421
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,980
Is he insane?

422
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,180
If he kidnapped a youngster, he must be punished severely.

423
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,640
Do you know Chen Jingming?

424
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,660
No.

425
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,070
But I've heard of him before...

426
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,480
About Liu Qing's case six years ago,

427
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,030
Chen Jingming admitted

428
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,830
he was one of the members

429
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,760
of making counterfeit notes.

430
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,960
You don't know him?

431
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,300
I've confessed everything

432
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,100
six years ago.

433
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,710
There are criminal records here.

434
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,830
I've been in jail for six years.

435
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,070
You said he belonged to Liu Qing's gang,

436
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,910
not Lei Naiwu's gang...

437
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,550
Whatever,

438
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,570
but why did he want to kill you today?

439
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,150
How would I know?

440
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,070
I went drinking with my friends.

441
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,360
Then I opened the door.

442
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,100
I wanted to pee.

443
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,630
He wanted to shoot me.

444
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,780
Then I tried to defend myself,

445
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,660
so I picked up the stick

446
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,590
to hit him.

447
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,710
Because I wouldn't

448
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,820
bow to the evil.

449
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,260
Or I would die.

450
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,750
Also,

451
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,910
I have something

452
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,940
that I must say.

453
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,620
In the past,

454
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,760
I went astray.

455
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,000
I took the wrong path.

456
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,590
But during the six years in prison,

457
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,870
Under the government's education and reform,

458
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,470
I realized my mistake.

459
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
I want to turn over a new leaf

460
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,380
and return to society.

461
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,900
But as soon as I returned to society,

462
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,670
they wanted

463
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,700
to kill me.

464
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,450
The society doesn't accept me.

465
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,590
It's really hard to be

466
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,220
a good person.

467
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,910
But now,

468
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,740
I have a heartache

469
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,430
and my whole body hurts.

470
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,180
I'm scared.

471
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,660
I need to go to the hospital.

472
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,350
You acted well.

473
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,210
Lei Naiwu.

474
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,710
Let me tell you.

475
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,060
I've seen a lot of people like you.

476
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,860
If you don't make it clear today,

477
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,070
you can't leave here.

478
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,980
I told you everything.

479
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,640
Let's retake your statement!

480
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
What's your name?

481
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,190
Lei Naiwu.

482
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,730
Lei Naiwu must die.

483
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,420
He ruined my daughter.

484
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,900
I must kill him.

485
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,940
If I turned myself in first,

486
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,540
I wouldn't be able to get out.

487
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,460
If that beast

488
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,410
harasses my child again,

489
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,070
what should I do?

490
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,020
You know Xueying's

491
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,680
condition.

492
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,100
She can't stand any stimulation.

493
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,060
If I go to jail,

494
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,340
who will protect them?

495
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,850
Shall I depend on Jiadong?

496
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,670
You know

497
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,570
what Jiadong is like.

498
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,260
He is weak

499
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:53,960
and incompetent.

500
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,560
Can I count on him?

501
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,390
So...

502
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,240
So I have to do it myself.

503
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,400
I must get rid of this beast.

504
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,480
This

505
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,080
is the last thing

506
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,310
I can do

507
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,540
for our children.

508
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,100
Alright.

509
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,020
Do whatever you want.

510
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,890
Where's the boat?

511
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,460
What boat?

512
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,320
The boat that carried the body.

513
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,710
It was already gotten rid of.

514
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,940
Then why do you still keep that gun?

515
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,410
It's been six years.

516
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,430
My life is more painful than death.

517
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,400
It's like living in hell.

518
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,630
I'm tired.

519
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,510
I'm tired.

520
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,940
I want to be free.

521
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:08,989
Dengyuan.

522
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,110
I want to be free.

523
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,940
Call the doctor.

524
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,670
Untie him.

525
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,400
Chen!

526
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:22,780
Chen.

527
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:23,940
Don't worry.

528
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,300
I'll go find the doctor.

529
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:27,870
Bro.

530
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,949
What did you tell the police?

531
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:31,310
Why did they let us go?

532
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,429
Last night,

533
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,580
the police

534
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,659
came so fast.

535
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,850
But they came in time.

536
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,100
Otherwise, we're doomed.

537
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,900
Dongyu.

538
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:41,190
This water area is downstream of the Long River.

539
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,190
The silt washed down from upstream

540
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,990
settles here.

541
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,820
It's been six years.

542
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,830
We don't know how deep the layers of silt

543
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,250
at the bottom of the river are.

544
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,180
And there was a flood two years ago.

545
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,640
It might be flushed to somewhere else.

546
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Don't worry.

547
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,440
I'll go check again.

548
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,150
Dongyu.

549
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,620
I...

550
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,860
I heard that

551
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,700
they found out the whereabouts of Uncle Zheng.

552
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,060
I called you,

553
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,960
but you didn't answer.

554
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,290
So I came to check on you.

555
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,060
Dongyu.

556
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,620
I know

557
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,740
you must be in a bad mood.

558
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,260
But after so many years,

559
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,160
at least there's

560
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,070
a result now.

561
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,800
My condolences.

562
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,780
Uncle Zheng can finally

563
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,490
reunite with your mom there.

564
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,940
You...

565
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,880
Have you found the murderer?

566
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,000
Who...

567
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,290
Who is the culprit?

568
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,540
Dongyu,

569
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,440
don’t keep it to yourself.

570
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,870
There will be a problem.

571
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,980
Do you want to talk to me?

572
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,600
Okay.

573
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,220
Let's talk about

574
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,620
how my dad died.

575
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,640
Your dad

576
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,230
killed my dad.

577
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,780
What...

578
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,260
What...

579
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,050
What did you say?

580
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,060
My...

581
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,590
My dad killed Uncle Zheng?

582
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,150
Please leave.

583
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,260
Well.

584
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,880
I said please leave.

585
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,370
I'm sorry. Please leave.

586
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,320
Let's go.

587
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,970
Bro, you'd better go out and hide.

588
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,290
If Chen Jingming

589
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,740
exposes you,

590
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,610
it'll be hard for you to leave.

591
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,850
He wanted to kill me,

592
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,480
but he had no guts to report me.

593
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,110
He's getting tougher.

594
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,710
He even shot me with a gun.

595
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,100
Hu.

596
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,960
Find some connections to inquire

597
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
about what's going on inside there.

598
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,120
Chen Jingming.

599
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,000
Your son sent a document

600
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,860
for you to sign.

601
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,310
I remember a movie where they said,

602
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,650
"If you live by the sword,

603
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,050
you die by the sword."

604
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:26,940
Dad.

605
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,300
It's time.

606
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,420
When you see my mom,

607
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,240
please apologize to her for me.

608
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,920
Tell her I'm sorry.

609
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,450
[Chen Jingming]
