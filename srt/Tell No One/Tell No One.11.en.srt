which is not easy.

185

187

Don't think too much.

189
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,750
Take care.

190
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,830
Get well.

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,070
The team is undergoing comprehensive deployment,

192

Don't run around.

00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:33,990
Kill him.

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,680
Don't kill me.

197
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,400
Don't kill me.

198
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,870
Stab him here.

199
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,850
Here.

200
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,680
Do it!

201
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,020
Why do you want to kill me?

202
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,290
We lost a large batch of goods.

203
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,850
Don't you understand?

204
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,930
They betrayed you.

205
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,550
Kill him.

206
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,790
Kill him.

207
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,310
Don't kill me.

208
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,870
Stab him here.

209
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,710
Do it!

210
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,880
Hello, Chief Li.

211
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,590
I have a clue.

212
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,550
Why are you not sleeping

213
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,100
but staring at me?

214
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,170
This is the task given by Chief Li.

215
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,240
Hello, Deputy Chief Zheng.

216
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,120
Turn on the speaker.

217
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:46,850
Okay.

218
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,130
It's turned on.

219
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,230
Is Gao Hu there?

220
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,110
Yes.

221
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:57,830
All right.

222
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,510
Turn off the speaker.

223
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,470
I did.

224
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,590
Bring him to the prison tomorrow.

225
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,650
I found something about Gao Jialing's case.

226
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,730
Don't tell him yet.

227
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,670
Let him sleep well

228
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,030
tonight.

229
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,350
Okay. Got it.

230
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,040
What did she say?

231
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,200
Ask what you should ask.

232
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,860
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

233
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,200
Why are you police

234
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,170
all the same?

235
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,800
What did she say?

236
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,870
You'll know tomorrow.

237
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,550
Go to sleep.

238
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,150
Lu Guimin.

239
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,570
We've found out

240
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,770
that the Murder Case at the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Gupan Town

241
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,780
is not a simple robbery and murder case.

242
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,510
I hope you can cooperate with us

243
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,150
to restore the truth.

244
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,920
What are you talking about?

245
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,590
I don't know.

246
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,110
I don't understand.

247
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,750
Lu Guimin.

248
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,360
I advise you to confess.

249
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,190
You are one of the earliest members

250
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,750
of Liu Qing's gang.

251
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,470
After you escaped from prison in 2003,

252
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,270
you were arrested by us again.

253
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,230
You've been in prison until now.

254
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,470
We've cracked the video about

255
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,330
you participating in Gao Jialing's case.

256
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,060
You should volunteer to tell us

257
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,740
and try to get a lighter punishment.

258
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,140
Why do you want to kill me?

259
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,160
Because you informed the police.

260
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,750
Do you still want to watch it, Lu?

261
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,110
You only have one chance

262
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,710
to get a lighter punishment.

263
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,550
Stab him here.

264
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,590
Do it!

265
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,730
I will tell you.

266
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,230
It was 19...

267
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,630
It should be 1990.

268
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,800
Liu Qing

269
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,070
got several boats.

270
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,150
He smuggled goods at the border.

271
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,650
It was strange.

272
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,389
The police were very accurate.

273
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,960
They could catch Liu Qing's men and goods

274
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,760
every time.

275
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,840
Liu Qing said

276
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,150
someone

277
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,250
must have leaked the information.

278
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,380
So he asked Lei to investigate.

279
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,870
At that time,

280
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,150
there was a businessman who did a small boat business

281
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,870
called Chen Jingming.

282
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,020
He wanted to seek refuge with my boss, Liu Qing.

283
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,550
Chen Jingming told me

284
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,949
some of his boys

285
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,400
found a man named Gao Jialing

286
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,389
was close to the police.

287
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,300
I told Lei about this.

288
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,909
Lei found out

289
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
that Gao Jialing was a retired soldier.

290
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,150
He was a prestigious local.

291
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,830
Lei decided to kill Gao Jialing

292
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,430
to give a warning.

293
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,830
Lei asked Chen Jingming

294
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,790
to kill

295
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,070
Gao Jialing.

296
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,970
He said it would be Chen Jingming's pledge.

297
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,590
That night,

298
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,480
Lei and Chen Jingming

299
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,720
brought me with them.

300
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,750
Then...

301
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,460
we went to...

302
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,160
The three of us sneaked into

303
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,040
that Supply and Marketing Cooperative on that rainy night.

304
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,310
Then why did Lei Naiwu say

305
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,590
Gao Jialing was betrayed by the police?

306
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,470
Lei wanted Gao Jialing to know

307
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,750
before he died that informing the police

308
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,700
wouldn't induce

309
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,950
good results.

310
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,630
Do you know Zheng Ying?

311
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,590
Who is Zheng Ying?

312
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,570
I don't know.

313
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,110
I don't know this person.

314
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,050
I don't.

315
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,280
When I'm

316
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,470
not around,

317
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,320
you need to learn to cook for yourself.

318
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,050
Understand?

319
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,880
I told you last time

320
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,630
after the water boils,

321
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,630
you need to add cold water

322
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,070
three times when making dumplings.

323
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,430
But when making wontons,

324
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,180
you just need to add cold water twice.

325
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,990
Got it?

326
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,710
I'll fall.

327
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,830
Don't worry.

328
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,780
I'm here.

329
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,640
You will never fall down.

330
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,510
Dad.

331
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,110
Will you leave me?

332
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,110
Of course not.

333
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,270
I'll always be with you

334
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,430
until you grow old.

335
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,270
According to the leadership's decision,

337
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,350
from today on,

338
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,910
we'll terminate your

339
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,040
undercover mission

340
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,110
and restore your identity as a police officer.

341
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,470
Although you had a hard time,

342
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,310
now the case is facing

343
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,110
a big twist,

344
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,020
we don't have time for you to rest.

345
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,270
We need you to participate

346
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,510
in the case immediately.

347
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,030
Yes.

348
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,340
Change your clothes.

349
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:03,280
[Linjiang Criminal Investigation]

350
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,830
Okay.

351
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,150
Stop for a while.

352
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,230
Let me

353
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,090
officially introduce him to you.

354
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,150
This is

355
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,430
the chief superintendent

356
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,360
of Linjiang Criminal Investigation Unit, Gao Yang.

357
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,460
Let's welcome him.

358
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,480
What are you looking at?

359
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,820
Don't you know me?

360
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,190
Hu, you...

361
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,470
Why are you wearing this?

362
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,710
Don't call me Hu.

363
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,920
Call me officer.

364
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,670
Officer.

365
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,660
From now on,

366
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,450
answer whatever I ask you.

367
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,790
Answer the truth.

368
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,910
Understand?

369
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,070
Yes, officer.

370
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,650
Do you know where Lei Naiwu is hiding?

371
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,550
What date is it today?

372
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,430
Seventh.

373
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,030
Did my boss

374
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,890
call me?

375
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,980
Then my boss

376
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,480
must be murdered.

377
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,650
I need to go somewhere far.

378
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,840
I might not be able to come back.

379
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,190
Well.

380
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,550
Boss.

381
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,750
Did something happen to you?

382
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,510
Well...

383
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:20,830
Well.

384
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,110
I'll watch the place for you.

385
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,640
There won't be any problem.

386
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,510
It's mainly because I'm old.

387
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,760
Remember what I said.

388
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,720
At noon the day after tomorrow,

389
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,950
no later than the night of the day after tomorrow,

390
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,350
I'll call you.

391
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,550
If you didn't receive

392
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,550
my call,

393
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,350
it means I'm dead.

394
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,590
No, Boss.

395
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,260
Is anyone causing you trouble?

396
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,520
Tell me who it is.

397
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,500
I'll kill him.

398
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,080
Chen Jiadong.

399
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,510
Coming.

400
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,580
Hello.

401
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,870
What's the matter?

402
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,470
Is Chen Jiadong home?

403
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,190
My brother

404
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,390
is not home.

405
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,520
Hello.

406
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,540
This is...

407
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,950
What's wrong?

408
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,500
Chen Jiadong.

409
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,710
You're suspected of murder.

410
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,150
Can you...

411
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,350
Can you give me one minute?

412
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,060
Xueying.

413
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,230
I'm going to talk to the police.

414
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,320
They need me

415
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,810
to ask me about something.

416
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:11,830
I...

417
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,590
I went to buy groceries for you.

418
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,800
Take it in for me.

419
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,020
I'll cook for you when I'm back.

420
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,110
Okay?

421
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,310
Here.

422
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,470
Wait for me at home.

423
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,540
Go in first.

424
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,680
I'll be back soon.

425
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:46,630
Chen Jiadong.

426
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,850
You are suspected of murder.

427
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,980
You are summoned according to the law.

428
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:51,450
This is a subpoena.

429
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,510
We found that

430
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,420
there's a large sum of transfer

431
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,680
to Lei Naiwu's account

432
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,920
was made by you.

433
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,170
Why did you give him money?

434
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,280
After...

435
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,710
After my father passed away,

436
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,360
Lei Naiwu

437
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,710
has been harassing us.

438
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,510
I can't afford to offend them.

439
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,200
Neither can I escape from him.

440
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,190
I can only save myself with money.

441
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,290
Where were you on the night of May 5th?

442
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,980
May 5th?

443
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,510
I should be home.

444
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,870
My sister

445
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,060
was in shock.

446
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,630
Her condition has been not stable lately.

447
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,950
Whenever I had time,

448
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:03,000
I went home to stay with her.

449
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,070
Master.

450
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,310
Chen Jiadong must be lying.

451
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,880
How much time is left for detention?

452
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,030
16 hours left.

453
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,280
Have you found the trace of Lei Naiwu?

454
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,310
The last time we saw him in the CCTV

455
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:18,880
was

456
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,190
at 10 p.m. that night,

457
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,350
Lei Naiwu got out of the car at the intersection of

458
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,210
Yanjiang Road.

459
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,080
Then he entered the blind spot.

460
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:27,730
The Yanjiang Road?

461
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,650
Was he going to the dock

462
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,850
to smuggle out?

463
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,280
I also suspected that.

464
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,230
But I've already checked through

465
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,400
the dock.

466
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,750
No one saw him.

467
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,070
Chen Xueying said

468
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,150
Chen Jiadong was

469
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,210
with her all night?

470
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,560
She told me that.

471
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,220
Can you talk to Xueying again?

472
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,190
She is

473
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,530
our only breakthrough.

474
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,430
Xueying.

475
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,470
Xueying.

476
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:32,790
Xueying.

477
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,630
Xueying.

478
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,670
Xueying.

479
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,030
Xueying.

480
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,750
Xueying.

481
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:51,990
Xueying.

482
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,390
Xueying.

483
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,220
Xueying.

484
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:15,750
Xueying.

485
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:18,200
What are you doing in the water?

486
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,580
I'm catching the fish.

487
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:23,070
Look.

488
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,090
Is it pretty?

489
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:27,590
Yes.

490
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:29,700
How about this?

491
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,920
Come up first, okay?

492
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,810
It's cold in the water. Be good.

493
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,530
I want to catch the fish.

494
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:43,500
Tomorrow morning,

495
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,900
we'll take you to buy fish

496
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,990
and buy you

497
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,580
a big and beautiful fish tank

498
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,310
for the fish to live in, okay?

499
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,030
Be good.

500
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,130
I have a fish tank.

501
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,400
There.

502
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,990
That is my fish tank.

503
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,340
My dad said that.

504
00:47:58,830 --> 00:47:59,790
He promised me

505
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,760
to make me

506
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,110
a big fish tank.

507
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:03,280
He would raise

508
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,940
colorful fish in there.

509
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,190
They will be all my mom's favorite fish.

510
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,930
In this way,

511
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,470
I won't have nightmares at night.

512
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,140
But when I moved,

513
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,910
I saw this tree.

514
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,990
This tree killed my fish.

515
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,110
It's all your fault.

516
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,230
Because of you,

517
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:27,950
everything has changed.

518
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:29,970
Dad has changed.

519
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,590
Brother has changed too.

520
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,580
Since you have been in our house,

521
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,910
everything has changed.

522
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,480
Dad.

523
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,840
I want a fish tank.

524
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,790
I hate this tree.

525
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,470
Give me the fish tank.

526
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:44,970
Give me the fish tank, okay?

527
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:45,830
When did they

528
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,590
move here?

529
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,570
2005.

530
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,070
Chief Li.

531
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,860
Send someone here.

532
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,550
Chen Xueying's house.
