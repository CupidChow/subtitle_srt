Because I'm afraid you'll kill me.

So it's been said that Chen Jingming was arrested

106

for killing a police officer.

107
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,430
But these past few days,

108
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,830
I finally figured it out.

109
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,000
On the day of the incident,

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,909
Chen Jingming couldn't have gone up the mountain.

111
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,990

113
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,730

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,310
Mr. Chen

115
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,820
did indeed sprain his foot,

116
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,990
and it was quite serious.

117
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,710
He hadn't left

118
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,370
the house for a week.

119
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,710
He could barely walk himself.

120
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,830
How could he

121
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,670
possibly have run into the woods to kill someone

122
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,470
and then evade

123
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,790
the police search?

124
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,990
But Chen Jingming confessed.

125
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,710
He even committed suicide in the hospital.

126

127
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,530
he committed suicide to escape punishment.

128
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,500
But I thought

129
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,050
it was impossible.

130
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,010
Why did he commit suicide?

131
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,169
I figured it out later.

132
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,919
Because he wanted to protect someone.

133
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,040
A person who knows the ink formula.

134
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,610

What do you mean?

195
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,560
Chief Li is here.

196
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,640
You're here.

197
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,730
Have a seat.

198
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,560
Are you okay?

199
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,940
Is he okay?

200
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,710
I went to the hospital and checked on him.

201
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,670
Kai has woken up.

202
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,350
I've already sorted out

203
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,680
the rest of the matters.

204
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,090
I won't let him be in danger again.

205
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,830
I have a question.

206
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,110
Kai is from our side.

207
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,980
Why didn't you tell me

208
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,780
about such an important matter?

209
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,150
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,570
That's a life at stake.

211
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,680
It could have been lost.

212
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,470
If you had told me earlier,

213
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,190
would this happen...

214
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,830
All right, calm down.

215
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,190
It's not easy for us

216
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,310
to develop an informant.

217
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,710
The fewer people who know,

218
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,750
the less risk.

219
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,670
It was my decision

220
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,310
not to let Dongyu tell you

221
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,680
due to safety concerns.

222
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,030
It's my fault.

223
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,830
Chief Li.

224
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,490
I indeed

225
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,190
didn't consider

226
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,590
this matter thoroughly.

227
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,190
Kai is my informant.

228
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,570
I should be responsible

229
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,590
for his safety.

230
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,270
I

231
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,720
didn't handle it well.

232
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,070
It was my negligence.

233
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,270
I request punishment.

234
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,030
What?

235
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,930
You are always ready to accept punishment.

236
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,750
If everyone were like you

237
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,910
and got punished,

238
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,590
then there'd be no one left

239
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,910
to do the work.

240
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,260
If you really want to be punished,

241
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,270
then go buy a bowl of noodles for me.

242
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,270
I'm still hungry after all the work.

243
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,840
Get two, I haven't eaten yet.

244
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,670
Lei Naiwu used Guan Dayong

245
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,140
to coerce Chen Jiadong.

246
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,250
Coerce?

247
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,730
Chen Jiadong and Lei Naiwu

248
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,320
talked for a long time

249
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,390
in the cemetery.

250
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,630
But it was too far.

251
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
I couldn't hear.

252
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,690
It seemed very confidential.

253
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,110
Lei dismissed

254
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,990
all of us.

255
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,590
Guan Dayong has been working for Chen Jingming

256
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,920
for more than ten years.

257
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,910
It's not surprising.

258
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,590
But Chen Jiadong and Lei Naiwu...

259
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,140
It seems like we need to rescue Guan Dayong

260
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,270
as soon as possible.

261
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,310
Why are you killing me?

262
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,190
Because you tipped off the police.

263
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,350
We lost a large batch of goods.

264
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,230
Do you know?

265
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,380
Don't you understand?

266
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,910
They betrayed you.

267
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Kill him!

268
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,150
Hurry up and play your card.

269
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,630
Bro.

270
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,589
You're here.

271
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,569
Bro, your package.

272
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
Who's turn?

273
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,710
Bro.

274
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,990
A package.

275
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,819
A package? Open it.

276
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,780
Where did it come from?

277
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
It's not written.

278
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,070
Who sent this? What for?

279
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,560
What's wrong, Bro?

280
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,850
Hu, you may leave.

281
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,380
Is everything okay?

282
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,640
Yes. You can leave now.

283
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,210
Leave the box.

284
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,210
Go out.

285
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,950
Can we get something

286
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,390
more sophisticated, Master?

287
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,390
Watched too many James Bond movies?

288
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
What else are you pondering?

289
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,820
Have they found Guan Dayong's car?

290
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,550
There are no surveillance cameras in the old city area.

291
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,750
Haven't found it yet.

292
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Take it easy.

293
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,750
Hey, Pao.

294
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,470
You are smart.

295
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,240
I found it. Get back to work.

296
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,430
Hello?

297
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,790
Can you check

298
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,830
Lei Naiwu's date

299
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,830
of imprisonment?

300
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,430
April 28, 2005.

301
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,190
And his release date?

302
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,820
March 26, 2011.

303
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,990
What's his prisoner number?

304
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,130
[Name Lei Naiwu, Number 52458]

305
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,130
[Linjiang No. 1 Prison]

306
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,020
52458.

307
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,070
Do you want it?

308
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,850
Not following. Right?

309
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,200
No.

310
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,630
Come.

311
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,400
Hu, are you following?

312
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:29,990
No.

313
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,750
I won again.

314
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,630
Look at your luck.

315
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,330
He won alone.

316
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,390
You won all today.

317
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,670
You're so lucky today.

318
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,850
I'm hungry.

319
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,780
Waipao.

320
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,430
You won so much.

321
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,950
Treat everyone to late-night snacks.

322
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,270
Sure. Okay.

323
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,050
Go buy it.

324
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,480
Okay, I'll go buy it.

325
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,230
Enjoy yourselves.

326
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,830
Okay.

327
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,320
Come on.

328
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,830
Keep betting.

329
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,590
Come on.

330
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,510
Hu, hurry up.

331
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,470
Let me tell you something.

332
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,430
Go on. Keep dealing.

333
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,870
My stomach hurts. I need to use the bathroom.

334
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,490
Enjoy yourselves.

335
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,260
Okay.

336
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,030
Fa.

337
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,260
I have to tell you something.

338
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,550
Someone told me

339
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,230
Gao Hu is a cop.

340
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,530
[Gao Hu is a cop]

341
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,950
I bet one hundred.

342
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,350
I'll bet one hundred too.

343
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,730
You...

344
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,410
Pass.

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,720
Do you believe it? I don't.

346
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,510
Like father, like son.

347
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,190
The father and son of the Chen family

348
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,230
are really bad.

349
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,290
They're worse than me.

350
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,650
They're trying to scare me off and make me leave.

351
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,690
Can I leave?

352
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,950
I can't leave.

353
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,080
I can't let your blood go in vain.

354
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,850
I have to get the money.

355
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,110
After that,

356
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,070
I'll quit.

357
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,020
I'll leave.

358
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,160
Don't worry, Fa.

359
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,590
I'll burn

360
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,670
every penny

361
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,590
of your share to you,

362
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,350
one by one.

363
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,310
Keep protecting me,

364
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,670
blessing me,

365
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,510
and shielding me.

366
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,750
When Dad's

367
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,830
not around,

368
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,790
you have to learn to cook for yourself.

369
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,710
I need to answer a call.

370
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,710
Keep wrapping it.

371
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,890
You have to ensure

372
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,270
the pleats are tight.

373
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,400
Remember.

Do you know?

387
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,450
Don't you understand?

388
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,410
They betrayed you.

389
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,380
Don't kill me!

390
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,050
Kill him!

391
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,200
These are all

392
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,250
my dad's work diaries.

393
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,040
Gao Jialing.

394
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,530
These are the allowances given to informants.

395
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,790
So Uncle Gao

396
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,870
was my dad's informant.

397
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,780
Don't you understand?

398
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,920
They betrayed you.

399
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,410
Do you want to catch the bad guys?

400
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,470
Do you remember me?

401
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,950
Because we're

402
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,940
family.

403
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,430
Hello,

404
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,920
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

405
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,630
Why did you turn off your phone?

406
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,690
I thought something happened to you.

407
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,220
You managed to open the safe?

408
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,710
How did my dad die?

409
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,810
What do you mean?

410
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,200
My dad was Zheng Ying's informant.

411
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,640
Do you know?

412
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,230
Due to organizational discipline requirements,

413
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,430
I can’t tell you this.

414
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,710
Gao Yang.

415
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,270
Uncle Lei.

416
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,310
Did your dad tell you

417
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,640
what kind of person I am?

418
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,660
See?

419
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,310
My boss Liu Qing

420
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,390
asked me to collect five thousand yuan.

421
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,200
On my way back,

422
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,050
nine guys blocked me.

423
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,910
They had knives

424
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,710
and told me to leave the money and go.

425
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,510
I didn't run.

426
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
Those nine guys came up and slashed me.

427
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,590
My flesh was even exposed.

428
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,150
But I knocked them

429
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,190
all down.

430
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,670
They were covered in blood.

431
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,800
My boss said, "You should have just run

432
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,260
and given them the money."

433
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,310
I didn't run

434
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,440
because I'm a gangster.

435
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,970
Do you understand?

436
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,450
You're using a video

437
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,650
of me killing someone

438
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,630
to scare me

439
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,630
and make me leave?

440
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,810
You've never been slashed before.

441
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,690
You know?

442
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,250
And you're here telling me

443
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,910
Gao Hu is a cop.

444
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,510
Even if he is...

445
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,550
He is a cop,

446
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,330
why hasn't he arrested me?

447
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,000
He needs evidence to arrest me.

448
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,770
You said I killed someone.

449
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,750
You also killed someone.

450
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,150
The deadline I told you about last time

451
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,720
has two days left.

452
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,390
20 million.

453
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,560
Not in RMB, I want it in USD now.

454
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,680
You have to get it ready.

455
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,420
I'll release Guan Dayong when I get back.

456
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,550
Many people want to know

457
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,790
your family's story.

458
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,430
The police

459
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,740
and that man called Li Dengyuan...

460
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,200
You call him uncle, right?

461
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,210
He's the one most eager to know.

462
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,390
Don't fool me.

463
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,620
I see.

464
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:12,950
Uncle Lei.

465
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,680
By the way, Uncle Lei,

466
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,230
I think

467
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,270
I need to tell you something.

468
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,040
That year, the informant you and my dad killed

469
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,220
at the supply and marketing cooperative

470
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:37,870
was

471
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,790
Gao...

472
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,790
Gao Hu's father.

473
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,520
Uncle Lei, I've...

474
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,750
I've arranged a bath attendant for you.

475
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,700
I've already paid for it.

476
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,450
Enjoy yourself.

477
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,990
Six.

478
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,510
Get me a gun.

479
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,890
The sooner, the better.

480
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,480
Here.

481
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,480
Okay, I'll do it.

Let me ask you something.

492
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,060
Have you seen Gao Yang recently?

493
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,790
No.

494
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,790
Haven't you contacted each other recently?

495
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,260
No.

496
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,030
Call him.

497
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,540
He's not available.

Nothing.

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,990
Really?

501
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,990
He's a bit emotional.

502
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,280
Let me know if you hear anything about him.

503
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,750
Tell him to call me.

507
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,030
Tell me.

508
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,970
There's no rush.

509
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,420
Say whatever comes to your mind.
