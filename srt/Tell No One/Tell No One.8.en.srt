What happened?

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,450
Chen Jiadong came this afternoon.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,550
He said there was a company document

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,030
to sign.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,590
He also said we agreed.

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:24,870
Yes.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,710
Did you let Chen Jiadong into the ward?

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,300
No.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,030
Our men

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,160
brought the document in to be signed.

Chen Jiadong

13
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,270
stayed outside the door.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,590
And then what?

15
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,110
Then

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,870
as soon as Chen Jiadong left,

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,830
Chen Jingming said he was tired.

18
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,550

When the nurse

22
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,430
went in to change the dressing,

23
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:38,870
she found that the needle

24
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,060
had already been broken by Chen Jingming.

25
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,190
He'd slit his wrist under the blanket.

26
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,280
It was too late for emergency treatment.

Dad, the case is finally solved,

31
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,660
but where are you?

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,120
I haven't drunk with you for a long time.

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,110
Come on, Zheng.

The two of us

35
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,520
should drink today.

36

Cheers,

37
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,230
Dad.

38
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,550
Great timing.

39
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,130
Since you're here,

40
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,330
drink with him.

41
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,590
Dad,

42
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,320
have a cup.

43
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,650
Are you okay?

44
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,070
Actually...

45
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,310
I'm fine.

46
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,990
But also not really.

47
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,110
Gao Yang,

48
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,550
let me ask you a question.

49
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,160
Have you ever had an instant

50
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,430
or

51
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,260
a second

52
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,550
where you would really regret

53
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,520
being a police officer?

54
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,880
When I was young, my dad was rarely home.

55
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,200
I always got mad at him,

56
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,590
so my dad would take his police cap

57
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,670
and let me wear it

58
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,240
to make me happy.

59
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,520
When I went out to play in the yard,

60
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,090
the other kids

61
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,720
would look at me differently.

62
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,310
At that time, I thought

63
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,110
the police

64
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,200
were the most powerful people in the world.

65
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,190
But after I grew up,

66
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,320
I realized the police needed protection too.

67
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,670
The police would get scared too.

68
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,470
Do you know how I survived

69
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,500
these six years?

70
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,880
Every day in the past six years,

71
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,440
I pretended that I didn't care,

72
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,210
like I didn't have any complaints

73
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,720
toward anything

74
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,190
and the organization,

75
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,910
but it wasn't like that.

76
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,830
I was not happy at all.

77
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,159
These six years,

78
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,830
so many people searched together.

79
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,370
They took so long.

80
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,240
But they couldn't find Zheng.

81
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,610
Actually, I even thought just now

82
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,950
that we should stop looking.

83
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,480
If this case doesn't close,

84
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,630
everyone will be stuck

85
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,790
in guilt forever.

86
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,870
But now,

87
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,010
the case is closed.

88
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,190
But I...

89
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,400
I...

90
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,150
I'll never have

91
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,370
a mom and dad anymore.

92
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,550
I'll stop.

93
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,030
Do you think

94
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,460
I'm very selfish?

95
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,630
No.

96
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,490

102

103
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,730
I can't sleep at night either.

104
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,840
Last night,

105
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,590
Zheng appeared in my dream

106
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,190
and said so many things to me.

107
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,910
He said he was cold

108
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,670
and couldn't sleep.

109
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,390
The place was humid too

110
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,210
and there were many bugs.

111
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:33,950
I know.

112
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,790

113
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,510

I'll protect you from now on.

115

No matter what happens,

116
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,480
we won't separate.

117
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,730

118
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,930

Therefore,

120
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,790

121
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,390

A few days ago,

137
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,590
the police came over

138
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,240
as soon as he accepted two cars.

139
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,570
Of course he got caught.

140
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,020
How come you're fine?

141
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,510
He only had me repair some motorcycles

142
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,570
and do some miscellaneous tasks.

143
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,100
It had nothing to do with me.

144
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,030
Take it.

145
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,750
You brat,

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,260
you can't do well anywhere.

147
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440

Sit down and eat.

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,060
Here, have some drinks.

Okay.

186
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,670
What's wrong?

187
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,950
Chen Jingming died.

188
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,880
Died?

189
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,480
I just found out too.

190
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,190
How did he die?

191
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,780
I heard it was suicide.

192
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,920
Why did he commit suicide?

193
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,750
It's okay.

194
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,970
Go have a drink.

195
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,750
Go hang out with them.

196
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,790
Drink with them first.

197
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,910
I'll sit for a while.

198
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,630
Are you okay?

199
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,190
I'm fine.

200
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,910
Go. Go.

201
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,210
What's wrong?

202
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,230
What's wrong?

203
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,370
Go eat.

204
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,890
Try the fish

205
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,670
made by Uncle Guan.

206
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,480
It's the original version.

207
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,190
Try it.

208
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,080
Go ahead.

209
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,030
How is it?

210
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,470
It's not as delicious as my dad's.

211
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,030
Really?

212
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,370
Where's my dad?

213
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,670
I haven't seen him for days.

214
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,390
Uncle Guan.

215
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,440
Where did my dad go?

216
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,550
Your...

217
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,690
Your dad...

218
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,000
Jiadong,

219
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,240
where did Dad go?

220
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,720
Actually...

221
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,070
Two days ago, your dad

222
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,970
couldn't be saved

223
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,460
and left us.

224
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,640
Impossible.

225
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,530
My dad was not sick.

226
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,250
We wanted to tell you

227
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,840
when you felt better.

228
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,920
Now it seems that you've guessed it already,

229
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,440
right?

230
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,400
He's passed away.

231
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,920
We have to face the reality.

232
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,300
You have to live well

233
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,810
for your dad

234
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,270
and mom, right?

235
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,430
Ying,

236
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,829
look.

237
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,670
You still have

238
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,310
a brother who loves you so much.

239
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,030
Call him.

240
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:26,910
Call him!

241
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,830
-Hurry up and call my dad!
-And Uncle Guan.

242
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,630
Hurry!

243
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,140
Hurry up and call my dad!

244
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,400
Jiadong.

245
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,590
Call Dad.

246
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,630
Call him!

247
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,560
Call Dad.

248
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,710
Hurry up.

249
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,260
I want the phone.

250
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,480
I want you to call Dad,

251
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,590
hurry up!

252
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,720
My daughter is back!

253
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,440
Dad.

254
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,010
Great.

255
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,680
Here.

256
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,540
You scared me this time.

257
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
Does it hurt here?

258
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,840
Not anymore.

259
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,130
It tastes okay.

260
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,690
It's just a bit off.

261
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,470
See?

262
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,470
It's not easy to get a compliment

263
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,470
from my daughter.

264
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,760
Three fish?

265
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,150
Because every time

266
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,210
I cook fish for you,

267
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,870
it's always

268
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,820
a little bit off.

269
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,150
So today,

270
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,350
I cooked three

271
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,330
in one go.

272
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,190
I think

273
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,330
there must be one

274
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,860
that meets my daughter's standards.

275
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,230
It is said that

276
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,110
after Chairman Chen Jingming

277
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,400
of Minghua Group

278
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,750
was arrested by the police,

279
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,970
the truth of Minghua Group

280
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,030
has been revealed.

281
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,790
Over the past two years,

282
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,480
Minghua Group

283
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,210
has been operating under debt.

284
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,000
A Ms. Liu

285
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,970
who's responsible for investor matters

286
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,280
told the reporters

287
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,170
that based on the current asset condition

288
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,240
of Minghua Group,

289
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,790
he must pay off

290
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,670
all the debts.

291
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,620
-Otherwise, the investors' stocks
-I was almost fooled by Chen Jingming.

292
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,420
and shares will be transferred.

293
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,030
I was tricked by this old bastard.

294
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,920
I didn't get a penny,

295
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,190
but I almost owed

296
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,790
two or three billion in debt.

297
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,670
Evil.

298
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,310
Chen Jingming, you committed suicide.

299
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,300
Why?

300
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,750
Jiadong,

301
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,910
Ying is finally asleep.

302
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,350
Uncle Guan.

303
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,700
I...

304
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Sit down and talk.

305
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,590
Okay.

306
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,490
I've asked

307
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,630
Director Zhao from the provincial hospital.

308
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,710
He said to continue taking the medicine

309
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,310
and observe Ying for a few more days.

310
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,950
If she's mentally well,

311
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,540
she'll be fine.

312
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,630
Okay.

313
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,790
By the way,

314
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,920
Mr. Chen will be buried in two days.

315
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,710
I've informed

316
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,950
547 people

317
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
but only received 27 replies.

318
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
So if that's the case,

319
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,420
this is what I think.

320
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:12,880
Uncle Guan.

321
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,040
Call those 27 people

322
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,870
tomorrow

323
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,470
and tell them

324
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,100
not to come either.

325
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,970
I thought about it.

326
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,510
Let's just have

327
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,070
our own people attend my dad's funeral.

328
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,190
That works.

329
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,520
Just our own people.

330
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,990
By that, I mean

331
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,500
me and Xueying.

332
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,580
You don't have to attend either.

333
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,260
I won't go either?

334
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,590
Take this

335
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,170
nine million yuan.

336
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,890
You worked under my father

337
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,220
for so many years.

338
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,390
Go and enjoy your life.

339
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,030
Also,

340
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,250
I bought you

341
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,150
a plane ticket for tomorrow.

342
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,420
Go abroad to find your son

343
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,920
and enjoy the rest of your life.

344
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,150
Is it that urgent?

345
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,320
Let me see Mr. Chen off

346
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,670
for the last time,

347
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,350
okay?

348
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,110
Uncle Guan,

349
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,110
leaving earlier

350
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,240
is safer.

351
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,150
I'm afraid

352
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,670
you won't be able to leave

353
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,150
when you want to.

354
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,190
I understand.

355
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,910
I understand.

356
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,750
I rarely saw

357
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,530
Dad wear this sweater.

358
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,390
This was my dad's favorite.

359
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,070
When my mom

360
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,390
knitted it for him,

361
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,610
she ran out of yarn,

362
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,650
so I took apart

363
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,130
my red scarf

364
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,750
and filled in this part for him.

365
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,910
When he wore it,

366
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,070
he was so proud.

367
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,880
He looked this way and that

368
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,470
and couldn't get enough of it.

369
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,200
Come on, Dad.

370
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,440
Come and take a look.

371
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,790
It's really good.

372
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,430
Well...

373
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,400
What do you think?

374
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,870
Is it suitable?

375
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,310
Yes.

376
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,030
Suitable.

377
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,590
Dad,

378
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,240
you look good in this red sweater.

379
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,640
Yeah?

380
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,730
Really looks good.

381
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,190
I'd look better

382
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,830
if my hair was dark.

383
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,630
My dad is handsome in everything,

384
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,360
right?

385
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,710
Yes.

386
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,520
Let's go.

387
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,900
Let my mom have a look.

388
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,550
Mom.

389
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,230
Come and have a look.

390
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,140
I put it on Dad.

391
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,560
It looks good.

392
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,480
Looks really good.

393
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,050
Looks good?

394
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,770
Isn't it?

395
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,440
Then let's eat.

396
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,730
Let's eat.

397
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,430
Pour some wine.

398
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,690
Two questions.

399
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,120
What a chatterbox. You even have questions?

400
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,640
Listen.

401
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,240
First question.

402
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,430
Why are you two forcing me

403
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,560
to wear red clothes?

404
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,870
This year is your zodiac year.

405
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,790
Have you forgotten?

406
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,370
You have to wear red for your zodiac year.

407
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,500
Have you forgotten?

408
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,030
Second question.

409
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,470
Honey, look.

410
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,190
Look.

411
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,710
Why are there two colors?

412
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,600
Look at the collar.

413
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,470
Let me explain

414
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,570
this question.

415
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,190
When I was knitting the sweater for you,

416
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,300
I ran out of yarn

417
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,520
because you gained weight every month.

418
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,270
I used up one kilogram of yarn.

419
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,170
And then?

420
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,910
Then our

421
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,320
little angel

422
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,140
took apart

423
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,670
her scarf

424
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,650
and filled in this part for you.

425
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,590
Why are you crying

426
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,690
as you're talking?

427
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,800
It's Chinese New Year.

428
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,240
Come on.

429
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,270
Let's toast to our angel.

430
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,110
Thank you, little angel.

431
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,510
I'll toast to my parents.

432
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,030
Cheers.

433
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,180
Cheers!

434
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,790
Since this was

435
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,070
Zheng's favorite,

436
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,830
let's send it to him too.

437
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,450
No.

438
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Let's keep it.

439
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,090
Keep it for the memory.

440
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,830
Sure.

441
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,310
We'll keep it.

442
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,310
These are all

443
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,570
my dad's work diaries.

444
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,880
He's so detailed

445
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,120
with all these books.

446
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,830
Year 2002.

447
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,950
Year 2000.

448
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,790
Gao Jialing?

449
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,400
February 10, 1990.

450
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,950
In 1990,

451
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,200
my dad was still a front-line investigator.

452
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,590
I got it.

453
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,500
This was the compensation for informants.

454
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,750
Could it be...

455
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,390
I found Uncle Gao's name.

456
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,720
So Uncle Gao

457
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,680
was Zheng's informant.

458
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,550
They must

459
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,570
have been close.

460
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,330
Maybe they had

461
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,550
known each other

462
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,340
since before we were born.

463
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,190
No wonder

464
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,390
after my dad passed away,

465
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,190
the first to come visit me

466
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,070
was Zheng.

467
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,510
Say,

468
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,470
why didn't Zheng

469
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,710
tell me before?

470
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,930
Don't think too much.

471
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,590
If Uncle Gao

472
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,720
knew

473
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,800
that you've become a police officer,

474
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,830
he'd be proud of you.

475
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,950
Maybe

476
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,110
they are

477
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,740
drinking together right now

478
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,040
and watching you from heaven.

479
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,070
You must work hard.

480
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,590
I will.

481
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,670
Dad,

482
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,220
will you leave me?

483
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,480
Of course not.

484
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,800
I'll always be with you

485
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,870
until you have gray hair.

486
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,270
After the water boils,

487
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,220
you need to

488
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,800
add water three times for dumplings,

489
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,750
but for wontons,

490
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,830
you only need to add cold water twice.

491
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,630
Got it?

492
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,570
Come on. Follow it.

493
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,440
How much?

494
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,710
Hurry up.

495
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,230
I'll put in 50 first.

496
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,230
Here, 50 with you.

497
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,290
One hundred first.

498
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,370
You'll do 100 first?

499
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,400
Follow with 100.

500
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,310
Hello?

501
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,850
Gao Hu,

502
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,570
Xueying relapsed again.

503
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,440
Can you come here?

504
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,110
Okay.

505
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,790
Two hundred.

506
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,770
Another 100.

507
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,300
Waipao,

508
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,990
I need to go out.

509
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,210
Tell Wu.

510
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,230
Okay, Hu.

511
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,570
I'll be here with Boss.

512
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,190
Do you want to see the cards?

513
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,870
[Jin Ming]

514
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,590
Hu.

515
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,350
Hu.

516
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,630
Pao.

517
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,230
Boss.

518
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,170
Where's Hu?

519
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,800
He went out for something.

520
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,330
He went to the hospital again?

521
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,430
Okay.

522
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,230
You guys go.

523
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,850
Invite someone for me.

524
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,790
Be civilized.

525
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,120
Let me out! Let me go!

526
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,680
I want to find my dad.

527
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,330
Let go of me!

528
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,520
Xueying, calm down.

529
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,320
Xueying.

530
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,440
Xueying, calm down

531
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,830
Look who's here.

532
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,150
Gao Hu?

533
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,520
Gao Hu,

534
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,380
listen to me.

535
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,630
Dad is not dead.

536
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,540
I saw him last night.

537
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,590
He was outside.

538
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,270
He was looking at me.

539
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,510
Trust me.

540
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,570
They don't trust me.

541
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,270
You have to trust me.

542
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,190
I trust you.

543
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,570
Can you visit my dad?

544
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,630
Okay?

545
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,030
Okay.

546
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:36,790
Okay.

547
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:37,470
Let's go.

548
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:38,790
Here.

549
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,030
He was right here.

550
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,300
He was looking at me from the outside.

551
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,910
He was here yesterday.

552
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,470
He left.

553
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,030
Gao Hu,

554
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,920
you have to trust me.

555
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,740
My dad is not dead.

556
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,160
It's all your fault.

557
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,550
It's all because of you.

558
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,840
Everything changed after you came

559
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,270
to my family.

560
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,640
It’s all because of you

561
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,750
-It's all your fault.
-Xueying.

562
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,040
It's all your fault.

563
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,470
-It’s all your fault!
-Xueying.

564
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,630
It's all your fault.

565
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,350
Xueying, come down first.

566
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,460
My family has changed.

567
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,750
The feng shui of my family

568
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,950
is all because of you.

569
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,710
It's all your fault.

570
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,310
It’s all you.

571
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,350
Xueying.

572
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,310
Enough.

573
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,200
I'll chop it down.

574
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,750
-I want to chop it down.
-Xueying.

575
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,610
Let go of me! I want to chop it down.

576
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,150
Xueying.

577
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,920
Let go of me!

578
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,480
Xueying.

579
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,390
Jiadong.

580
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,160
Are you okay?

581
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,450
Are you okay?

582
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:58,950
Come.

583
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,070
Xueying.

584
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,960
Dad.

585
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,950
Calm down.

586
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:21,960
Who are you?

587
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,130
What are you doing?

588
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,470
Come in.

589
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,790
Chief Li,

590
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,430
look.

591
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,420
Lei Naiwu captured Guan Dayong

592
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,460
at the company?

593
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,620
Boss! Boss!

594
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,330
Brother Guan.

595
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,710
There was something up there

596
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,730
that I had to take care of.

597
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,410
Apologies.

598
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,890
You called me "Brother Guan?"

599
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,140
I'm flattered.

600
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,130
Why are you flattered?

601
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,310
You're my senior.

602
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,630
Even Chen Jingming had to respect you.

603
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,110
You're definitely the big brother.

604
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,989
Mr. Lei.

605
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,830
What do you mean?

606
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
What were you doing?

607
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,440
What were you doing?

608
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,270
I told you to be civilized.

609
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,270
How disrespectful!

610
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,139
Didn't I say to invite him?

611
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:49,989
Brother Guan,

612
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,050
I apologize to you.

613
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,310
Why did I invite you here?

614
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,060
It's because

615
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,140
Chen Jingming died, right?

616
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,570
For many things,

617
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,970
I don't understand them,

618
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,270
but you must know.

619
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,510
I don't remember

620
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,340
what happened in the past.

621
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,450
I didn't even ask you yet

622
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,180
and you say you don't remember?

623
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,220
You're already confused.

624
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,590
You can't recall

625
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,630
anything now?

626
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,270
I can't.

627
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,010
Brother Guan, let me buy you a drink.

628
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,580
Let's drink and recall together.

629
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,240
No hurries.

630
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,870
I don't drink.

631
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,070
You must drink.

632
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,050
Come.

633
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,380
Help me host my Brother Guan.

634
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,860
What are you doing?

635
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,240
Let's go.

636
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,640
You...

637
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,790
Brother Guan,

638
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,980
do you recall anything?

639
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,400
No.

640
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,270
You didn't drink enough.

641
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,350
Come on, open the bottle.

642
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,110
Pour it for my Brother Guan.

643
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,880
Guan Dayong is in danger.

644
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,430
Do as we discussed.

645
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,030
I’ll inform Gao Yang.

646
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,510
How is she?

647
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,830
She's better.

648
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,050
She went back to her room to sleep.

649
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,960
Okay.

650
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,070
Hello?

651
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,280
I'll be right there.

652
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,200
I'm leaving.

653
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,900
You came back just in time.

654
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,220
How did you know Kai?

655
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,320
He was here when I came.

656
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,660
Yes.

657
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,710
But you two are close.

658
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,670
Aren't I close

659
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,810
with everyone?

660
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,930
If I must say someone's special,

661
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,190
before Lu left,

662
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,940
he said

663
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,070
he and Kai were close

664
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,450
and asked me to take good care of him.

665
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,500
But how did you know Lu?

666
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,320
We escaped

667
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,600
from prison together.

668
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,140
You almost buried me alive,

669
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,950
remember?

670
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,550
Drink less fake alcohol.

671
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,420
Okay.

672
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,300
It's been more than six years.

673
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,690
He contacted you as soon as he came.

674
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,710
It's just like when I came looking for you.

675
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,790
The day he came,

676
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,790
he said he was in trouble,

677
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,390
so he wanted to work under us.

678
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,280
I didn't agree to it.

679
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,790
I told him to find a proper job

680
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,870
and make some stable money.

681
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,840
It was you who insisted for him

682
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,930
to come in to eat,

683
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,430
right?

684
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,030
Yes.

685
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:46,850
Yes.

686
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
You even cooked the dishes that day.

687
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,740
They didn't dare to say it,

688
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,900
but I must tell you.

689
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,350
The food tasted terrible.

690
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,380
Do you suspect me?

691
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,560
I suspect myself.

692
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,680
Let's go.

693
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,000
Undo it for him.

694
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,460
Untie the rope.

695
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,380
[Two hours ago]

696
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,500
Pao.

697
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,010
What are you doing?

698
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,470
Nothing.

699
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,120
Who are you texting?

700
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,700
A friend.

701
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,640
A friend?

702
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,650
Let me have a look.

703
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:01,970
Well...

704
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,600
Stop looking, Pao.

705
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,110
Let me have a look.

706
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,650
Boss.

707
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,380
Boss,

708
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,760
well...

709
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,540
It's a misunderstanding.

710
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,040
Kai,

711
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,310
I hate

712
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,810
traitors like you the most.

713
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,850
When I was in elementary school

714
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,200
and the school booked the movie theater,

715
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,480
whenever the traitor appeared,

716
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,670
I would hate it so much.

717
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,550
If I had a spear,

718
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,750
I'd stab him to death.

719
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,710
Come.

720
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,360
See if any of these people standing

721
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,810
are on your side.

722
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:13,430
Anyone?

723
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:15,900
No.

724
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,610
Anyone with you?

725
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,730
Over here. Anyone?

726
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,950
Anyone?

727
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,750
Anyone?

728
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,780
No.

729
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,410
No.

730
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,600
All right.

731
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,300
Come, spread it out.

732
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,300
Boss.

733
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,110
Boss.

734
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,100
Boss!

735
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,650
I was wrong.

736
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,390
Boss,

737
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,500
I was wrong.

738
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,340
Boss.

739
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,790
Boss,

740
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,450
I was wrong.

741
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,390
Boss.

742
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,040
I was wrong.

743
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,610
Boss,

744
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,280
giving him a swift kill is too easy on him.

745
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,790
Let's bury him alive.

746
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,630
Bury him.

747
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,230
Kai!

748
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,230
Kai!

749
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,060
Kai!

750
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,370
This batch of goods

751
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,190
won't pass the money detector.

752
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,330
[2002]

753
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:11,230
What's the reason?

754
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,190
Can't you find out?

755
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,100
It's the ink again.

756
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,830
I've found some experts

757
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,950
and they're looking for a solution.

758
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,710
Jiadong,

759
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,940
how do you know this place?

760
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,040
You haven't figured out

761
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,650
the ink formula yet?

762
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,660
You shouldn't be here.

763
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,920
Go back now.

764
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,030
Try this.

765
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,950
What is this?

766
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,940
This is a sample I developed.

767
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,180
It should be helpful to you.

768
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,330
Jiadong, you bastard!

769
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,070
From now on,

770
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,830
you need me.

771
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:37,310
I can help you succeed.

772
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:47,820
Brat,

773
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,410
you can even hit your dad now.

774
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,770
The other half of the ink formula

775
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,110
is in my classmate's hands.

776
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,140
He looks down

777
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,160
on our business.

778
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,270
We must force him to give us

779
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,820
