Thank you.

196
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,010
Officer Zheng.

197
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,040
This is Xu Mei's medical record.

198
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,700
Take a look.

199
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,070
I remember

200
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,150
she was seriously injured

201
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,510
when she was sent here.

202
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,720
And she was eight months pregnant.

203
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,400
At that time,

204
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,640
our hospital had limited conditions.

205
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,440
So after we gave

206
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,330
[Letter of Transfer to the Second People's Hospital of Jiangdong Province]

207
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,560
her simple treatment,

208
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,160
we sent her to

209
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,880
the Provincial People's Hospital.

210
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,030
Okay, got it.

211
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:52,610
Thank you.

212
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,540
You’re welcome.

213
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,610
-Chief Li.
-Chief Li.

214
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,750
Zuo.

215
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,440
Untie one of his hands.

216
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,390
How did you sleep?

217
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,200
Good.

218
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,390
Careless.

219
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,590
You'll die anyway.

220
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,020
You'll be relieved if you die.

221
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,040
You won't worry about anything then.

222
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,510
Eat it while it's hot.

223
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,150
On May 16th,

224
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,920
2004,

225
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,830
in the morning like today's,

226
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,830
you drove the Jetta you borrowed

227
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,480
to take your wife,

228
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,800
Xu Mei, who was eight months

229
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,470
pregnant

230
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,870
to go back to the city for delivery.

231
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,200
When the car went to the Chengjiaoxi Road,

232
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,270
a BMW X5

233
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,490
suddenly broke into the red light

234
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,530
and hit your car on the right.

235
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,280
Xu Mei was in the passenger seat.

236
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,540
She was badly injured.

237
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,330
Her life was in danger.

238
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,790
One day later,

239
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,630
Xu Mei was transferred to

240
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,440
the ICU ward

241
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,240
of the Provincial People's Hospital.

242
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,770
To save your wife and child,

243
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,670
you needed a large sum of medical expenses.

244
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,920
You did everything you could.

245
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,560
You utilized media.

246
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,190
You sold the champion medals.

247
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,280
You requested donations from the public.

248
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,750
A few days later,

249
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,030
you paid 100,000 yuan of surgery fee

250
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,360
at once.

251
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,750
You also paid several times after that in a row.

252
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,460
It was a total of 300,000 yuan.

253
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,920
Where did you get the money?

254
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,330
You killed someone else

255
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,070
to get money to save your family.

256
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
The person you killed

257
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,110
also had a wife

258
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,430
and a child.

259
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,150
He was a policeman,

260
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,630
a good policeman who had worked hard

261
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,270
for 30 years.

262
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
I was forced.

263
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,480
I was forced.

264
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,710
I was forced.

265
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,950
Xueying.

266
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,470
Come on, try it.

267
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,920
See how the fish

268
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,810
I made today is.

269
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,440
Not bad.

270
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,030
But it's not that good.

271
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,840
The texture

272
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,340
is not good.

273
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,400
See?

274
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,180
It's not easy for my daughter

275
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,940
to praise me.

276
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,000
You don't know

277
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,140
that Uncle Guan

278
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,520
taught me to cook this.

279
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,800
If you don't like it,

280
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,070
it must be that Uncle Guan

281
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,300
has hidden a trick from me.

282
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,340
No, no, no.

283
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,740
I think it's okay.

284
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,960
Have a seat.

285
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,680
Ms. Wang.

286
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,410
Get Guan a set of tableware.

287
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,880
Let's eat together.

288
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,070
You need to take your time

289
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,000
to cook.

290
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,490
Ying.

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,280
Just like your dance,

292
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,550
you need solid basic skills.

293
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,270
Right?

294
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,119
Ying, you seem

295
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,030
to have lost weight.

296
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,680
Are rehearsals very tense?

297
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,230
I plan to practice in a few days.

298
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,150
When is the performance?

299
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,800
Soon.

300
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,670
You must invite me to watch it.

301
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,130
I'll leave you a ticket.

302
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:20,810
Okay.

303
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,069
You must invite your dad too.

304
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,350
Eat up.

305
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,240
It'll get cold.

306
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,950
Okay.

307
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,880
Here.

308
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,080
My wife was in the hospital

309
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,560
waiting for money to save her life.

310
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,130
I borrowed money everywhere.

311
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,610
I kept borrowing money.

312
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,850
But I couldn't get enough of it.

313
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,270
Later, Boss Liu

314
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,590
gave me some money.

315
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,910
He said that was life-buying money.

316
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,330
He would ask me to pay it back later.

317
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,760
Later, one day,

318
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,150
he asked me to kill someone.

319
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,360
I made up my mind

320
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,400
and agreed.

321
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,030
He told me

322
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,480
he would send someone

323
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,020
to help that person cross the border.

324
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,750
I needed to go up to the mountains

325
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,010
and wait for him there.

326
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,680
I would shoot when he came.

327
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,790
At night,

328
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,150
I saw someone

329
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,810
come in a hurry.

330
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,770
He was the person in the photo.

331
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,040
Then I...

332
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Where's the body?

333
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,990
I...

334
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,910
Grew up in the mountains.

335
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,350
I've seen many situations

336
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,020
where wild beasts in the mountains

337
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,030
dig out

338
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,080
the graves

339
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,430
and eat the bodies.

340
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,950
So I made another plan

341
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,470
to secure this thing.

342
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,870
[Identification Room]

343
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,250
I’ll be right there.

344
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,070
-Chief Li.
-Chief Li.

345
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,100
Take someone to Sihe County

346
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,560
tomorrow morning at dawn.

347
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,200
Okay.

348
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,980
Okay.

349
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,160
Don't let Dongyu go.

350
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,940
Tell her it's my order.

351
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,040
Yes.

352
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,930
Why are you here like this?

353
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,490
It's too dangerous.

354
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,870
He confessed.

355
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,110
Did he do it?

356
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,640
Yes.

357
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,710
Where?

358
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,350
We'll go tomorrow morning at dawn.

359
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,750
I'll tell you the result.

360
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,590
Why?

361
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,990
For money.

362
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,880
Liu Qing ordered it.

363
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,460
Liu Qing knew there was an undercover

364
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,900
when he made that deal.

365
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,730
There is a possibility.

366
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,990
Liu Qing didn't plan

367
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,830
to make the deal from the beginning.

368
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,700
He wanted to completely reverse his image.

369
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,550
Instead of trading

370
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,280
with a foreigner he didn't know

371
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,910
and getting involved later,

372
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,520
he might as well kill the trading partner

373
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,580
and get some money.

374
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,590
He would kill that person when he got the money.

375
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,650
Then he would blow up the factory

376
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,180
and relevant people.

377
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,610
This is more straightforward.

378
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,790
We'll know when dawn comes.

379
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,550
Come here.

380
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,740
Watch carefully before you speak.

381
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,800
Where is he buried?

382
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,250
Over there.

383
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,470
Say it when we arrive.

384
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,990
Is it here?

385
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,080
Where is it?

386
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,470
Speak.

387
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,730
Under your feet.

388
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,450
Take him away.

389
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,720
Come.

390
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,670
Come here.

391
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,800
In this area.

392
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,980
Maintain the order.

393
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,990
Hurry.

394
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,310
Chief Li.

395
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,030
We found something here.

396
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,120
Chief Li.

397
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,700
The body was burnt.

398
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,650
Where is the gun?

399
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,680
Answer me.

400
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,660
Where is the gun?

401
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,520
Where is the gun?

402
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,590
I'm asking you.

403
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,720
The gun is in the pot on my roof.

404
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,730
Where is it?

405
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,670
In that pot.

406
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,440
Chief Li.

407
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,240
Chief Li.

408
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,960
The results of the gun appraisal are out.

409
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,550
Look.

410
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,990
The gun at Lijing Sauna

411
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,920
is the same gun

412
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,980
as six years ago.

413
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,070
Okay. Got it.

414
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,360
It's new.

415
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,230
Okay.

416
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,800
Has it been buried too long?

417
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,200
These are not

418
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,260
the main problems.

419
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,160
The key is that the remains

420
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,890
were burned more than once.

421
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,150
Besides, the fuels

422
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,750
were not ordinary gasoline.

423
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,600
So most of

424
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,860
the biological samples available for extraction

425
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,130
have been damaged.

426
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,960
We did more than ten extractions

427
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,160
from different parts.

428
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,650
Look.

429
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,760
There's not even

430
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,560
one complete genetic sequence.

431
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,970
Could it be that

432
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,710
we missed something?

433
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,850
No trace

434
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,000
can be missed.

435
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,310
We've checked

436
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,550
all the parts.

437
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,330
Then there's no other way?

438
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,210
Fortunately, there are some fragments.

439
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,270
It depends on them.

440
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,720
We have extracted

441
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,960
a small amount of

442
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,760
possibly undamaged dental pulp tissue

443
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,040
from the teeth.

444
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,270
But our conditions are limited.

445
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,920
You'd better send it to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Provincial Bureau.

446
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,380
Maybe there's still hope.

447
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,670
Fine.

448
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,440
That's not my dad.

449
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,210
What did you say?

450
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,640
I said

451
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,710
that's not my dad.

452
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,550
Sometimes you can't work so hard.

453
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,840
You have to think about running away first.

454
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,440
You lost your life.

455
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,640
Hu!

456
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,080
Hu!

457
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,580
Bro.

458
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,400
Bro.

459
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,870
How are you?

460
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,850
I'm fine. I've been recuperating for a few days.

461
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,380
I've been

462
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,440
calling you these days

463
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,040
but I couldn't get through.

464
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
I'm worried about you, you know?

465
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,820
I dare not turn it on.

466
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,270
I'm afraid the police will look for me.

467
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,530
It's still turned off.

468
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,430
Are you okay?

469
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,080
I got a few stitches.

470
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,890
Come and burn incense for Fa.

471
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,120
Fa.

472
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,770
Don't be a gangster in your next life.

473
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,110
Bro.

474
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,680
My condolences.

475
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,260
Is that person dead?

476
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,030
How would I know?

477
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,320
I beat him almost to death.

478
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,560
When the police came,

479
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,400
I ran away.

480
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,190
I think he was caught.

481
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,240
Bro.

482
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,590
Why did he try to kill you?

483
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,600
I don't know.

484
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,140
The one who killed the police six years ago

485
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,580
should be him.

486
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
Didn't you do it?

487
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,320
No.

488
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,400
I was bragging.

489
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,820
Haven't you seen him before?

490
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,030
No.

491
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,880
Bro.

492
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,310
Did you offend anyone?

493
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,560
You'd better think carefully

494
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,620
what if they cause you trouble again.

495
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,200
I offended many people.

496
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,770
How did you know I was there?

497
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,640
It was Fa.

498
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
He called me.

499
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,140
He said you didn't have enough manpower.

500
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,510
He was afraid you might be in danger.

501
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,320
So I went.

502
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,300
I didn't expect...

503
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,850
You're also my brother.

504
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,110
My life is yours.

505
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,360
I have to repay the two of you.

506
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,810
Fa is a good boy.

507
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,240
I...

508
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,880
That person is not him.

509
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,760
He's not my dad at all.

510
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,410
I know.

511
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,440
We've been investigating my dad's case

512
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,390
for six years.

513
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,060
We all desperately want a result.

514
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,760
But Gao Yang,

515
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,660
I’m sure

516
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,270
he is not my dad.

517
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,710
I know you can't accept it.

518
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,930
But...

519
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,150
I'm his daughter.

520
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,920
I can feel it.

521
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,930
That person must not be my dad.

522
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,340
Sister.

523
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,179
I know you've been suffering for the past six years.

524
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,110
Me and my master suffered the same.

525
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,199
But that's the truth.

526
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,560
This matter is over.

527
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,440
We have to move on.

528
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,989
We can go somewhere else.

529
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:20,830
Anywhere...

530
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,870
I can't leave.

531
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,480
I can't leave here.

532
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,170
For the past six years,

533
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I've checked the bodies repeatedly

534
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,880
and waited for the results again and again.

535
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,000
I can't live

536
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,949
this kind of life anymore, either.

537
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,989
I even hope

538
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,889
the person who appeared this time

539
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:49,980
is my dad.

540
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,850
Then the case can be closed.

541
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,719
But he is not.

542
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,920
Gao Yang.

543
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,120
As a police officer,

544
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,100
as his daughter,

545
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,950
I beg you to trust me.

546
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,400
Trust my judgment.

547
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,190
Okay?

548
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,020
You may leave.

549
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,700
Leave me alone.

550
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,870
[Criminal Investigation Department of Jiangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau]

551
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,490
Is this the fish you caught?

552
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,440
Are they tadpoles?

553
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,360
Put down the bucket.

554
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,360
Are you leaving or not?

555
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Put it down.

556
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,980
You threw away the fish I've been fishing for so long.

557
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,710
Give me back.

558
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,150
Get the bucket back.

559
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,800
Get it back!

560
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,660
Who will get it?

561
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,900
Give it to me.

562
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,300
Dad.

563
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,370
Where are you?

564
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,560
How about this?

565
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,820
Come into my dream tonight.

566
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,490
Tell me where you are

567
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,440
so that I can find you

568
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,890
and take you home.

569
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,720
Okay?
