00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,110
He's dead.

200
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,790
Who's dead?

201
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,000
Sanyong is dead.

202
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,440
Who shot him?

203
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,170
I don't know.

204
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,910
Sanyong was shot to death

205
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,310
under the police's nose.

206
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,810
Killing him under the police's nose?

207
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,690
That's pretty tough.

208
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,350
What... What do you mean?

209
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:37,870
Li.

210
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,070
The deceased's fingerprints and hair

211
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,200
are exactly the same

212
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,710
as the biological samples extracted

213
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,830
from the 327 kidnapping case.

214
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,270
Okay.

215
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,980
When the results come out,

216
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,710
I'll have someone pick them up.

217
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,470
Li.

218
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,800
Let me show you something.

219
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,980
The bullet lodged in the victim's skull.

220
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,100
That's why the bullet was

221
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,030
removed intact.

222
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,630
The standard bullet

223
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,110
is 7.62 mm.

224
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,070
But this one is 7.608 mm.

225
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,310
Both the materials and the craftsmanship

226
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,520
are from small workshops.

227
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,070
The size is exactly the same

228
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,950
as the bullet found in the case of Zheng’s disappearance

229
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,870
six years ago.

230
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,950
That gun appeared.

231
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,010
To determine whether the bullet

232
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,110
was fired from the same gun,

233
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,910
we need to send it to the Provincial Bureau for a ballistic analysis.

234
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,110
There may be some progress

235
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,100
in Zheng's case.

236
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,870

237
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,840
Everything will have to wait

239

[2005, Linjiang Public Security Bureau]

295
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,390
To catch Liu Qing,

296
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,350
the undercover was already in place.

297
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,350
According to the clues he provided,

298
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,610
Lu Sheng, a foreigner,

299
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,140
will enter the country soon

300
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,830
and make a deal with Liu Qing.

301
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,680
But just now, Lu Sheng

302
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,590
was arrested by Interpol

303
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,450
when he tried to enter the border.

304
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,120

to arrest Liu Qing

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
can't be carried out.

307
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,310
But I have a bold idea.

308
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,030
According to the information

309
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,630
provided by our undercover,

310
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,840
Lu Sheng and Liu Qing

311
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,610
don't know each other.

312
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,110
They suspect each other.

313
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,390
To protect themselves,

314
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,390
they don't know

Liu Qing doesn't know yet.

319
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,680
We can totally

320
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,560
do something

321
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,750
based on this information gap.

322
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,280
We can ask someone to pretend to be Lu Sheng

323
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,430
to trade with Liu Qing.

324
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,590
This is the best opportunity

325
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,720
to arrest Liu Qing.

326
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,230
It's too risky.

327
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,670
Even if we can use the information gap,

328
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,830
in such a short time,

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,630
Boss.

387
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,800
[Jin Ming]

388
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:57,950
All right.

389
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,030
Come on, Kai, stop.

390
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,630
Hurry and put it on for Mr. Lu.

391
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,990
Mr. Lu.

392
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,310
Mr. Lu.

393
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,270
Mr. Liu.

394
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,750
Don't call me Mr. Liu.

395
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,040
Call me Doctor Liu.

396
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,950
Okay, Doctor Liu.

397
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,630
Can I take your pulse?

398
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,160
Is there such a service?

399
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,670
We have many procedures.

400
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,130
Let's take our time.

401
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,790
Okay.

402
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,310
Come on.

403
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,820
The pulses of both hands need to be checked together

404
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,620
for accuracy.

405
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,470
You said you're Mr. Lu.

406
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,930
How can you prove that?

407
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,510
Right.

408
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,230
How can I prove

409
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,310
I am myself?

410
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,960
Hu.

411
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,590
They all say you have sharp eyes.

412
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,100
Today I want to see what you're capable of.

413
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,900
There are three banknotes here.

414
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,750
Only one is fake.

415
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,710
Help me find it.

416
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,650
Can I use my hand?

417
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,790
Which hand?

418
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,630
Whatever.

419
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,430
The first one

420
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,350
is the 1928 version.

421
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,890
The first-generation Federal Reserve Note

422
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,800
didn't use

423
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,070
12 English letters

424
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,320
to represent the Federal Reserve District.

425
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,040
Instead,

426
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,550
it uses 12 Arabic numerals.

427
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,670
This is known in our collecting world

428
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,730
as the digital version of the dollar.

429
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,550
The first one is genuine.

430
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,040
The second one

431
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,280
is the 1996 version.

432
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,380
It is commonly referred to as the "big head" version.

433
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,590
Both its front and back

434
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,820
feature very delicate lines.

435
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,190
Of course, this is also

436
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,870
the most common technology now.

437
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,670
The second one

438
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,430
is also genuine.

439
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,550
The third one.

440
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,590
The third one.

441
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,540
This third one...

442
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,990
Although the third one

443
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,440
has misprints, its 3D motion security

444
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,300
and the use of pearlescent ink

445
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,590
are both fine.

446
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,550
So the third one...

447
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,400
Is also genuine.

448
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,530
Your heart rate is steady.

449
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,670
Your vitality is strong.

450
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,710
And your pulse is stable.

451
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,650
You don't feel nervous at all.

452
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,710
Just your kidneys are a bit weak.

453
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,350
I'm embarrassed.

454
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,750
Hu.

455
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,950
Arrange the accommodation for Mr. Lu.

456
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,510
Treat him to a nice dinner tonight.

457
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,350
Thank you.

458
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,030
Doctor Liu,

459
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,990
when will we

460
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,870
start the deal?

461
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,550
Why are you in such a hurry?

462
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,550
Stay here for now.

463
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:32,950
Sure.

464
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,030
Mr. Lu.

465
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,890
A bowl of fried rice with beef.

466
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,530
Okay.

467
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,340
You asked me out so late.

468
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,330
There must be good news.

469
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,890
The victim is Qin Yong.

470
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,780
The test result shows

471
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,580
he kidnapped Chen Xueying.

472
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,850
At the entrance of Lijing Sauna,

473
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,790
I saw Lei Naiwu's man,

474
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,710
Chen Guangfa.

475
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,760
His appearance must not be a coincidence.

476
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,440
So kidnapping Chen Xueying

477
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,330
must have something to do with Lei Naiwu.

478
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,000
Thank you.

479
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,320
Who killed Qin Yong?

480
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,180
The culprit knew Qin Yong

481
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,470
was a suspect in the police's album.

482
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,870
He still took such a big risk

483
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,620
to kill him.

484
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,500
Why?

485
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:00,770
One more thing.

486
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,430
The bullet that killed Qin Yong

487
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,990
is the same

488
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,850
as that one found

489
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,350
at the scene of Zheng Ying's disappearance.

490
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,750
It has been sent to the Provincial Bureau

491
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,950
for testing.

492
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,000
That means

493
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,830
the owner of the gun we failed to find six years ago

494
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,530
has appeared again.

495
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,270
Does Dongyu know?

496
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,630
Yes.

497
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,390
Boss.

498
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,590
Bill, please.

499
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,710
The only breakthrough

500
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,230
is Lei Naiwu.

501
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,710
It's time to meet him.

502
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,200
He'll be here soon.

503
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,210
Master Wu.

504
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,460
Come, please.

505
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
Guys,

506
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,270
let me make introductions for you.

507
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,290
This is my big brother,

508
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,800
the legendary Master Wu.

509
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,710
Master Wu.

510
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,630
Master Wu.

511
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,430
Nice to meet you, Master Wu.

512
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,270
Have a seat.

513
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,750
Have a seat.

514
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,560
This is 20,000 yuan.

515
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,210
Master Wu, don’t think it’s too little.

516
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,050
All of us here

517
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,340
brought money with us.

518
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,510
Master Wu, look.

519
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,720
Good brother.

520
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,150
Fa, Fa, this is for Master Wu.

521
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,540
What are you searching for?

522
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,670
Can you find the money?

523
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,430
Bro, I have no money.

524
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,600
I don't care about this little money of yours.

525
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,770
How open-hearted!

526
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,890
Master Wu, you’re so open-hearted.

527
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,470
I have something to tell you.

528
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,110
Liu Qing.

529
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,430
Boss Liu.

530
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,840
Do you know him?

531
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,710
Yes.

532
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,330
I've heard of him.

533
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
The undercover who approached him,

534
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,870
the cop who was pretending to be

535
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,670
a Burmese,

536
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,120
was shot dead

537
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,750
with three shots

538
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,350
by Master Wu

539
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,990
without hesitation.

540
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,190
Impressive.

541
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,560
Today, Master Wu...

542
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,190
Forget about the past.

543
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,470
You are so low-profiled.

544
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,210
Do you know why Master Wu

545
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:30,870
came today?

546
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,080
He did it for my sake.

547
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,110
He also thought

548
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,060
about all of you.

549
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,270
He wants to lead us to work together

550
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,010
and create glory again.

551
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,170
Great! Great!

552
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,390
Come on.

553
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,220
Master Wu.

554
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,620
Do you remember me?

555
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,930
What are you doing, Bro?

556
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,460
Did you collude with the police

557
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,990
to betray Boss Liu?

558
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,040
Bullshit!

559
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,620
I had been loyal to Boss Liu.

560
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,860
I killed the undercover cop.

561
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,770
You did?

562
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,910
Yes.

563
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,110
And then?

564
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,540
What?

565
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,230
Where is he?

566
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:19,830
I buried him.

567
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,510
Where?

568
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,400
It was in the middle of nowhere,

569
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
how do I know the exact location?

570
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,860
Didn't the police notice you killed him?

571
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,790
Bro.

572
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,520
Can we not talk about this here?

573
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,070
It's okay.

574
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,200
He is my bro.

575
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,630
Let me introduce you.

576
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,630
Call him Hu.

577
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,830
Hu.

578
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,350
Hello, Hu.

579
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:57,810
Fa.

580
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,290
A bro is lying here.

581
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,980
Yes.

582
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:01,800
Hu.

583
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,990
Come on.

584
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,550
See?

585
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,670
Is he strong?

586
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,219
Yes.

587
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,960
This is my bro.

588
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,290
We've known each other

589
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,679
for about eight to nine years.

590
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,630
He's here to seek justice

591
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,440
for my boss.

592
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,780
He's so loyal.

593
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,070
Bro.

594
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,800
You must have suffered in these six years.

595
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,400
Who are you working for now?

596
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,989
I'm alone.

597
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,080
Come to me.

598
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,580
Look, I have so many men.

599
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,429
Fine.

600
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,270
Let's start a business together

601
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,250
in this city.

602
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,000
We will work together

603
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,810
to create more glory.

604
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,670
We will work together

605
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,750
to create more glory.

606
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,080
Come on.

607
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,500
Okay.

608
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,670
Come on.

609
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,840
Nonsense!

610
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,390
I'm loyal to Boss Liu.

611
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,770
I killed the undercover cop.

612
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,610
You did it?

613
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,710
Yes.

614
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,770
Where is he?

615
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,320
I buried him.

616
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,000
Where?

617
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,990
It was in the middle of nowhere.

618
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,990
How would I know the exact location?

619
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,350
Yang.

620
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,160
If you really don't want

621
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,200
to move in with us,

622
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,870
I

623
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,490
respect your opinion.

624
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,020
But there's a condition.

625
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,800
For weekends,

626
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,280
during festivals,

627
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,190
you must come and stay with us

628
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,840
because we are

629
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,910
family.

630
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,660
Hu.

631
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,350
We're back.

632
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,970
He just got a little drunk.

633
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,970
Don't worry.

634
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,690
Okay.

635
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,860
Bro.

636
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,550
Have some tea.

637
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,470
Bro.

638
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,600
Who's call?

639
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,270
It's not an outsider.

640
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,140
Hu asked if you were home.

641
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,390
Hu is so nice.

642
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,950
What you said

643
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,590
during dinner

644
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,510
touched me a lot.

645
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,110
You're so loyal.

646
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,920
Master Wu, have some water.

647
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,280
Don't trust him.

648
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:48,980
What?

649
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,650
Didn't you say you were brothers?

650
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,070
Fa.

651
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,630
As a gangster,

652
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,340
we can only speak part of the truth.

653
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,590
Don't expose all your thoughts.

654
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,750
He's too smart.

655
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,630
Even if you are more careful,

656
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,750
you can't beat him.

657
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,940
You know?

658
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,310
It's pretty.

659
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,430
I didn't know

660
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,310
you were so cruel.

661
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,810
I gave you the person you want.

662
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,430
When will you

663
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,550
give me what I want?

664
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,220
Where's the 500,000 yuan?

665
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,640
Do you think I'm a beggar?

666
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,630
Open the door.

667
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:30,950
Bro.

668
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,510
Thank you for

669
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,190
the start-up fund of 500,000.

670
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,110
I didn't mean anything else.

671
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,340
Do you know where I am now?

672
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,050
I'm at the place

673
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,270
where my boss started his business.

674
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,280
The Chinese medicine shop.

675
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,190
Liu Qing's lair?

676
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,310
Do you want to get rid of me

677
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,670
for 500,000?

678
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,790
Let me tell you.

679
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,910
The condition is the same.

680
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,510
I want the same amount

681
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,530
I told you before.

682
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Here's a phrase for you to remember.

683
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,280
The King of Hell is easy to meet,

684
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,040
but the little ghosts are troublesome.

685
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,480
Don't think you'll be safe

686
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,420
since the King of Hell is dead.

687
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,620
I'm the little ghost.

688
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,650
I'm clinging to you!

689
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,000
You...

690
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,190
Dad.

691
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,020
If the leaves on the tree

692
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,460
get bitten by bugs,

693
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,590
spraying some pesticide

694
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,710
might solve the problem.

695
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,150
But if the root is rotten,

696
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,950
we have to pull it out.

697
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,640
If Lei Naiwu doesn't die,

698
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,910
our whole family will die.
