00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,190
who

386
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,310
ordered me to teach her a lesson,

387
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,110
and who

388
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,470
I was listening to.

389
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,270
Are you threatening me?

390
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,400
You don't care about your wife and son?

391
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,670
Master Wu.

392
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,290
When I respect you,

393
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,240
I'll call you Master Wu.

394
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,760
If I don't respect you,

395
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,110
you're just a fart.

396
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,510
You're threatening me with a countryside woman

397
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,310
and a child?

398
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,440
Listen to me, you fart.

399
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,430
I want 200,000 now.

400
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,510
Not a penny less.

401
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,250
I'll leave when I see the money.

402
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,320
If I don't see the money,

403
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,310
I can accompany you back to prison

404
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,930
for another couple of years.

405
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,630
Okay.

406
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,550
I'll give you 200,000.

407
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,830
It's a deal.

408
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,670
After I give you the money,

409
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,310
you leave Linjiang,

410
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,980
alright?

411
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,150
Bro.

412
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,510
Have some noodles.

413
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,630
Bro, have some noodles.

414
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,270
Where can we get 200,000

415
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:07,960
for him?

416
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,930
I'll burn it to him.

417
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,720
[Minghua Group]

418
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,470
What happened to your leg?

419
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,520
Are you injured?

420
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,350
I'm fine.

421
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,470
I found Zhao Long,

422
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,230
a former member of the Guangdong gang.

423
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,830
He said Qin Yong

424
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,190
has been hiding in a place called

425
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,890
Lengshui Village in Mount Xiaocang.

426
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,950
He has a child

427
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,160
about seven or eight years old.

428
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,750
It's close to where Zheng was murdered.

429
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,350
Right.

430
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,050
On the day Zheng went missing,

431
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,360
Lei Naiwu didn't have enough time.

432
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,380
But if there was someone

433
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,290
hiding nearby,

434
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,300
Lei Naiwu would handle the killing

435
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,190
while that person would handle the body.

436
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,550
And he was not one of Liu Qing's men.

437
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,330
So, he wouldn't have been discovered

438
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,070
during the interrogation and investigation.

439
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,930
By the way,

440
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,870
Zhao Long also said

441
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,660
Qin Yong used to work for Lei Naiwu.

442
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,270
The day after Lei Naiwu

443
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,730
was released from prison,

444
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,680
Chen Xueying was kidnapped

445
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,060
Is there a connection?

446
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,870
If it was Lei Naiwu,

447
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,420
why would he do this?

448
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,600
After Lei Naiwu was released,

449
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,400
we've been keeping an eye on him.

450
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,950
Lei Naiwu was seen

451
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,520
near the Minghua Building.

452
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,910
Maybe he

453
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,870
was after Chen Jingming.

454
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,450
I have to go to Chen Jingming's house.

455
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,070
Then I'll

456
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,400
go ask Xueying.

457
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,200
Her condition should be stable.

458
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,600
Go ahead, but be careful.

459
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,460
Bro.

460
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,120
Don't stand there. Sit.

461
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,230
How is Xueying?

462
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,950
She has had

463
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,280
health problems since childhood.

464
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,620
After such a shock,

465
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,870
her condition worsened.

466
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,080
Even if you didn't come to me today,

467
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,670
I would've come to ask you.

468
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,630
When can you catch

469
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,360
that beast?

470
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,590
Don't worry.

471
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,080
We'll catch him soon.

472
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,470
Do you have any leads?

473
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,240
I can't tell you.

474
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,550
I just don’t understand.

475
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,440
You know Xueying

476
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,910
has been innocent since childhood,

477
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,100
and hardly knows anyone outside,

478
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,250
how could she provoke someone?

479
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,020
Although I'm a businessman,

480
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,200
I've always been kind to people

481
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,790
and done business in harmony.

482
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,120
I've never had any conflicts with anyone.

483
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,880
Thinking of Xueying's situation,

484
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,650
it's really baffling.

485
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,150
Did you ever deal with Liu Qing

486
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,190
back then?

487
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,750
Liu Qing?

488
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,760
Is Liu Qing the one from Guanghua Real Estate?

489
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,150
No.

490
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,270
He was the leader

491
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,650
of the counterfeit money gang

492
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,300
six years ago.

493
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:22,990
Liu Qing.

494
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,110
I heard about that.

495
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,350
It was very shocking back then.

496
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,470
It was in the newspaper.

497
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,270
They also said

498
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,470
the leader was shot dead on the spot.

499
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,370
How could I possibly know him?

500
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,830
Do you know Lei Naiwu?

501
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,750
Who?

502
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,110
Lei Naiwu.

503
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,750
You mean he did it?

504
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,410
Bro.

505
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,160
You keep saying this nonsense.

506
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,590
You are Xueying's uncle

507
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,990
and an experienced policeman.

508
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,940
You've solved so many cases.

509
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,350
Why can't you catch the culprit

510
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,550
in this child's case?

511
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,310
Calm down.

512
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,510
I...

513
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,990
Give me more time.

514
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,640
Xueying.

515
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,310
Did you know that bastard?

516
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,190
No.

517
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,480
I didn't know him.

518
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,310
He didn't know me either.

519
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,130
He didn't know you either?

520
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,430
When I told him my dad was Chen Jingming,

521
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,570
he stopped hitting me.

522
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,510
He looked surprised.

523
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,140
Then I said I would give him money.

524
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,580
I begged him to let me go.

525
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,640
He didn't agree.

526
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,270
He came and tore my clothes.

527
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,550
I was so scared.

528
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,470
He hugged me from behind.

529
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,830
I couldn't move.

530
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,650
I had no strength.

531
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,350
I don't know

532
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,000
why I had no strength.

533
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,650
I didn't want him to touch me.

534
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,150
I didn't want him to touch me.

535
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,080
His smell,

536
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,840
his sweat,

537
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,950
everything about him...

538
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,400
-Scared me.
-Xueying.

539
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,310
I didn’t want him to touch me.

540
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:13,840
Xueying.

541
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,680
I didn’t want him to touch me.

542
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,730
I didn’t want him to touch me.

543
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,450
It's okay.

544
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,150
I'm here.

545
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:22,930
I'm here.

546
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,870
I'm here.

547
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,110
It's okay.

548
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,000
It's all in the past.

549
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,630
Well.

550
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,950
Here's the thing.

551
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,680
I know you and my sister

552
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,360
were getting close recently.

553
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,550
As her brother,

554
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,580
I don't really want to interfere

555
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,670
with her private life.

556
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,150
But her condition

557
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,950
is indeed unstable.

558
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,150
And I'm afraid her simple personality might cause her

559
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,950
sufferings from another shock.

560
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,740
Don't misunderstand.

561
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,920
Xueying and I are just friends.

562
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,450
When a friend has a problem,

563
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,890
I will definitely help.

564
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,600
I understand.

565
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,430
I hope you can understand me too.

566
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,170
After all, she's

567
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,080
my only sister.

568
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,910
I understand.

569
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,270
I'm leaving.

570
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,900
Call me if you need anything.

571
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,710
Thank you.

572
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,570
The kidnapper didn't know Chen Xueying.

573
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,139
The motive is unknown.

574
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,060
Bro,

575
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,139
we need to talk.

576
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,190
I have nothing to talk to you.

577
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,210
I know I was wrong.

578
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,400
I apologize to you first.

579
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,270
How about I hand over the person

580
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,750
who kidnapped your daughter

581
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,010
to you for punishment?

582
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,290
Is that okay?

583
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,450
Can I trust you on that?

584
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,680
You have to trust me.

585
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,350
Because we are brothers.

586
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,670
We share the same fate.

587
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,500
Well,

588
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,350
don't you think you should show some sincerity?

589
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,360
Because I...

590
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,370
I have no money

591
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,350
after getting out of prison.

592
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,550
Can you give me

593
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,030
some money to spend first?

594
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,260
When I see the person, you'll get the money.

595
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,790
That's very thoughtful.

596
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,630
So loyal.

597
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,430
That's what brothers do, right?

598
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,110
Bro.

599
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,640
Did you get the money?

600
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Where can I get it?

601
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,160
There are only a few hours left.

602
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,950
If we can't come up with 200,000,

603
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,990
he'll really go to the police

604
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,790
and rat us out.

605
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,820
Alright, then you go and get it done.

606
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,610
Well.

607
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,490
Bro.

608
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,280
I have no money,

609
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,410
and you want me to go?

610
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,710
You don't have to bring money.

611
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,750
Just go there

612
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,880
and keep an eye on it.

613
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,410
Just come back

614
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,110
and tell me

615
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,210
everything you see.

616
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:32,810
Go ahead.
