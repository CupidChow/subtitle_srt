The hit-and-run driver is Zhou Jian.

He caused the car accident back then

39
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,760
killing Huang Bingde's family.

40
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,550
What's worse

41
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,490
is that if Huang Bingde's wife

42
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,820
was sent to the hospital

43
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,620
and treated in time,

44
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,050
she could've been saved.

45
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,950
They only needed 50,000 yuan more.

46
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,630
Zhou Jian was rich.

47
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,230
The traffic police also said

48
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,690
he should pay the medical fees,

49
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,659
but he refused.

50
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,640
He even said

51
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,200
he wouldn't pay much if he killed someone.

52
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:59,270
It'd only be an endless cost if they survived.

53
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,410
Who wouldn't want to beat him up after hearing that?

54
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,490
So I guess

55
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,250
Huang Bingde must have gotten the idea

56
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,880
to kill him at this time.

57
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,040
Please forgive me, sir.

58
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,790

I've avenged you,

66
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,950
but I can never see you again.

67
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,710
Then why did

68
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,370
Huang Bingde say it was Zheng?

69
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,830
Most importantly,

70
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
how did he know Zheng?

71
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,430
When interrogating him,

72
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,200
he could even

73
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,730
describe the whole process

74
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,910
of killing Zheng in detail.

75
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,720
So,

76
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,950
he's taking the blame for someone.

77
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,960
I couldn't find anything else.

78
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,290
This pack of noodles is all there is here.

79
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,790
Add the seasoning yourself.

80
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,390
The noodles should have been around for a few years.

81
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,520
Just make do with it.

82
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,150
Cold water?

83
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,960
It's been a long time since anyone has lived here.

84
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,490
I couldn't turn on the fire.

85
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,790
Just make do with it.

86
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,480
Actually, I'm not that hungry.

87
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,780
I'll eat on my way home.

88
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,800
I checked Huang Bingde

89
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,290
and the people around him.

90
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,510
There are no financial problems.

91
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,550
If he didn't do it for money,

92
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,200
why would he take the blame?

93
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,870
Actually, I never thought

94
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,040
he did it for money.

95
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
His parents have passed away

96
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,070
and he has no friends.

97
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,470
Besides,

98
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,190
he can be executed for this.

99
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,390
Even if he made money,

100
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,510
he wouldn't have the chance to spend it.

101
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,910
Did he want to send it to his wife and kid in the afterlife?

102
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,220
Huang Bingde spent more than 300,000 yuan

103
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,310
to save his wife,

104
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,120
but his wife

105
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,050
died on the spot.

106
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,240
What did he spend

107
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,070
such a big sum of money on?

108
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,080
His baby

109
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,140
was probably born.

110
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:20,870
Hello?

111
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,830
Gao Yang,

112
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,590
I'm at the Provincial People's Hospital.

113
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,830
Huang Bingde's wife

114
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,160
was sent to the hospital back then

115
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,220
and died very soon.

116
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,320
She underwent

117
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,680
an emergency C-section

118
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,550
and this baby

119
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,140
survived in the end.

120
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,870
However, she had hypoxia from being premature

121
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,310
and needed to be put in the incubator.

122
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,370
Twenty days later,

123
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,840
the infant recovered.

124
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,600
So the 300,000 yuan

125
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,940
was probably spent here.

126
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,830
By the way,

127
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,960
a couple came with Huang Bingde

128
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,550
to complete the discharge paperwork

129
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,950
and took this child away.

130
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,620
After that, they completed the official adoption paperwork

131
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,210
through the orphanage.

132
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,800

137
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,510

to adopt Huang Bingde's daughter.

143

Chen Jingming gave Huang Bingde's daughter

146

It's such a big favor.

147
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,870
Is it possible that Huang Bingde

148
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,270
was willing to sacrifice himself for this?

149
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,920
But I have a question.

150
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,050
Why did Chen Jingming kill Zheng?

151
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,890

153

know about this yet.

154
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,080
I'm afraid she won't be able to take it.

155

I don't think you can either.

156

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,110
If it really is him,

159
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,610
I must be the one to do it.

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,830
was the man who killed your wife.

165

Let me tell you more.

When your wife passed away in the car accident,

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,670
you tried to gather money

to save her to no avail.

170
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,730
Then Chen Jingming showed up.

He gave you 300,000 yuan

172

to Chen Jingming's classmate to be adopted,

177
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,370
because at that time,

178
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,700

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,560
take the blame

192
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,890
for killing Zheng Ying.

193
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,920
You thought it all through.

194
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,350
It was perfect.

195
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,670
But you didn't expect

196
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,400
that we could do a DNA test

197
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,680
on a burnt corpse.

198
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,750
Huang Bingde,

199
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,410
you've been making up stories

200
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,640
since you came in here.

201
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
Keep going!

202
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,390
Officer Li,

203
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,080
I don't know

204
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,610
what you're talking about.

205
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,270
I

206
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,320
killed the man.

207
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,850
Huang Bingde won't say anything.

208
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,040
Seems like he'll hold up until the end.

209
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,030
Who's up there?

210
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,150
Hu?

211
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,160
Hu!

212
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,750
Boss.

213
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,870
Come up.

214
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,070
Boss,

215
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,550
what's wrong?

216
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,310
Hu,

217
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,240
what's more important?

218
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Taking big steps or being brave?

219
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,069
Pour me a cup of tea.

220
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
If you succeed,

221
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,160
you can

222
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,819
retire and enjoy

223
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,440
the rest of your life.

224
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,810
If you fail,

225
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,630
you might even

226
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,470
lose your life.

227
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,270
If it were you,

228
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,310
would you do it or not?

229
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,400
Boss,

230
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,300
you have good luck.

231
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,940
Whether we do it or not,

232
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,010
it's up to you.

233
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,830
Brat.

234
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,000
My daughter is back.

235
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,870
Dad.

236
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:10,660
Great.

237
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,480
Look.

238
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,050
You scared me this time.

239
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,240
Xueying,

240
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,990
are you home tomorrow?

241
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,400
Gao Hu.

242
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,400
Xueying.

243
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,610
Why did you come to visit me suddenly?

244
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,310
Why don't you come in and sit for a while?

245
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,000
No need.

246
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,680
I have an appointment with some bosses.

247
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,070
Are you alone at home?

248
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,070
Xueying,

249
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,010
the bosses I'm meeting

250
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,340
all smoke cigars.

251
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,030
I saw your dad was smoking

252
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,210
a good cigar that day.

253
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,450
Can you get me some?

254
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,290
If you do this, I'll be more respectable

255
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,350
when I talk to them.

256
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,650
No problem. My dad's cigars

257
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,430
are one of it's kind in Linjiang.

258
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,070
Really?

259
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,280
They're custom-made.

260
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,670
You'll definitely look good if you bring them out.

261
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,530
That'll be great.

262
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,490
I'll get it for you.

263
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,170
Thank you.

264
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,290
So,

265
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,580
Chen Jingming lied.

266
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,030
You mean Chen Jingming and Liu Qing

267
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:40,890
are in cahoots?

268
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,240
In that case,

269
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,520
everything

270
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
can be explained.

271
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,350
Consider this.

272
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,440
The illegal profits

273
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
that Liu Qing made by

274
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,550
creating and selling counterfeit notes

275
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,440
was laundered

276
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,060
by Chen Jingming's company.

277
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,000
After Liu Qing died,

278
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,080
Chen Jingming

279
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,360
transferred all his assets

280
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,680
privately to his own name.

281
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,200
He became

282
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,470
the richest man in Linjiang overnight.

283
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,140
At that time, Lei Naiwu

284
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,810
discovered Chen Jingming's actions.

285
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,030
That's right.

286
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,670
Lei Naiwu was thinking

287
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,600
that he could find Chen Jingming

288
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,850
after being released

289
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,680
and get back what belonged to him.

290
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,810
But with the Minghua Group's

291
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,890
current power,

292
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,080
Chen Jingming

293
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,430
didn't give Lei Naiwu the time of day,

294
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,790
so Lei Naiwu got desperate

295
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,840
and had someone kidnap Chen Xueying.

296
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,550
Lei Naiwu

297
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,000
didn't want to

298
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,260
completely offend Chen Jingming.

299
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,250
He just wanted to threaten him

300
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,660
and force Chen Jingming

301
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,480
to negotiate a good price with him,

302
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,000
but something went wrong.

303
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,280
We saved Xueying.

304
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
Now, this matter

305
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,820
has gotten

306
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,110
out of Lei Naiwu's control.

307
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,750
According to a gangster

308
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,800
arrested at the scene

309
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,260
the day Qin Yong was killed,

310
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,110
Qin Yong

311
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,120
was going to collect

312
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,600
200,000 yuan in cash that day.

313
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
So, I hypothesize

314
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,550
that Qin Yong

315
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,090
threatened Lei Naiwu.

316
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,900
Based on my observation of Lei Naiwu,

317
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,990
there was no way

318
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,080
he could afford all that at the time,

319
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,440
so he leaked Qin Yong's information

320
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,720
to Chen Jingming.

321
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,090
He had Chen Jingming do the dirty work.

322
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,290
Huang Bingde worked for Chen Jingming.

323
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,180
Huang Bingde killed Qin Yong

324
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,290
to avenge Chen Jingming's daughter.

325
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,160
Then why did Huang Bingde

326
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,150
kill Lei Naiwu?

327
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,020
One reason was that Lei Naiwu

328
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,480
had his eyes on his assets.

329
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,070
But the more important reason

330
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,550
was that Lei Naiwu

331
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,350
had something on Chen Jingming.

332
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,760
This means

333
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,900
Huang Bingde admitted to killing Zheng Ying

334
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,390
because...

335
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,860
There's only one possibility.

336
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,240
Zheng's murderer

337
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
was Chen Jingming.

338
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,210
Lei Naiwu was the witness.

339
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:59,000
[Six years ago, day of counterfeit notes transaction]

340
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,600
Fifteen days.

341
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,400
You locked me up for 15 days.

342
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,830
Good things are worth waiting for.

343
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,110
After today,

344
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,680
you will definitely

345
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,070
make a lot of money.

346
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,110
The money doesn't matter.

347
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,870
Just let me

348
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,280
leave you bastards.

349
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,910
You watch over me every day.

350
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,600
We gotta take good care of you.

351
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,120
If we can't keep working

352
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,430
in the future,

353
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,120
you gotta take care of us.

354
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,960
Excuse me,

355
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,390
the phone.

356
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,150
In my pocket.

357
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,830
Bro.

358
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,670
I need to trouble you again.

359
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,810
It's the same ol' rules.

360
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Hurry up.

361
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,960
Put it on.

362
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,810
This way, I can sleep on the way.

363
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,630
Boss, we're almost there.

364
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,510
Got it.

365
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,390
Kai,

366
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,160
when we get there,

367
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,690
get some game meat.

368
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,510
We'll celebrate tonight.

369
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:28,710
Come on.

370
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,020
Let me go in with you.

371
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,520
Do as I say.

372
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,360
Cut the crap.

373
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,580
Okay.

374
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,830
Boss.

375
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,760
Mr. Lu,

376
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,040
you look well

377
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,190
after these days of rest.

378
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,640
I just ate and slept

379
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,540
every day.

380
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,550
If I still don't look well,

381
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,880
I'd let you down, right?

382
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,360
After today,

383
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,480
you can go home.

384
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,560
Okay.

385
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,310
Mr. Lu,

386
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,920
you've seen the mechanic

387
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,160
and technical experts.

388
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,640
The paper craftsmanship

389
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,980
and ink technology

390
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,960
are all top-notch here.

391
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,480
The handover can be anytime

392
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,740
once the money is paid.

393
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,910
No deception.

394
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,820
Pay up.

395
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,590
Okay,

396
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,710
boss.

397
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,870
It'll be there in 10 minutes.

398
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,390
The money will arrive in 10 minutes.

399
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,120
Mr. Liu,

400
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,310
I'm sorry.

401
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,010
Where is the bathroom?

402
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,320
You only had a few cups of tea

403
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,640
and you need the bathroom?

404
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,080
Our place is shabby.

405
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,180
We only have piss buckets.

406
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,900
Do you mind?

407
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,270
No.

408
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,270
Hu,

409
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,030
take Mr. Lu there.

410
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,570
He ran away!

411
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,680
Naiwu!

412
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,670
Naiwu!

413
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,830
He's a cop.

414
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,300
Take some men to stop him in the back.

415
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:05,910
Hurry!

416
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,590
Hurry up.

417
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,170
Follow.

418
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,680
Hurry up.

419
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,580
Hurry up.

420
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,630
Hurry up and follow.

421
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,880
Keep up.

422
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,640
Hurry!

423
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,200
Don't move.

424
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,950
Take him away.

425
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,680
Yes.

426
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,230
Go.

427
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Behave yourself.

428
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,160
Don't move.

429
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,050
Get down!

430
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,970
Behave.

431
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,390
Don't move!

432
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,910
Put down your gun.

433
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,480
Hands up.

434
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,570
Up!

435
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,010
If you cooperate with me,

436
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,370
your life can be spared.

437
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,740
Li Dengyuan,

438
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,190
I don't trust you.

439
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,100
I only trust that the explosives

440
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,230
buried in my factory

441
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,270
are enough to blast your men

442
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,820
to heaven.

443
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,430
You can't escape.

444
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,420
I don't want to.

445
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,910
Having your men accompanying me,

446
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,660
those dozens of lives,

447
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,480
it's worth it for me.

448
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,200
Do you want take a gamble?

449
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,030
Put down the gun.

450
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,590
Good job, Hu.

451
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,300
Boss, you go first.

452
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,830
Li Dengyuan,

453
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,660
let's settle this today.

454
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,300
Before you die,

455
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,440
I'll treat you to a firework show.

456
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,880
Get up.

457
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,000
Go.

458
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,350
Who is it?

459
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,530
Don't move.

460
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,800
Boss.

461
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,870
Boss.

462
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,670
I...

463
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,780
No, I...

464
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,540
Boss.

465
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,940
Let's get this done.

466
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,920
What's wrong?

467
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,710
Don't come near me!

468
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,810
-Go away!
-Are you okay?

469
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,850
Don't touch me.

470
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,260
Please go!

471
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,320
Please!

472
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,310
Xueying.

473
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,150
Don't.

474
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,410
Don't.

475
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,110
Gao Hu.

476
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,000
I know my sister

477
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
really likes you,

478
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,000
but I can also see

479
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:56,840
that you don't

480
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,770
have any special feelings for her.

481
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,240
Don't worry.

482
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,700
After Xueying gets better

483
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,130
I will take her abroad immediately.

484
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,210
She won't bother you anymore.

485
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,909
How about

486
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,639
you go in and talk to her?

487
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,989
I'll buy you two some food.

488
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:34,840
Gao Hu.

489
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,760
Did my brother go to you again?

490
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,810
Your brother is worried about you.

491
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,150
Are you okay?

492
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm fine.

493
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,679
Today,

494
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,460
I just wanted to be braver.

495
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,340
I wanted to go back to a normal life sooner.

496
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,400
Then I won't need to bother you

497
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,660
and everyone anymore.

498
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,310
I know you like

499
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,520
brave and strong girls,

500
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,120
so today,

501
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,220
I went alone today.

502
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,440
But I didn't expect

503
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,640
the moment

504
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,970
my dance partner hugged me from behind...

505
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,200
Just that moment,

506
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,760
his breath and sweat

507
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,230
suddenly swarmed over from all directions.

508
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,310
There was no way for me

509
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,040
to not think about that person.

510
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,760
I couldn't do it.

511
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,760
Actually, I have an older sister

512
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,840
who is very brave.

513
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,560
She's been my role model since childhood.

514
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,710
I really want

515
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,790
to be like her.

516
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,230
I remember when I was young,

517
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,160
people walked to and fro

518
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,010
at my mother's funeral.

519
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,560
They were all busy.

520
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,850
My brother and I hid in the corner.

521
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,850
Dongyu found us

522
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,890
and held our little hands.

523
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,430
She said,

524
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,430
"Don't be afraid.

525
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,590
I'm here."

526
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,930
At that moment, I felt

527
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,380
that she was a beam of light

528
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,500
wherever she went.

529
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,640
She was bright

530
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,120
and warm.

531
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,080
I want to be that kind of girl.

532
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,990
Although I failed this time,

533
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,380
I will work hard.

534
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,430
Xueying,

535
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,910
you have to believe

536
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,870
that everyone standing behind you

537
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,150
loves you

538
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,180
and will support and protect you.

539
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,120
But

540
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,550
you have to overcome

541
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,180
the hardest obstacle by yourself.

542
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,430
Trust yourself.

543
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,710
Gao Hu,

544
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,110
can you hug me?

545
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,880
One last time.

546
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,540
The kind of hug between a brother and sister.

547
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,320
You can do it.

548
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,190
You should know

549
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,470
how Xueying and I met.

550
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,150
It was after that time.

551
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,970
She often comes to visit me.

552
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,410
Maybe it's because we had

553
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,740
similar childhoods.

554
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,840
I can understand her pain

555
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,750
and despair.

556
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,430
Also,

557
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,700
during the past six years,

558
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,120
Master gave me

559
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,200
a new mission.

560
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,320
I couldn't contact you.

561
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,140
I couldn't casually contact Master either.

562
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:08,960
One day,

563
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,630
I couldn't stand it anymore,

564
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,920
so I called Xueying.

565
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,680
Actually, I just wanted to

566
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,760
subtly ask her

567
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
about you.

568
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,470
However,

569
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,960
I couldn't ask too much.

570
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,480
Luckily, Xueying likes you

571
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,690
and keeps mentioning you,

572
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,670
so every time she calls,

573
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,270
I pick up.

574
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,900
I pick up as soon as she calls,

575
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,350
but Xueying knows

576
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,830
that I have someone I love.

577
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,450
Why are you so nervous?

578
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,540
I didn't ask anything.

579
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,590
It'd be too late if you asked.

580
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,320
Fine.

581
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,880
If I explain one more thing,

582
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,720
it'll make you seem petty.

583
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,760
If I ask one more question,

584
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,690
it'll make you seem like you have bad intentions.

585
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,220
What intentions can I have?

586
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,750
Forget it.

587
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,440
It's great.

588
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,600
How many years

589
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,140
has it been since we've been

590
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,210
alone like this?

591
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,820
♫Can't bear to miss you too much♫

592
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,380
♫I'm afraid the memory will fade♫

593
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,010
♫In my dream, you're by my side♫

594
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,680
When I first went to work under Liu Qing,

595
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,580
♫If I reach out, I can touch your face♫

596
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,010
I reminded myself every day

597
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,000
♫After so many years♫

598
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,220
that my name was Gao Hu.

599
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,620
I was a gangster.

600
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,520
♫Loneliness is more obvious♫

601
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,920
There wasn't a day where I slept well.

602
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,530
I was afraid that if I fell asleep completely,

603
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,510
♫The you from before seems to be by my side♫

604
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:55,670
I'd expose myself.

605
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
At that time,

606
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,500
♫I returned to the yesterday♫

607
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,770
I really missed

608
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,440
the time

609
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,600
when we were carefree.

610
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,520
♫I want to stay by your side, no matter how many years♫

611
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,880
♫Freely and safely let time flow♫

612
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,410
♫Experience the hardships and sweetness together with you♫

613
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,610
Right now, this moment,

614
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,950
is the most relaxed I've been

615
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,660
♫Forge on even without a poetic future♫

616
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,920
in all these years.

617
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:26,270
♫I want to keep your footsteps and soften your time♫

618
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,430
♫Let the world spin with strength and persistence♫

619
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,650
♫Looking for the hardships and sweetness with you♫

620
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:40,710
♫Even without a poetic future, it's still a place with love♫

621
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,080
The organization chose the right person.

622
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,480
You have high awareness.

623
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,380
Thank you, Deputy Chief Zheng.

624
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,870
♫Can't bear to miss you too much♫

625
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,730
♫I'm afraid the memory will fade♫

00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,240
♫In my dream, you're by my side♫

627
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,810
You'll only

628
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,700
compliment me?

629
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,830
♫If I reach out, I can touch your face♫

630
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,270
I didn't have time to prepare.

631
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,540
♫After so many years♫

632
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,060
♫Loneliness is more obvious♫

633
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,480
Gao Yang.

634
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,050
♫The you from before seems to be by my side♫

635
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,730
Say...

636
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,040
♫I returned to the yesterday♫

637
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,000
It should be daybreak soon, right?

638
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,060
♫I want to stay by your side, no matter how many years♫

639

♫Freely and safely let time flow♫

640
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,320
Should be.

641

♫Experience the hardships and sweetness together with you♫

642
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,200
♫Even without a poetic future, it's still a place with love♫

643
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,210
Twenty-five years ago today,

644
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,880
the three of us became sworn brothers.

645
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,930
We don't wish to be born on the same day,

646
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,490
but to die on the same day.

647
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,560
Here. I suggest

648
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,590
we have a drink for our brotherhood.

649
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,720
Today is the 25th anniversary

650
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,100
of our friendship.

651
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,260
We must have a drink.

652
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,350
Come.

653
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,360
Wait.

654
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,700
Today is also the anniversary of Gao Jialing's death.

655
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,900
I understand.

656
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,050
I don't know

657
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,300
who you are talking about,

658
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,160
but I also know

659
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,580
the deceased must be honored.

660
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,280
