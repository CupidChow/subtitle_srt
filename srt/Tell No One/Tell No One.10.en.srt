What were you going to say?

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,680
I plan to retire from the front line

5
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,430
and transfer to logistics.

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,630
I've made the report.

7
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,560
It should be approved in a few days.

That's it?

00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,760
What do you mean?

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,230

He won't be in danger on the front line anymore.

Don't you understand?

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,190
Our sister-in-law is sick. She has been diagnosed already.

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,320
Dongyu is young too.

21

Are you afraid?

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,730
Since you're in this field,

28
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,230
you'll face danger.

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,810
I'm not afraid.

30
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,640
This was what you told me back then.

Zheng, I think

38
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,870
you made the right choice.

39
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,350
Really.

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,789

You look so spirited.

Yes.

Not bad. We're peers.

Are you worried?

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,010
Actually, I'm worried too.

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800

They said there is

an abandoned hotel in their district.

With us here,

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,280
Coerce?

No one coerced me.

125
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,960
Then why are you here?

126

Did someone imprison you?

I got drunk one night,

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,200
so I came

133
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,440
I was drunk.

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,440
I fell down by accident.

No one is stopping me, right?

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,360
We still hope

144
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,840
you can think it through.

145
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,300
If you don't say anything,

146
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,760
we can't help you with anything.

147
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
Thank you, officer.

You didn't reply to texts either.

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,720
I was in a bad mood.

156
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,260
I don't want to talk about it right now.

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,890
You're back?

159
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,720
Chief Li.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,960
Guan Dayong wasn't there?

161
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,840
He was,

162
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,000
but he wouldn't say anything.

163
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,770
Gao Yang was also there.

164
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,360
What was he doing there?

165
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,400
I think

166
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
Lei Naiwu told him to go

167
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,920
and free Guan Dayong.

168
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,010
How can Lei Naiwu

169
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,960
be so kind?

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,730
I wonder

171
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,520
what exactly

172
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,380
he is up to.

173
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,860
I’ve asked Zuo Minghao

174
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,460
to keep an eye on Guan Dayong.

175
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,120
Times like these,

176
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,650
we can’t let our guard down.

177
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
What did Gao Yang say?

178
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,400
He said...

179
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,320
Well, his words felt off.

180
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,030

That's right.

193
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,710
I want them to follow.

194
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,340
Okay, keep following.

195
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,000
Come up.

196
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,210
Jiadong,

197
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,040
I didn't say anything

198
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,160
to Lei Naiwu.

199
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,730
Don't worry.

200
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,970
Uncle Guan,

201
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,360
you...

202
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,520
You've been in our family for so many years.

203
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,880
Actually,

204
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,840
what you said

205
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,370
and how you said it

206
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,050
really isn't important

207
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,620
to me anymore.

208
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,740
By the way, Uncle Guan,

209
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,360
how long have you been in our family for?

210
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
Eleven years, three months and seven days.

211
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,740
It's been 11 years.

212
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,480
Then

213
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,890
how did my dad

214
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,450
treat you before he left?

215
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
We were like brothers

216
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,290
What about Xueying?

217
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,880
I treat her

218
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,120
like she is

219
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,640
my own daughter.

220
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,600
What about me?

221
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,560
It's even more so for you.

222
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,180
All the things between us

223
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,000
are in my heart.

224
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,560
Well...

225
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,920
We really are a family.

226
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,880
A family without blood ties.

227
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,810
Uncle Guan,

228
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,320
come here.

229
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,340
Look at this.

230
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,060
This was sent by the company account

231
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,470
to your personal account, right?

232
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,010
Chen Jingming wasn't on the mountain that day.

233
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,820
He was injured and couldn't go out.

234
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,300
Guan Dayong can testify.

235
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,010
That's why Lei Naiwu

236
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,040
kidnapped Guan Dayong.

237
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,370
If it wasn't Chen Jingming

238
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,820
on the mountain that day...

239
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,410
I'll help you

240
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,810
finish Lei Naiwu's case.

241
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,290
After that,

242
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,980
that's it for us.

243
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,970
What is this?

244
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,410
I found it

245
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,540
in Lei Naiwu's safe.

246
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:27,810
This too.

247
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,240
Is this your so-called "like brothers?"

248
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,450
Your so-called

249
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,230
"like your own daughter?"

250
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,640
And this is "all the things between us?"

251
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,370
Uncle Guan,

252
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,880
I also remember

253
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,339
all of your words and deeds in my heart.

254
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,180
I found these

255
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,160
on the company's account

256
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,970
the day after my dad passed away.

257
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,420
It's over 10 million in total.

258
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,079
Uncle Guan,

259
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,520
if I hand these materials

260
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,450
to the police,

261
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,840
you should know

262
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,250
what'll happen, right?

263
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,970
Do you really think

264
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,690
Lei Naiwu

265
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,340
let you go?

266
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,130
Uncle Guan,

267
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,210
I...

268
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,430
I'm just talking nonsense.

269
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,240
It's the lesser of two evils.

270
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,300
I really hope

271
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,410
that my brother abroad

272
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,410
has the chance to use your money.

273
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,600
You...

274
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,520
Understand what I mean, right?

275
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,520
I understand.

276
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,630
Uncle Guan,

277
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,160
take care. Stay safe.

278
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,940
By the way, Uncle Guan.

279
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,250
Do you want Mrs. Wang

280
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,920
to cook some noodles for you?

281
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,070
Don't hurt Ying.

282
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,880
She's your biological sister.

283
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,800
Uncle Guan.

284
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,160
Take care.

285
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,460
Stay safe.

286
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,240
Why?

287
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,490
Why are you killing me?

288
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,720
Because you tipped off the police,

289
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,820
we lost a big batch of goods.

290
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,840
Don't you understand?

291
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,900
They betrayed you.

292
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,770
Don't kill me.

293
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,040
Don't kill me.

294
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,780
Here. Stab here.

295
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,390
I told you to stab him!

296
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,260
Did you watch it?

297
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,010
Yes.

298
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
I trust Zheng.

299
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,410
I only believe what I see.

300
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,670
Gao Yang,

301
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,010
I know it’s hard

302
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,690
to calm you down now.

303
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,720
Master.

304
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,650
I guarantee I'll complete the task.

305
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,320
Boss,

306
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,900
where is the toilet?

307
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,010
In there.

308
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,250
Thank you.

309
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,140
Guan Dayong!

310
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,170
Dongyu,

311
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,140
Guan Dayong is gone.

312
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,370
You said Guan Dayong threw off the police?

313
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,050
And he went to the noddle shop

314
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,780
straight from the Chen family?

315
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,650
Yes.

316
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,340
I followed him the whole way.

317
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,600
He didn't go anywhere.

318
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,550
What do they want to do?

319
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,480
The time of death

320
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,930
was 3 to 4 A.M.

321
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,610
The cause was asphyxiation.

322
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,610
There are no signs of fighting or injuries,

323
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,070
other than the rope marks.

324
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,020
Thus, we believe

325
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,350
homicide is ruled out.

326
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,050
Thanks.

327
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,770
I've checked

328
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,820
nearby surveillance cameras.

329
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,960
Guan Dayong entered the park

330
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,850
at 2 A.M.

331
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,910
No one went in or out

332
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,850
before a passerby discovered his body.

333
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,250
Looks like it really was suicide.

334
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,950
By the way,

335
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,090
a suicide note was found in his phone.

336
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,080
[Suicide Note]

337
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,730
What do you think?

338
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,730
The timing is so strange.

339
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,250
Why didn't he do anything

340
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,310
when Chen Jingming

341
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,450
was arrested?

342
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,900
He had to plead guilty now

343
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,090
and then commit suicide.

344
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,050
I think it's like

345
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,050
he's a scapegoat.

346
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,690
The last person Guan Dayong saw

347
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,750
was Chen Jiadong.

348
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,340
Mr. Chen, someone is looking for you.

349
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,940
Thank you.

350
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,370
Jiadong.

351
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,600
Uncle Li?

352
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,300
There are updates

353
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,050
about your father's case.

354
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,580
I want to ask you about them.

355
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,480
Let's talk inside.

356
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:41,850
No need.

357
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,490
Let's talk here.

358
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,730
Yesterday,

359
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,530
Guan Dayong came to you

360
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,110
right away

361
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,170
after Lei Naiwu released him, right?

362
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,780
Did he say anything?

363
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,330
Uncle Li,

364
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,610
Guan... His situation...

365
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,750
This case

366
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,610
involves the case from back then,

367
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,400
so Jiadong,

368
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,510
please cooperate with us.

369
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,740
Understood.

370
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,440
Yesterday,

371
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,690
when Uncle Guan came back,

372
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,890
we had a meal

373
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,200
at home.

374
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,970
He said

375
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,010
he did a lot of bad things

376
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,740
with my dad these years.

377
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,490
He wanted to turn himself in.

378
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,850
Did he tell you

379
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,980
what exactly he did?

380
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,530
No.

381
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,250
This morning,

382
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,620
people exercising found Guan Dayong

383
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,490
committed suicide by hanging himself in the park.

384
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,220
Suicide?

385
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,160
Boss!

386
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:54,890
Boss!

387
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:57,890

They said he

397

hung himself in the park.

398
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Was it suicide?

399

Okay, you can go.

400

After this is resolved,

What if I do it,

427
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,440
but you don't give it to me?

436

produce someone like you?

437

Yes.

445

446

and packed

went on missions before,

Chief Li,

455
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,060
Gao Yang has been so acting strange these days.

456
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,740
Could it be related

457
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,540
to Zheng?

458
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700

Let me show you something.

461
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,180
But remember,

462
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,690
you're a police officer,

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,980
instead of

464
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
watching it as someone's daughter.

465
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,500
After watching it,

466
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,400
think about what you should do

467
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,880
and how you could do it.

468
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,740
Watch it.

469
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,860
Why?

470
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,500
Why are you killing me?

471
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,060
Because you tipped off the police,

472
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,660
we lost a batch of goods.

473
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,270
Don't you understand?

474
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,480
They betrayed you.

475
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,860
Kill him.

476
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,620
I told you to stab him!

Don't you understand?

Gao Yang’s biological father

481
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,480
was working for Zheng,

482
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,840
which caused him to get killed.

483
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:26,940
So,

484
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,989
Gao Yang thinks

485
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,500
Zheng betrayed his father.

486
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,469
How could he think that?

487
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,260
Doesn't Gao Yang know

488
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,750
what kind of person Zheng is like?

489
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,750
How could he

make an arbitrary judgment

491
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,980
based on one video?

00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,770
No, Chief Li.
