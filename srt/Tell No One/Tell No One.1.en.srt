00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,870
My dad is Chen Jingming.

197
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,360
My dad is Chen Jingming.

198
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,990
My dad is Chen Jingming.

199
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,910
My dad...

200
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,870
My dad is Chen Jingming.

201
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,430
No.

202
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,270
What did you say?

203
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,130
Who is your dad?

204
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,130
My dad is Chen Jingming.

205
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,960
What's your name?

206
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Chen Xueying.

207
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,830
Really?

208
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,270
Yes.

209
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,560
How much can your dad pay me?

210
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,430
My dad...

211
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,070
My...

212
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,690
As long as you don't touch me...

213
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,630
As long as you don't touch me,

214
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,360
you can have as much as you want.

215
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,880
I beg you.

216
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,150
I beg you.

217
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,600
We can do this business.

218
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,470
I mean it.

219
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,270
But today,

220
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,630
we must get this done.

221
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,800
Understand?

222
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,920
Understand?

223
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,790
No!

224
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,720
Don't!

It’s okay now, Xueying.

230

Don't move.

231
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,360
Don't move.

232

Hands on your head.

233

Don't move.

234
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,030
Why are you arresting me?

235
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,500
Don't move.

236
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,700
I'm here to save her.

237
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,110
-Let go!
-Don't move!

238
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,710
So good?

239
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,740
You know how to treat your elder sister well.

240

What did you call me?

243
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,510
Where are your

244
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,220
manners?

245

I'm going to the army soon.

I know.

247
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,830
My dad told me.

248
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,910
So,

249
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,510
I have something important

250
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,190
to tell you.

251
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,320
Listen carefully.

252
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,190
First,

253
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,560
I've grown up.

254
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,790
You can't hit me anymore.

255
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,460
Second,

256
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,420
I've grown up.

257
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,910
I don't want to be your brother anymore.

258
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,810
Brat.

259
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,490
I don't think you've grown up.

260
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,610
I think you've become bolder.

261
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,310
If you don't want to be my brother, what do you want to be?

262
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,240
Your boyfriend.

263
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,140
I like you.

264
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,190
You're going to university soon.

265
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,790
In the university,

266
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,990
many boys will pursue you

267
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,720
and like you.

268
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,440
But they don't know you.

269
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,520
If they know

270
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,790
you have such a bad temper,

271
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,720
who can stand it?

272
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,250
But I can.

273
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,440
Although you're

274
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,870
domineering,

275
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,990
stubborn,

276
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,170
impatient,

277
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,410
unreasonable,

278
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,630
and like to bully me,

279
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,870
I like the way you are.

280
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,160
I know everything about you

281
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,940
and like everything about you.

282
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,630
Everything, whether it's good or bad.

283
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,920
Do you agree?

284
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,670
Zheng Dongyu.

285
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,450
Do you agree?

286
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,150
If you hit me,

287
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,830
I'll consider it as a yes.

288
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,710
So you agreed.

289
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,590
Listen.

290
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,750
I'll hit you whenever I want.

291
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,190
Cut the crap.

292
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,870
Let's go home and eat.

Chief Li.

295
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,150
I'll interrogate him with you.

296
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:22,630
No need.

297
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,170
Let me do it.

298
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,890
You don't trust me?

299
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,200
Follow my order.

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,070
-Li, come here.
-Chief Li.

301
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,230
Take Deputy Chief Zheng to rest.

302
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,750
Yes.

303
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,990
Stop staring.

304
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,950
Turn off the CCTV.

305
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,920
Get some rest.

306
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,710
Yes.

307
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,450
Yes. Okay.

308
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,950
You go out.

309
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,390
Chief Li, you want to interrogate me personally.

310
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,450
Isn't it too grand?

311
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,270
The CCTV and recording are not on.

312

Do you have some time?

317
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,950
No.

Come in, kid.

Do you know him?

323

He's grown up.

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,840
So energetic.

Yes.

What’s your plan?

328
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,690
He just took the exam

of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

330
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,370
He got third place.

331
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,240
Not bad, we'll be peers.

332
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,830
Where was he assigned to?

333
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,750
I want you to

334
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,520
take him as your disciple.

Yes.

337
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,470
Let me test you first.

338
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,710
Can you say something

339
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,530
about my personality,

or habits?

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,370
Say whatever you want.

343
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,900
You won't favor old friends.

344
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,100
You're upright, but you tend to offend people.

345
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,500
You don't have a wife.

346
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,550
Give me an explanation.

347
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,870
Your clothes are neat,

348
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,030
but your collar is dirty.

349
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,030
It means no one takes care of you in your family.

350
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,550
A detective tends to be busy

351
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,530
and has a bad temper.

352
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,240
It's normal for you

353
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,170
to find it difficult to find a wife.

354
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,590
Also,

355
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,640
you've been on a business trip recently.

356
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,390
Why?

357
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,050
The mud in the pot is wet,

358
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,870
but the leaves are withered.

359
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,750
It means no one took care of them for days.

360
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,280
The water was just watered.

361
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,790

362
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,710

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,830
No.

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,220

367
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,950

Am I taking him as my apprentice

373
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,770
or are you taking him as your son-in-law today?

374
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,290
Well.

is to join this gang

389
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,750
and try your best

390
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,290
to get their head,

391
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,300
Liu Qing's trust

392
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,790
and find evidence of them

393
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,390
selling counterfeit notes.

394
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,830
Got it.

395
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,750
Liu Qing is very cunning.

396
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,390
The comrade who was sent

397
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,770
undercover by the special task force

398
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,570
was discovered by him when he was

399
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,020
just beginning to reach the core.

400
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,070
Kid,

401
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,400
this mission is extremely dangerous.

402
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,520
You are the key

403
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,200
to whether we can

404
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,930
dismantle this criminal gang.

405
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,470
Don't worry, Master.

406
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,230
I will complete the task.

407
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:05,910
Hello.

408
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,550
Deputy Chief Li.

409
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,020
Everything goes well.

410
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,560
Mission completed.

411
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,640
Wait.

412
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,940
Go on.

413
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,550
I brought you a cup of herbal tea.

414
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,350
The temperature is just right.

415
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,910
Here.

416
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,910
What did you go to prison for?

417
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,040
I stabbed someone to death.

418
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,230
When did that happen?

419
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,550
This year.

420
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,990
Where are you from?

421
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,710
Guizhou.

422
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,530
Who else is in your family?

423
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,870
All dead.

424
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,130
Eat up.

425
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,590
Eat.

426
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,150
Bury him.

427
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,480
Boss, I've checked.

428
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,390
Guizhou Police

429
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,120
is really trying to arrest him.

430
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,560
Pull him out.

431
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,080
Brat.

432
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,850
You're so tough.

433
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,670
You actually persisted for so long.

434
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,910
Work for me in the future.

435
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,820
Go out with Lu tomorrow

436
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,410
for a while and change your identity.

437
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,550
Then come work for me.

438
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,720
Call him Boss.

439
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,150
Boss.

440
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,990
Welcome back.

441
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,070
Dad.

442
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,400
Where are you?

443
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,400
Gao Yang appeared again.

444
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,670
What happened

445
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,700
back then?

446
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,090
Can anyone tell me?

447
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,910
[2005]

448
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,470
Kai!

449
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,930
Take a look over there.

450
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,540
Okay.

451
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,500
[Linjiang Daily]

452
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,870

Wish you prosperity!
