00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,860
Bro.

3
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,830
From the moment

4
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,750
my wife passed away,

5
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,000
there were only two things left

6
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,870
in my life.

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,010
First, it's revenge.

8
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,840
The second

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,950
is to repay your kindness.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,020
So no matter what you want me to do,

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,430
just tell me.

12
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,930
You have to help me again.

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,350
Bro.

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,830
Do you know?

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,230
For the past seven years,

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,250
I've been like

17
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,820
a walking corpse every day.

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,840
But since the first time you came to me,

19
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,730
I've become valuable.

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,510
Thank you.

21
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,270
Lord Guan.

22
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,180
Please bless me

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,979
to get the money.

24
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,790
Lord Guan.

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,639
Are you trying to enlighten me?

26
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,870
Is he lying to me?

[Episode 4: The Evildoer]

29
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,510
Bro.

30
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,910
Come here, Bro.

31
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,430
Come and have some tea.

32
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,780
Bro.

33
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,010
I have something to tell you.

34
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,000
I just met someone

35
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,470
who helped us

36
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,530
sell goods abroad.

37
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,320
He asked me if we still made banknotes.

38
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,860
If we make it,

39
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:20,940
he can sell it.

40
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,870
We can't do it, Bro.

41
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,870
Bro.

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,480
We're just

43
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,840
doing guard duty now,

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,510
not making much money.

45
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,270
The police often crack down on vice and drugs.

46
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,430
We don't have much profit to gain.

47
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,390
We can do what we did back then.

48
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,820
We will follow the same practice

49
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,280
you carried out with Boss.

50
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,950
We need the same batch of staff.

51
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,990
A raw material specialist.

52
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,790
A technician.

53
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,120
A salesperson.

54
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,990
It's not hard.

55
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,840
You don't understand, Bro.

56
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,710
Everything else is easy

57
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,110
but the ink.

58
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,680
The ink requires a special formula.

59
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,720
Why did Boss

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,390
want to make banknotes?

61
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,940
Because he found someone

62
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,090
who knew a special formula.

63
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,750
How can you find such a man now?

64
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,140
Why didn't I know

65
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,310
there was this person?

66
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,470
Was he also caught then?

67
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,030
No.

68
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,920
He ran away.

69
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,040
I've never seen him.

70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,010
Every time he came with ink,

71
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,160
and left right after work.

72
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,290
Boss Liu was the one who contacted him.

73
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,190
Was he there at the last time?

74
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,030
Of course.

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,340
What would we print if he wasn't there?

76
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,870
Was he from China or abroad?

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,290
I don't know.

78
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,940
Stop thinking about it, Bro.

79
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,030
If we do that now,

80
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,740
we will face

81
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,930
the death penalty.

82
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,350
We finally

83
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,159
escaped.

84
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,950
Trust me.

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,900
We'll get richer.

86
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,909
Just in a few days.

87
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,530
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

88
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,670
Hello?

89
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:14,670
Okay.

90
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,370
Bro, I need to go out.

91
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,920
Where are you going?

92
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,430
To meet a girl.

93
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,950
Be restrained, Bro.

94
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:25,960
Bro.

95
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,680
Think about the banknotes.

96
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,110
The ink maker...

97
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,040
Try to reach him.

98
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,590
Watch out!

99
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,270
It was too dangerous.

100
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,200
What's going on?

101
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,590
Look at that.

102
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,720
Is she sick?

103
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,270
Miss, are you alright?

104
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,810
Take a deep breath.

105
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,150
Deep breaths can relieve nervousness.

106
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,800
Do you need me to take you home?

107
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,040
What's your name?

108
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,360
My name is Chen Xueying.

109
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,200
My friends call me Xueying.

110
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,290
My name is Gao Hu.

111
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,290
Gao Hu.

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,710
Your name

113
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,640
feels very much like the impression you give.

114
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,830
It makes people feel safe.

115
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,500
Why did you get so scared

116
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
by a falling pot?

117
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,030
When I was young,

118
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,230
my mother...

119
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,630
She...

120
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,150
She...

121
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,830
She...

122
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,790
She...

123
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,200
Got it.

124
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,910
I got it.

125
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,350
It's okay.

127
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,430
I... I'm sorry.

128
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,620
Here.

129
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,640
Have some candy.

130
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,990
When there's sweetness in your mouth,

131
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,050
there's no bitterness in your heart.

132
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,300
Actually, something also happened...

133
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,000
When I was a kid,

134
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,440
I couldn't sleep all night.

135
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,850
I always had nightmares.

136
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,990
But then I figured it out.

137
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,350
They are all watching from heaven.

138
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,390
They'll only be happy

139
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,110
when we get through it.

140
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,030
So,

141
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,630
you...

142
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,740
You're an adult.

143
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,070
Why did you bring White Rabbit with you?

144
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,130
My sister loves it.

145
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,350
Gao Hu,

146
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,010
can I have your phone number?

147
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,190
Sure.

148
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,530
If anyone bullies you,

149
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,490
come to me.

150
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,280
Boss, I'm paying the bill.

151
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,630
Gao Hu, one number is missing.

152
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,560
Three, three.

153
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,260
Dad, I'm back.

154
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,880
My daughter is back.

155
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,060
Dad.

156
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,730
Great.

157
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,510
Look.

158
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,110
You scared me this time.

159
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,770
Does it hurt here?

160
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,750
No.

161
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,090
Okay.

162
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,960
Dad.

163
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,610
Let me introduce him.

164
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,070
This is Gao Hu.

165
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,610
He saved my life.

166
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,230
Sis.

167
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,960
Dongyu.

168
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,080
We found the Hornet 250.

169
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,030
It's 700 meters away

170
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,720
from the gas station on Sangtian Road.

171
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,910
The gas tank is empty.

172
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,350
I checked the license plate number.

173
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,810
It's the vehicle that was stolen last month.

174
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,340
There are four fingerprints.

175
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,390
Two fingerprints belong to the owner.

176
00:11:59,390 --> 00:11:59,910
Look.

177
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,510
One is on the accelerator.

178
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,380
One on the seat.

179
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,550
The other two

180
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,810
belong to the suspect.

181
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,660
We can't see the pattern.

182
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,590
It's too blurry.

183
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,950
The Technical Department staff

184
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,080
have tried many ways

185
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,130
but couldn't find the result.

186
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,670
Obviously,

187
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,620
the fingerprints were destroyed.

188
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,430
He killed people so skillfully

189
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,270
and ran away.

190
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,310
It's definitely not the first time for him to do that.

191
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,570
Send this information

192
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,140
to every police station

193
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,040
and ask them to find a repeat culprit

194
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,640
who broke his fingerprints.

195
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,700
Yes.

196
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,270
Sit.

197
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,010
Please.

198
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,480
Sit.

199
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:34,980
Sit down.

200
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,550
It's okay.

201
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,810
Make yourself at home.

202
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,890
The first toast...

203
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,960
-Is to welcome my daughter home...
-Dad.

204
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,440
I think the first toast

205
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,920
should be made to Gao Hu.

206
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,310
When I first

207
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,340
met Gao Hu,

208
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,350
he saved me.

209
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,190
This time, he saved me again.

210
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,100
Gao Hu.

211
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,640
I always caused you trouble.

212
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,480
Sorry.

213
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,360
Xueying, I’m glad you’re fine.

214
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,150
Thank you.

215
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,730
Mr. Chen.

216
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,730
Okay.

217
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,190
Dad.

218
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,030
Brother.

219
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,400
You have no idea.

220
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,730
Gao Hu and I are really fated.

221
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,230
He's just like me.

222
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,290
When he was young,

223
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,270
he had the same experience as me.

224
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,900
-Gao Hu...
-Xueying.

225
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,520
It's all in the past.

226
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,820
Let's not talk about this.

227
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,080
Just take care of yourself in the future.

228
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,580
So what I want to say is

229
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,790
during this period,

230
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,470
I've thought it through in the hospital.

231
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,190
As for me,

232
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,510
only when I'm

233
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,790
with Gao Hu,

234
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm happy.

235
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,350
So,

236
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,230
I

237
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,910
want to be...

238
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,240
Xueying.

239
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,710
I understand what you mean.

240
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,430
Gao Hu.

241
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,430
Welcome to Minghua Group.

242
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,070
You can start as a security team captain.

243
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,470
Let's take a step at it.

244
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,270
Okay?

245
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,030
Dad.

246
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,190
That's great.

247
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,000
That way,

248
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,270
I can see you every day.

249
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,110
Mr. Chen.

250
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,750
I'm doing quite well myself.

251
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,710
I'm used to being free.

252
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,110
I don't like to be supervised.

253
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,710
Thank you for your kindness.

254
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,630
Gao Hu.

255
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,350
Our group is really good.

256
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,110
Think about it.

257
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,620
Chief Li.

258
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,390
Come in.

259
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,660
Chief Li.

260
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,670
The ballistic comparison results are out.

261
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,400
Put it there.

262
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,040
[Examination of sample bullet heads and casings]

263
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,040
[Examination of on-site bullet heads and casings]

264
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:00,790
Come on.

265
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,470
Did you find anything

266
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,610
about the shooter?

267
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,510
The murderer rode

268
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,870
a stolen Hornet 250.

269
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,580
The owner just parked the motorcycle

270
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,190
in front of the supermarket a few minutes ago,

271
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,990
then the motorcycle was stolen.

272
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,860
He's just a motorcycle thief.

273
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
A habitual thief.

274
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,210
Do you need to ask me?

275
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,320
So,

276
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,170
you need to spend some time on him.

277
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,470
Okay.

278
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,470
What's your progress?

279
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,550
I tested Lei Naiwu today

280
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,390
about making counterfeit notes.

281
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,100
He refused.

282
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,560
He has been

283
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,990
contacting someone recently.

284
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,410
He said he would get a lot of money soon

285
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,310
and we didn't need to take the risk.

286
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,170
Who do you think

287
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,550
he is contacting?

288
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,830
You talked about counterfeit notes with Lei Naiwu?

289
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,520
Why?

290
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,390
When

291
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,430
Liu Qing and his gang were arrested,

292
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,110
a man who made special ink

293
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,830
escaped.

294
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,310
Who?

295
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,770
Has Lei Naiwu seen him?

296
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,770
He said he didn't.

297
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,890
Neither have I.

298
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,030
This person

299
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,090
disappeared everytime

300
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,040
he delivered the ink.

301
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
But if he was

302
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,750
at the crime scene,

303
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,960
he's most likely

304
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,540
to know the truth.

305
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,470
But I will

306
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,560
find a way to test Lei Naiwu again.

307
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,270
Okay.

308
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,950
Watch your strategy.

309
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,550
The ballistic identification results

310
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,550
from the Provincial Bureau are out.

311
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,150
The gun that killed Qin Yong

312
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,630
is the one six years ago.

313
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,510
The leadership has decided to establish a special task force

314
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,220
to merge the case of Zheng Ying's disappearance

315
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,350
for investigation.

316
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,360
Okay.

317
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,000
We've waited for six years.

318
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,480
We finally have a clue.

319
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,790
Now Zheng's case

320
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,190
has some clues.

321
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,950
I believe we'll be able to solve it soon.

322
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,030
For your safety,

323
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,150
I will apply to my superior

324
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,130
to change your job

325
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,329
and let you step back to the second line.

326
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,150
Master.

327
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,569
My dad's case

328
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,120
hasn't been solved yet.

329
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,390
You've been through too many

330
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,520
life-risking moments in eight years.

331
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,350
I have to give Zheng an explanation.

332
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,030
Are you telling me to give up?

333
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,570
To give up on my dad?

334
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,630
Gao Yang.

335
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,780
I’m your master.

336
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,660
You are my disciple.

337
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,230
I'm not discussing it with you.

338
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,230
This is an order.

339
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,830
All these years,

340
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,970
we haven't given up.

341
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,630
Dongyu and I are still

342
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,910
looking into your dad's case.

343
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,250
We will find out the truth.

344
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,130
Don't worry.

345
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,830
You want me to give up?

346
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,830
I've waited for 20 years.

347
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,290
I haven't slept well for a day.

348
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,550
If I don't solve my dad's case,

349
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,870
no one can stop me.

350
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,420
I believe you will remember

351
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,680
what Zheng always said.

352
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,140
Since we chose this uniform,

353
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,400
we can't be afraid of danger.

354
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,460
I have to live up to Zheng.

355
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,520
I have to live up to this uniform more.

356
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,110
Master.

357
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,990
If Zheng is still alive,

358
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,190
he will support me.

359
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,290
I won't give up

360
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,940
on both cases.

361
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,650
[1990]

362
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,830
You're here.

363
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,520
How is it?

364
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,450
The crime scene has been blocked.

365
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,410
What happened exactly?

366
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,740
The case happened about 9 p.m. last night.

367
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,910
According to the footprints

368
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,510
and traces left on the scene,

369
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,430
based on our preliminary analysis,

370
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,050
three people committed the crime.

371
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,180
They opened the door

372
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,050
on the rainy night

373
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,670
and sneaked into the Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

374
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,880
The victim, Gao Jialing,

375
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,810
was 32 years old.

376
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,450
At the time of the incident, he was stabbed

377
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,820
several times in the back,

378
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,890
abdomen, and back.

379
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,600
According to the investigation,

380
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,230
it was found that the financial ledger of the supply and marketing cooperative is missing.

381
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,310
We suspect it

382
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,440
to be a case of home invasion homicide.

383
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,030
The deceased exhibited

384
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,310
a strong will to survive until the very end.

385
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,840
He crawled several meters forward.

386
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
In the end, he was exhausted

387
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,690
and fell into the blood.

388
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,750
Dad!

389
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,320
His only son was left behind.

390
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,030
Dad.

391
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,070
His son has been

392
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,990
lying on top of him since last night

393
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,380
when he found his body.

394
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,910
His name is

395
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,810
Gao Yang.

396
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,390
Yang.

397
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,400
I know your name is Gao Yang.

398
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,030
I also know

399
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,950
you're sad

400
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,670
and you don't want to leave your dad.

401
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,890
But you should know

402
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,590
that lying on top of your father

403
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,950
like you are now

404
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,910
will destroy

405
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,540
any traces left by the killer.

406
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,310
For example,

407
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,010
fingerprints,

408
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,460
and footprints.

409
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,000
Without these traces,

410
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,410
how can the police catch the bad guy?

411
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,830
So,

412
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,950
let me ask you a question.

413
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,860
Do you want to catch the bad guy?

414
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,670
I do.

415
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,590
Okay.

416
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,390
Now,

417
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,930
I'll take you away.

418
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,550
Let the police

419
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,590
work early

420
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,150
so that they can catch the bad guy early.

421
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,670
Okay?

422
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,500
Good boy, come on.

423
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,930
Let go of that hand.

424
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,870
Yes.

425
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,270
Okay.

426
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,030
Come on.

427
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,070
Get up.

428
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,320
Who is it?

429
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,470
Dali.

430
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,630
It's Gao Hu.

431
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,950
Hu.

432
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,200
Long time no see.

433
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,130
You're out?

434
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,090
I've behaved well.

435
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,460
I need your help.

436
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,330
Hu.

437
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,450
I...

438
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,630
I miss you so much.

439
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,340
Wait.

440
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,270
Where have you been all these years?

441
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,730
I can't find you anywhere.

442
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,870
I served a prison sentence in another city.

443
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,000
You work here?

444
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm making a living here.

445
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,710
Where's the boss? I want to buy a motorcycle.

446
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,440
Why do you have to buy one?

447
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,170
Which one do you like?

448
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,000
I can give it to you.

449
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,830
Can you afford it? You're just a part-timer.

450
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,550
Look at you.

451
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,080
Do you have a Hornet?

452
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,740
The Honda one?

453
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,480
I just sold one two days ago.

454
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,540
I guess

455
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,310
you'll have to wait two more days.

456
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,110
Who bought it?

457
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,480
I don't know him.

458
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,090
Call your boss out.

459
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,750
Boss.

460
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,990
This is my bro.

461
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,760
He wants to buy a motorcycle.

462
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,670
Which one?

463
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,470
Dali introduced me here.

464
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,290
Take a look.

465
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,440
You're someone Dali introduced.

466
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,870
Don't worry.

467
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,270
The price is negotiable.

468
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,030
Bro.

469
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,400
I want to ask you about someone.

470
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,240
My boss wants to find him.

471
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,130
It's personal.

472
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,200
We won't expose your information.

473
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,230
Don't worry.

474
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,000
My bro knows his place.

475
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,760
He won't cause you any trouble.

476
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,430
I don't know who that person is.

477
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,360
I only know he ordered another one.

478
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,170
I'll deliver it tomorrow.

479
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,000
Chief Li.

480
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,950
What’s up?

481
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,110
Has the results

482
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,260
of the ballistic comparison come out?

483
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,110
Has the gun from six years ago

484
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,920
also appeared?

485
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,470
Follow me.

486
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,550
Bro.

487
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,320
Look at the hair gel.

488
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,920
Bro.

489
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,420
Look at your hairstyle.

490
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,700
Does it look good?

491
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,590
Where's Hu?

492
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,070
He called me. He...

493
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,910
He sent the girl to the hospital.

494
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,250
To the hospital?

495
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,850
What is it?

496
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,230
I want to go out for something.

497
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,670
All right, I'll go by myself.

498
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,430
Take me with you.

499
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,230
It's the same.

500
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,550
Forget it. Don't go.

501
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,280
Stay at home.

502
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,950
Bro.

503
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,470
Take me with you.

504
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,530
I think it's good.

505
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,190
Bro.

506
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,250
The leadership has decided to set up a special task force.

507
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,660
[Assessment Report]

508
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,660
[Criminal Science and Technology Research Institute of Jiangdong Provincial Public Security Department]

509
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,110
They requested to combine the investigation

510
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,990
of the Qin Yong case with the disappearance case

511
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,520
of Zheng Ying six years ago.

512
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,430
Go ahead.

513
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,470
I know.

514
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,120
Be careful.

515
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,880
Gao Yang called me.

516
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,570
The suspect who killed Qin Yong

517
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,350
has appeared.

518
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,950
Dongyu.

519
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,350
Let's go.

520
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,700
Take some staff to arrest him.

521
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,220
Yes.

522
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,870
Sorry.

523
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,880
The subscriber you dialed

524
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,040
is busy now.

525
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,910
Please try again later.

526
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,060
Sorry...

527
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,470
Did it not go through?

528
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:47,960
Hello, Chief Li.

529
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,290
How long will we arrive?

530
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,230
Ten minutes left.

531
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,350
Faster.

532
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,440
Faster.

533
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,350
Lei Naiwu!

534
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,790
Bro, run!

535
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,790
Hurry!

536
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,430
Don't move.

537
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,380
Don't move.

538
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,090
Let me go now!

539
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,150
If you can't release me,

540
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,150
take me to the hospital.

541
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,480
I'm seriously injured.

542
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,870
How about you send me to the police...

543
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,710
Boss.

544
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,070
I was being brave.

545
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,380
Release me.

546
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,510
Li.

547
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,090
You may get out.

548
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,710
Yes.

549
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,960
Where are you hurt?

550
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,390
Relax.

551
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,110
The camera is off.

552
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,730
Be gentle.

553
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,030
Hang in there.

554
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,200
You almost died today.

555
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,930
You know?

556
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,350
Well,

557
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,410
that guy was really good at fighting.

558
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,750
If I were a little late,

559
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,510
Lei Naiwu would've died.

560
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,800
It's okay.

561
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,960
It's not my first day as a police officer.

562
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,020
It is the first day.

563
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,270
Alright.

564
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,510
I'm glad

565
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,150
you're fine.

566
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,230
But

567
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,910
you have to be careful in the future.

568
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,320
Do you hear me?

569
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,270
Chen Jingming, you're so cruel.

570
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,510
You want to kill me after killing Sanyong?

571
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,570
I won't let you off!

572
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,840
One of my men died.

573
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,090
He's just a kid.

574
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,110
If you play so hard,

575
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,590
I'll kill your family first,

576
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,530
then kill you.

577
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,550
Wait and see.

578
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,200
I'll make your life miserable.

579
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,250
Based on his ability and skills,

580
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,840
he shouldn't have been unable to kill

581
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,110
Lei Naiwu.

582
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,690
Someone capable must have

583
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:11,640
helped him.

584
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,270
Is it enough?

585
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,880
There's more if not.

586
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,600
I'm full.

587
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,610
You have a good appetite.

588
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Do you do physical work for a living?

589
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,920
You didn't go home all night.

590
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,280
Don't your family worry?

591
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,910
Be quick.

592
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,930
You have to tell us

593
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,090
what your name is.

594
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,200
We have to go through the routine.

595
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,080
You won't surrender, will you?

596
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,830
Within 24 hours,

597
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,860
I will definitely find out who you are.

598
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,270
Guan.

599
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,230
Investigate someone for me.

600
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,960
Who?

601
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,430
Gao Hu.
