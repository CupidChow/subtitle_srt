00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,920
They were just

196
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,190
one part of my plan,

197
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,890
all just objects to be buried with my mother.

198
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,670
I wanted to put

199
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,890
everyone inside.

200
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,750
Have some tea.

201
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,730
The explosives are buried.

202
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,540
Is it enough?

203
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,710
Don't worry.

204
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,840
After tomorrow,

205
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,710
there won't be any evidence

206
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,710
and the necessary people would be gone too.

207
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,230
You have to wash your clothes when they're dirty.

208
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,870
If there's lice...

209
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,490
You have to burn it.

210
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,240
Jiadong,

211
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,790
I realized

212
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,390
you're the one who will do great things.

213
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,640
You're much stronger than your father.

214
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,230
Boss Liu,

215
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,790
I'm just worried

216
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,250
you'll fail in your old age

217
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,440
after being successful your entire life.

218
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,510
Do you really think so?

219
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,870
Of course.

220
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,830
Jiadong,

221
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,500
I like it.

222
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,300
[Jin Min]

223
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:39,960
By the way,

224
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,870
I'm afraid Chen Jingming will make trouble.

225
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,800
Don't let him go.

226
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,110
Don't worry.

227
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,920
I'll take care of it.

228
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,470
It's okay. Go ahead.

229
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,230
Drink.

230
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,910
Naiwu.

231
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,070
Think of a way

232
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,390
to stop him

233
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,830
from walking around these days.

234
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,360
Why did you push me?

235
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,990
You're too slow.

236
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,040
I considered everything,

237
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,050
but I didn't expect

238
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,280
that the Lu Sheng doing the deal with us

239
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,330
would be Zheng Ying.

240
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,190
Since Zheng Ying is here,

241
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,870
it means this deal

242
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,670
is completely

243
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,270
under the police's control.

244
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,060
I must tell Liu Qing as soon as possible

245
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,990
that this plan

246
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,850
has completely failed.

247
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,120
Unfortunately, Zheng Ying...

248
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,560
Saw me too.

249
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,510
Jiadong.

250
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,950
Jiadong,

251
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,590
why are you here?

252
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,830
How do you know Liu Qing's group?

253
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,450
Go back with me now.

254
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,590
Let's tell the truth

255
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,630
and apply for clemency.

256
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,760
I'll accompany you.

257
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,110
Let's go back.

258
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,150
Let's go back.

259
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,940
Get up.

260
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,550
Don't be afraid.

261
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,610
I'll take you back.

262
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,040
Let's go.

263
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,390
Go!

264
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,470
I shot him just like that.

265
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,710
But when I was about to

266
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,950
add a second shot,

267
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,760
I suddenly hesitated.

268
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,270
I thought about it.

269
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,730
I couldn't give him another shot.

270
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,510
I wanted to take him back.

271
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,890
I wanted to kill Chen Jingming's good friend

272
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,260
in front of him.

273
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:47,830
Jiadong.

274
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,150
Jiadong.

275
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,650
What happened?

276
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,950
Jiadong.

277
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,070
Jiadong!

278
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,670
This...

279
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,910
Who is this?

280
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,270
You know him too.

281
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,630
Zheng?

282
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,350
Isn't this...

283
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,430
Isn't this your Uncle Zheng?

284
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,990
He's also Lu Sheng.

285
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,270
Lu Sheng?

286
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,590
How...

287
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,510
How did he get shot?

288
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,310
I shot him.

289
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,910
Quickly send him to the hospital.

290
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,750
Quickly send him to the hospital!

291
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,230
Hurry.

292
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,830
Send him to the hospital.

293
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,510
Jiadong.

294
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,110
He saw me today.

295
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,440
Either he dies or I die.

296
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,990
Kill him.

297
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,480
What did you say?

298
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,430
I said kill him.

299
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,440
Jiadong, are you crazy?

300
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,730
This is your Uncle Zheng.

301
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,830
When Lei Naiwu tells you to kill someone,

302
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,160
you do it.

303
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,520
But when I tell you to kill someone,

304
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,750
you won't listen to me?

305
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,070
Jiadong.

306
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,750
Jiadong.

307
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Back then,

308
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,230
I had no choice.

309
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,390
I did it for you,

310
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,350
for Xueying,

311
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,950
for our family...

312
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,910
I had no choice.

313
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,920
No matter if he was...

314
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,660
Something Jialing,

315
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,120
Gao Jialing or something,

316
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,350
I didn't know him, after all.

317
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,660
But this is...

318
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,830
This is your Uncle Zheng.

319
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,870
He's my good friend.

320
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,870
Jiadong,

321
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,210
take him to the hospital.

322
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,010
Chen Jingming.

323
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,250
He's your good friend.

324
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,870
The one who died

325
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,870
because of that recording back then

326
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,590
was my mom.

327
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,690
It was your wife.

328
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,550
I know.

329
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,550
So...

330
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,630
So I

331
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,790
regret it too.

332
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,900
I don't want you

333
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,740
to do anything you regret again.

334
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,090
Chen Jingming.

335
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,510
Do you know

336
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,970
that I've wanted to kill you all these years?

337
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,170
But why didn't I kill you?

338
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,850
Do you know?

339
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,010
Because I want to see you

340
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,210
wish you were dead instead.

341
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,150
Jiadong.

342
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,550
Jiadong.

343
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:24,590
Kill him.

344
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,480
Jiadong.

345
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,790
I told you to kill him.

346
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,710
Jiadong.

347
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,590
Jiadong.

348
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,550
Can't do it?

349
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,120
Then watch from the side.

350
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,180
I'm sorry.

351
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,920
Chen Jingming was such a coward.

352
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,240
To be honest,

353
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,490
when I suffocated Zheng Ying,

354
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,310
Chen Jingming didn't even

355
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,310
dare to breathe.

356
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,740
[Control Room 2]

357
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,020
I'll be there on the day

358
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,710
you get executed.

359
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,890
Behave yourself.

360
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,300
Take him away.

361
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,630
Take him away.

362
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,550
Go.

363
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,670
Let's go.

364
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,030
Zheng,

365
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,370
[Mother Hu Wanying, Father Zheng Ying]

366
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,340
I have something

367
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,160
to talk to you about.

368
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,230
The night before the deal,

369
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,450
you and Gao Yang

370
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,050
disappeared for 46 minutes.

371
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,880
Where did you go?

372
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,360
I've asked Gao Yang.

373
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,500
He kept hiding it from me.

374
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,690
He wouldn't tell me the truth.

375
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,870
I'll say it.

376
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,360
You all listen

377
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,460
and see if I'm right.

378
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:13,980
Royal Flush!

379
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:14,980
Coming.

380
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Have some supper.

381
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,390
Hu is here.

382
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,020
Hu.

383
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,110
How is he?

384
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,630
He's inside. He's fine.

385
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,990
You always lose, but you still play.

386
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,630
Don't drink too much.

387
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,930
Okay.

388
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,560
There's work tomorrow.

389
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,060
Okay.

390
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,190
Go work, Hu.

391
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,740
Are you hungry, Mr. Lu?

392
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,850
Where are we going?

393
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,810
What happened?

394
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,190
Mom is dying.

395
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,400
Go back.

396
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,170
Look at the situation now.

397
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,630
Go back now.

398
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,030
Blame it on me if anything happens.

399
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,560
What are you talking about?

400
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,750
Honey,

401
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,660
I didn't take good care of you.

402
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,350
How are you?

403
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,180
I'm here.

404
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,110
Tomorrow,

405
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,250
I'll take you out of the hospital.

406
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,920
Honey,

407
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,770
I won't leave you.

408
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,750
I won't walk a single step away.

409
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,110
Stay safe.

we'll leave at daybreak.
