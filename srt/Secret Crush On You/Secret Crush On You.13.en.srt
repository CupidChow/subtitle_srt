00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,240
What do you think about today's movie, P'Nuea?

164
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,370
I think it's good.

165
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,920
You like it as well, right P'Nuea?

166
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,660
Right?

167
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,860
I like one of the characters so much.

168
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,620
It's very much like you, P'Toh.

169
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,160
I think P'Nuea must like this one also.

170
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,710
I like Toh.

171
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,660
Not something that is similar to Toh.

172
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,060
No matter how similar it may seem,

173
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,460
it's still a fake copy.

174
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,040
Let's go, Toh.

175
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,460
Let's go back to our condo.

176
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,920
Oh. Yes.

177
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,200
- Goodbye, P'Nuea.
- Goodbye.

178
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,630
Copy.

179
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,560
- Copy.
- Let's leave.

180
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,020
- Going now.
- Copy.

181
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,740
Copy.

182
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,860
Hey, look. My kid is so cute. Looks so good, right?

183
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,999
Sure.

184
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,519
- But we won't see...
- It's good. There's a bird...

185
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,700
Hey, my child is good-looking, right?

186
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,660
What's going on?

187
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,100
Jao, take it. Take it.

188
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,810
- Is it for me?
- Yeah, take it.

189
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,460
- Open it.
- What is it?

190
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,420
- There's something inside.
- Yeah.

191
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,840
- What is it?
- Looks pretty.

192
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,760
What is it?

193
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,220
Here.

194
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,279
You're giving it to me?

195
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,740
- It's pretty.
- Do you really not want it, Jao?

196
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,000
That's right.

197
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,440
- Look, Toh. It can blink.
- Jao, don't play with it.

198
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,160
To the one I love the most, from the most handsome one.

199
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,060
Hey, didn't you say you'd give it to me?

200
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,960
I don't think I can now.

201
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,090
It's not pretty, Som. It's better if you don't take it.

202
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,340
It's not suitable for you. I'll keep it for myself.

203
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,550
- You were just saying you would let me have it a second ago.
- Yes.

204
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,800
I see. This one is from his lover.

205
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,600
No wonder he's acting like this. Acting all shy now.

206
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,660
I don't say that.

207
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,813
Wait a second.

208
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,840
When did you confess to him?

209
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,673
That's right.

210
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,320
- Jao, what's up? Tell us about it.
- What happened? Talk.

211
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,530
- Yeah, speak up.
- The lion is cute, don't you think?

212
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,680
- Don't change the subject.
- Don't try to budge. Say it.

213
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,200
- Oh look! The eyes can move.
- Argh, stop trying to change the subject.

214
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,450
- There're surely some developments these days.
- Yes.

215
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,960
So you're not telling us? Fine. I'll go ask P'Sky myself.

216
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,340
Hold it.

217
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,120
You don't really want to ask P'Sky. You just want a reason to go see your hubby.

218
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,200
- Yeah.
- True.

219
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,039
Yeah, so what?

220
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,420
But I'll share every little detail about the cutie here with you later.

221
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,960
Fantastic!

222
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,420
Stop it, Toh!

223
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,400
- I'm leaving now. Going now, okay?
- Okay, sure.

224
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,639
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

225
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,920
- Don't do it, Toh.
- Bye.

226
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,753
Toh!

227
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,790
♫ Who has a secret crush on you ♫

228
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,490
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

229
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,920
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

230
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,200
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

231
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,933
Damn it!

232
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:21,939
I'm so annoyed with that bitch, Toh.

233
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:23,459
Why?

234
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:27,210
I don't know how long I have to keep dressing like this.

235
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,420
It's not me at all.

236
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,440
That's true.

237
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,180
You sure are putting in an effort.

238
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,560
You even try to dress and act like him.

239
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,720
What can I do, man? This just happens to be P'Nuea's taste.

240
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,040
I just don't get it.

241
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,620
I don't think P'Nuea can date Ai Toh for long.

242
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,920
Yeah, I agree.

243
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,720
How about we make a bet?

244
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,100
If P'Nuea breaks up with Ai Toh and chooses me,

245
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,460
I'll book the entire pub for us to celebrate.

246
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,759
- Hey. You're serious?
- Hey. That's dope.

247
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,879
- Damn! I'm in.
- Yeah Let's do it.
- Go for it!

248
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,300
It's exactly like what P'Nuea said.

249
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,959
Let's grab a meal, P'Toh.

250
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,679
I'm really sorry. I suddenly had a stomachache.

251
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:53,739
A stomachache...

252
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:55,220
- Sure.
- Oh!

253
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,379
So... don't you have to go celebrate at the pub now?

254
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,120
Ce... celebrate what?

255
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,033
Nong Kong.

256
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,360
If you don't like to keep this appearance you don't need to force yourself.

257
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,540
What do you mean, P'Jao?

258
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,460
It means, quit being fake!

259
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,100
I take acting classes. I can tell.

260
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,020
Nong Kong.

261
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,780
You're so good. Te... teach me.

262
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:15,040
But... I think this is no longer an act.

263
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,100
It's become your habit, right?

264
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,120
Please stop it, Kong.

265
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,100
We're not upset or anything.

266
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,060
We only ask for one thing.

267
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,680
Please don't come around us anymore.

268
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,899
It's better that you know now,

269
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:05,059
so from now on... I can do what I want to take him from you!

270
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,640
Guys... Help me.

271
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,060
Hey, Nong.

272
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,079
I think you should eat more fish.
(T/N: Fish contain Omega-3 fatty acids that are healthy)

273
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,039
You see, if P'Nuea wanted you, he would have chosen you long ago.

274
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,479
I mean, look at him, you guys.

275
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,719
He went out of his way to copy Toh, but P'Nuea still doesn't want him.

276
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:36,400
- Just think about it.
- Som, you bitch!

277
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,530
It's Som Valencia. I want you to call me by my full name.

278
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,120
You bunch of outcasts.

279
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,060
What?

280
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,800
Sore loser!

281
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,160
- What outcasts? There are four of us here.
- That's right.

282
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,400
I just remembered something.

283
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,619
- Everyone.
- Huh?

284
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:13,819
- What?
- The result of "Like a star" competition is out.

285
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:17,259
- Huh?
- Yeah, have a look.

286
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:20,940
Kongkiat Yim-ngam.

287
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,580
Darn...

288
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,410
He's probably a better photographer than I am.

289
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,119
Why did he even want me to teach him?

290
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,740
Gosh! Toh!

291
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,900
Give it to me.

292
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,160
Here it is, my silly boy.

293
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,113
Here.

294
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,579
Thank you.

295
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,240
It's your favorite flavor.

296
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,419
- Is it hot?
- It is.

297
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,380
Let me cool it down for you, then.

298
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,820
Is it still hot?

299
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,020
Well...

300
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,759
I think it's still hot.

301
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,220
Let me blow it some more.

302
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,760
Is it any cooler?

303
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,910
It's me who's getting hotter now.

304
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,833
P'Nuea.

305
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,473
Yes?

306
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,900
So, you knew about that all along?

307
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,000
About Kong?

308
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,873
That's correct.

309
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,080
I didn't exactly know about it,

310
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,060
but I had a hunch.

311
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,539
- What?
- How come you never told me?

312
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,720
Hey...

313
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,300
A person like Thima... should face this himself.

314
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,040
So... you don't have to teach him to take photos anymore?

315
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,350
Why would I teach him?

316
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,959
He's probably better than me.

317
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,039
Are you serious?

318
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,210
- Is he really better than you?
- You're teasing me.

319
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,679
- I'm not talking to you anymore.
- There, there.

320
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,599
- I'm eating now.
- There, there.

321
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,140
Come here. Come.

322
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,733
Toh.

323
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,800
Now you know,

324
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,260
even if there are ten of you standing right in front of me,

325
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,870
I will only love this Toh right here.

326
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,320
P'Nuea. You speak like an old uncle.

327
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,420
Even if I'm an old uncle,

328
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,140
I'm also your hubby.

329
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,693
By the way.

330
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,300
I think I'm quite vocal about our relationship,

331
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,840
but why are there still people trying to do these things?

332
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,273
Or...

333
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,220
maybe I haven't done enough?

334
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,860
Or do you want to move in with me?

335
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,940
Having a weird thought again, huh?

336
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,280
Go and wash up. You've been exhausted all day.

337
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,179
Go. Get up.

338
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,119
I don't want to go. No.

339
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,653
No.

340
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,920
I'll carry you if you're not going by yourself.

341
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,193
I'm not going.

342
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,300
- I don't want to shower.
- You naughty kid.

343
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,259
Come here now.

344
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:30,839
Come here, naughty kid. Go.

345
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,619
P'Nuea.

346
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,159
No...

347
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,519
♫ Who has a secret crush on you ♫

348
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,080
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

349
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,559
Saying I can't wash up with you...

350
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,679
We're already lovers and all.

351
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,399
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

352
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,179
♫ Oh, baby ♫

353
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:56,880
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

354
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,953
Yes?

355
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
P'Nuea!

356
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,613
Toh.

357
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,960
This is...?

358
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,879
Surprise, P'Nuea!

359
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,359
Well... I've prepared this, um...

360
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,639
as your birthday surprise.

361
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,373
But... it's too bad you saw it first

362
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,773
Oh, I see.

363
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Thanks so much, Toh.

364
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,860
I couldn't have imagined you doing all this for me.

365
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,639
I think Jao is here to see us.

366
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,440
Should we open the door for him first?

367
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,960
Toh, let's find something to eat. Ah!

368
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,899
Oh, I'm sorry

369
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,539
for entering without permission.

370
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:31,419
The door isn't locked.

371
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,539
Shall we go grab something to eat?

372
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,990
Yeah, let's go grab a bite, Nuea.

373
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,170
You can go ahead.

374
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,340
I need to talk to Toh.

375
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,199
Okay.

376
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,420
Toh, if anything happens, I'll be in my room.

377
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,930
Hang in there.

378
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,059
We should leave. Let's go, P'Sky.

379
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:12,339
There's nothing...

380
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:16,100
- But...
- There's nothing to be worried about, P'Sky.

381
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,940
Are you ready to explain this to me?

382
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,493
So...

383
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,970
I've been having a crush on you for quite some time.

384
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,839
Since when?

385
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,519
♫ You've changed my life in every moment ♫

386
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,480
♫ To be more meaningful ♫

387
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,059
♫ Just to be able to see you up close, is enough ♫

388
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,700
Well...

389
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,799
Ever since the day I went to see... your basketball match.

390
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:36,640
My feelings have grown

391
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,859
more and more since...

392
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:43,079
I want to collect everything that I see.

393
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,999
Please let me help you.

394
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,900
It's fine, Auntie.

395
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,679
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

396
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,319
♫ That makes my whole heart ♫

397
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,919
♫ Feel love since the day you came ♫

398
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:12,459
I will go and throw it away myself.

399
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,439
♫ That made me realize ♫

400
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,079
♫ That tomorrow when I wake up ♫

401
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:29,080
I will spend every moment, to have you ♫

402
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,200
♫ I don't dare to continue to dream like this ♫

403
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,540
♫ Because in reality, you're too high and out of reach
to someone who's right here ♫

404
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,039
- Here.
- Yes?

405
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,759
It's for you.

406
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:04,120
♫ I will keep every moment with you within my heart ♫

407
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,380
You did this, Toh?

408
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,793
Yes.

409
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,130
Can we throw them away?

410
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,580
No!

411
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,893
Why, Toh?

412
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,040
I can't throw them away

413
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,559
because each and every single of them is a piece of my good memory.

414
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,199
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

415
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,140
♫ That makes my whole heart ♫

416
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,299
Should one day we part ways,

417
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:09,299
I still have these items with me.

418
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:13,039
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

419
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,299
To remind me that I once had you in my memories.

420
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,799
♫ I will spend every moment, to have you ♫

421
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:37,600
♫ What we have today is like a dream come true ♫

422
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,879
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

423
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,459
Why are you thinking like this again?

424
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,759
Do you always think about breaking up with me?

425
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,300
Hm?

426
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,119
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

427
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,259
That's not it.

428
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,299
I heard it.

429
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,239
When you're with your friends,

430
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,479
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

431
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,619
you keep saying that...

432
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,679
I'm your good memories.

433
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:28,799
You want to embrace me dearly, in case you won't be able to later.

434
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,699
Why is it, Toh?

435
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,139
If you find someone better for you...

436
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,260
♫ To love you ♫

437
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,800
you're going to leave me, right?

438
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,500
I won't.

439
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,060
That's not what I think.

440
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,460
On the contrary, I think you're a great person.

441
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,740
So...

442
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,340
should you meet someone better than I am,

443
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,160
I'm not gonna hold you back.

444
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,090
I'll leave.

445
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,700
No, I won't let you, Toh!

446
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

447
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,290
I'm not such a good person, Toh.

448
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,700
I'm not, Toh.

449
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm just an ordinary guy

450
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,320
that wants you to be by my side.

451
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,080
I don't need anything else, Toh.

452
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,520
I don't need anything else.

453
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,913
So...

454
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,250
can you not say that you will leave me ever again?

455
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,953
Please, Toh?

456
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,653
All right.

457
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,000
I won't say that anymore.

458
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,060
I'm sorry.

459
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,540
I love you, Toh.

460
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,850
Don't say that we'll break up again.

461
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,653
I beg you.

462
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:39,800
Understood. I'm not breaking up with you.

463
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,600
I love you, P'Nuea.

464
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,540
I love you too, Toh.

465
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,720
So, are you still mad at me?

466
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,270
I'm not mad at you.

467
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,590
I'm more surprised than anything.

468
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,470
But you've always been an oddball,

469
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,940
so I'm not too taken aback.

470
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,060
Something this trivial

471
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,310
won't make me break up with you.

472
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,380
Do you really mean it?

and that box there.

481
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:53,739
That one was well.

00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:29,259
♫ For the person standing down here, to look up and admire ♫

489
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,139
I remember this one.

490
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:35,479
It's from the Open House event.

491
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,459
That's correct.

492
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:48,440
♫ But for me, it's enough just for me to see you ♫

493
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,959
- Er... well.
- Toh.

494
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:04,200
Toh! Toh! Oops!

495
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,319
Just a moment, Toh.

496
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,899
P'Nuea. I have something to tell you.

497
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,780
Please look at this.

498
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,813
P'Nuea.

499
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,420
Although it looks weird...

500
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,620
we've never had any bad intentions.

501
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,480
We are just...

502
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,300
people who have secret crushes.

503
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,700
We just want to store all the memories

504
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,740
even though it seems weird.

505
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,560
But everything that I and Toh keep

506
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,100
are priceless treasures.

507
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,220
That's why... P'Nuea,

508
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,880
please don't break up with Toh. I beg you.

509
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,100
Kaojao.

510
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,250
I'm not breaking up with Toh.

511
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,700
We've talked it out and understand each other now.

512
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,533
Oh?

513
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,620
But thank you, Nong Kaojao.

514
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,900
I think...

515
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:20,920
someone else... probably wants to see this box more than me.

516
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,620
Toh! Why didn't you tell me first?

517
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,519
Well... Jao.

518
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,459
I was about to tell you but...

519
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:37,079
you were too fast I couldn't interrupt.

520
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,580
Don't touch me. I'm leaving!

521
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,300
He's gone sulking now.

522
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,633
Jao!

523
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,553
Nong Jao!

524
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,000
P'Sky.

525
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,473
Yes?

526
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,540
I have something to confess.

527
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,153
What is it?

528
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,240
May I have a look?

529
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,600
Well... P'Sky.

530
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:14,260
Actually, it's not strange for lovers to keep some mementos...

531
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,480
of each other, right?

532
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,690
But isn't this from before we started dating?

533
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,773
Well...

534
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,660
Answer me.

535
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,880
P'Sky.

536
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,700
Don't be so naughty.

537
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,640
That's not what you call naughty.

538
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,253
This... is what we call "naughty".

539
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,480
You're getting ahead of yourself these days.

540
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,820
I can be much worse, Jao.

541
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,840
Your turn now.

542
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,670
Is that all you've got?

543
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,890
I didn't feel anything.

544
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,800
Let me show you how the adults do it.

545
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,860
Ah, P'Sky!

546
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,920
That tickles.

547
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,910
In conclusion,

548
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:11,370
this wall... it's not a surprise gift for me, right?

549
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,580
These are the photos that you collected?

550
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,193
Yes.

551
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,860
How come there are only my pictures?

552
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,080
Well, I'm the one having a secret crush.

553
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,730
Of course, I only collect the pictures of the person I like.

554
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,180
Toh.

555
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,479
♫ Ever since the day you came ♫

556
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,399
What secret crush are you talking about?

557
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:00,199
Our feelings are now mutual.

558
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,119
Shouldn't the pictures on the wall change as well?

559
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:11,199
♫ Just to be able to see you up close, is enough ♫

560
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:18,519
♫ I don't expect anything more than this ♫

561
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,839
♫ I know well who I am ♫

562
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,499
[Mom: I almost forgot. Nuea,]

563
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,119
P'Nuea.

564
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,200
I can't stay for the tutorial this Friday.

565
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:37,580
Oh?

566
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,379
How come?

567
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,259
You said you wouldn't leave me.

568
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,579
It's not that I'm leaving you.

569
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:52,039
I just need to go home.

570
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,839
My mom texted me.

571
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,599
♫ That made me realize ♫

572
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,860
Then, I'll go with you...

573
00:58:05,421 --> 00:58:07,859
as a son-in-law.

574
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,219
Ah... P'Nuea.

575
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:15,200
Toh.

576
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,559
You got to meet my parents.

577
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,679
Why can't I meet yours?

578
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,839
But...

579
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,279
No but.

580
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,879
It doesn't matter how strict your parents are,

581
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,999
I'm not afraid.

582
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,119
Please? Let me go with you.

583
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,960
All right.

584
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,839
Let's go to my house this Friday.

585
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,099
Okay, thank you.

586
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:53,359
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

587
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,339
Thank you.

588
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,960
look at this picture.

589
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,879
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

590
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,919
I didn't mean to tease you.

591
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,340
You sure? Look at my vacant eyes.

592
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:20,719
♫ I will spend every moment, to have you ♫

593
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:27,439
♫ What we have today is like a dream come true ♫

594
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,419
Did you like it?

595
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,773
P'Sky.

596
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,813
Hm?

597
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,260
I'm glad that it's you.

598
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,320
And I promise you that...

599
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,180
it will always be you.

600
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,459
My chubby little one.

601
01:00:10,459 --> 01:00:12,719
Chubby, hmph?

602
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,870
You're so cute like this.

603
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,119
Can I kiss your tummy?

604
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:19,879
- No.
- Just a little.

605
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,660
Please?

606
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,439
Ah! Why did you bite me?

607
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,690
Well, it's unbearably cute.

608
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,940
♫ I don't dare to continue to dream like this ♫

609
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,800
This hurts.

610
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,919
♫ But you are my destiny ♫

611
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,580
- It was so fun.
- Hey, guys!

612
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,680
Calm down, Toh.

613
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,780
- What's with you?
- Jao.

614
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,859
You all must go to Suphanburi with me.

615
01:01:14,859 --> 01:01:16,959
- Suphan?
- Yeah.

616
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,840
Your hometown?

617
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,719
Yes.

618
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,139
- What's your house got to do with me?
- Right.

619
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:28,390
Well, I need more people to accompany me.

620
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,859
Why would you need a lot of people to go with you?

621
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,239
Right.

622
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,999
Is it that... you're taking P'Nuea with you too?

623
01:01:37,999 --> 01:01:39,673
Yes.

624
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,453
Why?

625
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,419
Toh, I wonder... if it's a good idea to take P'Nuea with you.

626
01:01:48,419 --> 01:01:51,739
I agree. Your father is really fierce.

627
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:55,559
He must be cleaning his rifle right now.

628
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,039
I know! That's why I want you all to come with me.

629
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,179
Please, Jao. Som.

630
01:02:01,179 --> 01:02:04,760
Don't plead with me. I'm not your hubby.

631
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,499
- I have work to do. I'm not going.
- Hey, wait!

632
01:02:09,499 --> 01:02:12,239
- What?
- One week of Shabu shabu.

633
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,020
- Don't want it.
- Me either.

634
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,060
Another week of grilled barbecue pork.

635
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,959
- No, no.
- Nope.

636
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,600
- I don't want to eat it. I'm still full.
- Right?

637
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,860
- Fine. Topped with bubble milk tea.
- Deal.

638
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,239
- You should have started with that.
- True. Why are we wasting time?

639
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,239
- Let's go.
- That's all. Come on.

640
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,059
We get everything. Barbecue pork, Shabu, and bubble milk tea.

641
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:42,239
You're also with them, huh? Jao?

642
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,499
- Let's go.
- It's fine. I can go with you.

643
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:47,320
Food. Yum, yum.

644
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,559
- What's the matter with him?
- - I don't know.

645
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,293
What happened?

646
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,440
- Is he okay?
- I have no idea.

647
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:06,519
- I don't think he's okay.
- Is he stressing out because of his dad?

648
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,199
- Guess so.
- Yes.

649
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,350
- He's so strict.
- Let me divert his attention.

650
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,479
Gosh! I'm rolling my eyes over here!

651
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,880
Why am I here? Everybody has a partner here!

652
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,479
So irritating!

653
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,599
But you still have me, Nong Som.

654
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:30,819
- Oh, wow.
- Tor, chill.

655
01:03:30,819 --> 01:03:33,799
P'Tor... gosh.

656
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:35,740
When did they talk to each other?

657
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,619
Hey.

658
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:48,640
- P'Nuea, hello.
- Hello.

659
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,233
Toh.

660
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,900
What's the matter?

661
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,720
Don't tell me you're stressed over meeting your family.

662
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,260
Are your parents that strict?

663
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:19,260
Well...

664
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,640
A little.

665
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,860
My mom is nice but...

666
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,950
my dad is strict about certain things

667
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,899
Maybe it will be easier if we switch roles.

668
01:04:34,899 --> 01:04:37,019
Would you like to be their daughter-in-law instead?

669
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:41,140
Maybe my dad won't be so fierce towards you.

670
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,859
- How ridiculous!
- That's impossible.

671
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:48,219
- How about it, Nuea?
- Don't even think about it.

672
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,090
- I thought I was going to be stressed.
- Hey...

673
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,740
Don't be stressed, okay?

674
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,440
I promise you I'll take one step at a time

675
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,300
to win your dad over.

676
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,140
And I sure won't give up.

677
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,340
That's my buddy.

678
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,399
Well...

679
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,420
- It's actually not about that, P'Nuea.
- Doesn't matter what it's about

680
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,699
I'll give it my all regardless.

681
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,320
P'Nuea, you're so sweet.

682
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,200
If you think so,

683
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,180
then let me...

684
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,259
Hey! You're practically sharing the same tongue already!

685
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,680
Let's go! Get in the car.

686
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,020
Why did you tease them?

687
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,959
- I'm jealous.
- It's not your tongue though.

688
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,439
P'Sky, you shouldn't have interrupted them.

689
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:23,690
- Yeah. I was filming them on my phone.
- I was enjoying it, you know?

690
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,053
Jao.

691
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,500
What about us?

692
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,399
We'd better go.

693
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,133
Let's go.

694
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:52,070
I didn't think we'd have so much fun even though our car broke down!

695
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,479
Here we are, Toh.

696
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,839
We've arrived.

697
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,700
Your house is nice.

698
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,639
- Go. Quick.
- Everyone, let's hurry up.

699
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,839
- Have you finally arrived?
- Let's go, everyone!

700
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,519
Come on, let's get down.

701
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,799
Let's go.

702
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,939
Quickly, everyone!

703
01:07:53,939 --> 01:07:55,679
I've been waiting for you all morning!

704
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,399
- Mom!
- Hello!

705
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,639
I missed you so much! There's so much stuff. Come!

706
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,119
Let me help you carry your stuff.

707
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,819
- It's okay, Mom, we can handle it.
- We'll do it, Mom.

708
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:08,219
Mom, this is for you.

709
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:10,100
- For me?
- Yes.

710
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:16,940
Oh, so handsome and so kind. Whose son-in-law is this?

711
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:23,920
Dad, why are you acting so tough? Come say hi. Your son is home.

712
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,700
Oh. You finally know your way home, my Lil pup!

713
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:49,579
Long time no see, Som, Daisy,
- Hello.

714
01:08:49,579 --> 01:08:52,320
- and Kaojao.
- Hello.

715
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,340
Who are all the rest?

716
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:00,339
- Oh, the one over there is P'Touch.
- Hello.

717
01:09:00,339 --> 01:09:02,719
- This here is P'Tor.
- Hello, sir.

718
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,680
- This is P'Sky.
- Hello.

719
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,320
And, this is P'Nuea.

720
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,170
Are they all your upperclassmen from the college?

721
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,139
Why are they all here?

722
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:16,519
Hey, they're all your son's friends.

723
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,419
Why do you have to throw so many questions at them?

724
01:09:18,419 --> 01:09:19,919
Can we talk later?

725
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,299
Come, kids. You must be tired. Let's go upstairs.

726
01:09:22,299 --> 01:09:26,119
I've turned on the air-con and prepared rooms for you. Come on. You must be exhausted.

727
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:28,359
- Let's go.
- Quick, quick.

728
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,359
- Let's go.
- Come come.

729
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:35,160
How are you, Som? You look prettier.

730
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,780
Hurry up.

731
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,190
Let's go.

732
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,830
I'll see you later.

Yes.

734
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,000

- Your father surely knows about us.
- Yes.

740
01:10:45,539 --> 01:10:48,439
