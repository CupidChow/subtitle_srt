Yes, sure.

Hey, Nong.

Please be careful.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,139
Sorry, Phi. He was a little careless.

are not the same person.

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,320
Toh, what's the matter?

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Why are you looking down?

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,633
Well, I...

35
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:25,400
I am sorry... for being so loud earlier.

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,440
So, about what you said earlier...

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,900
Is it true or not?

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,500
It's... true.

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,620
Didn't you say you like "P'Red"?

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,540
P'Nuea, you also said you like "Van Gogh".

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,560
Van Gogh is you.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,770
So...

43
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,620
Why am I Van Gogh?

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, before this...

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,900
I didn't know your name.

46
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,190
But I saw your face so often that I eventually remember you.

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,279
The kid with "Van" (Thai for glasses) that always seems "Goh" (Thai for clumsy)

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,380
should be named "Van Gogh" right?

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,420
Now...

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,880
Can you tell me about "P'Red"?

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,280
I think I should go shower.

52
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,500
Don't even try it.

53
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,050
Toh, everybody heard what you said already...

54
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,460
that you confessed to me.

55
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,960
If you're thinking of going back to "P'Red," it's too late.

56
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,860
You must be responsible for me.

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,180
P'Nuea.

58
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,900
So, who's P'Red?

59
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,980
Is it P'Touch?

60
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,920
No, it's not. It's not P'Touch.

61
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,800
P'Red is you, P'Nuea.

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,200
Red is me?

63
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,719
It's a nickname we used in our group to refer to you

64
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,320
so other people don't know who we were talking about.

65
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,073
And

66
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,320
why am I called Red?

67
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,540
Uh... well... um...

68
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,179
Red is an auspicious color.

69
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:53,799
And... when we put it together with your name,

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,360
it also makes your name auspicious.

71
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,473
That's it.

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,000

Yes?

77
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,360
This is for real, right?

78
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,420
Do you think

79
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,200

Just look at him.

00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,539
Normally he's already an oddball,

109
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,579
but now that he's got a lover, it's worse.

110

Oh right, do you think his man knows he's like this?

I saw it, you know.

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,380
You and P'Sky spent a lot of time playing in the waterfall.

120
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,860
I thought you would swim out through the Gulf of Thailand.

121
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,860
- Som!
- Stop!

122
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,820
You're so nosy. Putting your nose everywhere.

Right now, we must congratulate Toh!

124

- Hey, Toh!
- Toh!

125
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,319
One, two... Toh!

126
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,439
Huh? Huh? What?

127
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,539
- What do you mean by "What?"
- Right.

128
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,779
Have you lost your mind already?

129
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,539
It hasn't been a day since you started dating P'Nuea.

130
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:14,180
Jao! You're harsher than they were.

131
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,879
- Agree.
- Yeah.
- Huh?

132
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,979
I'll be back. Give me a moment.

133
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,779
- Where are you going?
- To the waterfall!

134
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,999
- What for?
- To get some of the water!

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,859
Damn it, Toh.

136
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,779
But it's the confession water of P'Nuea and I.

137
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,979
I want it as a keepsake.

138
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,339
Toh!

139
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,019
I think the water stream has probably flowed up to China by now.

140
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:43,739
I think collecting the stones, soil, and sand would be more practical.

141
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:46,339
Right! I'll go get the soil then.

142
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,260
- Toh!
- We're being sarcastic!

143
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,079
Toh! You're already dating P'Nuea.

144
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,079
I think you should stop collecting these things.

145
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,639
Agree. I think you should collect couple's photos or movie tickets

146
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,339
like how other normal people do it.

147
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,419
That's right!

148
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,539
- If P'Nuea saw your room, he would be shocked to death.
- Right!

149
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I know! But I don't want to throw away the items I've collected.

150
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,079
Every piece has its meaning in my heart.

151
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,820
They're like the best memories of my life.

152
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,973
Toh.

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,399
- Hey guys.
- Hm?

154
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,100
My lover is calling me.

155
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,359
You should be careful.

156
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,740
I think right now,

157
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,260
your fortune is going to run out.

158
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:21,320
You might trip over your own feet and die, you know?

159
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,380
- Let's go, y'all.
- Yeah, let's go.

160
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,020
Bye, P'Nuea!

161
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,579
- Hey.
- Hm?

162
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:43,480
I need to pee. Come with me!

163
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,899
Yeah, fine. Let's go.

164
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,219
- Hold on.
- What?

165
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,179
I'll put my stuff back in the room.

166
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:54,319
Fine, just go! I can't hold it any longer!

167
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,053
Quickly!

168
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,060
Do you want to go get some ice cream with me?

169
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,039
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,840
♫ That made me realize ♫

171
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,419
Walk faster. I need to pee really badly.

172
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:28,879
Gosh! If you wanted to pee so bad why didn't you go in the bushes over there?

173
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,199
You're a guy. Just go for it.

174
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,699
Hey! I'm a lady. How could I do it in the bush?

175
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:36,099
Sure. Very ladylike.

176
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:40,119
Right over there. The men's restroom, go.

177
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,619
Yeah. Wait for me right here. Do not go anywhere.

178
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,999
No. I have to pee too.

179
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,119
Let's meet again right here.

180
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,260
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ugh!
- I'm off.

181
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,939
Inside the restroom! Inside the restroom!

182
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:16,320
- It's in the restroom! A Gecko!
- Daisy.

183
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,873
P'Touch?

184
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,580
Please... wait here. I'll have a look for you.

185
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,313
Okay.

186
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,520
The light's back on.

187
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,350
It's all right now.

188
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,820
The restroom is a bit rundown.

189
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,439
I'm truly sorry, P'Touch.
(T/N: Daisy is using "nhu" as a pronoun which is normally used by girls)

190
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,100
If I went into the bush instead,

191
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,430
you wouldn't have to go through the trouble like this.

192
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,039
It's not troubling for me.

193
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,500
It's part of my duty.

194
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,939
I think I'd feel troubled if I made you feel uneasy in the camp instead.

195
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,840
Then... if you need anything else, you may tell me anytime.

196
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,659
Oh, okay.

197
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:36,020
Thank you.

198
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,820
Okay.

199
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,493
All right.

200
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,540
Yes.

201
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,519
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

202
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,519
I heard a loud scream. Whose voice was that?

203
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,199
I was going to use the restroom just now,

204
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,439
but the lights suddenly turned off

205
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:57,519
- and I saw a gecko! It's so scary!
- Really?!

206
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,279
I'm still having chills.

207
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,330
Hey, Daisy, Daisy!

208
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,580
You...

209
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,920
Why are your pants wet, Daisy?

210
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,339
- What?
- I'm so doomed!

211
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,239
My life has fallen apart!

212
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,360
Huh, why?

213
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,360
What's the matter with you?

214
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,690
I'd better leave. So scary.

215
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,360
Watch your steps, Toh.

216
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,533
Hey.

217
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,560
What's wrong, Toh?

218
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,159
Well, I'm afraid I'll trip over.

219
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,119
Som told me that if we're too lucky,

220
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,980
our good fortunes on other matters will run out.

221
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,280
Don't walk, then.

222
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,670
Come here. Let me help you.

223
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,453
Here.

224
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,773
Have a seat.

225
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,020
Sure.

226
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:47,959
- What is that?
- Right here. My popsicle fell just now.

227
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,879
Yeah.

228
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,980
Sit. Sit down, please.

229
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,919
Let's eat it quickly.

230
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,280
O-okay.

231
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,460
It's really cold.

232
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,590
Let me have some.

233
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,573
Here.

234
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,739
Let me throw away the stick.

235
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,160
I'll take care of it.

236
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,279
You fed me just now.

237
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,080
Okay?

238
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,799
It's freezing cold, right?

239
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,880
Yes.

240
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,660
Look at the stars.

241
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,400
So beautiful.

242
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:39,760
That one is also nice.

243
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,770
Not sure if it's because I'm watching them with you.

244
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,840
P'Nuea.

245
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,340
That's kind of lame.

246
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,600
Why do you enjoy taking photos, Toh?

247
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,220
Maybe it's because...

248
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,800
I like to preserve memories.

249
00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:00,100
I feel that something... about today is so great,

250
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,180
but tomorrow it might change.

251
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,240
And also,

252
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,840
I think that nothing lasts forever.

253
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,780
But at least I can have those good moments with me.

254
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,980
When you take my photos...

255
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,300
do you think this way as well?

256
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,933
Yes.

257
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,839
T-take... what?

258
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:55,500
T-there aren't any.

259
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,950
How many have you taken so far?

260
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,159
Hey.

261
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,060
I saw it.

262
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,759
You like to carry around your camera taking pictures of me at university events.

263
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,279
P'Nuea!

264
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,380
So how many photos have you taken already?

265
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:33,253
Hey!

266
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:36,099
You're too much.

267
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:38,880
It's not like that.

268
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,240
This is the reason why you won't let me go to your room, right?

269
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,920
Or maybe...

270
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,920
you use my pictures when you...

271
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,420
That's perverted, P'Nuea!

272
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Hey. Toh.

273
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,670
Let me ask you.

274
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,400
Why have you never come and asked me for a photo?

275
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,840
Back then...

276
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,200
I thought it was more than enough to look at you from a distance.

277
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,880
But... I'm not like you.

278
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,660
If I love someone...

279
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,800
I want to be close to them instead.

280
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,380
P'Nuea.

281
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,410
- I look so bad right now.
- You look quite natural.

282
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,993
Check it out.

283
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,000
What do you mean by natural? I look so ugly.

284
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,180
Keep it, Toh.

285
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,890
So that we know we started dating here.

286
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,280
Maybe we can come back here to celebrate our anniversary next year.

287
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,140
We... have an anniversary?

288
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,373
Of course.

289
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,870
If you're not going anywhere.

290
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,800
Of c-course not.

291
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,780
But I think we should head back now.

292
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,933
Let's go.

293
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,073
Okay, let's go.

294
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,619
Hm? Is there something wrong, Toh?

295
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:34,700
This here.

296
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,780
It's ripped.

297
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
It tore?

298
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,339
♫ But you are my destiny ♫

299
00:25:54,339 --> 00:26:05,440
♫ I will keep every moment with you within my heart ♫

300
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,159
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

301
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,859
♫ That makes my whole heart ♫

302
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:19,880
♫ Feel love since the day you came ♫

303
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,619
I think P'Touch just smiled at you.

304
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,559
Are you crazy, Jao?

305
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,919
Maybe he smiled at Som?

306
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,119
- Really?
- Yeah

307
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:52,519
He didn't smile at me. He smiled at you because your bold act last night is still fresh.

308
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,060
Som! Shut the hell up!

309
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,519
- Nong Som!
- Yes?

310
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,080
Do you need any help from me today?

311
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,399
Do we?

312
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,619
Is there anything we need?

313
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:10,639
Hey, Ai Nuea's lover.

314
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:14,139
Do you need us to help with anything?

315
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:16,380
P'Nuea!

316
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,819
No... No, I'm good.

317
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:22,639
And... what about Ai Sky's future lover?

318
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:26,079
- Oh wow!
- Khongkwan.

319
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,219
P'Kwan, we've finished painting.

320
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:31,159
We just have to put them back to their places.

321
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,359
You can help us move the tables though.

322
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,439
- Sure.
- Okay.

323
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,399
All right. Lift the table like this?
(T/N: Toh's name means table)

324
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,539
P'Nuea! Calm down. There are kids present.

325
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:45,760
- Have a seat, P'Nuea.
- Sit sit.

326
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,439
Since there's table (Toh) lifting, won't we have to lift Jao as well?

327
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,139
Hold it right there!

328
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,719
I guess there isn't.

329

00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,110
Are you not eating?

494
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,559
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

495
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,093
Oh?

496
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,673
That's right!

497
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,460
I put it on silent mode, Toh.

498
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm sorry.

499
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,959
- I'm sorry.
- No.

500
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,700
Toh...

501
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,813
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,680
I'm sorry, all right?

503
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,940
I'm sorry, okay?

504
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,000
I know already.

505
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,820
Did I make you worry?

506
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,893
No.

507
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,460
I trust you, P'Nuea.

508
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,859
But if one day you'll really leave,

509
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:20,079
I'd like you to tell me first.

510
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,930
- I can accept the truth...
- Stop it now!

511
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,660
Who says you can talk about breaking up soon after we just dated?

512
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,353
Toh.

513
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,020
I have chosen you.

514
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,940
How can I break up with you?

515
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,890
Even if you want to break up with me,

516
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,580
I won't.

517
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,640
And you too.

518
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,300
Be more possessive of me. Do you understand?

519
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,760
I understand.

520
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,740
Come. Let's continue eating.

521
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,540
This is in place of my apology.

522
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:58,380
This is what you call, "in place of an apology."

523
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,960
Since you're skinny,

524
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,840
I want to take you to do some intense exercise.

525
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,700
But I'm not ready, P'Nuea.

526
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,840
And I'm not rushing you.

527
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,030
I'm giving you time to prepare.

528
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,700
I think Friday should be fine!

529
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,520
You're kind of fast, aren't you?

530
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,380
I'll...

531
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,040
get myself prepared.

532
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,673
Bring it on.

533
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,860
I'll give you a full course.

534
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,553
All right!

535
00:45:53,553 --> 00:45:57,780
Just four more days. Whatever happens, happens.

536
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,100
Go for it, Ai Toh!

537
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,733
Toh!

538
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,930
What's the matter with you?

539
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,173
Oh...

540
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,533
Right.

541
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,259
I'm... the one that loves you.

542
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,300
Give me your hand.

543
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,719
Why?

544
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,770
Just give it to me. I won't prank you.

545
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,780
What is it?

546
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,960
Please take care

547
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,260

I don't think we will work out.

553
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:19,439
Let me ask you seriously, Jao.

554
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:21,919
Is there anything that still makes you doubt me?

555
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,619
I'm just a lost puppy that's waiting for your love right now, Jao.
