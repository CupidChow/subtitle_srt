2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,639
Present how things went last night!

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,199
How did you get that kind of photo?

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,959
P'Nuea did the right thing.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,199
Who would want to kiss a person they met for the first time?

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,619
- Get in the car.
- What for?

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,479
I'm supposed to pursue you for a week. Did you forget that?

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,759
I'm calling to ask when the photos will be ready.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,279
I finished editing them.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,799
Then let me see the photos first. At your dorm, okay?

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,959
- Where did you say, Toh?
- Well, my dorm room.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,820
Don't you remember what you have inside your room?

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,780
Shit!

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,799
Ai Toh, you really are something.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,319
You dare to invite him to your room, which is full of his pictures

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,119
and all the stuff related to him?

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,639
Right! Why didn't you schedule to meet somewhere else?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,439
- Yes.
- Like a coffee shop or wherever.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,719
Yes.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,319
I didn't think of anything on time at the moment.

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,559
It's all right.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,239
Since you already agreed to meet P'Nuea,

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,539
we have to help him, no matter what, okay?

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,119
Come on.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,180
Let's go!

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,400
Yay!

27
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,819
Finally, it's done.

28
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,999
- You guys.
- What?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,539
Thanks a lot for today.

30
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,119
I think you guys have to get going now.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,019
P'Red is going to be here soon.

32
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,120
Toh!

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,120
I'll treat you guys to five weeks of Grilled BBQ pork.

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,139
Are you bribing us?

35
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,460
It seems familiar, don't you think?

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,299
- No comment from me.
- Such a bully.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,479
- Get out!
- Huh? What?

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,820
- Let's go. Let's leave.
- Fine, we'll leave!

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,760
[Nuea: I'm already here. Come downstairs for me.]

40
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,920
Hello.

41
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,419
Were you doing a track race?

42
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,699
N-No.

43
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,100
I rushed down to come and greet you.

44
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,300
Here.

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,060
I bought this for you.

46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,380
Oh, who did you buy it for, P'Nuea?

47
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,500
I bought it for you, little one.

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,280
Actually, P'Nuea...

49
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,960
Thank you.

50
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,380
Where's your room?

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,980
I'll lead the way.

52
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,600
Yes.

53
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,120
Yes! Yes!

54
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,300
Why does your room look so tidy?

56
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,320
That way, please. The computer is over there.

57
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,660
Toh, what are you doing?

58
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,500
Nothing.

59
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,300
The computer is over there. Over there, please.

60
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,740
Let me pull the chair for you.

61
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,080
- Um, thanks.
- My pleasure.

62
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,760
- Do you hear anything?
- I can't hear anything.

63
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,720
Hey, now!

64
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,420
- What was that!?
- Don't know.

65
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,059
Toh! What are you doing?

66
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,679
Why does P'Nuea sound angry?

67
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,419
- Jao!
- Hm?

68
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,919
He only said "Hey, Toh!"

69
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,000
You're exaggerating like Ai Toh.

70
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,200
Toh, what are you doing?

71
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,740
Well...

72
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
- Well... Well...
- Hey!

73
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,040
I'm so exhausted, P'Nuea.

74
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,880
But.. I feel better now.

75
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,119
- You've recovered already?
- Yes. My body is just a bit rigid.

76
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,540
Toh.

77
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,300
The choux creams taste the best when you eat them right away.

78
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,839
Here. I'll open them for you.

79
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,080
Opening them? Such a waste...

80
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,319
I'll open them up myself.

81
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,880
- I'll do it for you.
- It's totally fine!

82
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,220
I'll put them away myself.

83
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,380
The p-photos are in there. You may take a look.

84
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,959
- Do you hear anything?
- I don't.

85
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960
- Why is it so quiet?
- Yeah.

86
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,660
I almost died.

87
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,620
Toh!

88
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
Toh.

89
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Which folder are the photos in?

90
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,380
In that folder right there.

91
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,040
What?

92
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,580
It's in the folder titled, "Nong Lan's Birthday"

93
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,520
What are you saying?

94
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,159
I am telling you that...

95
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,519
the photos are in the folder titled "Nong Lan's Birthday".

96
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,819
The photos... are in ... the birthday folder?

97
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:02,539
The photos are in the folder titled, "|Nong Lan's Birthday".

98
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:07,699
- Oh in, "Nong Lan's Birthday".
- Yes!

99
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,500
That's all it was.

100
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
No.

101
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,880
Is this rotten? Ew.

102
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,239
Toh!

103
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,359
If you're opening it slowly, when will you get to eat it?

104
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,819
Oh, I'm looking for a plate.

105
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,300
Here it is. Found it.

106
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,819
Jao! It's heavy.
[Sky: Hi, cutie.]

107
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:02,439
You hear anything at all, Som?
[Jao : I'm busy right now. Also, my name is Jao]

108
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,460
I don't.

109
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,539
- Toh!
- Yes?

110
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,079
Are you done yet?

111
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,980
Almost. Just a second.

112
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,559
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

113
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
You seem to be sweltering.

114
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,480
Oh. Yes, a little.

115
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,840
Toh.

116
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,859
- Y-Yes?
- What are you doing?

117
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:21,819
I'm looking for something in here.

118
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:23,719
Hurry up so you can help me choose the photos.

119
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,220
Okay.

120
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,800
It doesn't look pretty at all.

121
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,320
[Line: new message]

122
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,099
I picked up some trash.

123
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:03,499
I noticed it was kind of messy so I quickly got rid of it.

124
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,540
Are you all right, Toh?

125
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,680
You've been fidgeting since a while ago

126
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,620
P'Nuea, you're using a phone case with Van Gogh's painting?

127
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,680
Well, I'm kind of interested.

128
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,620
Oh, I see.

129
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,960
This photo looks nice, Toh.

130
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
I like it.

131
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:01,400
Sure. I'll put it in the frame for you.

132
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,240
Nong Lan's name comes from the Similan Islands, right?

133
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,619
That's right.

134
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:21,219
Does this mean you gave her the picture of the Similan Islands because you knew?

135
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:25,399
Yes. Nong Lan's name came from Similan.

136
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,679
As for your name, Nuea, it came from Nimman road.

137
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,860
I think both have beautiful meanings.

138
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,840
Why does it...

139
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,320
seem like you know so much about me?

140
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,980
Well...

141
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,659
since you're the star of the campus,

142
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,820
of course, I've seen the information...

143
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,860
from the University bulletin.

144
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,640
I see.

145
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,440
Anyway...

146
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,200
how can you stay in this room?

147
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,820
It's hot in here. Don't you have an AC?

148
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,679
I don't have one.

149
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,800
Then let me take off my shirt for a bit.

150
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,360
Toh!

151
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,220
Has your nose stopped bleeding yet?

152
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,380
Oh... yes, it has.

153
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,740
It was just...

154
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,959
Was just?

155
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,599
Sweltering hot.

156
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,000
The temperature is a bit hot.

157
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,339
Hey, Toh. I think the photos are very good.

158
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,320
I think Nong Lan will like them.

159
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,720
Thank you.

160
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
Sure.

161
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,660
And...

162
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,880
Where's the choux cream box?

163
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,859
I threw it in the garbage bin already.

164
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:57,459
I think... I did.

165
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:00,779
Ah, too bad. I was going to do it for you.

166
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,320
Ah, that's fine. It's all handled.

167
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,740
Fine.

168
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,640
Wait.

169
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,040
Here.

170
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,040
Your payment. Take it.

171
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,320
Take it.

172
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,300
Ah. Yes.

173
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,119
I think... I think it's way too much, P'Nuea.

174
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,920
I won't accept it.

175
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,900
It's all right, Toh. I want to give it to you.

176
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,160
Share it with Kaojao too.

177
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,680
And take your friends out for grilled BBQ pork.

178
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,220
Here.

179
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,520
Yes, yes. Thank you.

180
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,800
I'm sorry.

181
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm heading off, then.

182
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,920
- Drive safely.
- Thank you.

183
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,680
Who's sending me texts now?

184
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,240
[Nuea: Look inside the envelope. Come if you have time.]

185
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Shit!

186
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,500
Toh!

187
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,280
Are you all right?

188
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,580
What did P'Nuea do to you?

189
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,760
Are you all right?

190
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,980
P'Nuea invited me to go see, "Love is in The Air."

191
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,170
[St. Stephen]

192
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,940
Let's go.

193
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,900
Hey, wait.

194
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,500
Jao, wait!

195
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,920
Donations are welcome.

196
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,100
Come everyone. Jao and Som, follow me.

197
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,459
The Engineering faculty is my turf!

198
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,499
Come here, come here. Come!

199
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:44,399
Flowers! The roses!

200
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:47,099
- Hello.
- Hello.

201
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:48,319
- How much is it for a bouquet?
- 50 baht.

202
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,719
50 baht? We'll take...

203
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,619
- Four.
- Four of them, please.

204
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,419
200 baht? Okay.

205
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,719
This is yours.

206
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,279
This is yours.

207
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,179
Hold on to it!

208
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:02,900
- This is yours.
- Okay

209
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,039
It's so pretty. Thank you. Thank you.

210
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,219
Hey, you there!

211
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:10,919
Have you received any roses today?

212
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,519
Oh, not yet.

213
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,859
I just bought these roses.

214
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,819
I'm giving them all to you.

215
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,639
Take them. Take them.

216
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:21,580
Goodbye.

217
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,699
Are you crazy?

218
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,499
It's a loss if that's what you're going to do!

219
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,779
Follow me now. Follow my lead.

220
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,759
What? How?

221
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,100
You have to give one stem at a time.

222
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,819
Toh, the concert is about to begin.

223
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:45,580
- Is your camera ready?
- Yes!

224
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,060
Please let us through. Please let us through!

225
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,320
Hurry. Quick!

226
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,999
Oh my gosh! So handsome!

227
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,039
Hello everyone! I am Thep!

228
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,319
I welcome you all to the young ladies' and gents' events of the Engineering faculty

229
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,579
for the concert tonight.

230
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:13,879
Today we have a special show from the handsome seniors of the Engineering faculty.

231
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,919
Here, we have Nuea!

232
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,520
All right!

233
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,100
All right! How are you all doing?

234
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,340
Okay!

235
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,079
Let me ask Nuea,

236
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,979
what kind of special show did you prepare?

237
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:32,819
I'm delighted to be here today.

238
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,619
We've prepared a few performances,

239
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,739
but I didn't come alone.

240
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:41,159
I have my squad here. Let's welcome them onto the stage

241
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,480
Yes. Give it up for Sky, Khongkwan, and Tor.

242
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
Excellent!

243
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,999
Let's move a bit. Move a bit.

244
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,539
Dude, they all look so handsome!

245
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,979
Okay. I believe the Grilled BBQ pork squad is ready.

246
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,819
- Are you all ready?
- Yes, we are.

247
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,659
- Is everyone ready?
- We are!

248
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:07,480
If you are, I'm handing this stage to the Grilled BBQ pork squad now.

249
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,540
P'Nuea is about to sing now.

250
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,539
You're smiling, Jao.

251
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,520
You were just saying, "I'm not going. I'm not going."

252
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,899
Hello, everyone.

253
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:26,420
Well, today...

254
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:32,320
I have a song... that I want to dedicate to someone.

255
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,300
And that person is also here with us today.

256
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,219
Wow, is it you?

257
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:46,020
You're awesome!

258
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:59,740
I have a song... that I want to dedicate to someone.

259
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,540
And that person is also here with us today.

260
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,599
Wow, is it you?

261
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,420
You're awesome!

262
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,299
Toh!

263
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,899
He waved at you.

264
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,119

Jao, Som, let's go!

320
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,360
Make way, please.

321
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,399
Please make some noise for the BBQ pork squad one more time!

322
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,519
I have to say this squad has never let us down once.

323
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,599
Khun Nuea, how do you feel about the performance just now?

324
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:19,880
Well, I hope the song that I sang could make everyone here happy.

325
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,239
Toh!

326
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,780
- Toh!
- Toh.

327
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,399
Toh!

328
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,040
Toh, come this way first.

329
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,639
Toh, are you okay?

330
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,779
We're not used to seeing you this way.

331
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:43,199
We're worried about you.

332
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,280
Yes. I'm worried as well.

333
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,860
That's right. Don't think too much, Toh.

334
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,719
Actually, you guys can go back inside for the concert.

335
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,839
I don't want to spoil your fun. Okay?

336
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,179
- It's fine.
- That's right.

337
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,079
- It's perfectly fine.
- Yeah.

338
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:12,000
The event is sucks! What's so fun about it?

339
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,239
- Hey.
- Huh?

340
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,159
Before you say it's horrible, go sip some lemonade.

341
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,000
You screamed like a damn whistle.

342
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,140
Huh?

343
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,100
It'll be okay, Toh.

344
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,620
It's the rules of someone who has a secret crush, Toh.

345
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,300
It's got to hurt sometimes.

346
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,980
You'll be all right.

347
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,719
It's totally fine. I'm all right.

348
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm just a bit upset.

349
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,819
When I think about it,

350
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:14,400
I got to know him nowadays and greet him.

351
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,440
It's already more than enough.

352
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,420
Did you know...

353
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,699
It's so much that, I mistook my own importance.

354
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:34,039
I have forgotten my place.

355
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,680
The place that I belong is right here. Behind the camera lens.

356
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,100
It's all right.

357
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,500
Three...

358
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,980
Equals to four.

359
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,640
Wherever three goes...

360
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,020
Four goes as well.

361
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,100
Thank you, guys, so much.

362
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,220
If I didn't have you guys, I don't know who would comfort me.

363
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,080
[Toh. Where are you?]

364
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,139
What are you stressed about, Nuea my friend?

365
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:32,799
Are you frustrated that Nong Van Gogh left early

366
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,319
and he didn't come to see you,

367
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,479
or that he didn't reply to your text?

368
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,200
I saw him briefly just now. Where did he go?

369
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,680
I have no clue.

370
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,679
Didn't say anything when he came. Didn't say anything when he left.

371
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,700
Look. He doesn't read my LINE messages.

372
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,920
I still have no idea why he left like that.

373
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,819
Silly Van Gogh.

374
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:10,140
Oh, Ai Nuea, I meant to ask you this so many times,

375
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,480
Why do you call Nong Toh "Van Gogh"?

376
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,000
Well, because he wears glasses,
(T/N: "Van" and "glasses" in Thai, have the same pronunciation)

377
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,420
and he's goofy.
(T/N: "Gogh" and "goofy" in Thai have the same pronunciation)

378
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,080
Sometimes he acts suspicious.

379
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,839
He hung a bag of tangerines on my car's side mirror.

380
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,859
- How did he think of that?
- And you were so mean!

381
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:35,959
You knew it was from him. Yet, you threw it away in front of him.

382
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,579
Ai Sky,

383
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:41,200
I just wanted to make sure that it was actually him.

384
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,260
Anyhow, it was such a waste to throw away that bag.

385
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,240
How did he know I like tangerines?

386
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,059
Next time, stop making a stern face and try smiling for him.

387
00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:02,139
Ai Sky, you don't know anything. I smile at him all the time.

388
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:05,419
He's the one who keeps exclaiming, "shit" at me every time we meet.

389
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,500
I'm so damn confused.

390
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,899
Well... P'Nuea and P'Sky.

391
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,900
I have a flower delivery for you guys.

392
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,860
Can you take them back with you? My car is already full.

393
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,079
Ai Nuea.

394
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,359
What?

395
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,060
It's Nong Daisy.

396
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,160
Yes, Nong?

397
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,399
Someone wanted to send you flowers, P'Nuea.

398
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,940
These are for P'Nuea.

399
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,759
- And, these are for you, P'Sky.
- Thank you.

400
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,199
- I really liked today's event.
- Thank you.

401
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,139
- I'm leaving, then.
- Get home safe, Daisey.

402
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:53,780
Bye-bye.

403
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,980
Huh?

404
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,820
Shit!

405
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,759
P'Nuea! P'Nuea!

406
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,520
P'Nuea.

407
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,660
Let me ask honestly, do you remember my name?

408
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,020
You keep calling me "Shit" every time we meet.

409
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,980
I'm sorry. Well...

410
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,560
You like to suddenly show up out of nowhere.

411
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,260
So, of course, I'm startled.

412
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Here.

413
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,720
I dropped by to return your flash drive.

414
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,760
Actually...

415
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,820
you didn't have to rush to give it back.

416
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,299
I don't need to use it anytime soon

417
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,380
I thought I saw you earlier.

418
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,440
You went to the concert, right?

419
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,900
Then, why did you leave early?

420
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
Was it not fun?

421
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,280
It was fun, but...

422
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,140
Jao...

423
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,899
Jao felt a bit unwell.

424
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:37,880
So, I had to take him back first.

425
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,460
I'm so sorry.

426
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,820
What if I say... I won't forgive you?

427
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,780
What must I do to be forgiven, then?

428
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,120
It's not that difficult.

429
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,900
But would you be able to do it?

430
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,100
P'Nuea!

431
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,620
Here. Drink up.

432
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,279
Take it.

433
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:15,200
Thank you.

434
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:28,200
So... Have you forgiven me yet?

435
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,200
I have about halfway.

436
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,059
Then, what should I do...

437
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,650
P'Nuea?

438
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,300
I'm here.

439
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,260
Come here.

440
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,680
If you take all these flowers,

441
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,940
I'll forgive you.

442
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,900
But...

443
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:21,960
Aren't you afraid the people who gave you all these roses will be upset?

444
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,259
Toh, I can't keep all the flowers everyone gives to me.

445
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,840
But if you ask me

446
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,420
if there's a person I want to receive the flowers from...
