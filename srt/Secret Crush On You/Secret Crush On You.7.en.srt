You just came to the beach but didn't get any action.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,339
It's totally okay, yeah?

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,299
Do you still remember that I didn't do it for free?

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,540
Let me know if you want anything.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,900
I told you I didn't want payment in money.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,310
Please come to the camp with me.

- Hello.

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,059
I want to sleep with you.

11
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,479
I don't want the person I like to misunderstand me.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,939
He's totally head over heels for that Van Gogh person.

13
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,899
Ah! I'm sorry, Toh.

14
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,390
This is already worth it.

What is it?

36
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,959
We're out of paint.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,519
Ai Toh!

38
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,510
We're out of paint.

All right, don't fight.

00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,760
I'll contact the senior through the walkie-talkie.

Hey.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,219
Do you even know how to use it?

00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,439
Jao, hand it over to me.

Here.

46
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,340
Excuse me. We're running out of paint in the Third Grade classroom.

How many tins do you need?

That's P'Touch's voice.

- Let's go with two.
- All right.

51
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:57,719
Two tins, please.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,979
Then, go and wait for me at the front of the school. I'll take you to the store.

Why did you use the walkie-talkie?

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,860
Are we not allowed to use it?

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,299
Oh! Is it because it uses up the batteries?

I am sorry.

69

so you should tell me if you need anything.

70

Here, get up.

100

- Why can't I tell them?
- Don't say anything.

Don't bother us if you don't have a clue.

102
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:20,559
Hey, do you guys hear something... like crows squawking?

103
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,100
It sounds like those lonely spirits asking for a blessing.

104
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,519
I don't want to listen to it. Check out my nails though.

105
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,419
I don't think these people have any clue.

106
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,140
They are only good at manual labor.

107
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,719
Hey, that's too harsh!

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,939
Right? Isn't that too much?

109
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,239
If you're going to say that, let's just fight!

110
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,390
- Bring it on.
- Yeah, come at me.

111
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,000
Why?

112
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,659
Hi, P'Sky.

113
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:55,620
P'Sky, I would like one of those popsicles you got there.

114
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,680
Thank you!

115
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,019
Is it sweltering? I brought you guys some popsicles.

116
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,719
Oh, thanks so much, P'Sky.

117
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,139
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

118
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,419
- We got some popsicles from P'Sky...
- P'Sky!

119
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,799
Why did you bring them some popsicles?

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,839
They have legs. Let them go get it themselves.

121
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,620
True that.

122
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,000
How can I ever do that?

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,260
I'm pursuing him.

124
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,060
I suddenly feel like a winner.

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,540
Who are you pursuing?

126
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,879
Don't tell me it's this scholarship recipient!

127
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,179
Hey! This girl!

128
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:49,199
- Isn't that too harsh!?
- Right! That's too much.

129
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,940
Or... is it this bitch?

130
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,039
You bimbo!

131
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,839
But I don't think it's this fatty here.

132
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,719
- How can you say that?
- Girl, calm down.

133
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,960
Do you want to fight?

134
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,460
Nong Peach, everyone has a name.

135
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,720
This is Nong Daisy. This is Nong Som.

136
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,260
This person here is someone I'm pursuing. His name is Nong Kaojao.

137
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,390
What are you looking at?

138
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm not joking.

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,999
I pursue someone with a nice heart.

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,199
This type of matter isn't measured by someone's body shape.

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,159
Because no matter how slender they are,

142
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,539
if their personality is terrible, I can never like them.

143
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,059
He won't like...

144
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,260
P'Prao, he's talking about you.

145
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,599
You better realize it.

146
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,700
Peach!

147
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,119
- Damnit! Let's go!
- Bye-bye!

148
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,359
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,879
Make sure you finish them.

150
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,199
- I'll come back after I finish my duty.
- Sure.

151
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,099
Don't go out in the sun or in bad weather.

152
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,379
If you need anything, let me know. Okay?

153
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,839
Absolutely. Thank you, P'Sky.

154
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,540
Understand?

155
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,680
P'Sky.

156
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,910
Thank you.

157
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,959
I'll head back to work then.

158
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,739
- See you later.
- Yes. Thank you. Bye bye.

159
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,100
He's quite a charmer, that one there.

160
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,720
Have you softened your heart towards him yet?

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,640
Nosy! Get back to work.

162
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,319
- Wait a sec.
- What?

163
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,279
What about this one?

164
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,319
What's happened to her?

165
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,240
- Hey.
- Hey.

166
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,559
- Let's go.
- Yeah, go.

167
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,400
That's kind of crazy.

168
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,870
[If your lover doesn't love you, just text me on Facebook anytime]

169
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm back.

170
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,219
Come on. Let's go.

171

172
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,190
Aren't you getting off?

173
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,280
Oh, yes. I will.

174
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,473
Well...

175
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,919
- Are you all right, Toh?
- I'm okay, but...

176
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,339
Are you okay, P'Nuea?

177
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,359
I'm all right. I'm okay.

I can help you take a look at it.

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,379
It's all right.

181
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,239
I'll take care of it.

182
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,319
I'm truly sorry.

183
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,560
If you need my help with anything, please let me know.

♫ Oh my love... ♫

185
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,120
Anyway. Aren't you using only two tins?

186
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,420
Why did you buy three?

187
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,159
Well, these two are to be used here. The other one is for me to keep.

188
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,879
What?

189
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,780
Why would you keep it?

190
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,739
I... I mean... as a spare one.

191
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:41,460
In.. in... case we need it, we won't have to bother you.

192
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,160
Toh. I don't mind.

193
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,990
You can always bother me.

194
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,340
But I must be the only person you bother.

195
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,593
Do you get it?

196
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,040
I get it.

197
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,490
What are you doing?

198
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,740
Let me have a look.

"If your lover doesn't love you, just text me on Facebook anytime."

200

Yeah.

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,799
You like these kinds of things?

202
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,560
Well, just a little.

203
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,999
Then, can I have it?

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,220
Ah! Maybe next time, P'Nuea.

205
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,199
Next time, please.

206
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,660
Excuse me.

207
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,120
I can't even have it.

208
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,560
Are you still hurt?

209
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,199
Well, a little.

210
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,121
Hey, Nuea, my buddy.

211
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:06,819
- Dude, we're going to bathe at the river. Want to come?
- Sure, yes.

212
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:09,160
- See ya.
- Yeah.

213
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,520
- Right, Toh.
- Yes?

214
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,879
Do you want to join me at the waterfall?

215
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,499
Want to go?

216
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:20,620
Yes! I want to.

217
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,833
Let's go, then.

218
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,440
Hey, guys! Do you need any help?

219
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,879
Toh. I'll meet you at the waterfall, all right?

220
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,279
I'll be right back.

221
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,199
Okay.

222
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,039
Come. Let me help. It's fine.

223
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,620
Where should we put it?

224
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,433
Okay.

225
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,373
Hurry up. Woohoo!

226
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,820
Jao!

227
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,213
Jao.

228
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,179
Jao, let's go play in the water. Hurry.

229
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:24,839
Toh, what are you doing?

230
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,759
- Going into the water, of course.
- No.

231
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,293
Toh!

232
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,750
What are you doing?

233
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,619
Taking off my clothes to get in the water!

234
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,059
Toh!

235
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,980
I think you and Kaojao should go bathe further up the river.

236
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,559
But why?

237
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,199
You told me to come here.

238
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,620
- Toh!
- Toh, come join us here.

239
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,459
The water is so cool.

240
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:50,999
Yes! Okay, I'm going!

241
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,219
Toh!

242
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,860
Hey! Nong! Nong!

243
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,673
Hey, Nuea.

244
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,519
- Are you okay?
- Hey, Nong...

245
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,500
Please be careful.

246
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,500
Sorry, Phi. He was a little careless.

247
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,999
Toh.

248
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Are you okay?

249
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm fine.

250
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,020
Thank you so much, P'Touch.

251
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,939
- It's great that you're fine.
- Toh!

252
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,160
I told you to bathe further up the river.

253
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,680
- Why? I've just arrived...
- Toh.

254
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,599
I said to go bathe further up the river.

255
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,660
All right.

256
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,840
- Hey, Ai Sky.
- Huh? Yeah.

257
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,640
Please excuse me.

258
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,990
I'm fine.

259
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,999
Let's go.

260
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,319
Quickly.

261
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,953
Come here.

262
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,319
Let's eat.

263
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,119
What are you eating?

264
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,559
I'm eating food.

265
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,479
Isn't that right, Toh?

266
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,879
Everything looks delicious.

267
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,859
There are lots of vegetables.

268
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:34,439
How's everything, kids? Are you exhausted today?

269
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,279
I'm so drained, Fon.

270
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,139
Lend me your shoulder.

271
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:41,320
She asked the kids, not you.

272
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,939
We're not that tired P'Fon.

273
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,879
But I envy those who went to the waterfall.

274
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,340
Right? I'm so envious.

275
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm telling you that you guys missed out.

276
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,019
- What did we miss?
- You didn't go into the river though.

277
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,199
Jao!

278
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,559
Toh! You were imagining it, weren't you?

279
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,180
Right! This guy!

280
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,719
That area was kind of dangerous and the protector was very possessive.

281
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,559
P'Sky, there's a protector in this area?

282
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,419
Yes, Nong Som. It's very scary.

283
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,780
I'm scared! I have chills!

284
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,679
I don't like it P'Khongkwan.

285
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,079
- Hey, Nuea.
- Hey.

286
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,999
- Are you done helping the aunties?
- Yeah, all done.

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,259
- What's that drink? Let me have some.
- Oh, no!

288
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,179
It's liquor.

289
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:40,799
Liquor?

290
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,519
Keep it down, Daisy!

291
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,039
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,879
You'll get in trouble.

293
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,700
How dare you bring liquor to the camp?

294
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,759
Yeah.

295
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,339
I wasn't going to drink it but the aunties gave it to me.

296
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,860
I think you should throw it away, Ai Nuea.

297
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,079
Otherwise... we're all doomed.

298
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,279
That's right, P'Nuea. You should throw it away.

299
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,460
Yeah, I'll throw it away.

300
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,760
Toh!

301
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,053
Toh! Toh!

302
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,880
Take this.

303
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,720
Nuea, hold on to him.

304
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,859
Toh! Toh! Are you all right?

305
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,550
- Toh!
- Toh!

306
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,800
Toh!

307
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,339
- Why is he so drunk?
- Right.

308
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:30,899
It's a locally brewed rice wine. So it must be very strong.

309
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:35,399
I think you should take him to get some rest.

310
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,239
- I agree.
- Yeah.

311
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,819
Let's take him to get some rest.

312
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:39,719
- Toh!
- Toh!

313
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,940
Toh. Toh, get up!

314
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,279
No, I don't want to!

315
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,140
I'm not drunk! I'm not!

316
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,393
Nuea.

317
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,360
What is it, Prao?

318
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
I have something to say to you.

319
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,113
Nuea.

320
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,410
What is wrong with you?

321
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,880
Prao, we've been through this already.

322
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,510
Is there anything I haven't made clear?

323
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,479
About you liking somebody else?

324
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,100
What about us, then?

325
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,000
You know full well what's between us.

326
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,120
Am I not one of your choices?

327
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,140
I see.

328
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,470
You think that I'm just playing around, don't you?

329
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,679
It was like that in the past.

330
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,360
But now it's not.

331
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,390
Because you're about to dump me.

332
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,340
Shit. I can't hear anything at all. Damn it.

333
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,200
- What are they doing?
- Right.

334
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,979
Hey.

335
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,660
Holy shit! A hug!

336
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,479
- Prao.
- Nuea.

337
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,719
I love you, Nuea.

338
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,639
Prao.

339
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,259
Toh, should we get closer to take a look?

340
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,639
I don't think we should. Let's just leave.

341
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,039
Right, Toh? Let's go.

342
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,239
- Come, Toh.
- Hey? Toh?

343
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,799
Huh? What?

344
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,279
Oh!

345
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,799
Where's Toh?

346
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,719
- Hey!
- Toh!

347
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,253
Prao.

348
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,780
Prao, please don't do this. I beg you.

349
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,170
We used to do much more than this before, didn't we?

350
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,500
Prao. Prao! Prao!

351
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,180
Prao!

352
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,140
So you think you're so good, huh?

353
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,960
Toh!

354
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,739
Toh! Toh!

355
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,630
Hang on! Did he just kiss a girl?

356
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,300
Toh! You jerk!

357
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,260
Hey! Toh!

358
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,153
Toh!

359
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,340
In short, you drank liquor inside the camp.

360
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,699
You know the rules, right?

361
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:45,839
I can send you back right away.

362
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,540
But I understand you didn't mean to do it.

363
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,999
I'll overlook it this time.

364
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,180
But if there's a next time,

365
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,999
you must leave immediately, understand?

366
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,959
Yes, Sir.

367
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,999
- Straighten your arms.
- Yes, Sir.

368
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,319
As for your issue with Prao, I'll let you settle it yourselves.

369
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,940
P'Prao, I'm really sorry about what happened last night.

370
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,040
Prao, do you need my help on anything?

371
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,033
I don't.

372
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,410
I just don't want to see that guy's face anymore.

373
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,539
That's settled then. Now, go back to your work.

374
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,800
- If anything comes up, let me know.
- Yes.

375
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,999
Do you want to go home so bad?

376
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,920
Yes!

377
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,579
Stay, then.

378
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,040
Why would he even ask, then?

379
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,240
Ah, here he is.

380
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,919
P'Prao, how are you?

381
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,679
Was it sweltering hot?

382
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,879
Was it hot?

383
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
I apologize once again, P'Prao.

384
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,299
Ooh, snow!

385
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,000
- Y'all, it's snow!
- Snow! Woo!

386
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,820
Damnit!

387
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,279
Peach!

388
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,560
Waiwai! Let's go!

389
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,100
Okay.

390
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,680
- There's snow everywhere.
- It's so pretty.

391
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,293
Toh.

392
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,220
How was it? Did P'Touch scold you?

393
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,460
He didn't say anything.

394
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,940
It seems he already knows about it.

395
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,220
Did you tell him all about it?

396
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,079
Yeah.

397
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,000
I was the one who told him.

398
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,319
I thank you very much, P'Nuea.

399
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,239
Also, I have to apologize.

400
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,440
Why are you apologizing to me?

401
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,659
Well, about P'Prao.

402
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,740
I really went too far.

403
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,500
Toh. There's no need to apologize to me.

404
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,140
You apologized to Prao already, right?

405
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,899
I did but...

406
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,440
She's still upset, right?

407
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,130
That's normal, Toh.

408
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,360
But you already apologized to her, didn't you?

409
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:24,360
Then it's up to her whether she forgives you or not.

410
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,940
As for me...

411
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,759
there's one thing I'm feeling upset about.

412
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,780
What is it?

413
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,900
What are you going to do, P'Nuea?

414
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,640
Do you still remember what I was teaching you?

415
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,399
You've already practiced with me, but why do you still suck at kissing?

416
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,550
Don't let anyone know I teach you how to kiss.

417
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,033
Well...

418
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,240
I was drunk at the time.

419
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,000
Do you know

420
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,000
kissing while intoxicated is better than when you're sober.

421
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,140
R... rea... really?

422
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,000
Then...

423
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,800
we should start from the sober one.

424
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,730
If you ever get drunk,

425
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,920
I'll show it to you.

426
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,080
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

427
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,440
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

428
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,780
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

429
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,120
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

430
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,860
Enjoy your meal!

431
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,559
You plain face.

432
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,100
Plain face!

433
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,333
Hey.

434
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,199
Is he out of his mind? He's talking to the soup.

435
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,639
Right. He was just feeling down this morning.

436
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,079
But I think it's great that you've stopped overthinking.

437
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,420
Right?

438
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,639
It's fine, right?

439
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,759
Plain face. Plain face.

440
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,399
Oh hey, Nong.

441
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,820
Hi, P'Touch.

442
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,359
- Is it delicious?
- It's delicious.

443
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,079
- Oh! Nong, your name is Toh, right?
- That's right.

444
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,539
- What's your faculty?
- Comm Arts.

445
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:28,839
- Aha, what about the rest of you?
- I'm Jao.

446
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,040
My name is Som. I'm the star of Comm Arts.

447
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,100
Don't be too confident!

448
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,319
And my name is Daisy.

449
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,899
I'm not the star of the faculty,

450
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:49,780
but I've called dibs on all the handsome men!

451
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,799
And... what are your duties here?

452
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,319
We are in charge of repairing the tables and chairs, P'Touch.

453
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,440
My role is painting.

454
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,679
Then, whenever you're bored of painting, you can help me plaster the walls.

455
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,839
We definitely need more hands.

456
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,399
- Of course!
- I'm in!

457
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,679
I'm pretty good at it.

458
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,840
I'm a soldier who's ready to build the walls!

459
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,780
- Excellent!
- Toh!!

460
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,313
Brilliant.

461
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,880
You said you would help me repair the building.

462
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,760
When did I say that?

463
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,040
I told you earlier.

464
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,740
Eh? Oh! Yes. Yes, you did!

465
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,390
I completely forgot about it.

466
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,239
I'll bring some fruit. Would you like anything?

467
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,560
Yes, please. Water-water-watermelon!

468
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,739
♪ Take a little bite. Take a little bite ♪

469
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:55,840
♪ Take a little bite. Take a little bite ♪

470
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,659
- P'Nuea.
- Huh?

471
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,780
So, you're being serious, right?

472
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,500
Yes. I've come this far, haven't I?

473
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,700
I don't think there should be any problems.

474
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,200
He seems to like you as well

475
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,759
But mine... he's so stubborn.

476
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,460
I don't know if ten years is enough time to succeed.

477
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,980
Cheer up, man. Do whatever you can for now.

478
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,519
- Right.
- Before that, finish this up first.

479
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,159
- Hurry up.
- All right.

480
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,260
Then we can move on to something else.

481
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,560
Or maybe...

482
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,580
I should...

483
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,199
♫ Upon the vast sky ♫

484
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:00,339
♫ And shine your light ♫

485
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:04,020
♫ You are like the beauty ♫

486
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:10,300
♫ For the person standing down here, to look up and admire ♫

487
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:16,739
♫ That is all there is and I know wel ♫

488
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:21,579
♫ It might seem meaningless ♫

489
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:30,380
♫ But for me, it's enough just for me to see you ♫

490
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:38,199
♫ So please just be a star in the sky ♫

491
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,899
Who's that?

492
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,040
Who is it?

493
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:54,140

♫ I was scared that the time we had would vanish  ♫

495
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:16,060

You're the best! Thank you so much!

501
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,060
Nong Jao.

502
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,699
Wow, where did you get it from, P'Sky?

503
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,899
How come I didn't see it?

504
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:01,380
It's a special dish for someone handsome.

505
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,800
You kissed the auntie over there. Just tell him like it is.

506
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,559
Really?

507
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,599
I didn't kiss her. I didn't.

508
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,333
Did you, really?

509
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,220
Eat up! Dig in!

510
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,719
P'Sky.

511
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,939
You can have it. I'm not hungry.

512
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:27,019
No, Jao. You cannot starve yourself.

513
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,259
You've used a lot of energy today, so you need to eat healthy food.

514
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:31,793
Here.

515
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,300
- Come on.
- Here.

516
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,640
When you have round cheeks like this, it's the cutest.

517
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,799
Take it down a notch, my friend.

518
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,340
You're making the plain soup sweet.

519
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,440
- Let's have a try.
- Toh.

520
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,819
So sweet.

521
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:01,570
Let's have a try.

522
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,620
Are you all just incapable of eating yourself now?

523
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,119
Oh, but I think the soup is tasty, P'Khongkwan.

524
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,320
Let's see what they put in the soup.

525
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,479
Pickled mustard cabbage and... Shitake mushroom.

526
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:24,740
Is it delicious?

527
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,130
Can I have some?

528
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,279
- Shitake mushroom!
- Toh!

529
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,119
- Toh!
- Toh!

530
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,520
Toh! Toh!

531
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,780
- Toh!
- What's wrong!?

532
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,319
- He gets drunk on mushrooms!
- Yes! Yes!

533
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,839
Getting drunk like when he drinks liquor?

534
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,620
No. If he drinks liquor, he becomes hyperactive.

535
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,499
But if he eats mushrooms, he falls asleep. Here, like this.

536
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,939
I think you guys should bring your friend up to sleep.

537
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:54,799
We'll take care of everything here.

538
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,359
Hey.

539
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,460
Don't bother. I'll take care of him.

540
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,239
- Oh, okay. That's fine.
- Please take care of him, P'Nuea.

541
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,779
- Please take care of him.
- Yes, go ahead!

542
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:08,020
Toh. Toh.

543
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,819
Toh.

544
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:15,170
Take care of him, Ai Nuea.

545
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,320

Yes.

551
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,480
My head hurts.

You don't have a fever though.

553
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,500
Do you want to wash up? You'll feel better.

554

No...

555
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,560
I can sleep anywhere

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,920

P'Nuea...

563
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,773
What?

564
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,620
What about your promise?

00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,420

566
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,553
Well...

567
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,200
you said you would kiss me when I'm drunk.

568
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,460
Right now, I'm drunk.

569
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,840

589
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,379
Please hand me the silicone sealant.

590
00:43:46,379 --> 00:43:48,013
Okay.

591
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,780
Keep it on. It's hot out here.

592
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,120
Time, hold the ladder for me.

593
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,760
P'Sky, take your hat back.

594
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,019
Jao!

595
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:12,379
Just wear it, Jao.

596
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:14,779
P'Sky was nice to bring it to you, right?

597
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:18,820
But I'm down here. He's up there.

598
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,260
Is it right that I wear it?

599
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:26,400
You seem to be worried about him a lot, huh?

600
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,960
Nosy! Be quiet!

601
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,939
Oh, Toh!

602
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:37,059
Do you still have a headache?

603
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:38,399
I'm fine now.

604
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,879
I'm so sorry.

605
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,259
I forgot to check if there were mushrooms in the soup.

606
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:44,099
You don't have to apologize, Jao.

607
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:47,119
It's my own fault.

608
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,159
I was too busy looking at P'Nuea,

609
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,140
that I accidentally ate the mushroom myself.

610
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,099
Did you know that being drunk was so freaking awesome?

611
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,500
Freaking awesome?

612
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,259
Hey Nong, does anyone want some cool towels?

613
00:45:10,259 --> 00:45:11,970
Excuse me.

614
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,100
I'll get one.

615
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,319
- Nong Toh.
- Yes?

616
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,340
Stay still.

617
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,659
- Toh.
- Y... Yes?

618
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:41,919
- Come help me hold the ladder.
- Oh, sure.

619
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,700
Excuse me.

620
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,113
Here I am.

621
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,660
P'Sky.

622
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,820
Here's a refreshing towel.

623
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,473
Here.

624
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,360
Thank you.

625
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,239
Could you wipe it for me? My hands are dirty.

626
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,073
Silly.

627
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,299
I didn't think... that you'd like men.

628
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:39,050
It's none of your business no matter who I like.

629
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,470
- What era do you think we're living in?
- This means you're serious about it.

630
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,953
Yes.

631
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,080
I'm dead serious.

632
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,000
Now that you know it...

633
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,680
please stay away from Toh.

634
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,300
Then, let me tell you one thing.

635
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,280
Our targets

636
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,960
aren't the same person.

637
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,279
It's so cold

638
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,600
P'Nuea.

639
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,899
You keep teasing me.

640
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:36,050
How come you are so thin?

641
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,799
Do you work out at all?

642
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,679
I've never.

643
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,179
Well, it runs in the family.

644
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:48,030
Everybody is thin and has similar physical builds.

645
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,390
You should have muscles like this.

646
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,820
And, about the person you like,

647
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,020
is it P'Touch?

648
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,720
Can I not say who it is?

649
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,860
You can't.

650
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,913
I want to know.

651
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,870
Will you tell me?

652
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,500
Will you tell me?

653
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,333
Please?

654
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,080
Please.

655
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,220
Please?

656
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,580
No! It's not P'Touch.

657
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,100
P'Nuea, you tell me first who Van Gogh is.

658
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,450
I don't think it's that hard to guess.

659
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,220
Who's the one I spend time with the most right now?

660
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,040
Who's the one I asked to join me in this camp?

661
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,850
The Van Gogh that I like...

662
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,039
is you, Toh.

665
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:35,759

Woohoo!

672
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,439
Why are you making a move so fast?

673
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,859
Aren't you going to pursue him anymore?

674
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,879
I like him, and he likes me.

675
00:51:31,879 --> 00:51:33,919
- Shall we start dating?
- Huh!?

676
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:37,999
You haven't been dating P'Nuea for a whole day, have you lost your mind already?

677
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,290
It's a gecko!
