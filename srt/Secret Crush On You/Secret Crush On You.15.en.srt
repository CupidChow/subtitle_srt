[How "Secret Crush on You, The Series" came about]

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,959
We started by establishing the company known as Idolfactory.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,499
Among our main objectives for establishing this company,

13
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:52,019
we wanted to give opportunities to young talents in the entertainment industry,

14
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,459
including the ones I have known, to work together in the same company.

15
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,419
This is how Idolfactory came about. Then, I wanted to grow and expand further.

16
00:00:57,419 --> 00:01:02,859
One day I felt that I could pass on this good fortune and opportunity.

17
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:08,419
So, I felt like making a TV series to give young talents an opportunity,

18
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:11,499
as well as to carry on the goals I have set.

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,399
is a new territory, a new role, for me.

23
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:27,219
That's why, as I said before,

24
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:28,859
I had to experience so many things.

25
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,939
There were lots of trials and errors

26
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:36,939
I had to invest myself in learning about different things.

I feel that this was something that brought me happiness.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,859
I didn't create a series, film, or soap opera,

29
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,839
but I created something in my heart that happens to be

30

where happiness occurred from seeing everyone enjoy watching the series.

Before the series came about, before choosing the novel,

38

before forming the production crew and arranging key staff,

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,559
while dealing with the obstacles that come up,

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,199
the best classroom is the one where we experience ourselves.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,759
These practices teach me a lot of things.

As for being an actor,

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,319
this is probably what I'm familiar with the most

52
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,539
because I've been an actor for some time now.

But in "Secret Crush On You"

54

I only appear as a guest star playing the role of "P'Thep"

there are some new and different things.

to both the main characters, Nuea and Toh.

60

and create more situations for them.

62
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,279
I think it's a fun character to play

To be honest this character doesn't have any background story before this.

66
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,399
Thep's dialogues are as few as 3 pages for the whole series.

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,939
I felt that I had to create P'Thep's background myself.

68
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,399
So I worked on that before I took the role as P'Thep.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,399
I had to think about what I had to prepare to be the character.

70
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:48,339
What should I do? What should P'Thep's story be?

71

How would his character be involved? I brainstormed on my own.

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,079
It was as if I wrote a separate novel about P'Thep's entity.

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,979
And I felt that I wanted to create P'Thep to be

00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,099

We've been working together. We're familiar with each other.

Then, we agreed to work together.

It started with P'Chen and Nong Saint giving me the opportunity to be the director.

95
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,379
After that, I read the original novel

[Let's start from the character "P'Nuea" by Billy]

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,139
For Billy's character, we had a rough idea in mind

108
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,759
about how we wanted him to be. We had a draft.

109
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,819
When we first met P'Billy, we thought

110
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,139
he quite matched the image we had of Nuea.
["Nuea is superb"]

111
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,839
P'Billy is fairly confident in himself

112
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,359
He has this old soul within him dubbed "Billy the Uncle"

has P'Nuea's soul in him.
["Nuea is so dope"]

until we got this version of P'Nuea we see on screen.

118
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,259
In the end, he came out to be what we wanted.

119
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:06,720
Then, we blended his character with P'Nuea's.

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,199
I think P'Billy and P'Nuea's personality overlap a lot

121
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,479
He is mature and P'Nuea's maturity level is also high.

122
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,319
He's a warm-hearted man.

123
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,259
When I look at him,

124
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:20,339
he makes me feel that he's ready to protect the person he loves.

125
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,319
He makes me feel his desire to protect Toh.

126
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,839
But sometimes the way he's protective,

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,339
isn't in a way where it's straightforward.

I'd say he really is the magic, like how Toh describes him.

The first time I met Billy,

133
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,679
I thought he was good. He exuded potential.

134

I read both volumes.

Honestly, I've never read a novel before.

146

I read books, like textbooks

147

[Surely, a person like Nuea isn't afraid of this!!]

As soon as I read the novel, it was really good.

which have illustrations to help visualize the story, right?

152

But for a novel, there are only words.

153

So, it surprised me how the narration

I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't stop reading

157
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,579
I'm impressed by many of its characters.

158
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,699
It never really occurred to me that I would get chosen as P'Nuea.

159
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,799
I thought to myself if I get to be a part of such a fun story,

160
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:15,439
I could make the audience feel the same joy I had when I read the novel.

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,579
Then, P'Chen and Saint called me to cast for the role.

162
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:24,939
When I got the role the first thing I felt was happiness.

163
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,619
Then, it hit me that I had to play P'Nuea

164
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,119
I was beyond nervous.

165
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,159
I was like "What should I do? I have to play P'Nuea.

166
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,379
Where's the Mr. Cool guy side in me?"

167
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,199
All the questions flooded through my head, and I started to panic.

168
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,799
I was happy, but I also freaked out.

169
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,999
I was wondering how I could best portray P'Nuea in a way that the audience would enjoy.

170
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:47,339
I wasn't confident that I could be P'Nuea.

171
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,999
I wasn't confident that I could be P'Nuea.

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,339
When I first attended the workshop,

173
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:53,879
I heard some comments saying

174
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,519
"Can he really play the role of P'Nuea well?" and all that.

175
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,679
Did they discourage me? They did.

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,939
But I came all the way to this point. I had to go forward.

177
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:03,439
I had to pull it off.

178
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,000
I had to be the P'Nuea that people would enjoy and love.

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,239
["Toh" played by Seng]

180
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,539
We followed the same steps in choosing Seng.

181
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,839
At that time, we...

182
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,899
we wanted Seng to try Toh's character
["Stretch and refresh"]

183
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,639
I remember during the casting process,

184
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,799
Seng still struggled to find Toh's character

185
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,979
Again, we tried different methods on him.
[#Alcoholsarebad, This is a prop for filming]

186
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:32,499
We added the colors yellow, red, orange, and purple
[Surely, Toh is talking about work]

187
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:34,479
and Seng slowly became the character
[You just wanna say that Toh is good?]

188
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,539
With adjustments, he gradually embodied Toh's character.

189
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,199
There were adjustments made but Send is very good.

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,099
Because you can kind of see the balance between Seng and Toh.
[Someone is putting pressure on him!!]

191
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:47,359
That being said, they weren't too far apart.

192
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,279
I think that Seng did really well to change himself and portray Toh.

193
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,430
And he made people believe that he really was Toh.

194
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,639
There were quite a few moments off the screen

195
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,019
that the audience didn't get to see Seng likes receiving tender loving care.

196
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:08,179
He likes to plead cutely.

197
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,839
Normally, when you pull a prank or tease others,

198
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,379
you just do it without thinking too much. You just have fun with them.

199
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,279
But Seng is different. When he finishes teasing others, He's going to sit down and start wondering,

200
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,599
"Will they feel down and sad?"

201
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,179
"Will those people take revenge on me?"

202
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:23,159
"Or maybe I should apologise to them in case they're really upset with me"

203
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,239
That's how Seng is as a person.

204
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,019
And all these are the characteristics that Toh has. He overthinks.

205
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:36,939
At first, Seng didn't realize these feelings can became the basic foundation

206
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,399
that can bring forth Toh's character.

207
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,999
When we brought out the bits of Seng's character,

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,999
we eventually got the Toh you see in the series.

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,080
As for Seng...

210
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,479
I've actually met him before.

211
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,159
And now we work together again on this project.

212
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,299
At the beginning, I had a couple of worries about him

213
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,799
because I thought he was so different from Toh.

214
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,239
People who have met him before or his fans

215
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,599
definitely know that he has his own specific style.

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,919
But during the workshop

217
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,379
I got a glimpse of what he was capable of

218
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,160
that could turn him into Toh.

219
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,960
Today, he's proved himself as a perfect Toh.

220
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,759
[Seng - Wichai Saefant as "Toh"]

221
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,639
The first thing that hit me was excitement.

222
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,399
I really wanted to play the role well.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,939
This is the first series I get to play a lead role.

224
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,819
I received an opportunity given by P'Chen and P'Saint.

225
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:44,159
They told me to try this role.

226
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,619
They told me they chose me for this project.

227
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,079
That made me want to try my hardest
[Toh, you're making the director nervous]

228
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,119
not to disappoint them.
[by showering him with compliments]

229
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,040
From reading the scripts and the original novels

230
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,779
to working out all the details, I worked hard in every area.

231
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:01,879
I'm glad I was part of this story and was able to convey this series to the audience.

232
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,279
I went all out with everything I had.

233
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,379
What I got in return... I just felt that I put my 100 percent.

234
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,799
I gave everything I had at the time.

235
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,179
And all I wanted was to make the audience smile

236
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,119
and be happy with the series. That was it.

237
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,119
[Heng as "Sky"]

238
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,919
Khun Heng, our own "P'Sky."

239
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,219
Needless to say, he played as himself.

240
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:25,759
Let me tell you this, among our 4 main characters

241
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,039
he's the one whose character overlapped with the character he played (Sky) the most

242
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,899
since the initial casting.

243
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,219
When I saw his profile picture and all,
[Your way of trying to make up with him]

244
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,459
I thought they had a lot in common.
[is making him bashful]

245
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:40,519
Even the way he walked was the same as how I pictured Sky walking.

246
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,039
They were that similar.

247
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,639
So I thought this friend of mine
[Refreshed. So refreshing]

248
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,559
was perfect as Sky.

249
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,679
Heng is a handsome man.

250
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,699
He was handsome and cool the moment he walked in.

251
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,859
He carried this mysterious aura with him wherever he went.

252
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:58,519
I thought he was mysterious. There was something about him.

253
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,939
He had this cool and handsome vibe.

254
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:05,880
When we unveiled this part of his, we can see that Sky

255
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,940
was hidden somewhere inside him.

256
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,520
So we pulled the shadow of Sky out.

257
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,719
We amplified and drew more of that part of him out.

258
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,359
Among the 4 characters, it took Heng the least time and effort to adjust to the character.

259
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,519
I'm so glad we got Heng to play this role.

260
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,559
He made Sky loveable as a character.

261
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,259
I think that both Heng and Sky like to plead cutely.

262
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,599
Heng likes to joke around and tease people around him.

263
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,960
And being playful and cheeky are Sky's character.

264
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,379
When we put that with Heng's cool aura, Sky's character is complete.

265
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,679
And that's how Khun Heng is.

266
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,779
Actually, I met Heng before.

267
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,419
When we met this time round

268
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,659
I thought he was a stubborn kid
(7:00 A.M.)

269
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,079
But when we started working together,

270
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,879
I realized he was kind-hearted man.
(This is how we energize ourselves during the filming)

271
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,959
He's a caretaker and he pays attention.

272
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,899
To put it simply, he could really be Sky in real life.

273
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:08,140
He's loyal and faithful. He's a diligent kid.

274
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,559
But he's also a whiny kid.

275
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,720
Not whiny like being selfish, but he's sensitive as a person.

276
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,359
(Heng - Asavarid Pinitkanchanapan as "Sky")

277
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,219
To say "it's beyond the wildest dreams" is not an exaggeration

278
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:23,839
because not many people receive such an opportunity

279
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,739
and not everyone is this fortunate.

280
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,239
When I saw the character during the workshop,

281
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,160
I started asking myself how come this character and I were so much alike,

282
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,519
from our background stories to something deep down inside.

283
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:38,679
I don't think this is a coincidence

284
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,039
Our acting coach, Teacher Kla, told me nothing is a coincidence.

285
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:49,479
There will be something that leads the character and myself to meet.

286
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:52,879
Each character chooses the actors to perform the roles,

287
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,119
so the actors could portray the characters as much as possible.

288
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,279
I talked to my character every day. I'm bonded with him.

289
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,859
So the feeling has long since surpassed gratitude.

290
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:08,059
It was an experience that gave me the courage to step out of my comfort zone.

291
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,039
I didn't even believe that I could do it then.

292
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,439
(Surprise as "Kaojao")

293
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,959
Kaojao or our very own Khun Surprise.

294
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,279
All 4 of them always hang out together

295
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,599
But Surprise has the 'youngest sibling vibe' ever since the first time I met him,

296
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:28,230
even during the casting process, he seems like the youngest sibling in the family.

297
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,839
He makes you want to protect him.

298
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,479
Kaojao's main characteristic is the love of eating.

299
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,619
Surprise always asks, "Can I eat this?"

300
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,919
"How about this one? Can I eat this one?"

301
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,159
"Can I trade this one for that one?"

302
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,419
I felt that they had something in common there.

303
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,479
This might seem like a trivial issue.

304
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,579
But, Surprise is also a little sensitive and a bit sulky at times.

305
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,959
Which I really like.

306
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,579
So I told him to utilize this part of himself

307
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:04,239
and put it in Kaojao.

308
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,839
And that made Kaojao more complete as a character.

309
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,199
It would make Kaojao even more adorable and delicate as a character.

310
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,059
This was the assignment for Surprise to do.

311
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:17,279
He understood it and blended who he was and his character together.

312
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,460
He delivered everything I pictured in my head and created such a loveable Kaojao.

313
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,479
And that was how it played out.

314
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,999
Surprise.

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,300
I have to tell you that Surprise checked off many factors on the list

316
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,779
as an actor who would get to play Kaojao.

317
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:40,680
He interpreted Kaojao and interpreted it well in his own way.

318
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,139
I feel that Kaojao's loveliness as portrayed by Surprised

319
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:51,320
had many astonishing moments.

320
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,399
(Surprise - Pitikorn Siripornsawan
as "Kaojao")

321
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,039
I'm delighted to be a part of this series

322
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,839
When I studied the character,

323
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,239
I thought Kaojao's character matched me so well, simply because I also enjoy eating.

324
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,859
I put so much effort into this role.

325
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:08,159
Before I started playing Kaojao, my weight was 64 kilograms

326
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:11,759
and I tried to lose weight because I didn't know the character well enough.

327
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,419
But when I read the scripts I realized

328
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,839
Kaojao should be a little chubby, healthy and plump.

329
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,419
So I tried to eat more to portray Kaojao's appearance the best I could.

330
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:21,579
I've been with this character
for a long time.

331
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,950
And I love this character so much.

332

[Secret Crush On You | The Series]

333
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,839
(Similarities and differences between you and the role you play)

334
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:35,719
(Differences between Billy and Nuea?)

335
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,119
P'Nuea is calm, cool, and very mature.

336
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,699
He's someone who examines things attentively.

337
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:48,099
Everything that he does has been well planned

338
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:52,059
and thought out. Like what does he have to do, to get this done?

339
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,319
He lets his actions speak louder than his words.

340
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,619
You will see that in each scene

341
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:01,719
he maintains his composure and communicates through his gaze.

342
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,639
And this is why it's difficult for me to play P'Nuea.

343
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,199
As for myself, I speak first

344
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:14,141
before I take action.

345
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:16,419
Do I have a plan? Yes.

346
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,979
Am I as meticulous as P'Nuea? No.

347
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:22,399
But what I think P'Nuea and I
("I've been keeping a serious face all day.)

348
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,219
have in common is we both like to take care of people around us
(Let me pull a funny one now)

349
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:32,779
We always support the younger kids and people around us
("Toh, you're making it tough on Nuea")

350
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,379
We put others before ourselves.

351
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:41,519
One more similarity that we have is our, "coolness."

352
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,419
Although I try to be cool, it appears as, "wanna-be cool."
(Finally, Toh gets to wear Nuea's clothes)

353
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,739
But P'Nuea is cool from the inside out.
(Finally, Toh gets to wear Nuea's clothes)

354
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:54,940
Also, I think I've learnt so much from P'Nuea.

355
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,779
The version of Billy you see now has P'Nuea as his idol

356
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,939
in the process of maturing.

357
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:10,779
I think this character makes me a better man.
(Toh's heart is racing because of Nuea)

358
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:14,819
I'm so glad I get to play P'Nuea.

359
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:21,040
I've adopted P'Nuea's personality into my everyday life these days.

360
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,519
(The differences between Seng and Toh?)

361
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,899
Our similarity lies in our energy. We're both playful and lively.

362
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,179
I think this makes us click with each other.

363
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,699
We both like to make people laugh.

364
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,199
We can't stand the awkward silence.

365
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,920
Toh likes to lighten up the mood I really appreciate that.

366
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,939
This extends to his love life.

367
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,039
He's very dedicated to love.
(Take cover once)

368
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,299
When he loves someone he gives them 100%.
(Take cover twice)

369
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:46,979
He's always ready to support the person he loves.

370
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,939
I think we're quite similar.
(Nuea's handsomeness has such a powerful impact)

371
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,939
When I have fallen for someone I want to give the person my support

372
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:57,019
I want to be by their side to fully back my loved one up.

373
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,199
Within the group of friends
(Eh? Whose hand is this?)

374
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,199
and the love among them,
(Toh is in shock)

375
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,899
I think Toh fully loves and supports his friends.

376
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,959
He doesn't want his friends to be sad or unhappy.

377
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,259
He doesn't want to see them cry

378
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:10,839
And when I see my friends like that, it makes me upset.

379
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,879
It makes me want to help them solve their problems.

380
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,159
As for our differences,

381
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,959
I think it's the way we handle things.

382
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:24,299
Toh is extremely observant, especially in what he likes and is interested in.

383
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,639
This becomes clear to me when I play as the character

384
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:30,239
I thought I paid attention to details

385
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,179
But when I got to know Toh,

386
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,039
I can tell that he pays attention in every aspect.

387
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,119
That includes the time, what the person he likes enjoys, and what he himself likes.

388
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,639
He will even know the release of certain items,

389
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,239
the details of each photo,

390
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,799
or even the small details of what the person he likes, like to do

391
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,939
on a day-to-day basis.

392
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,959
I think this is how I'm different from him.

393
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,779
Unlike him, I may not remember all the details.

394
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,559
Also, we're different when it comes to food.

395
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,459
I felt that we're really different in the beginning

396
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:08,139
because I didn't know that Toh rarely eats. Before I took this role, I had to change my physique and weight.

397
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:12,819
My weight was 68-69 kilograms, I think.

398
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:14,699
When I got Toh's role

399
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,939
I had a talk with P'Chen and P'Saint about my appearance and weight

400
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:21,199
And we thought Toh might be slimmer and smaller.

401
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,619
Right before the filming started, my weight went down to 52 kilos.

402
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,659
During the filming, I was completely unaware

403
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:30,959
that I ate so much less and that my health had also changed.

404
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:34,959
I realized this when people started noticing and commented, "Why are you eating so little?"

405
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,399
"Why are you eating just that?"

406
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:41,639
That's when I knew that when I changed my eating habits my physique and health changed too.

407
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,979
My dietary requirements also changed.

408
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:47,999
For me, this is another big difference between me and Toh

409
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:50,559
(Differences between Surprise and Kaojao)

410
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,719
There're both similarities and differences.

411
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,639
What we have in common is the fact that we eat lots of desserts.

412
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,359
We both enjoy eating. Very much.

413
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,719
When we eat, we don't think about anything else. We just eat.

414
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:08,479
As for the differences, I think it's about sports.

415
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,339
I love playing basketball. I play a lot of sports.

416
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,159
But Nong Kaojao doesn't really do sports.

417
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,319
He enjoys taking photos, being by himself, and hanging out only with his friends.

418
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,319
He doesn't socialize as much because he's shy.

419
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,739
(What do you like in the character that you play?)

420
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:25,859
(Nuea)

421
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,839
I like... how witty he is.

422
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,419
I like everything about him from his maturity to his calmness.

423
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,279
He has his way of playing.

424
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,619
He has his own ways of communicating.

425
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,679
He doesn't always speak out what he feels.

426
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:55,399
He can be tight-lipped but he knows all the possible outcomes of what he decides to do.

427
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,859
During the filming, I hardly had any time to watch the playbacks.

428
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,119
I got to see the final product when the series aired.

429
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,859
I saw that the words in my head were delivered through my gaze.

430
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:12,579
And this was the assignment P'Kla and P'Cheewin gave me since day one.

431
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:14,779
In the beginning, I didn't have any required skills. I couldn't communicate with my eyes,

432
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:17,559
and my ears aren't great. P'Nuea has a good ear.

433
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,479
So I did so much homework on eyes and ears

434
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,019
I watched Korean series as my references

435
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:26,979
to understand those male characters

436
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:29,179
that speak little but communicate with their eyes.

437
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,359
How they have lots of inner monologues and how they delivered them with their gaze.

438
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:36,119
I did a lot of homework. I also watched the Hollywood shows.

439
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,819
I watched Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Garfield, for instance.

440
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:43,019
Normally, I watch them for leisure

441
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,619
But now, I have to stare intensely at the screen.

442
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:49,439
It's like I get to practice the skill as well.

443
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,819
That's why I like how P'Nuea talks through his eyes.

444
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:56,259
(Toh)

445
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,859
Actually, I like everything about Toh.

446
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:01,719
I like his viewpoints, possibly all of them.

447
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:06,279
But if I need to name one, I like his attitude towards love.

448
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,519
The way he gives love to someone,

449
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,239
he doesn't need anything in return.

450
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,079
I think Toh is a faithful person when it comes to love.

451
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,219
He gives 100% and all that he's got for that person or thing he likes.

452
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:23,999
I feel like I see the different perspectives of Toh when he likes someone.

453
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,359
He's willing to give all his time, heart and soul for his beloved.

454
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,399
From the activities his loved one enjoys doing

455
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,439
or whatever his loved one likes.

456
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,319
Toh is attentive and always gives encouragement

457
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,199
to the one he likes.

458
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,779
And he never expects anything in return or expects the other person to reciprocate.

459
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,759
I think his feeling of love is so pure.

460
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,080
This part of Toh impresses me so much.

461
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,399
(Sky)

462
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,579
There're many things I like about Sky.

463
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,959
Sky is playful, yearning for love, and flirtatious.

464
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,639
That said, he's warm-hearted.

465
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,999
His character is interesting.

466
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,999
Even for me, I think this type of person is charming

467
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,739
I want to be him the best I can.

468
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:16,559
He's an athlete and a musician.

469
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,879
He has many friends. He's lively and attentive.

470
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,119
It's the kind of character I want to be like.

471
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,059
Most importantly, he may seem like a playboy

472
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,499
but as a person who's been playing as Sky during the past year

473
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,559
I can confirm that when he stops playing around,

474
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,479
it means he's very serious about his feeling

475
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,520
I'm not bragging (selling my point) but I'm selling a pipe dream.

476
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,940
Yes, that's about it.

477
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,579
(Kaojao)

478
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:51,759
How he cares and loves his friends.

479
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,199
He truly cares for his friends

480
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,679
and does his best to give them the support they need.

481
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,719
Another thing I like is his eating habits.

482
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,199
Yes, I like it because he eats a lot. Like... a lot

483
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,599
When he eats, he doesn't think much about the calorie intake unlike me.

[Secret Crush On You | The Series]

486
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,099
("Inspirations" in designing the scenes)

487
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:23,159
The inspirations for each scene... Let's go back to the beginning.

488
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,079
I feel that for Y series',

489
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,819
the creative imagination, the voices in the head and the thoughts about them,

490
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,419
have disappeared from Y series for a while.

491
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,159
But when I started working on this series,

492
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,419
I felt that I wanted to bring these elements back once again.

493
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:43,699
And I thought these elements would go well with the characters in this series.

494
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:48,119
If we're talking about the scenes that I came up with,

495
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,699
I'd say, that's me putting myself in their shoes.

496
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:54,099
For instance, if I encountered something like this with someone,

497
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:57,119
this is what I would do with that person.

498
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,959
Or I would want to go all the way as much as possible,

499
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:03,679
visualizing what the characters would do.

500
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,639
And Nong Seng presented his character well. He went above and beyond.

501
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,299
Sometimes, I think it even went beyond my briefing and direction.

502
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,199
(Your most "memorable scene")

503
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,819
If I say every single scene impresses me it'll probably be too much though that's the truth

504
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:23,419
But if it's the scene that impresses me since the first glance

505
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:26,519
I think it's the "Like a Star" scene.

506
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,119
I think the scene is perfect by itself with all the elements:

507
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,560
the ambience, music and communication

508
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,919
I like this scene a lot.

509
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,839
Another thing is the friendship among Toh and his friends.

510
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:49,039
I think he's lucky to be surrounded by such good people.

511
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,819
including P'Nuea, P'Sky, P'Khongkwan, P'Fon, and P'Touch.

512
00:27:53,819 --> 00:28:00,339
They came into his life and made Toh's ordinary life so enviable,

513
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:03,039
because he's surrounded by such good people.

514
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,139
There's also this scene with P'Sine.
(Sine - Intira Charoenpura)

515
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:10,879
At the time we were filming, it must have been around 7 pm.

516
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,019
It was the final scene of that location.

517
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:17,659
As we finished setting up and were ready to shoot.

518
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,359
3, 2, and... action. All the lights went out.

519
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,239
I was like "Oh my, what do we do now?"

520
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,819
P'Sine put her hands together and mumbled something.

521
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:35,679
Then, I walked towards her. She said that this was normal.

522
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,439
Once she finished what she was saying the lights came back,

523
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,559
and we could finish our filming.

524
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,599
It was unbelievable.

525
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,999
Do not disrespect it even if you don't believe in it.

526
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,799
Everything was set and the camera were already rolling.

527
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,359
Everything was ready. The electricity suddenly went out.

528
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,879
That was perfectly normal. It's considered something good.

529
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,499
Such things happen all the time.

530
00:28:56,499 --> 00:29:00,519
Every scene is full of joy. I particularly enjoy the early episodes.

531
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,319
I like the fact that P'Nuea is full of tricks.

532
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,039
He was as sweet as a field of sugar cane. So flirty.

533
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,339
This is so clear in the first and second episodes. Especially when they play the Kung King game. Like, oh wow.

534
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:15,539
During the Kung King game that I had to play around.

535
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,379
It's like I was having fun teasing and that I got to play around with Toh.

536
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:20,639
When, in fact, I more or less liked him since the first time I laid my eyes on him.

537
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:26,799
But I also wanted to make sure how much this person liked me

538
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,979
and how serious this person was towards me.

539
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:33,279
Because P'Nuea has a composed persona.

540
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,480
From the way he looks

541
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,059
he might seem composed and has to keep his cool look all the time.

542
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:45,159
But everyone can see the differences after he has become Toh's lover.

543
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,359
He is ready to throw such images away.

544
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,219
There's this dialogue in which he says to Fon, "If I like someone, I'll make sure the person knows"

545
00:29:54,219 --> 00:29:57,419
He lets his actions speak.

546
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,319
He drops his composure and pours his heart out.

547
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,739
He tells the world he's Toh's lover. I love him for who he is.

548
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:09,159
I love the clumsy kid wearing glasses named Nong Toh.

549
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,659
Even in the episodes when they're dating already he still enjoys teasing Nong Toh.

550
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:19,639
For P'Nuea, in his eyes everything that Toh does is adorable.

551
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,439
It's pure joy.

552
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,159
It's like there are only two of them in this world.

553
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,959
Nothing else matters. It doesn't matter if there are people around passing by.

554
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:32,539
He has tunnel vision.

555
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,499
He's crazily in love with Toh. That's right.

556
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,459
The scene that I enjoy the most is the one where everyone plays games together.

557
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:42,539
It's in Ep.2 or 3 where we go to P'Nuea's house.

558
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,359
Another one is where we go to the beach.

559
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,419
I think it's the scene that all the actors

560
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:52,359
both the Engineering and Comm Arts groups get together and play games.

561
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,539
I felt that we enjoyed ourselves a lot.

562
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,819
I get to see what each character wants.

563
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:03,019
I also enjoy the overall carefree and cheerful vibes.

564
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:07,200
It's where everyone can enjoy and laugh out loud. Yeah.

565
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,259
It's fun. At the same time, it's challenging

566
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:15,599
because "Kung King, do as you're told" is the main game of our Engineering squad.

567
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,399
Each person is different. Like P'Nuea has a cool composure.

568
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,019
Khongkwan and Fon are glued together.

569
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:30,699
So Sky has to boost the energy so that everyone can have fun.

570
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:33,259
I felt so stressed shooting this scene

571
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,959
Because one, the dialogue was quite long

572
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,279
And this scene was a reshoot.

573
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,679
It didn't reach the emotional feel that they wanted from us.

574
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,019
So I kind of blamed myself for not being able to do this scene better.

575
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,199
I thought I had to do better. I asked myself if it was my fault that they had to reshoot.

576
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:54,399
I had many things inside my head. So, to me, the scene was difficult.

577
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,519
On top of that, this reshoot is put

578
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,619
as the final queue of filming, "Secret Crush On You, The Series"

579
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:06,959
Frankly speaking, that day we'd completed 99% of the filming

580
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,279
I thought I fully understood everything.

581
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,999
I understood the character. I understood how I should play.

582
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,459
I knew the most important thing was to relax.

583
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:17,339
I needed to go out there and give my best shot.

584
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:20,039
I was prepared and remembered my lines because we had filmed it once before.

585
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,039
As for the rest, I just had to play the scene with my friends

586
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,319
the hardest I could to make people believe that

587
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,559
it really is the game that we all enjoy.

588
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,439
When I finally pulled it off I was so happy that I told myself I made it.

589
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:34,699
That's why it was the most difficult but fun scene.

590
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:37,359
It's one of the most memorable for me. That's it.

591
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,039
The scene in which I had the most fun playing

592
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,199
is probably the one I played with my friends,

593
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,079
Toh, Som, and Daisy.

594
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,459
It's the scene where we snuck to hang tangerines on P'Nuea's car.

595
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,299
Which was a very silly scene.

596
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,739
In that scene, everyone has to act like ninjas to hang the bag of tangerines.

597
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:57,299
We pretended to be trees and Kaojao acted as a rock.

598
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:02,239
For this scene, P'Cheewin didn't brief us on what to do.

599
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,779
So we had to think of the details ourselves.

600
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,699
Like should we pretend to be a tree or something else?

601
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:07,819
Or maybe Toh should hide under the car?

602
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,159
The scene was very hilarious.

603
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,279
It's one of the opening scenes of the series as well.

604
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,280
I really like that scene. It's fun. And it was so energy-consuming.

605
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,199
("Flirting Scene" that you like)

606
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,959
Billy and Seng's bathtub scene.

607
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,119
For me, I don't see it as a heavy NC scene.

608
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,419
But I think the plot is realistic.

609
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,419
I like how well the message is delivered.

610
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:37,819
This is for real. It's terrific.

611
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:40,870
Should we call this flirting or teasing?

612
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,419
P'Nuea has his own way of doing things.

613
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:46,639
To be honest he's tried to make a clear statement

614
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,919
since Ep.1 and Ep.2

615
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:52,459
Then... how should I put it?

616
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:54,359
He slowly works his way to his prey.

617
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,299
But for Nong Toh, what Nuea does isn't enough for him

618
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:01,259
to be aware that P'Nuea is pursuing him.

619
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:06,679
Of course, P'Nuea just waits for Toh to finally realize it.

620
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,999
If he does one thing and Toh still has no clue

621
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,719
he will level up his actions more and more.

622
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,559
"Do you understand now?" If not, he'll do more and more.

623
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,159
This continues until the waterfall scene

624
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,699
where Nong Toh finally understands P'Nuea's feelings.

625
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,279
That eventually marks the beginning of their relationship as lovers.

626
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,939
While we know P'Nuea initiates the romance, but Toh doesn't realize this at all

627
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:33,419
That's the scene before their relationship starts

628
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,959
But after they start dating I'd choose the barbeque pork scene

629
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,199
on the rooftop after we return from the camp Toh waits for P'Nuea to come.

630
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,879
It's when their relationship has just begun

631
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,919
so he has a lot to learn about each other.

632
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,379
He's still being very much considerate of P'Nuea.

633
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:50,239
He tries to respect P'Nuea's personal space.

634
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,619
He tries to make P'Nuea understand that he wants to be with P'Nuea always.

635
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:56,079
He's not trying to cross the line.

636
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,999
He doesn't want to invade P'Nuea's privacy. He tries to show that he trusts P'Nuea.

637
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:03,019
So we can see how Toh tries to put his trust in P'Nuea That's what I think.

638
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,119
It's a difficult question.

639
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,119
Well, of course there're scenes that I like

640
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,039
but what I like better

641
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,499
is how every single move Sky makes can turn Jao's world upside down.

642
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:17,559
I enjoyed doing that every single time.

643
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,399
The more I did it, the more playful I acted

644
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,479
Surprise's ears show what he feels whenever he gets shy or embarrassed. His ears turn red.

645
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:28,519
When I saw that his ears turned bright red,

646
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,859
I felt that I delivered the mood. I played my part well.

647
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,739
He got shy for real and it made him lose his cool.

648
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:36,879
And that makes Sky falls for him even more.

649
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:42,179
I enjoyed every single moment when Sky drops all his sweet talk.

650
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:48,100
He just says whatever he wants so that he can see Jao's reaction.

651
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,039
I really like it when Surprise's ears turn red.

652
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,659
That's it.

653
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:58,819
The couple or romantic scene with Sky that I like the most

654
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:03,739
is in Ep.13 Yeah, it's in Ep.13

655
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:05,439
I really like this episode.

656
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,679
It's the scene after Kaojao receives a plushie from his admirer, and P'Sky gets jealous.

657
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,999
I like it because Sky gets jealous and frustrated

658
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:18,879
but it makes me happy because Sky teases Jao a lot. It's payback time.

659
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:24,039
Another scene is the one where he takes me to his room

660
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,139
It's the scene in which Kaojao opens up his heart the most.

661
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:30,399
To me who played the role of Kaojao that day,

662
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,319
I think it's the scene that makes me feel most comfortable

663
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,639
because I now accept that I like this person. I've opened up my heart to him.

664
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,419
I like this scene very much.

665
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:44,739
(Favourite "dramatic" scenes)

666
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:47,559
Mine is in Ep.13

667
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,419
It's when P'Nuea sees Toh's entire collection

668
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,119
of all the photos on the wall.

669
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,479
That's a tough scene to pull off.

670
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,459
It's tough because I had to turn and look at Toh.

671
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:07,479
There were misunderstandings and so many questions.

672
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,799
Like, "Toh, why do you need to have so many photos of me?"

673
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,739
Yes, I do know that he has been collecting items related to me

674
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:19,040
but it's beyond my wildest imagination that he keeps so many of them and puts them on the wall.

675
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,660
He can't make sense of Toh's actions.

676
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,239
He also feels sad

677
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,859
because he truly loves Toh for who he is.

678
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:33,679
Many questions flood through his mind

679
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,939
And there's a dialogue in which Nuea asks Toh to tell him everything.

680
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:40,519
And after hearing what Toh had to say, P'Nuea understood it right away.

681
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:45,819
P'Nuea then explains the reasons why he loves Toh.

682
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:48,359
He tries to clear up the misunderstandings

683
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,999
and miscommunication between them. He explains everything.

684
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,579
There're all sorts of emotions in that scene.

685
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:57,599
Once you see that scene you'll see that it was cute and left a deep impression.

686
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,279
If I need to choose one I'll probably choose the one in Ep.13

687
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,539
It's the one which P'Nuea pulls down the curtain

688
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:05,779
and sees my photo collection and the rest of the items.

689
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:09,859
I think it's a crux of the series

690
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,239
Those who read the novel can definitely tell

691
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,059
that this crux or this hidden issue is Toh's greatest secret.

692
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:20,079
Ep.13 unfolds this issue.

693
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,579
If you haven't watched this scene I'd like to invite you to watch this part.

694
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:25,339
This scene isn't all about being dramatic

695
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:29,219
there are other emotions involved. It's also about moving forward.

696
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,079
It's about accepting one another.

697
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,639
It's also about listening to what the other has to say.

698
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,459
And it says something about having secrets.

699
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:40,199
At the end of the day, there's no secret in this world.

700
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,619
I really hope you would tune in to this scene.

701
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,419
Mine is in Ep.4

702
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:48,799
It's the first episode that Sky starts pursuing Nong Jao for real.

703
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:53,239
As Sky, I know it won't be easy to make Jao open up to him

704
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,439
but I made up my mind that I'll show him that he's serious about this.

705
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,259
It's the first time Sky makes a real big move.

706
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:00,919
Also, the scene where I drag Kaojao out of the pub

707
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,219
and take him back to his dorm

708
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:05,899
was the last scene of the day. What happened was it started to rain

709
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:08,620
And it was about time we had to wrap up the shooting.

710
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,459
The crew almost called the scene off, to film it another day.

711
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,939
But for some reason, we tried shooting one more time.

712
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:18,019
The staff, even Cheewin, all said this would be the final take.

713
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:21,379
It was all right if we couldn't do it. We could do it afterwards and such.

714
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:26,499
So I felt more relaxed

715
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:29,359
and gave it my all I have nothing to lose. I just wanted to do my best

716
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,879
And I had faith in my co-star.

717
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,319
We clicked and we pulled it off despite the time limit.

718
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,339
And it came out so well that after this final cut was released,

719
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:44,959
Prise came up to me and said, "Hey, Heng, you did well in this scene"

720
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,519
When I saw the final cut during the broadcast,

721
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,279
it remains the most memorable scene for me.

722
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,839
It shows the love and care, and the earnestness.

723
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,319
It shows different dimensions of the character.

724
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,199
It shows the earnest side of a playful guy.

725
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,339
Especially when I take him to the car and drop him off at his dorm.

726
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,599
Also, scene when we were chatting inside the car,

727
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,859
or when Sky waits until Nong Jao turns off the light in his room and goes to bed,

728
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,419
it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when I watch it.

729
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:15,459
It's hard to move on from that scene.

730
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:19,039
So it's the best melodramatic scene for me. Yes.

731
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,759
The melodramatic scene that I love so much is in Ep.4

732
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,099
It's the scene where P'Sky and Nong Kaojao return from the pub.

733
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:31,539
It's during the 7-day flirt remark.

734
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:37,139
There's a scene that leaves a deep impression on Kaojao.

735
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:42,739
It's the scene where Kaojao tries to step out of his comfort zone to go to P'Sky.

736
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:47,459
But he's unsure if Sky is just playing with his feelings or if he's serious.

737
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:51,639
When I played this scene, I teared up and cried

738
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,799
because I don't like people to play with my feelings

739
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,310
And I think P'Sky made him feel that way, that's why he felt uneasy.

740
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,110
[Secret Crush On You | The Series]

741
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,800
(What obstacles did you encounter during the filming process?)

742
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,839
Our location was flooded.

743
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,819
The picture I had in my head collapsed.

744
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:15,279
The rice field turned into a river.

745
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,919
It became a river. Water was everywhere.

746
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,380
It was impossible to do the filming. So we had to cancel the filming.

747
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,259
There was also the Covid situation.

748
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:24,679
There was a lockdown.
(Social distancing)

749
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,759
So we couldn't do the filming.
(Wearing masks at all time)

750
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,279
The situation prolonged the filming process.

751
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,739
When we set the time frame for filming,

752
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:34,539
we thought we would have finished filming by then

753
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,579
We should be doing the editing.

754
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,079
The broadcast schedule was moved.

755
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,359
There's also an issue with the swab test

756
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,599
People may think doing swab tests wouldn't cost a lot of money

757
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:46,439
But would you believe me if I tell you
(SWAB test for everyone )

758
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,219
it made the budget surge
(and every time)

759
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:51,039
because we had to do it every time we filmed

760
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,899
We had to be strict. We had to take care of everything.

761
00:41:53,899 --> 00:41:57,399
The overall budget rose. It went way over the budget

762
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,999
So I talked to to the director, producers,

763
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,479
and people who also work behind the scene like myself

764
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:04,679
They told me this was a welcome party for new producers

765
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,719
Fortunately, I got to work with the crew of "Secret Crush On You, The Series".

766
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,939
They're all professionals.

767
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:13,539
They taught me to look from other perspectives,

768
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:16,379
they told me, "You should try to think differently,"

769
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,099
"you should do this." All those things

770
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:19,919
I would embrace and think about their suggestions

771
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,239
so that we could take their advice and make-do

772
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,659
And that made "Secret Crush On You", the series you see today.

773
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,779
Let's skip the on-set experiences.

774
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:34,559
Allow me to talk about the touching moments on the set.

775
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,479
I've been working for 7-8 years. And I never had my own single

776
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,879
I must thank the cast of this series for giving me a solo track

777
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,279
Here are the people who produced the song, the two people here.

778
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,199
- Ready 1, 2, 3!
- Go.

779
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,600
Three times. Let's go.

780
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,039
♪ Wanna be a star Wanna be a star Wanna be a star? Be quiet! ♪

781
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,299
♪ Wanna be a star Wanna be a star Wanna be a star? You goldfish! ♪

782
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:05,359
♪ Wanna be a star Wanna be a star Wanna be a star? Good job! ♪

783
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,979
♪ Wanna be a star Wanna be a star
Wanna be a star. Character blocking! ♪

784
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:12,640
(We're glad we get to be a part of
"Secret Crush On You")

785
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,619
Right, last but not least I'd like to thank
all the important people

786
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:24,179
who have been walking alongside us
all this time, our filming crew and staff
I thank everyone in the team.

787
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:28,999
I thank P'Chen, P'Chen is the one who
initiated this project.

788
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:31,640
He dedicates himself to this project.

789
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,699
I want everyone to see how
P'Chen lost his sleep doing this project. He was so determined.

790
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,200
He was living and breathing
for this project

791
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,999
He wanted it to turn out well. He wanted it to be as beautiful
as it could.

792
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,539
He wanted to make everyone happy. He wanted the young talents to make
the best out of this opportunities.

793
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:50,959
I must thank everyone. I thank P'Cheewin
for giving me all the tips and guidance.

794
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:55,619
I thank all the producers, directors, and crew members
who gave me advice. Everyone guided me.

795
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:01,839
Thanks to the cast for putting
their effort to make this project successful.

796
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,450
I'd like to thank everyone

797
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,420
who is involved in this project.

798
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,839
I'd like to thank
the author of this novel for giving us the opportunity

799
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:18,400
to adapt such a good novel
into a good series.

800
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,540
Lastly, even if there's a book

801
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:27,270
but there's no reader, this book probably
wouldn't be what it is

802
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,459
But when the readers pick up this book, they add more value to the text

803
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:36,259
It can also bring happiness, love, smile, laughter, and tears to many people

804
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:40,460
I thank our readers, our audience
I sincerely thank you all.

805
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,780
for walking with us, for reading this
"book" from the beginning to the end.

806
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,019
I thank you for crying together
and having fun together, like I said before,

807
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:50,400
I must thank you for staying by my side
I'm truly grateful.

808
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,840
I'd like to thank everyone.
I thank our fans.

809
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,859
I thank you for loving this series.

810
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:04,739
Also, I'd like to thank
the production team that capture and convey the story

811
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:08,579
for the audience to see so that we can all enjoy
the series together.

812
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,020
I thank those who initiated this project
for introducing us to get to know one another

813
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,660
and letting me be a part
of Idolfactory family.

814
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,879
I'd like to express my gratitude
to Saint and P'Chen. I have no idea
what they saw in me when we first met.

815
00:45:21,879 --> 00:45:27,099
I didn't even believe in myself but they said they had faith that I could do it

816
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:32,800
That encouraged me
to break through my limits.

817
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,740
It wasn't easy to step out of my comfort zone to do something

818
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,519
I always felt insecure about. I said, "Could I do this well?" "The character is written well."

819
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:46,160
But I didn't give up.

820
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,159
I fought side by side with Sky. I told myself that I was chosen,

821
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:56,180
so I must do my very best to show my appreciation to Sky
who picked me to be him.

822
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:02,340
This meant more than
an acting role to me.

823
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:08,360
It's a lifetime experience. It's freaking worthwhile.

824
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,559
Lastly, I would like to thank each and every one

825
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,719
who plays a part in this project.
This includes the production team and all the fans who give us their support.

826
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:19,980
And thank you all the actors who have been working tirelessly

827
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,200
for the best of this series.
