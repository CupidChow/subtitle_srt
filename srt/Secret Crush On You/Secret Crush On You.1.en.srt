why did you tell us that he's here?

99
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:27,460
That's right. So he dragged us from the Comm Arts Faculty

I'll give them all a kiss on their cheeks.

I think I'm better-looking than Ai Nuea.

Hey, I'm heading to class.

153
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,780
Nuea, wait. I'm coming with you.

154
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,339
Fon... I won't talk to you anymore.

Wait for me, Fon!

156
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:20,979
Why are they suddenly in a rush?

157
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:23,479
I don't think you should have said that.

158
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:27,840
- Hey! Wait for me.
- We have to go to class, hurry.

159

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,619
I really can't stand it.

162
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,859
- Where are you rushing to?
- Hey!

163
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,279
- But you're the most handsome.
- Yeah.

164
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,180
- I know that already.
- You don't have a mirror at home?

165
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,450
Hold this for me.

166
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,279
What the hell are you doing?

167
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,480
What are you doing, Toh?

168
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,779
- Why did you bring the grabber tool and gloves?
- Right.

169
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,680
You're sure about this?

170
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,179
- Where's he going?
- Where's he going?

171
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,959
Don't tell me...

172
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,620
Exactly what you're thinking.

173
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,099
This will be the first class that I... won't fall asleep.

174
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,379
You're very focused on your studies?

175
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,479
I am focused on watching the professor.

176
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:03,999
Just like me!

177
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,420
- Friends!
- What?

178
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,959
- Yes?
- I have something to tell you all.

179
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,919
What?

180
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,779
I'm hungry.

181
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,479
Shall we have something to eat?

182
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,899
- Didn't we just eat, Jao?
- Right.

183
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:17,759
It's fine, isn't it?

184
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,539
Our friends is hungry.

185
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:24,799
- Right?
- Well, what do you want to eat, Jao?

186
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,799
What do you want to eat?

187
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,350
Grilled BBQ Pork.

188
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,819
No, no, no, no.

189
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,679
I think we should eat...

190
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,579
- Eat...
- Eat what?

191
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,799
I think ramyeon is better.

192
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,479
Like the lead actresses in Kdramas.

193
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,439
What?

194
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,499
- Ramyeon? Kdrama actress?
- Yes.

195
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:48,430
It's because you're broke!

196
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,179
- Som is broke?
- Yes!

197
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:53,639
You guys know me so well!

198
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,899
It's the end of the month.

199
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,739
It's only normal my wallet is empty.

200
00:14:58,739 --> 00:14:59,859
Let's have ramyeon.

201
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,159
- Yeah, okay.
- Broke. Broke. Broke.

202
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,999
- You're broke.
- Ramyeon it is.

203
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,699
- Let's go eat.
- Ramyeon.

204
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:07,539
Yes, Ramyeon. I only have enough for that, otherwise you treat me.

205
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,120
I won't be treating you, Som.

206
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,539
Ramyeon. Ramyeon.

207
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,599
- You guys!
- What?

208
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
- What is it?
- What?

209
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,899
Look at the little one.

210
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,619
What is "the little one?"

211
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:26,560
"The little one" is P'Magic's car.

212
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,379
Dude.

213
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:33,879
Aren't there many people at our university that drive similar cars?

214
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,539
I think it might not be P'Magic's car.

215
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,619
- Right?
- That's possible.

216
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:41,359
- Yes.
- Yeah, I agree.

217
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,739
Why are you looking at me?

218
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,079
License Plate, AP 77.

219
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,939
A white Mercedes C220d, top model, with a 3-inch side skirt.

220
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:54,159
19-inch rims and the same car options as before.

221
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,140
This one belongs to P'Magic for sure.

222
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,159
Maybe his friend borrowed his car?

223
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,279
That's right!

224
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,219
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

225
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:08,959
- It must be true. His friend borrowed it.
- Yes.

226
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,120
- Right?
- Yes.

227
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,039
- Jao.
- What?

228
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,279
That might be the case with his other cars,

229
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,320
but as for this one...

230
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,499
He wouldn't let anyone borrow it.

231
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:25,459
Toh! You know all the details so clearly.

232
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,419
If you know any more than this, it would be the vehicle ID number.

233
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:30,460
Yes, that's true.

234
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,820
HR-27 BD 92-4279-86

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,199
But, what is he doing at our faculty?

236
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,099
Or is he here to see someone, Jao?

237
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,559
I think you should just forget about it, Toh.

238
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,399
- Yes, that's right.
- Right.

239
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,190
He... probably... came to see his friend.

240
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,699
- Let's go eat.
- Yes.

241
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:01,359
Let's go eat. Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

242
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,839
Wait!

243
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,259
What now?

244
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,819
Don't you guys think that...

245
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,840
Think what?

246
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,839
This might be destiny.

247
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,259
Gosh! What destiny are you talking about?

248
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,779
All he did was park his car here.

249
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,079
- Yeah.
- You're delusional.

250
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,719
- Oops.
- Um.

251
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,259
It's destiny that I was given a chance to do something for him.

252
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,939
Not again.

253
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,779
I don't care! If—

254
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,119
- Jao.
- What?

255
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,959
- You, and you as well.
- Me?

256
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,159
You must help me. Please?

257
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:34,479
- Please? Please?
- What? Help with what?

258
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,039
- I don't know! I don't know!
- Please? Please?

259
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,919
I don't know. I don't know! Ask Jao!

260
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,599
Jao. Jao. Jao, please help me!

261
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,879
I... I... I don't know. I'm hungry. I can't think of anything. Som!

262
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:46,359
- Som!
- Me?

263
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,999
I don't know. I don't know either. I can't—

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,639
Just think of anything before he comes! We'll be caught!

265
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,599
Okay! Hold on!

266
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,900
- What should we do?
- Hurry up!

267
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,359
Hello. How are you, professor?

268
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,960
Hurry, hurry! P'Magic is coming!

269
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,599
P'Magic is here!

270
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,799
Okay! I figured it out!

271
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,359
Go and find a cute little snack and put it on P'Nuea's car.

272
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,119
And don't forget to attach a card and flower with it as well.

273
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,679
This is a 10/10 score. I guarantee.

274
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,630
- Now, disperse!
- Hurry up!

275
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,519
Hurry! Hurry!

276
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,519
Jao!

277
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,679
Wait for me!

278
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,560
Hurry up!

279
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,459
Hello. I'm a second-year student named Kaojao.

280
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:32,100
May I... take the heart?

281
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,100
There's a UFO!

282
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,673
I'm truly sorry.

283
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,519
Professor! Professor!

284
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,779
- What is it?
- May I have those, please?

285
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:45,679
- These?
- Yes, Sir.

286
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,119
Okay, sure. Here.

287
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:49,039
Thank you so much, Sir.

288
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
- Okay. I'm leaving then.
- Yes, Sir.

289
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
May I buy these from you?

290
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,930
May I buy this from you, please?

291
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,633
Give it to me.

292
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,800
Toh! I'm back!

293
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,079
Here's the heart!

294
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,200
Thank you, Jao.

295
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,140
I have tangerines.

296
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,379
Wait. You want him to give Nuea those Tangerines?

297
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:31,079
Here. This is mine.

298
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,719
Incense and flowers.

299
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,599
- What did you bring them for?
- Exactly, why?

300
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,260
To pay him respect maybe. Take them.

301
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,059
Well, I don't need the incense. You can have it back.

302
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,879
- Okay, okay.
- I'll do this then.

303
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,679
- Hurry, Toh.
- What should I do next?

304
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,959
- Aren't you going to write anything?
- Yes!

305
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,259
It's quite empty.

306
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:49,479
- Write on the card...
- Just write whatever.

307
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,339
Here. Hurry up.

308
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,300
- Write something.
- Write what?

309
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,380
- Just write anything.
- Write whatever!

310
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,700
Hurry. Hurry.

311
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,400
Just write whatever.

312
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,419
"With care"

313
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,739
Are you doing a cough medicine commercial?

314
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,139
- Huh?
- Right?

315
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,939
- It sounded like a mother's day gift.
- Yeah.

316
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:11,919
But I think it's all right.

317
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,759
- Right?
- Shall we move now?

318
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,019
Yeah. Let's go. Let's go.

319
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,699
Go go! I'll hold it for you. Run.

320
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:19,400
Go! Go! Run!

321
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,939
- Bend over a little more.
- We're almost there.

322
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:26,259
Quickly, quickly.

323
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,399
Hurry up and hang it on there.

324
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,479
Hurry up and hang it. Quickly.

325
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,920
Hurry! Can you stop dallying Ai Toh!

326
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,799
What?

327
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,700
Where? Where?

328
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,460
Stop dallying!

329
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,739
- Ai Toh!
- I'm leaving now.

330
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,360
Toh! Toh!

331
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,540
P'Nuea! PNuea!

332
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
Act like a stone!

333
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,980
We almost got caught. He's gone.

334
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,520
Jao, get up.

335
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,853
Huh?

336
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,253
That's right. It's a pity.

337
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:43,199
Jao, you call him over.

338
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,719
- Toh!
- Toh!

339
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,833
Look at him.

340
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,713
Toh.

341
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,759
I can... get the tangerines out of the bag for you.

342
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,100
- Right? Right?
- Yes, right.

343
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,559
And... I can treat you to some ice cream.

344
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,299
Which flavor do you want?

345
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,999
- Right?
- Which flavor do you want, Toh?

346
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,959
Or... How about we eat together at my place?

347
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,759
- We can have our karaoke session after that.
- Yeah.

348
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,900
With the song that you like, Toh.

349
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,520
- Shall we?
- We can eat something too.

350
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,399
You guys... really want to cheer me up, right?

351
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,559
Yes, we do.

352
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,140
Yes.

353
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,719
Just tell us what you want us to do.

354
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,819
- Yes.
- Yes.

355
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:20,320
- I can do anything.
- Same.

356
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,860
Then...

357
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,919
Can you get the tangerine bag for me?

358
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,179
- Huh?
- What?

359
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:37,679
P'Magic touched that bag for like 40 seconds!

360
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,659
Such a waste to throw it away.

361
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,739
Damn you, Ai Toh!

362
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:47,019
Please? You guys said you would help me, right?

363
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,799
All right. I'll pick it up for you.

364
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,533
It's hot out.

365
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,139
Yes, just like that, Daisy.

366
00:24:55,139 --> 00:24:57,419
- Lift it up.
- Got it?

367
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,179
Lift it up.

368
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:02,440
Not too close. It's dirty.

369
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,419
Seriously, Ai Toh. Instead of doing these kinds of things,

370
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:15,480
wouldn't it be better to show up and introduce yourself?

371
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,539
- No, that's not good.
- Why!?

372
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,839
Have you already forgotten?

373
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,990
- What?
- The rules of someone having a secret crush.

374
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,480
The rules of someone having a secret crush.

375
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,980
First rule, do not greet them

376
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,830
If you're not ready for heartbreak.

377
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,000
The second rule,

378
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,790
do not be dramatic if you're not going to fight it out.

379
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,220
The third rule,

380
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:19,820
do not confess if you're not ready to step out of the safe zone.

381
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,760
- You still have us.
- Yeah.

382
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,453
Here.

383
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,739
You're unbelievable, Toh.

384
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,539
- You're so unbearable.
- Yeah.

385
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:54,539
All right, quickly now. He got it for you.

386
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,019
Hurry up and take it.

387
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,399
Quickly!

388
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,020
I'm waiting to see.

389
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,553
- Toh.
- Go ahead.

390
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:06,459
- Don't worry about anything.
- Just grab the bag.

391
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,820
- Take it.
- Take it.

392
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,400
I can take care of it first.

393

It's too bad.

00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,540

Hello, everyone. Today you're with KK.

406
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,079
Today I was enjoying my meal,

407
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,379
but Sky told us to play the "I'm Your King" game.

408
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:27,119
We must do as we're told.

409
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,699
And today I was told to do an IG live

410
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:35,339
with the popular P'Nuea for ten minutes, everyone.

411
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:41,520
You can ask him anything before the time is up. Ready! Go!

412
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,859
How was your class today? Are you exhausted?

413
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:47,419
No, not at all.

414
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:51,219
He's not tired, everyone. He's never exhausted to learn.

415
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:55,320
Which subject did you have today?

416
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,639
Today? I had Mathematics class.

417
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,219
It was so tough, everyone. I couldn't come up with any numbers.

418
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,520
Does the food there taste good?

"Does the food there taste good?"

Yes, it does.

I recommend this place.

Hey, Nuea, you read comments

That's okay. Same messages also count.

425
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,579
Ah, all right everyone. It's been ten minutes.

Let's sleep now.

430
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,260
Don't be dramatic if you're not going to fight it out.

431

You're too much.

- Ai Sky.
- What?

433
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:15,659
Do you think our project for this term will pass?

434
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,139
I'm fine as long as it's not an F.

435
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:21,619
It's not cool to have to sit in class with the juniors.

436
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,779
Continue right. Just a bit more!

437
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:26,199
Give it.

438
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,299
- One moment.
- What's going on?

439
00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:29,939
You're very cool, Sky.

440
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,059
Look at yourself. You skip classes every day.

441
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:34,239
It's a group project, yeah?

442
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,739
But there's only me, Fon, and Ai Nuea, the three of us working on it.

443
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,959
You and you never show up.

444
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,339
You guys disappear and are never seen!

445
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:45,719
Don't scold them too much. Eat first.

446
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,799
- Can I just ask you one thing?
- What?

447
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,399
You add the prefix "Ai" in front of our names.

448
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,959
Ai Tor, Ai Nuea, Ai Sky.

449
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,610
But why didn't you add it for Fon?

450
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,239
You want to know? Come closer?

451
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,659
What?

Sit down. Sit down.

453
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:08,319
Eat your food.

454
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,859
- Let your ears ring!
- How about this?

455
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,379
How about we have Tor and Sky present the project?

456
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:16,680
What do you say, Nuea? Is that okay?

457
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,559
Sure, that's fine.

458
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,179
But both of you must practice in front of us first, okay?

459
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:28,199
- Yes, father.
- Sure, Sr. Representative of the Faculty.

460
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,019
Handsome, cool, studious, and top of the faculty who is the professor's favorite.

461
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,180
- What's left for us?
- Nothing, of course.

462

Have you become this narcissistic, Ai Nuea?

463

- Ai Jao!
- What?

464
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:48,319
What's with you? Why are acting so weird?

465
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,859
Right.

466
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,400
I...

467
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,559
I am feeling out of place.

468
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,839
Why do you think so much?

469
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,139
Just pretend you were at the Communication Arts canteen.

470
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:04,480
But... with more Engineering guys than usual.

471
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,459
Excuse me P'Nuea, can we take photos with you?

472
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:13,340
Oh, sure. Yes, of course. Come on.

473
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,920
Come on.

474
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,640
Our canteen is much better.

475
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,679
This one is so far. I'm tired. It's hot and I'm super hungry.

476
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,779
Ai Jao, don't forget the number rule of our group.

477
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,070
Three equals four. If three go, all four tag along.

478
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,960
P'Magic will hear us!

479
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,279
We're too loud.

480
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,680
And we already decided to eat here, Jao.

481
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,479
Fine. Let's hurry up then.

482
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,900
- We'll be late for class.
- Okay.

483
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,400
Let me try this.

484
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,140
Toh!

485
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,359
You intentionally picked this table, didn't you?

486
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,559
The location is awesome.

487
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,739
Why?

488
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:12,573
Look over there.

489
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,979
- Dude.
- Yes?

490
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:21,700
No matter how good the location is, our friend is still a scaredy cat.

491
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,559
Watch this.

492
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,093
What?

493
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,413
Let's eat.

494
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,799
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

495
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,719
P'Nuea, here are some snacks.

496
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,039
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

497
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,179
P'Nuea, today is my younger sibling's birthday.

498
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:53,879
She likes you a lot.

499
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,339
I'd like you to make a clip to wish her a happy birthday.

500
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,559
- Her name is Aum.
- I see.

501
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,399
- Please?
- Sure, all right.

502
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,819
- Which phone should I use?
- So cute.

503
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,759
Hi Nong Aum. Happy Birthday.

504
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,240
I wish you lots of happiness this year.

505
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,099
Ai Toh! Ai Toh!

506
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,239
Do you want a P'Magic's video like those people at that table?

507
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,039
I'll go and ask one for you.

508
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,079
What are you going to do?

509
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,559
Ask for what?

510
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,500
Ask for a clip from P'Ma—

511
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,259
- Is that alright? Please check.
- It's all right.

512
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:38,000
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

513
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,839
- Toh!
- What?

514
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,919
What?

515
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,840
Your phone!

516
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
You're even worse than me.

517
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,659
- I told you to call him P'Magic.
- I forgot, all right?

518
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:56,160
- Let's eat. Just eat.
- Yeah.

519
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,399
That gave me a shock.

520
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,159
See? I barely finished what I was saying.

521
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,399
And you always accept these sweet snacks but you never eat them.

522
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,100
- That's right.
- Want it?

523
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,459
But you'd better be careful, Nuea.

524
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:13,059
If you continue to be kind to everyone like this, it'll be hard to gain the trust of the person you like.

525
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:14,980
Yes, agreed.

526
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,839
Fon. Don't worry, all right?

527
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,079
If I have someone I like, 'll do everything to gain their trust.

528
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,719
Okay, okay!

529
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,220
My friend is handsome and he makes all the heads turn.

530
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,260
What about... that table over there?

531
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,719
I think they're kind of cute.

532
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,759
There's nothing wrong with them.

533
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,293
Yeah.

534
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,960
I'm fine as long as they can make me fall for them.

535
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,680
I'm okay with everything.

536
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,320
Good, good.

537
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,593
Som.

538
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,739
- Nuea.
- Oh, Prao.

539
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:32,180
- Shall we go?
- Sure. Oh, wait a sec.

540
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,179
Let's go.

541
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:46,099
Oh! That's fine, buddy. I'll take care of it for you.

542
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:48,219
Thanks, man. See you all later!

543
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:49,519
Bye. See you.

544
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,459
- Bye-bye.
- Such a good one.

545
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:53,920
Jao, hide! Hide!

546
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,119
- Don't speak. I'm not going to eat.
- The weather is nice.

547
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,479
Don't say anything.

548
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,319
- It's so sunny. This canteen is so bright.
- That's right.

549
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,400
What is it, Jao?

550
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,960
- Have they left yet?
- They're gone.

551
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,619
It's all right, Ai Toh.

552
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,219
At least you got to eat at the same canteen as he did.

553
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:23,519
It's fine, Toh.

554
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,499
They didn't say they were dating.

555
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:29,639
Having a secret crush is kind of tough like this.

556
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,500
Exactly.

557
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,060
What are you all talking about?

558
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,599
What's going on?

559
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,000
What were you talking about?

560
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,339
- Geez.
- Weren't you listening to us?

561
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:43,739
Yeah!

562
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:46,219
What were you doing and not listening?

563
00:43:46,219 --> 00:43:48,519
Look! How is it?

564
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,239
- What is it?
- The Engineering canteen is so cool.

565
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,720
I can re-watch P'Nuea's video clip.

566
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,419
Look at this.

567
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,079
Anyway, what were you saying?

568
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,039
I was saying "let's leave!"

569
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,399
Sure, let's go. I'm happy for today.

570
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,439
- Yeah.
- Yes, let's go!

571
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,240
- Happy is good.
- Such a pain.

572
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,520
I'm still hungry.

573
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,639
- Wait for me.
- Hurry up!

574
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,939
- The food also sucks.
- Take it.

575
00:44:15,939 --> 00:44:18,479
- I haven't even taken a bite.
- Come on!

576
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,420
I'm leaving now.

577
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

578
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,360
What's with him?

579
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,459
I think the food at the Engineering canteen really sucks.

580
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:03,799
Yes, I agree!

581
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,819
The flavor is so bad. Not good at all.

582
00:45:07,819 --> 00:45:11,399
- You think so?
- But there's one major plus.

583
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,699
- What is it?
- What?

584
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:16,020
The guys!

585
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,879
- It's a huge plus.
- Kaojao!

586
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,199
I ran into a pervert in the restroom just now!

587
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,300
- Huh?
- How've you been doing?

588
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,639
Toh!

589
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,399
- P'Thep! Hello.
- Hello, hello, hello.

590
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,959
How are you doing? How's it going? Hello.

591
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:44,399
- I miss you, P'Thep!
- Okay, okay.

592
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,599
- Daisy misses you too!
- I miss you all too.

593
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:49,179
But we might be missing each other a bit too much.

594
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,799
- Can't breathe.
- Okay.

595
00:45:51,799 --> 00:45:53,319
How are you guys doing?

596
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,539
We're good.

597
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:58,359
And what are doing around here, P'Thep?

598
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,340
Yes, why?

599
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,050
I should be the one to ask what you guys are doing at my faculty.

600
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,439
- Well...
- Oh! Yes!

601
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,879
We... well, the view from the engineering faculty is really good.

602
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,459
Yes! That's right!

603
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:16,599
- It's beautiful!
- That's why...

604
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:19,599
- We're here to take some photos!
- Yes, that's right!

605
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,220
Yes, taking photos! I'll take your photo!

606
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,310
I think the views at the comm Arts faculty are better aren't they?

607
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,919
- It's a change of location!
- Oh, okay.

608
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,919
- You're changing the location.
- Very good, Jao.

609
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,379
Sure, why not?

610
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:38,199
Oh, Toh! Actually,

611
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,859
I was thinking about calling you.

612
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:42,219
What's the matter?

613
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:45,959
My friend wants to hire you as a photographer for his younger sister's birthday party.

614
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,059
Oh, I thank you, P'Thep, but,

615
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:53,719
I'm pretty busy these days. I'll do it next time.

616
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,239
It's all good. I understand.

617
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,839
It's a pity though because usually, people don't mind any photographer.

618
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,419
But he specifically requested for you, Toh.

619
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,059
Really?

620
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:08,639
P'Thep, who's your friend? Do we know him?

621
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,259
- Who is it?
- I think you guys should know him.

622
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:13,860
His name is Ai Nuea. He's in the third year.

623
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,119
P'Thep! I'm feeling so grateful to you!

624
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,819
You've helped me in so many ways!

625
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:39,439
I love, cherish, and respect you faithfully.

626
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,999
You're like my cupid.

627
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,760
May I...

628
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,180
Toh! What's wrong?

629
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,239
Toh! Are you okay?

630
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:04,340
He's totally fine.

631
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,873
Sure?

632
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,279
- Is there something wrong?
- No. Nothing at all.

633
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,219
- Okay.
- No. Nothing at all.

634
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:16,139
I wanted to ask if P'Nuea specifically requested Toh.

635
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:19,520
Yes, he requested Toh directly.

636
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,439
Oh, Thep! Since when did P'Nuea know about Toh?

637
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,779
- That's right.
- Yeah.

638
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:32,099
I think he saw Toh's photo during the "Magic of Love" event.

639
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:36,039
He must've thought the photos were nice and liked them.

640
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,919
That photo was great.

641
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,159
That's right.

642
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,559
But Toh said he was busy, right?

643
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,259
I guess I'll contact—

644
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:50,839
Oh, well! Well... like...

645
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:53,919
- He's free!
- Yes!

646
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,170
What about when he said he was busy?

647
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:00,679
Oh! Actually, I'm super available, P'Thep!

648
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,079
- My schedule is empty.
- Yes.

649
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,479
I can also do it free of charge.

650
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,940
- That's fabulous.
- Yes, that's right.

651
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,719
- Yes.
- I won't charge a single baht.

652
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,479
- So you're no longer busy, right?
- No never.

653
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:12,579
- Okay.
- You joke around too much.

654
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:14,179
I see.

655
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:17,600
- It's been a while since we've seen you, that's why.
- Okay. How about this,

656
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,539
I'll tell Ai Nuea that Toh accepts the request.

657
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:23,599
And, I'll tell him to give you a call.

658
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,799
- I'll give him your contact, okay?
- Yes!

659
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,860
- Of course!
- Absolutely!

660
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,799
- Sure!
- Okay, then.

661
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,619
All right then. Please excuse me. I have matters to attend to.

662
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,279
Oh, sure. Please don't forget about it, P'Thep.

663
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,819
Of course. Let's have a meal together next time, shall we?

664
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:38,819
- My treat.
- Oh, absolutely a yes.

665
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:41,820
- Okay.
- All right then. I'll see you later

666
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,459
But before I leave...

667
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,359
Toh, you have to let me go first.

668
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,959
You silly! Let go of him!

669
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,079
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

670
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,899
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Bye.

671
00:49:52,899 --> 00:49:55,480
- Goodbye!
- Thank you.

672
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,279
- Are you really okay?
- We love you so much, P'Thep!

673
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,519
Okay sure. See you. Bye.

674
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,580
Bye-bye!

675
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,699
You get to take P'Nuea's photos!

676
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:19,660
I got chills.

677
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,980
Toh! Toh!

678
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,580
Toh! Toh!

679
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,719
Hey,

680
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,640
I'm a girl. I can't lift him up! Ah!

681
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,260
- I'm still having chills.
- Same.

682
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,860
Ai Toh was just minding his business but luck came to him!

683
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,180
Just like in the K-series I love to watch.

684
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,519
- It feels sensational.
- Lovey-dovey.

685
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,839
It's like falling in love or something.

686
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,320
Som! Can you not overreact?

687
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,999
Toh! How can we not be? It's P'Magic's house!

688
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,099
Yes, dude!

689
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:14,220
And you better not act like a dork there! You must not!

690
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,399
I think you guys should go with me. Please, Som?

691
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,139
I'm not going, How about you?

692
00:51:27,139 --> 00:51:31,640
- Me either.
- Come on. Som.

693
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,459
Jao, you're the chosen one.

694
00:51:46,459 --> 00:51:49,380
No. There's no way I'm going.

695
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,700
I have a bad feeling about this.

696
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,740
- I'm leaving.
- Jao!

697
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,599
Since you sense a bad feeling, you must go even more.

698
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,800
- That's right.
- No.

699
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,920
Jao, please go with me.

700
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,460
No. I don't want to.

701
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,999
Jao! Please accompany me. Please?

702
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,920
I don't want to go alone.

703
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,213
Fine.

704
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,999
- I'll go.
- Yes.

705
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,839
Success.

706
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:35,820
Thank you.

707
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,000
I'll buy you a meal later, okay?

708
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:54,020
Beautifuldaisy: Hmm! I know you're walking back and forth in your room waiting for Magic to call

709
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,920
No, I'm not.

710
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,840
I'm doing my laundry.

711
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,279
Orangemikan: At 10 pm?

712
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,780
Orangemikan: Sure, that was smooth talking

713
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,979
Kaojao: Everyone, don't tease him

714
00:54:19,979 --> 00:54:24,480
Kaojao: He just checks his phone every five seconds

715
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,480
Jao, you snake!

716
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,239
You're exaggerating, Jao.

717
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,959
[There's no way I would do that, Jao]

718
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,719
Kaojao: You want me to go to your room?

719
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,059
Kaojao: Our rooms are next to each other anyway

720
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:45,800
No!

721
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,359
Thank you, Jao,

722
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,439
but it's fine.

723
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,239
[Thanks, Jao.]

724
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:00,199
[But it's fine]

725
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,740
It's not P'Nuea...

726
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,320
Yes, hello.

727
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,580
Hello.

728
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,360
Underwear.

729
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,220
You're wearing white underwear, right? Is it white?

730
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,480
Shit! What the hell is wrong with him?

731
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,479
It's not? Or is it red? It's red, right?

732
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,200
Shit!

733
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,420
I'm wearing white, not red! Asshole!

734
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,460
Who's calling this time?

735
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,420
Oh, shit!

736
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,120
Yes, hello.

737
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,179
Hello.

738
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:45,219
My name is Nuea, not "Shit."

739
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:48,120
Oh, sure P'Nuea.

I'm telling you it's Nuea, not "Shit."

742
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,799
What should I do?

743
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,799
I'm sorry P'Nuea.

744
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,820
Could we skip to the next topic, please?

745
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,880

00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:32,479
And has Thep already told you about the party?

749
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,860
Yes, he has.

750
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:37,359
You can let me know what kind of photos you want me to take.

Oh, sure.

Yes?

756
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:00,680
I heard... that when we like someone

757
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,379
we'll take very nice photos of them.

758
