00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,199
You came to take photos on Lan's birthday. Is that right?

166
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,040
I remember you.

167
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,320
Yes, Sir.

168
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,779
You don't need to take a lot of photos today.

169
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,679
Make yourself at home.

170
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,280
I have quite a few photographers myself today.

171
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,373
P'Nuea!

172
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:46,559
Uncle is so handsome!

173
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,240
Chill, Toh. That's my dad.

174
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,399
P'Toh!

175
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,559
My dear, I can't catch up with you.

176
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,319
- My son!
- Mom!

177
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,479
You're so handsome today.

178
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,639
Isn't this pretty?

179
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,699
- It's really pretty.
- I wanted to wear it but I can't squeeze into it.

180
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,333
Oh, Mom.

181
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,559
- Hello, Auntie.
- Hello.

182
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,239
I'm Toh.

183
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,173
Toh. I have a question to ask.

184
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:18,833
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,759
I heard you're close with Nuea, right?

186
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,999
Yes. We're seeing each other right now.

187
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,439
We're seeing each other right now.

188
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,360
What?

189
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,660
I meant... the two of us are close.

190
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,480
Oh, I see.

191
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,490
It's great that you're close, dear.

192
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,020
Toh is adorable.

193
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,340
Just like Nuea told me.

194
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,919
Thank you so much.

195
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,279
- Hello.
- Oh!

196
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,479
- Hello
- Oh, hello.

197
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,600
- I'll take care of the guests first.
- Yes, Mom—... I mean Auntie.

198
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,899
- This way.
- Yes.

199
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,619
Oh, thank you so much.

200
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:07,559
P'Nuea, do you think Uncle knows about us?

201
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,139
Actually, I've already told my mom.

202
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:17,319
But I don't know if she told my dad or not.

203
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,879
P'Nuea! Why didn't you tell me sooner?

204
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,759
I was so startled.

205
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,279
Hey.

206
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,630
Let's have a seat at our table.

207
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,599
- Let's go.
- Yes, I'll follow you.

208
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,960
- This way.
- Yes.

209
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,813
Toh?

210
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,000
What's the matter?

211
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm nervous.

212
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,199
No need to be nervous. Okay?

213
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,040
P'Nuea!

214
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,499
I haven't seen you in ages. You've been keeping a low profile.

215
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:20,679
I didn't go anywhere.

216
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,159
I just want to spend time with my lover.

217
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,193
Lover?

218
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,560
Please excuse me. I'll go take photos.

219
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,759
Where are you going, Toh?

220
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,599
It's time to eat now.

221
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
Why are you going to take photos?

222
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,020
Excuse me.

223
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,870
- May I have this one?
- Yes, of course, Khun Nuea.

224
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,060
Try this one. It's good.

225
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,619
You're so nice, P'Nuea.

226
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:52,770
You allow the photographer to sit and eat with us.

227
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,639
You were saying that you have a lover.

228
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,100
Who is the person? I'm so curious.

229
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,779
Nong Pie, you're here already!

230
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:12,979
You look so beautiful. Hello.

231
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:16,319
Wait a minute. I heard the word "lover".

232
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,460
Who's the lover of who?

233
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,920
Toh, you know who Nuea's lover is, don't you?

234
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,260
Right. I'm also curious to know who Nuea's lover is.

235
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,039
Well...

236
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,439
Why are you asking me this, Uncle and Auntie?

237
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,560
I have a reward for you.

238
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,860
That's right. There's a reward.

239
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,779
A reward?

240
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:03,180
There's a reward. There's a reward.

241
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:11,460
There's a reward.

242
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:19,110
There's a reward. There's a reward. There's a reward.

243
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,119
I, Thima promise to have and to hold Nimman

244
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,579
for better or worse,

245
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:34,919
in sickness and in health.

246
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,779
I will love and cherish Nimman from this day forward

247
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,820
till death do us part.

248
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,700
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

249
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,920
Bravo!

250
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,360
Dad!

251
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,480
- Dad, no! Please don't!
- Move aside!

252
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,479
Dad!

253
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,313
- Dad!
- Move out of the way!

254
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,320
Dad!

255
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,439
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.

256
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,380
Nong Pie, lead your parents to their table, dear.

257
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,199
Wow, I love the scent of your perfume.

258
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:16,900
- You're gorgeous today.
- Thank you.

259
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,120
You've met Pie already, correct?

260
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,839
Yes, Sir. I've met her.

261
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,620
At first, I planned to match her up with Nuea,

262
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,960
but I just found out that Nuea has a lover already.

263
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,740
Toh, you know who Nuea's lover is, don't you?

264
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,193
It's...

265
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,073
Well...

266
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,693
So...

267
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,979
It's me.

268
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,513
What?

269
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm P'Nuea's lover.

270
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,460
What if I tell you to break up?

271
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,780
What are you going to do?

272
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
I will break up with him.

273
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,280
Everyone.

274
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,739
I'd like to thank each and every one of you for coming today to celebrate my father and mother's anniversary.

275
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:43,639
I'd like to ask all of you to raise your glasses and make a toast for my parents.

276
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,759
All right.

277
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,040
Hip, hip, hooray!

278
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,720
And, because today is an important day for my family

279
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,590
I'd like to take this opportunity to tell everybody here

280
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,940
that I have a lover now.

281
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,500
My lover is Toh.
(T/N: Toh means table in Thai)

282
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,753
Table? What?

283
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,660
Which one? Which table?

284
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,379
My lover is Nong Toh.

285
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,559
♫ Everything about you ♫

286
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,599
♫ What you go through, good or bad ♫

287
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,839
♫ There is me who notices it ♫

288
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,979
♫ I'm right here (watching you all along) ♫

289
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:06,219
♫ In my own space, I've never thought of bothering you ♫

290
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,519
♫ Just like that (always secretly watching you) ♫

291
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,980
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

292
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,019
Come take photos together.

293
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,199
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

294
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,079
♫ That there's someone who's been watching you ♫

295
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,840
Thank you.

296
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,939
Earlier, when I told you to break up, would you break up with him that easily?

297
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:46,120
Actually, it wouldn't be easy. But...

298
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,440
I wouldn't be able to continue dating P'Nuea if his family disapproves.

299
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,339
Besides, you and Auntie have raised P'Nuea so well.

300
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,779
You've given him nothing but the best.

301
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:05,980
I think... if you think I'm not suitable for him,

302
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,670
I would accept it and leave.

303
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,900
Hey, be more confident.

304
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,799
Let me tell you something.

305
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,980
As Nuea's dad, I don't like choosing anything for him.

306
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,519
He's pretty fussy.

307
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,720
He prefers making his own decisions.

308
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,379
Love should be their choice, right?

309
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:35,919
It's better for old people like us to just cheer them on from afar.

310
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,453
Right?

311
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,620
Does this mean...

312
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,319
you approve of our relationship, uncle?

313
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,999
This is the year 2022.

314
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,940
Stop calling me Uncle and just call me Dad.

315
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,639
And call me Mom. Okay?

316
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,620
- Say it.
- Yes, Mom.

317
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,740
- Yes, Dad.
- Let's take pictures together.

318
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,000
So, what do you think about my dad?

319
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,240
What the heck is he doing?

320
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,559
- What's he smiling about?
- Yeah.

321
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,460
What's up with him?

322
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,580
Who's he saying bye to?

323
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,299
Well. Since you're smiling from ear to ear like this

324
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,980
it can only mean things went well last night, huh?

325
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,919
Do you guys want to hear it?

326
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,959
Of course, we do. Tell us.

327
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,600
Tell us quick.

328
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,879
Well... I went to P'Nuea parents' anniversary yesterday.

329
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:20,440
And I took pictures together with his family.

330
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,299
Your hubby's dad is so cool.

331
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:31,159
He also said that he'll take me along for a holiday trip abroad during the semester break.

332
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,090
You scream louder than me.

333
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,680
Don't tease me, Som.

334
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,799
Toh.

335
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,239
You took photos with his family, right?

336
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:47,039
You didn't bring back anything weird with you, right?

337
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,799
That's right!

338
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,700
Did you take anything back with you?

339
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,173
No...

340
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,400
What a relief.

341
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,880
No way I would ever miss the chance!

342
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,599
- A pig's head?
- A pig's head?

343
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,819
What do you think?

344
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,959
- Did P'Nuea see it?
- He didn't see.

345
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,580
The pig's head, Jao!

346
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,520
[St. Stephen]

347
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,520
May I sit with you?

348
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,390
D!

349
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,639
What's happened, Daisy?

350
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,499
Why are you dressed like this?

351
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:02,359
Yeah. Exactly.

352
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,120
I think you're up to something, for sure.

353
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,300
- Tell us.
- Yes, tell us now!

354
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,600
- Speak!
- Hurry up.

355
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,820
- Quickly!
- Tell us!

356
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,539
There's nothing.

357
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,760
All you need to know is from now on I am...

358
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,799
"Day," the manly masculine man.

359
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,939
I'm no longer the feminine Daisy you used to know.

360
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:24,690
[Dear little dog]

361
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,840
Wow, that was so manly...

362
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,840
- That gave me chills.
- Yes, Day.

363
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,259
So manly.

364
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:38,719
But don't let me know what you're up to.

365
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,879
I will hunt for the truth.

366
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,050
- It'll be over for you.
- So over.

367
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,899
- You'll be done.
- You won't make it.

368
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:47,519
Gosh! Whatever.

369
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,020
Let's head to class or we'll be late.

370
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,839
Yes, Sir.

371
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,879
Hurry. Follow my lead.

372
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,713
Yes, Sir.

373
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,279
He changed the subject.

374
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,019
- So scary.
- I think something must have happened.

375
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:00,039
- Hey, hey.
- Huh?

376
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,739
- That way.
- The elevator is that way.

377
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,799
Oh yeah. I was going that way anyway.

378
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,279
Right.

379
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,160
Follow me.

380
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,819
- Is he possessed by a demon spirit?
- This kind of thing can happen?

381
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,039
- Yeah.
- Is he going to be all right?

382
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,099
Hello, students.

383
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:15,879
- Hello.
- Hello.

384
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,299
It doesn't sound lively at all.

385
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,499
Those in the back row, please submit your assignments before we start.

386
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:25,019
As for the front rows, I can tell you haven't finished it. So keep doing it.

387
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:27,560
This way. Come here.

388
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,679
Would you like to redo this?

389
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,959
Go ahead and redo it so you can pass.

390

- Come in.
- Hello, professor.

- I hope you are doing fine.
- I'm good.

- Jao.
- Yes?

444
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,020
It's like you don't know Daisy that well.

445
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,519
Daisy is a trans woman, it's not like she caught a cold.

446
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,479
It's not like Daisy can take some medicine and suddenly change.

447
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,913
Well...

448
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,219
If you want to change your appearance, I'm okay with that.

449
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,833
But this...

450
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,610
Even someone like Toh can tell you're lying right now.

451
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,460
- Som.
- It's true though.

452
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,333
So...

453
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,050
what's happened to you?

454
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,599
Seriously, you have to tell us.

455
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,740
This is overboard.

456
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,999
If you don't tell us, I'll call P'Touch right now.

457
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,960
- Don't.
- Toh.

458
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,773
All right!

459
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,140
Actually...

460
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,399
the day I went to have noodles with P'Touch.

461
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,839
Yes?

462
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,460
I overheard the conversation he had with his friends.

463
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,380
His friends said I was too girly.

464
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,180
I'm afraid P'Touch will be...

465
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,479
embarrassed...

466
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:53,720
So, I try to change myself like this.

467
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,920
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

468
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,670
Daisy, you're embarrassed because P'Touch's friends said those things?

469
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,993
Hey.

470
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,599
So what if you're girly?

471
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,479
P'Touch likes you the way you are.

472
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,219
That's why he's pursuing you, isn't it?

473
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,870
Why bother listening to what other people say?

474
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,560
Daisy.

475
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,740
Whether you are Day or Daisy,

476
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,280
there's nothing wrong with that.

477
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:39,200
All of us, Jao, Toh, and Som, are always by your side.

478
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,420
Everything will be okay.

479
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,360
There's still me here.

480
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,480
Thank you, you guys.

481
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,140
Daisy, listen to me.

482
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,880
I'm not saying this because I'm angry at you.

483
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,980
But it's because I care about you.

484
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:27,060
I don't want to see you not acting like yourself like this.

485
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,720
Me too.

486
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,220
But... if you really think you want to change yourself

487
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,210
I'm ready to support you.

488
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,850
But first, you must promise me that

489
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,160
you won't force yourself. Can you do that?

490
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,860

Yes.

Okay.

You've promised. Don't push yourself too hard.

Don't force yourself.

True. Aren't you gonna do anything about it?

P'Sky found out about it already?

Yes, he did.

As far as I can tell, he's not.
