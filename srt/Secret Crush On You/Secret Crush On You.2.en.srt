Hello, passengers.

Is this what he really wants to do? All right.

In the event of an emergency, please walk toward the left.

However, should you be in the wrong outfits,

turn back around and get changed.

- Right.

I think you should change your outfit.

00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,459
It looks uncomfortable.

31
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,999
Yes, I feel uncomfortable just looking at you. Don't you feel it?

32
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,859
- True. It looks suffocating.
- Go!

- I don't even want to imagine it.
- You're right.

- Hey, guys!
- What?

that you have to stop calling P'Magic by P'Magic first.

- Oh? How come?

What should we call him then?

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,919
Don't you remember the photo I sent for the competition?

68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,539
I think he remembers the name of that one.

69
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:46,019
Okay, then what do you want us to call him?

- I don't know.

128

- No way!
- I'm prettier!

- Nuea, I forgot to wear my false lashes!

Can't nerds take photos?

149

Sure, why not? But I want to see your skills.

150

Can you try with a phone camera?

151
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,920
Just you wait.

152
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,559
Never mind. It's wasting my phone memory.

What the...?

154

- Okay.

156
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,940
Nuea, open the door, please.

157
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,080
Then... I'll get in the car first.

158

159
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,980

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,499
Where have you been? What took you so long?

164
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:32,450
There. Ask the young master Nuea. It took him forever to pick me up.

165
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,419
Took so long.

166
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,139
Nong Toh. Nong Kaojao.

167
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:43,299
This is P'Fon, P'Khongkwan and P'Tor.

168
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

169
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,120
Is he the photographer? So cute.

170
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,830
What? Where's the cuteness? I can't see it at all.

171
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,273
Toh!

172
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:03,400
Nuea, go see Nong Ran. I'll take care of things here.

173
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,750
Are you done introducing yourselves?

174
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,640
Let's go, Nuea.

175
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,979
You come here.

176
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,979
P'Nuea! P'Toh!

177
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,959
You really come!

178
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,939
I saw the photo you took of P'Nuea and I totally love it.

179
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,439
You took such a beautiful photo.

180
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,519
Thank you very much.

181
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,919
I'm so happy to finally get to meet you!

182
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,770
- May I shake your hand?
- Yes, of course.

183
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,479
Happy Birthday, Nong Ran.

184
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,599
This is a present from me.

185
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,739
It's a limited edition wallet from the newest collection.

186
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,540
Thank you.

187
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,659
And... is that my present as well?

188
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:53,180
Oh... y-yes.

189
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,219
P'Nuea, look at it! It's so pretty.

190
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,279
Thank you so much.

191
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,879
- Sure.
- Let me go show dad.

192
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,413
Sure.

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,833
She likes it.

194
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,380
It's very pretty.

195
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,120
It's fine, Toh. We're here to work.

196
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,480
It's a bummer, Jao.

197
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,300
I even came all the way here.

198
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,419
I don't dare to take anything back with me.

199
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:50,300
Everything seems so expensive.

200
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,580
Toh!

201
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,400
What? Why?

202
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,380
We're here to work.

203
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,093
Yes...

204
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,800
Jao, I'll take the photos from this side, okay?

205
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,573
Hey.

206
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,530
Why haven't you dressed your wound yet?

207
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,380
Otherwise, you'll say I hired you but don't take care of you.

208
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,800
I will get rid of it myself.

209
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,799
It's fine, Toh. I'll do it.

210
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,019
Er... I'll do it, really.

211
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,839
It's totally all right.

212
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,100
It's okay. Let me do it. Hey, Toh! Toh!

213
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,940
Suit yourself then.

214
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,540
Where have you been? I've been looking for you.

215
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,319
What is it?

216
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,853
P'Nuea.

217
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,020
- P'Nuea, really?
- Yes.

218
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,980
One, two, three!

219
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,519
Thank you. What's this?

220
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,959
Happy Birthday, Ran. I wish you all the happiness.

221
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,279
Thank you so much.

222

I really like your picture, Phi. It's beautiful.

235
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,000
Thank you.

236
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,479
Let's take the photo now.

237
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
Okay.

238
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,440
Let's take the photo. Come on.

239
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,980
1, 2, 3!

240
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,880
Toh! Everything looks good.

241
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,360
Nong? What are you doing?

242
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,639
Y-Yes?

243
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,679
Feel free to eat.

244
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,719
I asked the maids to reserve the food for you. It's still warm.

245
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:55,420
Yes, of course.

246
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,400
Excuse me.

247
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,479
Make yourself at home. Excuse me now.

248
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,319
Yes, sure. Thank you.

249
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,219
I was so nervous.

250
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:14,370
That was a close one. What were you doing?

251
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,280
Come. Let's eat.

252
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,800
Aren't you going to eat, Toh?

253
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,260
I don't want to eat it...

254
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,680
I want to collect it.

255
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:45,060
You can't! How can you collect it? Here. Eat this.

256
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,820
Toh, move a bit.

257
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,280
Here it is.

258
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,600
There is so much food. Let me taste it.

259
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,140
So good. Do you want to try?

260
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,580
- Sure.
- Here.

261
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,140
Thanks, Jao.

262
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,079
- Toh, the shrimp is so good.
- Yeah yeah. So good.

263
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,539
How's it going boys? Is the food good?

264
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,980
How's everything?

265
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,999
It's tasty isn't it?

266
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,860
- May I sit with you?
- Please do.

267
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,279
Do you want to eat?

268
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,819
- It's delicious.
- No, thank you.

269
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:13,620
Thank you.

270
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,339
- You don't want one, Jao?
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

271
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:20,279
- Everyone.
- What's up?

272
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,299
Since we're all gathered here,

273
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:25,820
- there should be something fun to do, right?
- Yes.

274

- ♪ Kung, kung, kung, king, king, king! ♪

275
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,599
I will take photos for you.

276
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,720
Please go ahead and play the game.

277
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,540
Nong, you come here.

278
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,180
Working time is over. Play with us a bit, deal?

279
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,799
Since we have newbies today,

280
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,179
allow me to explain the rules.

281
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:53,359
You all already know how to play, of course.

282
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,499
Yes.

283
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:56,479
Just a moment.

284
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,900
Let me explain the rules.

285
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,999
The game is called "I'm Your King". You do as you're told.

286
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:06,819
First, I'm giving each one of you a horoscope card.

287
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:12,339
Next, I will roll the dice to see what task you have to do

288
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,960
and who you must do it with.

289
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,159
Do you understand?

290
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,739
I don't want to...

291
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:20,079

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,720
Toh!

328
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,979
- Jao, you all right?
- What?

329
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:19,179
- I don't wanna do it.
- Are you okay?

330
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,899
How about you continue? Let's go.

331
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,240
- All right. Come, let's play. You first, Kwan.
- Me?

332
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,840
- Yes, come here.
- Come on.

333
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,159
Jao. I envy you.

334
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,079
Envy? Here. Take it.

335
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,359
Oh, no no.

336
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,359
- I don't want it either.
- I don't want P'Sky pursuing me.

337
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,460
The one I want to...

338
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,759
One, two, three!

339
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,799
♪ Kung, kung, kung. King, king, king ♪

340
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,600
♪ What does Ai Nuea have to do today? ♪

341
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,980
The cards are all the same to me.

342
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,199
"It's all the same," you say.

343
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,879
You're dead, dude.

344
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:02,020
Shit! He gets to "kiss"!
[Kiss]

345
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,853
Kiss!

346
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,160
Kiss with who?

347
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,559
I want to know that as well.

348
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,059
- Come.
- Everyone, one, two, three!

349
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,859
♪ Kung, kung, kung. King, king, king ♪

350
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:19,160
♪ Who will share a kiss with Ai Nuea today? ♪

351
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,739
- Who is it?
- Well, not me at least.

352
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,320
- Is it you?
- No.

353
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,039
I-It's me.

354
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,493
Toh!

355
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,539
I feel bad for him. Should we draw again?

356
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:59,719
Fon, rules are rules.

357
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,339
Take a look at him first, will you?

358
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,439
- Unless Ai Nuea is a coward.
- Are you brave?

359
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,879
- Do you dare?
- Right.

360
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,079
I don't mind,

361
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,960
but look at Nong. Can he handle it?

362
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,380
I am very okay.

363
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,839
My friend is okay. He can do it.

364
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,799
If he's okay...

365
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:36,700
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

366
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,579
Nevermind.

367
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,079
Ai Tor! Ai Tor, I think you're next. Let's go.

368
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,559
- Yes, it's me.
- Too slow. Come on.

369
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,579
Let's continue playing.

370
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:38,220
One, two, three!

371
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,040
Thank you for dropping us off.

372
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:57,560
Thank you.

373
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,373
Sure.

374
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,539
You want me to help you carry the equipment upstairs?

375
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:08,039
Oh, that's all right.

376
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,299
The two of has can handle it.

377
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,039
Isn't that right, Jao?

378
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,939
- Right?
- Yes.

379
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:19,460
Toh and I will take of it, P'Nuea.

380
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,070
- It's okay.
- That's right.

381
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,859
Thank you.

382
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:25,979
Well, up to you, then.

383
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,230
I'll wait to see the photos from today.

384
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,620
Yes.

385
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:42,460
Then... I'll go and grab the stuff.

386
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,333
Okay.

387
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:11,339
This is the moment when the lead actor unfastens the seatbelt for the lead actress, isn't it?

388
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,180
What? You won't do it?

389
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,640
You really won't unfasten the belt?

390
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,150
Fine. I'll give up.

391
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,650
What are you doing?

392
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,260
I'm the lead actress.

393
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,893
What?

394
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,833
Lead actress?

395
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,279
Uh... Thank you.

396
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,913
Sure.

397
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,820
Jao, let's go.

398
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,839
P'Nuea, goodbye.

399
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,459
- Thanks so much.
- See you.

400
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,900
Toh, let's go upstairs.

401
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,720
I want to go up, but...

402
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,480
But... but what?

403
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,153
Well...

404
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,120
Is there something wrong, Toh?

405
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,840
Well, today is...

406
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,020
Today is...?

407
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,600
Gosh! I don't know.

408
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,319
Here.

409
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,853
What?

410
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,813
Jao!

411
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,680
Happy now?

412
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,880
Don't you like it?

413
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,393
Well...

414
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,640
What's wrong now?

415
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,440
Actually, I'm not upset about that.

416
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,380
What I'm feeling upset about is...

417
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,020
Gosh!

418
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,199
P'Nuea did the right thing.

419
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,279
Let's think about it.

420
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,619
Who would want to kiss a person they met for the first time?

421
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,053
Right?

422
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:20,270
Then, would you like to be hit on by a person you met for the first time?

423
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,860
Nosy! Stop talking!

424
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,680
If I knew it would turn out this way,

425
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,079
I would have never gone in the first place.

426
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,599
Hey, don't be like this.

427
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,339
If you didn't go, who would have helped me take the photos?

428
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,199
- Please.
- I don't know.

429
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,820
I really won't help you next time.

430
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,439
Jao, please don't sulk. Please?

431
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,990
If you don't go with me, who would help me?

432
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,573
Toh!

433
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,940
What did you collect?

434
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,190
It's just a little thing.

435
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,990
This isn't tiny.

436
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,920
Where is it?

437
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,559
What are you doing here?

438
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,093
Get in the car.

439
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,053
What for?

440
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,273
Hey.

441
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,499
I'm supposed to pursue you for a week.

442
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,300
Did you forget that?

443
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,160
No, I did not.

444
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,450
But I can go by myself. You don't need to drop me off.

445
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,973
Can't do that.

446
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,320
When I pursue someone, I don't let them suffer.

447
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,450
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

448
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,753
Get in.

449
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,893
I won't.

450
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,493
My bag.

451
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,420
My key as well.

452
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,319
Can we get in the car now?

453
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,953
No.

454
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,113
Get in the car.

455
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,520
Don't come near.

456
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,220
Get away from me!

457
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,933
Move aside.

458
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:14,100
You're in the way of the car door.

459
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,640
Get in. Quickly.

460
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,880
P'Sky...

461
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,260
Please sit down.

462
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,460
Do you want me to carry you inside?

463
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,753
Here.

464
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,510
- It's dark. Switch the lights on.
- Do it for me.

465
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,339
-That's nice.
- Very nice.

466
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,539
- Is it good?
- It's pretty.

467
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:09,259
I think we should take more photos just in case, but take this out.

468
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,019
Let me see.

469
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,459
It's awesome!

470
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,799
Hey, do you think we should take this one out?

471
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,839
Let me see.

472
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,040
- It's awesome. We'll get an A for sure.
- It's good, right?

473
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,940
Try to take another photo.

474
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,259
This one is nice.

475
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:27,993
Hey guys.

476
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,650
You need my help on this?

477
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,939
Help us present!

478
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:42,019
Present how things went last night!

479
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:44,359
How did you get that kind of photo?

480
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,799
Right?

481
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,459
Toh, apart from taking photos,

482
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:51,859
you're now editing photos too?

483
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,620
- I will file a report!
- You'll be charged!

484
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,839
What editing?

485
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,390
For someone like me,

486
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,520
it's a real photo.

487
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,460
Which means... the guy that you kissed was P'—

488
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,280
- Don't.
- P'Red, right?

489
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,319
Which shrine did you pray to? Tell me.

490
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,559
True! How did you end up kissing him?

491
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,399
Tell us quickly.

492
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,599
- Come on, sit! I want to know.
- Tell us.

493
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,060
Quickly. Sit, sit, sit.

494
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,853
Jao!

495
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,980
Oops. Such a coincidence.

496
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,420
Or... is it destiny?

497
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,740
How could you forget what I prepared for you?

498
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,013
Here.

499
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,120
You may leave now.

500
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,059
Did he smell nice?

501
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:17,259
Were his lips soft?

502
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:19,800
- Did he smell nice?
- Jao!

503
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Study hard, alright?

504
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,759
- Hello.
- Hello.

505
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,359
Hello.

506
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,800
- You study hard as well, P'Sky.
- Love you.

507
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,420
"Study hard!"

508
00:45:14,939 --> 00:45:17,840
What did P'Sky give to you, Jao?

509
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,319
And... how did you come to the uni this morning?

510
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,799
Yes, Jao, how?

511
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,859
What about your kid, "Tob"?

512
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:31,780
- Don't tell me...
- P'Sky's car, right?

513
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,299
So when P'Sky said he was going to pursue you...

514
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,833
Toh!

515
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,180
Meaning you and P'Sky are...

516
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,499
Lovey-dovey...

517
00:45:46,499 --> 00:45:49,259
- Right? Right?
- That's not it, Som!

518
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:51,560
It's not what you think it is.

519
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,100
Actually... it's just a game.

520
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,419
P'Sky was only tasked to do it for a week.

521
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:06,419
What game is it? I wanna play too.

522
00:46:06,419 --> 00:46:09,010
He belongs to your friend.

523
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:16,959
Then... it's not just me who's having a crush now, right?

524
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,199
"Nong Jao, study hard~"

525
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,580
Little cutie.

526
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,339
He's all shy now.

527
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:31,260
Fine, Toh. Since you're teasing me so much.

528
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,640
I'll just delete all the pictures. You dumb thumb!

529
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,653
Wait...

530
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,699
- What's with the thumb?
- Because...

531
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:46,320
The photo that Toh uploaded last night,

532
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,960
In fact...

533
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,720
Jao! Jao!

534
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,953
Jao!

535
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,000
Ai Toh!

536
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,679
Did you fool us?

537
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,730
It was a fake kiss!

538
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,419
What's going on?

539
00:47:09,419 --> 00:47:11,153
Well...

540
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,699
I didn't lie, though. The photo is real.

541
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,760
It's a real photo, but the kiss is fake!

542
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,719
You liar! You exaggerated beyond the truth!

543
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,939
- That's right!
- Come here right now!

544
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:22,039
- Come here.
- Come.

545
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,779
- Go.
- You're dead, Ai Toh.
- Jao!

546
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:26,839
- Since you like to tease me so much.
- Yes, come here now.

547
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,799
- Go now.
- Quickly.

548
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,979
- Quick.
- Sit down.

549
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:32,890
- Sit.
- Sit down.

550
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,139
- You dare to fool us?
- That's right. Tell us now.

551
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:39,859
The truth only, please.

552
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:41,619
What's up?

553
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:46,460
But it was like a real kiss though... it's—

554
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,619
Jao!

555
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:49,959
Huh! What kiss? Your imaginary kiss?

556
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,819
I can do that too.

557
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:54,079
- Jao.
- Come, Daisy. Let's do it

558
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,739
Yikes! No way. That's a taboo

559
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:58,200
Hey!

560
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,019
"My Magic"

561
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:07,380
- "My Magic"
- "My Magic"

562
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,000
Hey, that almost hit my face!

563
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,539
Look, look at him. He's crazy for men. Just like you.

564
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:20,699
- Som.
- What?

565
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,279
I would go too.

566
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,879
Yes, me too, actually.

567
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,813
- Hey.
- What?

568
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,900
- Sit.
- Come.

569
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,079
You're not off the hook, Kaojao dear.

570
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,140
So, tell us how you arrived with P'Sky. Speak.

571
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,900
Spill it now.

572
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,080
Don't make me go ask P'Sky myself.

573
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,719
Dear deities,

574
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,940
please let me be in my right mind. Satu!

575
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,940
- Hello, P'Nuea?
- Hello.

576
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,780
What were you doing? What took you so long to pick up my call?

577
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,680
Oh, my phone was on silent mode.

578
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,899
Did you have a reason for the call, P'Nuea?

579
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:50,099
I'm calling to ask when the photos will be ready.

580
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:52,980
Nong Ran asked me about it.

581
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,440
Oh, this evening is fine.

582
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,440
I finished editing them.

583
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,020
Then let me see the photos first. At your dorm, okay?

584
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,210
You're free this evening, right?

585
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,480
Yes. Yes, I'm free. This evening is good.

586
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,160
Okay.

587
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,100
- See you then.
- See you, P'Nuea.

588
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,719
Come here. Speak.

589
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,120
Tell us right now!

590
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,399
- Tell us!
- Tell us!

591
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:05,799
Hurry up

592
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,859
Tell us!

593
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,799
You two, look at him. This one is in euphoria.

594
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,100
I'm so irritated.

595
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,960
Go ahead and be irritated. I couldn't care less.

596
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,600
Because... I'll meet P'Red this evening.

597
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,239
Shit!

598
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,739
Why are you guys meeting up often?

599
00:51:41,739 --> 00:51:45,259
- You're quite fast these days.
- That's true.

600
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,320
It can't be helped.

601
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,539
He's the one who wants to meet up with me.

602
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:58,180
He said he wanted to come check out the photos at my dorm.

603
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,139
Where did you say, Toh?

604
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:10,699
Well, my dorm room.

605
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:13,759
- He will come to my place.
- Huh?

606
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,779
Toh, are you insane? Think about it.

607
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:21,360
Ai Toh, listen to me

608
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,459
You have to come to your senses!

609
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:26,240
Why? P'Red is coming, that's all.

610
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,900
You're going to let him enter your room?

611
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,619
Don't you remember what you have inside your room?

612
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,760
My room. Well...

613
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,060
The wall... wall...

00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,720
