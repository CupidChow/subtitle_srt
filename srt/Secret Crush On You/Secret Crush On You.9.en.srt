21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,019
- Look! It's in a heart shape.
- Yeah!

22
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,939
- It's so romantic.
- It looks so yummy, Toh.

23
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,559
Right!

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,559
Toh.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,980
This one is also pretty.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,740
- Hey.
- Huh?

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,173
Toh?

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,479
Hey. What's with you?

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,919
You've been acting like this since morning.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,279
Right.

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,679
Well...

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,299
- It's almost Friday, you guys...
- Friday?

33
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,159
- And?
- Yeah?

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,560
So what?

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,460
I planned an exercise session with P'Nuea.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,339
Why are you screaming?

37
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:01,380
Are you going to play badminton?

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,279
Or basketball?

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,500
Gosh, Jao!

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,299
Don't be so naive!

41
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,780
They're probably going to play a Pétanque match.

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,759
When lovers make plans to exercise,

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,699
what would it be about, Jao?

44
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,919
- Think. Think about it.
- Lovers who exercise—

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,640
Huh? Really, Toh?

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,619
Acting like you didn't know...

47
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:29,670
So you do understand the reference.

48
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,500
You're too much.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,340
- So what are you worried about?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,320
Well, I'm not ready, you guys.

51
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,019
Do I have time to cancel right now?

52
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:53,439
- Cancel it completely.
- I think you still can.

53
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,700
He won't force you to do it, right?

54
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,139
Can I still do it?

55
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,299
I don't think you can. You've already made the plan.

56
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,520
- How can you cancel?
- Right.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,200
How could someone like him not be ready?

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,119
Come on and tell us what are you going on about.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,019
Right.

60
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,060
Well, I...

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,640
I've never done it before.

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,879
Do you think he will be impressed?

63
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,260
Hold on a sec. Are you planning on topping him?

64
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,660
He plans to top P'Nuea.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,459
I'll challenge you. If you can top P'Nuea,

66
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,300
I'll let you use up whatever amount I have on my debit card.

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,780
Well, the point is you have 50 baht remaining on your card.

68
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,759
He can't withdraw that amount anyway.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,759
You're so poor, Daisy. Uh-oh, Toh's sulking.

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,279
What is it?

71
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,879
- What's wrong?
- Fine fine.

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,620
What exactly are you worried about since you plan to "take" him?

73
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,819
What?

74
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,219
What kind of condoms do you think I should buy? The regular or ribbed ones?

75
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,359
Strawberry flavor or the super thin ones?

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,739
What color underwear should I wear? And, do I have to take it off for him?

77
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,919
What positions should I practice? What about the helicopter position?

78
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,559
Should I warm up my voice? Should I moan in a high tone,

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,799
or like a low tone? Like, ha-huh—

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,839
No, no! Don't!

81
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,679
- What happened?
- Quit it! This is embarrassing.

82
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,199
- I need to warm up.
- Cover his mouth. Cover it.

83
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,579
Ugh! Enough already. Not a word! Shush!

84
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,480
It's embarrassing.

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
I think you should let P'Nuea take charge of this.

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,039
- Yeah, true.
- Right?

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,299
I think so too.

88
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:54,239
- Trust me. Don't think too much.
- Yes, it'll be better.

89
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:00,600
Just watch. I'll make you withdraw all your money on Monday, Daisy!

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,759
- Toh.
- Yes?

91
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,319
If you're ready, just take it off. All right.

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,540
I'll prepare myself.

93
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,293
Yes.

94
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,479
Oh, you'll get it for sure.

95
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,580
It wouldn't come off.

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,980
Good. He's not here yet.

97
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,160
Have you prepared the stuff?

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,640
I have.

99
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,839
Toh!

100
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,860
Huh... yes?

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,500
This is an insult.

102
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,060
For me, it has to be this size.

103
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,773
Toh?

104
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,100
Uh... er... yes?

105
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,579
Why haven't you got dressed yet?

106
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,899
We're going to the fitness gym downstairs, right?

107
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,280
Huh!? Fitness gym?

108
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,940
- Yes.
- What?

109
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,413
Or was your interpretation...

110
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:33,160
of exercising something else?

111
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,040
Uh, n-no!

112
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,640
It's the same as yours.

113
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,330
Why are you startled?

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,100
You touched them when we were at the camp.

115
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,750
The lessons that we practiced...

116
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,900
still have more training.

117
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,940
Are you interested?

118
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,193
Yes.

119
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,500
If you want to take training,

120
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,580
hold on to me.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
But if you don't...

122
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,150
just slightly push me back.

123
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,020
I'll back myself off.

124
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,000
Why are you sulking?

125
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,520
I'm just here for class.

126
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,300
But it's the weekend, Toh.

127
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,090
We could have spent time together instead

128
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,980
so that I can train you a bit more.

129
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,259
P'Nuea, enough already.

130
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,140
You've done a lot last night.

131
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:24,080
But my class sessions must be taken regularly

132
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,980
or else you won't be able to complete the course.

133
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,700
P'Nuea, that's enough.

134
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,860
Fine. But...

135
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,210
Toh, you must not forget...

136
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,920
that we have our exercise session every Friday.

137
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:15,180
You have to attend every session to complete the course.

138
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,333
Do you understand?

139
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,973
Yes.

140
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,080
P'Nuea!

141
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,340
Right, Toh.

142
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,160
I have a gathering at the pub for my line-code tomorrow.
(T/N: "Line-code" are student numbers given to each student)

143
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,119
I promise I won't get drunk.

144
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,470
I'm letting you know this in advance.

145
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,793
All right.

146
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:13,360
Then, I'm heading off to class first.

147
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,140
Thank you for giving me a ride.

148
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,333
Of course.

149
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,600
Here he comes. That troublemaker.

150
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,620
Come here right now.

151
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,699
It took you forever to get out of the car.

152
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,119
I thought I had to send a palanquin to pick you up from there.

153
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,000
So, how was last night, Toh?

154
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,299
There was... nothing.

155
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:50,620
It's just that I will be booked every Friday from now on.

156
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Because I have training sessions.

157
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,340
What training session?

158
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,440
In fact, you can add another rule to our squad.

159
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,419
"Fantastic Fridays,"

160
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:11,740
"P'Nuea will teach Gym Class."

161
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,580
A crown, Toh! Take the crown!

162
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,653
Here.

163
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,639
Just you wait.

164
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:30,940
I'll call you every Friday to nag so you can't focus on training.

165
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,240
You're so evil!

166
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,233
You guys.

167
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,659
Do we have PE class on Friday?

168
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,259
Nevermind him. I'm hungry. I feel hungry when I see you.

169
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:46,819
- Let's grab some food.
- Let's go.

170
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,079
- Follow me.
- Okay.

171
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,079
- Go.
- Wait for me.

172
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,560
- Follow me.
- Jao.

173
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,740
- What?
- I have something for you.

174
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Here, I'll give these to you.

175
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,779
Toh! Why are you giving me these?

176
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,840
Take them back.

177
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,359
No, Jao.

178
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,539
I know that safety is a priority when it comes to this matter,

179
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:28,020
but we didn't get to that stage yet last night.

180
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,379
Also... I don't think I'll get to use them.

181
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:34,040
I bought the wrong sizes.

182
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,910
You keep them to use with P'Sky, okay?

183
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,899
- Toh.
- What?

184
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:41,680
Stop teasing me.

185
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,533
How come?

186
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,120
P'Sky and I...

187
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,560
is probably impossible.

188
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,680
Why do you say it like

189
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,850
you also like him?

190
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,253
I do not.

191
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,019
Jao.

192
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,820
How many years have we been friends?

193
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,260
How would I not know what's wrong with you?

194
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,100
- Toh.
- Huh?

195
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,340
P'Sky and I...

196
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,140
It's impossible.

197
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,040
How can it be impossible

198
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,939
when P'Sky likes you

199
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:52,179
and you also like P'Sky?

200
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:54,020
So...

201
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,280
What's the problem here?

202
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,870
I think I have an idea.

203
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,859
Our faculty is so cool. They booked the entire venue for the gathering. Cool!

204
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,159
- Cheers!
- Yeah!

205
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,519
Bottoms up! You have to drink it all.

206
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,839
Toh.

207
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,259
What were you thinking dragging us to a pub?

208
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,079
The "one equals four" rule, you used it to drag us all the way here, huh?

209
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,859
Come on. We're best buddies, right?

210
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:49,480
Besides, do you guys know the word, "teamwork?"

211
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,879
If you're here to spy on P'Sky, you better watch out.

212
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,219
It might just be your hubby who slips.

213
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:58,860
- True.
- That's right.

214
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,319
What are you saying?

215
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,540
What hubby?

216
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,460
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

217
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,690
- Should we really be doing this?
- Just follow my lead.

218
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,219
Damn it, Toh!

219
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,199
You really are good at multi-tasking, huh!?

220
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,799
I have to give it to you.

221
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,633
Agree.

222
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
- Cheers.
- Come come.

223
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,879
- Oh, hey. Hello.
- Hi there.

224
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,659
- Hello.
- P'Touch, hello.

225
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,220
- Hi, everyone.
- Let's clink our glasses.

226
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,199
- Go for it. Go for it.
- To the fullest.

227
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,600
- Bottoms up.
- Yeah.

228
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,899
Have fun.

229
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,399
- Sure.
- I'll go back to my table now.

230
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,433
I'll see you over there.

231
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,970
What's up with you and P'Touch?

232
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,180
It is what it is.

233
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,399
- Will anyone spot us?
- No, they won't.

234
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:05,440
We blend in so well.

235
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,479
Hey, what's this?

236
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,499
- You're only feeding each other.
- Right.

237
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:13,059
- You want some?
- There're only 2 dishes of this snack.

238
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,560
- You guys!
- What?

239
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,660
P'Prao's squad is here.

240
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,359
What kind of line-code gathering is this?

241
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,339
All the popular people are here.

242
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,273
Damn right.

243
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,320
Can we sit here?

244
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,160
No.

245
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,360
Sorry. Sorry. Oops.

246
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,720
Please make way.

247
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,599
Are you okay?

248
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,159
I'm all right. What a coincidence.

249
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,260
Sure.

250
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,020
Tor! Sit down. Don't get up.

251
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,980
Sit. Stay right where you are. Do not move.

252
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,839
Jao.

253
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,359
But I don't think Sky is playing along with her.

254
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,719
Yeah.

255
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,739
He doesn't look as dumb as those male leads in the dramas.

256
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,479
That's true.

257
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,239
Don't overthink, Jao.

258
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,840
Right. Don't stress yourself out.

259
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,639
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

260
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,240
Not stressed out, Not one tiny bit.

261
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,639
Toh.

262
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,879
Why do you keep drinking?

263
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,679
Didn't you say you're here to help Jao?

264
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,479
- Aren't you thinking of doing something?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:55,620
Look over there.

266
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
Oh, no, no, no.

267
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,913
Like this.

268
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,300
- Do something.
- Yes.

269
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,739
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

270
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,940
Are you going to slap them?

271
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,639
- I'm going to pee.
- Damn it, Toh.

272
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,780
Heads down!

273
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,620
I'm sorry.

274
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,039
Hey, kid. Are you drunk?

275
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,420
Thank you so much.

276
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,593
Excuse me.

277
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,050
This person is mine.

278
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,520
Yes.

279
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,353
Come, Toh.

280
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,579
Jao, I think the situation looks bad.

281
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:06,199
You must do something.

282
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,199
You have to show yourself.

283
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,619
I agree. I think you should just go there

284
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:16,259
and catch him red-headed. Find out if he's got something going on.

285
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,040
Yeah.

286
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,959
But, I don't think we have to reveal ourselves.

287
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,319
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

288
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,639
Because someone is caught in the act already.

289
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,180
- Huh?
- Where?

290
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,833
Toh.

291
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,440
Sit properly.

292
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,660
- Go.
- Go Go.

293
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,819
Toh.

294
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:52,500
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

295
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,333
Jao.

296
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Are you here to drink as well?

297
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,993
Meddlesome!

298
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,610
What about you, Little One?

299
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,260
- Are you here often?
- Um... Not really.

300
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,900
But we have some business to attend to today.

301
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,660
Then, don't get too drunk.

302
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,093
I'm worried.

303
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,460
He's worried...

304
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,420
Who?

305
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,259
- Som, Daisy.
- Huh?

306
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:56,260
I think we should return to our table.

307
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,759
I... I don't feel comfortable here.

308
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,259
Then what about Toh?

309
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,599
- Yeah.
- What do we do?

310
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,433
Let's leave.

311
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:09,459
Jao. Jao, where are you going? I'm coming with you.

312
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,193
Stay still.

313
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,579
Let's get back to the table. Let's go.

314
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,859
Going back?

315
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Stay with me right here.

316
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,120
Don't go anywhere.

317
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,113
But...

318
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,770
you have to be with your friends.

319
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,193
It's fine.

320
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,340
I don't want to be with anyone else.

321
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
I want to be with you.

322
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Why are you so sweet, Ai Sky?

323
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,060
I mean, it's… bad

324
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,919
Your lover?

325
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,679
No, it's not Phi.

326
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,080
But your standing here hugging him like this?

327
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,960
No, Phi. He's not my lover.

328
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,519
Wait a sec, P'Sky.

329
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,070
- How could you say that?
- That's right.

330
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,620
He's not my lover...

331
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,880
because I'm currently pursuing him.

332
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,020
Oh, my god.

333
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,539
That's my bro. So cool!

334
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,600
- I hope you succeed soon.
- Thank you.

335
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,799
Stop teasing him. Let's go.

336
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,200
Come on.

337
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,653
Toh.

338
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,800
P'Sky, how serious can someone like you be towards Jao?

339
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,080
Or are you thinking of playing around?

340
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,540
Rest assured, Toh.

341
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,600
I am serious.

342
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,599
I seriously like him.

343
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,799
I'm seriously going after him.

344
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,700
And I seriously want to date him.

345
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,159
Marvellous.

346
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,119
You can take him.

347
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,579
- Take him home with you.
- Be careful.

348
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:08,279
- Sit still.
- Ugh! I'm leaving, then.

349
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,720
Get home safe, Nong Peach.

350
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,999
- Would you like me to give you a ride?
- Ride my ass!

351
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,400
Move!

352
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,660
Okay.

353
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,360
It's time to say goodbye.

354
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,880
Goodbye, everyone.

355
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,420
"It's time to say goodbye."

356
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,200
- There's still one left.
- Oh?

357
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,980
Are you not leaving?

358
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,900
P'Nuea...

359
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,900
P'Nuea.

360
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,320
I'm leaving then.

361
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,840
Bye-bye, P'Prao.

362
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,939
I think we should leave as well.

363
00:32:24,939 --> 00:32:26,599
Nuea, I'll leave the youngsters to you.

364
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,620
Yeah, all right.

365
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,580
Come, let's go.

366
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,570
Who said I will go back with you?

367
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,979
Will you agree to go nicely,

368
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:00,230
or do you want me to carry you?

369
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,613
Fine. I'm going.

370
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,980
If you agreed right away, it would have been okay.

371
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,820
Back off!

372
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,813
Jao.

373
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,999
Seniors, I think we should go dance.

374
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,719
Let's go.

375
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,339
Toh, come. Let's dance.

376
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:59,839
I don't think he can dance now.

377
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,590
Don't worry about him, P'Nuea. I'll take care of him.

378
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,700
Thank you so much, P'Sky.

379
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,193
Hey!

380
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,840
Why did you come in?

381
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,840
There's something I'd like to ask you.

382
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,073
Sure.

383
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,580
Why did you say those things?

384
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,750
What do you mean?

385
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,900
The things you said in front of other people.

386
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,260
Why? You don't like what I said?

387
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,270
I just want other people to know that I'm serious about you.

388
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,020
Especially you, yourself.

389
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,540
I want you to know this the most.

390
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,020
And... have you thought about this carefully, P'Sky?

391
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,780
Let me ask you seriously, Jao.

392
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,360
Is there anything that still makes you doubt me?

393
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,140
I used to play around but I already quit.

394
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,740
Right now,

395
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,100
I'm just a lost puppy

396
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,220
that's waiting for your love, Jao

397
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,660
Please adopt me.

398
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,600
I promise I'm easy to keep. I'm tamed.

399
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,100
And I love my owner a lot.

400
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,333
Stop it.

401
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,060
I promise

402
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,860
I won't disappoint you.

403
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,180
- May I hug you?
- Hm?

404
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,980
Well...

405
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,600
Are you sure about this?

406
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,299
Just a little. Only two seconds.

407
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:13,040
Two seconds.

408
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,759
Please?

409
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,220
One. two.

410
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,990
That's enough.

411
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,240
P'Sky. That's enough.

412
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,800
P'Sky...

413
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,510
It's already two seconds.

414
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,153
P'Sky.

415
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,770
Have a good night,

416
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,260
my lover-to-be.

417
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,833
You're crazy.

418
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Go home already.

419
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,073
Leave now.

420
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,079
Drive safely.

421
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,713
Okay.

422
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,000
Goodnight.

423
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,720
P'Sky.

424
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,380
"Lover-to-be."

425
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,930
Are you here by yourself?

426
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,679
I'm with my lover.

427
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,100
Where's your lover, then?

428
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,850
Must be around here, I think.

429
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,179
You're so handsome. Your lover shouldn't have left you alone.

430
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,479
Hey!

431
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,213
Toh!

432
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:20,753
Huh?

433
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,380
It's like our friend has been insulted!

434
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,073
Exactly.

435
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:35,639
Someone beautiful with someone handsome is a match.

436
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,459
I'm just a side character.

437
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:42,799
Geez, Toh! You can't just let this go!

438
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:45,619
Right. You're letting it go just because you're drunk.

439
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:48,579
- Toh! You're not a side character anymore.
- Right.

440
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,259
You are the main character. That's your man.

441
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,000
Go now. Let them that he belongs to you.

442
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,980
- Go!
- Right. Go!

443
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,090
Who's this guy in glasses?

444
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,600
None of your business.

445
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,960
Don't flirt with my wifey!

446
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,813
Wife?

447
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,340
This is my wife!

448
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,540
Stay back!

449
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,979
Wait for us, P'Nuea!

450
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:19,039
Are you all right?

451
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,680
Please put him down first.

452
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,539
Toh, you're truly a legend today.

453
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:28,759
Yeah, you're unbelievable.

454
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,919
Toh.

455
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,220
- Are you really drunk?
- Are you?

456
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,639
Such a fake.

457
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,839
P'Nuea!

458
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,400
- Som and I can take him back.
- Come here, Toh.

459
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,379
- Hey, we're your buddies.
- Yeah.

460
00:42:49,379 --> 00:42:53,859
It's okay, Nong Som and Nong Daisy. I'll take it from here.

461
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:55,339
- Okay.
- Sure.

462
00:42:55,339 --> 00:43:00,019
And... how are you two going to get home?

463
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,413
P'Touch,

464
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,830
can you do me a favor and drive Nong Som and Nong Daisy home?

465
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,579
Yes, of course.

466
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:16,780
Oh. that's fine.

467
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,550
Ouch! Why did you hit me?

468
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,199
Sending only Daisy home is fine, P'Touch.

469
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,739
Because I will leave with P'Khongkwan. Isn't that right?

470
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:30,979
- With me?
- Yeah, I told you earlier.

471
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,739
- Ah! Right.
- I'm leaving with P'Khongkwan then.

472
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,539
- Som!
- You!

473
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:42,579
You! When did you say that she's coming with us?

474
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:46,199
It was just meant to be us tonight! Me and you!

475
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,299
Alright then, the three of us... let's go!

476
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,599
Come on. Let me give you a hand.

477
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,599
Yes, good girl.

478
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,780
Bye-bye, P'Touch! P'Nuea! Please take my friends home.

479
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,813
Toh, come here.

480
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,800
Please take care of Toh.

481
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,460
Shall we go then?

482
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,959
Let's go.

483
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,360
Will something happen to me?

484
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,059
Sorry. I'm kind of hungry.

485
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,680
Let me have a bowl of noodles.

486
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,200
Oh. Sure, P'Touch.

487
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,360
Such bullshit!

488
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,219
I'm so fed up with you!

489
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:02,179
When there was a flood, I prayed since you told me to do it.

490
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:04,719
But it didn't work.

491
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,879
I'm so done. It's scorching, and I'm so broke.

492
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,140
The working class is so distressed!

493
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,279
- Hello, Sis.
- Aren't you a pretty one!

494
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,359
You look exactly like me ten years ago.

495
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:23,940
Your face looks just like mine. I used to look as pretty.

496
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,219
Okay.

497
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:27,479
Right?

498
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,119
You're still pretty, Sis.

499
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,720
What do you want to eat today? I'll do my best!

500
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,999
- What would you like?
- Then... what do you want P'Touch?

501
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,919
- Sis!
- What?

502
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,079
He wouldn't leave. Just as the fortune teller said.

503
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,839
I knew it.

504
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,660
I knew it! I knew they wouldn't leave!

505
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,079
Next time, when people asked me to join them in the rally

506
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:57,199
I'll make sure I go to the scene.

507
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:58,719
That's right!

508
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,199
I can't take it anymore!

509
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,100
- People are in despair.
- Sis!

510
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,659
- Hey!
- Let's go.

511
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:09,599
Let's go. What are we waiting for, then?

512
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,259
Just a sec.

513
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:14,140
Sis, we don't use weapons.

514
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,079
Of course. I'm a peaceful demonstrator. I don't carry weapons.

515
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,800
Let's go!

516
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,120
Make it yourself!

517
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,339
Is this even possible?

518
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:37,339
Well... I guess?

519
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,160
Then...

520
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,319
Come here, P'Touch. I'll do it myself.

521
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,940
Come, quick.

522
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,340
Here we go.

523
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,279
When I was younger, P'Touch,

524
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,479
I loved to play pretend as a noodle vendor.

525
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,479
I can guarantee that you'll have the best noodles made by me.

526
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,139
It'll be freaking amazing! Just wait.

527
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:15,299
- All right. Then please make it.
- Sure.

528
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:19,740
If a seller is this pretty, I will take anything she cooks.

529
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,293
P'Touch.

530
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,400
You're crazy...

531
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,300
Here, have a bite.

532
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,440
Yum, you're quite good. Do you normally cook?

533
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,459
From time to time.

534
00:47:48,459 --> 00:47:53,460
When my mom isn't home, I love to cook for myself.

535
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,779
As gorgeous and adept as you are, do you have a lover yet?

536
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,419
What are you saying, P'Touch? You're crazy.

537
00:48:16,419 --> 00:48:18,819
Me? How can I have one?

538
00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:22,000
I just have crushes on people.

539
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,499
Then let me ask again.

540
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:28,860
When you said you liked good-looking guys,

541
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,580
am I someone you find likable?

542
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,240
P'Touch, you're crazy...

543
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,220
By the way, you cooked it really deliciously.

544
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,540
I told you, didn't I? It would be amazing.

545
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,480
Shall we go?

546
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,573
Thank you

547
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,660
Well, I already told you.

548
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,600
What kind of husband is this? So stubborn.

549
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Are you having a headache?

550
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,380
No.

551
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,720
Did you bring me here?

552
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,773
Yeah.

553
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,460
But you're being naughty again today.

554
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:32,520
Do you remember what you said before?

555
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,553
Huh?

556
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,820
What I said...

557
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,160
This is my wife!

558
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,300
Stay back!

559
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,440
Hey, Toh. Toh!

560
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,660
I'm so sorry.

561
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,180
It's okay.

562
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,480
If you want to be my hubby,

563
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,150
you can...

564
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,660
Are you serious?

565
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,473
Yes.

566
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,173
But...

567
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,860
If you want to do it,

568
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,740
you have to do "it" by yourself.

569
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,219
P'Nuea! Stay still.

570
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:26,220
Well, if you want to be my hubby,

571
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,340
you have to take the initiative.

572
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,533
Here.

573
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,940
I'll lay still.

574
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,173
Fine.

575
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:10,620
Why is it so difficult, P'Nuea?

576
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,613
Fine.

577
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,540
I'll... give up then.

578
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,273
Give up what?

579
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,899
Give up what, hm?

580
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:36,433
Well...

581
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,220
I'll give in to being your wifey.

582
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,813
Then...

583
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,920
I'll give a special training session.

584
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,220
Trainer P'Nuea will give you,

585
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,940
an intensive lesson.

586
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,979
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

587
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:32,419
♫ That makes my whole heart ♫

588
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:39,379
♫ Feel love since the day you came ♫

589
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:42,959
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

590
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:46,579
♫ That made me realize ♫

591
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:50,199
♫ That tomorrow when I wake up ♫

592
00:55:50,200 --> 00:56:00,400
♫ I will spend every moment, to love you ♫
