Argh! Damn it, Toh!

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,319
What's the matter with you? Why do you keep sighing?

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,380
- You're ruining our mood.
- Yeah.

34
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,300
Well, I...

35
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,079
- What?
- What is it? Tell us about it.

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,299
Are you worried about him?

37
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,820
I just want to be nosy!

38
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,139
Ten out of ten.

39
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,080
Never mind that, tell us about it.

40
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,239
I've become close with P'Red.

41
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,719
And?

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,919
How can I possibly spy on him like before, then?

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,119
What?

44
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,019
See, I don't even dare to go take his standee.

45
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,859
Damn it. I was wondering what this was about.

46
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:11,999
Wait a moment.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,779
Close with him or not, you can't just take his standee.

48
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,579
- It is the property of the University!
- Yeah

49
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,479
Gosh. I thought it was something serious.

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,779
- Anyway!
- Huh?

51
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:26,819
Just now, I walked past Jupjip's gang.

52
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,379
I heard them gossiping.

53
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,941
- And?
- P'Red's squad... will go party tonight!

54
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,910
What kind of party?

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,180
Ugh! Cut it out!

56
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,300
I want to go!

57
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,579
- What is with him?
- Let's go!

58
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:49,219
You were just complaining that you can't spy on him if you're close to him.

59
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:52,320
What is it with you, Toh?

60
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,173
Well...

61
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:57,099
Well, we can sneak a peak in the corner of the place.

62
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,539
Nobody will notice.

63
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:03,719
Toh, someone like you can never fool anyone.

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,959
I think you'll fail. He'll see you for sure.

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,940
Let go of me. And we're not going. So nosy!

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,839
I have an idea.

67
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,159
We may not have to sneak in.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,860
We may go there as guests.

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,519
Hi everyone.

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,020
Hi, Jao.

71
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,299
- Jao.
- I don't have it!

72
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,620
- Jao.
- I'm not doing it!

73
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,653
Jao!

74
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:45,819
I'm busy.

75
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,760
Jao!

76
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,399
What do you guys want from me?

77
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,559
How did you come to the university this morning?

78
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,359
Why?

79
00:05:55,359 --> 00:06:00,239
Do you still have someone to pick you up and drop you off?

80
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,299
- So nosy!
- Hey, he scolded me.

81
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:09,899
Jao, we promise we won't bother you anymore

82
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,139
if you tell us if P'Sky told you that...

83
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,519
Toh, I don't want to get involved with P'Sky.

84
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,079
But why?

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,639
Well, I already told P'Sky that I'm not going.

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,079
You don't want to go, but your friend does, Jao.

87
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,299
- Um.
- Yeah.

88
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:30,139
That friend you're referring to is Toh, yeah?

89
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,999
I meant me!

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,399
It's been a while since the last time I went out partying.

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,979
Jao, please tell P'Sky that you'll go.

92
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,099
Please? Please?

93
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:46,560
Toh, I said I don't want to go, that means I won't.

94
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,059
P'Red!

95
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:58,210
- Pick it up right now.
- Yeah, Pick up right now.

96
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,180
Hello, P'Nuea.

97
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,140
Tonight?

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,739
I'm free.

99
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:10,440
- Is there something you'd like me to do?
- Toh.

100
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,239
Can we really go?

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,399
I'm not going.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,580
All of us can go.

103
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,679
Yes. There's no need for you to pick us up.

104
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,140
We can go there by ourselves.

105
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,479
Yes.

106
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,730
I'll see you there, P'Nuea.

107
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,859
How was it?

108
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,920
Yay! We can go!

109
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,233
Toh!

110
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,919
I said I'm not going!

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,139
Khun Kaojao, dear. Have you forgotten the rules of our squad?

112
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,139
Thee Equals to four.

113
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,080
If three go, all four tag along.

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,279
Okay. Fine.

115
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,339
Yay!

116
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:00,799
- Brilliant!
- Marvelous. Marvelous.

117
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,920
Thank You.

118
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,079
- You're the best.
- Yes.

119

- Thank you so much, Jao.
- Um.

120

- Hey, Di!
- It's Daisy.

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,359
- Hey.
- What?

122
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,239
- I don't feel too confident.
- What's the matter?

123
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,060
Do you think my skirt is too long?

124
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,679
Look at it. Is it too long?

125
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,979
- Is it too long?
- Long. It's long!

126
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,959
- Really?
- Just a bit longer than your panty!

127
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,500
- Argh! How short do you want it to be?
- Really?

128
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,439
Well, I wore something short today

129
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,759
in case I can bag a guy!

130
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,019
Let me do that too!

131
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,599
- Stop it.
- Can't I?

132
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,199
It's embarrassing.

133
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,199
How come Som can wear something short?

134
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,119
But I think you dressed pretty nicely today.

135
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,959
Looking like a cheese bite sausage.

136
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,239
- What is that?
- The sausage from 7-Eleven, you know?

137
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,119
- Hey! You're picking at me!
- Yeah.

138
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,840
But I have confidence!

139
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,150
That's my friend!

140
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,519
Now. Let's go.

141
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,999
- Go!
- Come on!

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,340
- Come.
- Hurry up.

143

Let's sit—

- Hi!

Guys, is this P'Nuea's hand?

What about you? Are you pretty?

160

Toh.

161
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,333
Toh?

162
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,720
If you're not going I'm going ahead.

Don't drink too much. You'll get sick.

165
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,019
- Here.
- Yes.

166
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,800
I poured it for you.

167
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,240
Ah, y-yes.

168
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,300
Thank you.

169
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,153
Thank you.

170
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,400
It's such a waste.

171
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,179
- Toh.
- Hm?

172
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,900
Should we go sit over there?

173
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,399
Um, sure.

174
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,933
Let's go.

175
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Where do you think you're going?

176
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,593
Don't meddle!

177
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,940
Excuse me, P'Nuea.

178
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,640
Let's go, Toh.

179
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,779
Those two boys are acting suspcious.

180
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,780
What's the matter with them?

181
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,753
Excellent.

182
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,119
Toh, I've been thinking about it

183
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,959
Can we clink our glasses?

184
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,140
Yes, of course.

185
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,393
Thank you.

186
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,320
Who was that?

187
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,560
I don't know.

188
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,240
- Nevermind.
- Hey.

189
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,640
Toh, are you really going to do it?

190
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,200
Jao.

191
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,779
How many chances do we get to have someone we like mix booze for us to drink?

192
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't know, but I have to bring some back with me.

193
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,020
It smells nice too.

194
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,120
It's so cute.

195
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,720
I won't be able to drink it.

196
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,900
Hey! Give it back.

197
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,419
Toh.

198
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,153
Shit!

199
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,859
Yes.

200
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,860
You called me "Shit" again.

201
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,560
You never learn, huh!

202
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,880
A kid that doesn't learn is a naughty kid.

203
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,079
Naughty kid! Naughty kid!

204
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,820
What kind of punishment should a naughty kid receive?

205
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,740
Toh!

206
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,620
What is it, Jao?

207
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,080
Toh, why did you bite me?

208
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,219
Then...

209
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,199
You must bite him back, Nuea. Bite him back. Do it.

210
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,340
- Bite him back.
- Yeah yeah.

211
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:08,440
Bite him! Bite him! Bite him! Bite him!

212
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,973
Yes.

213
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,140
I think so as well.

214
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,390
♫ (watching you all along) ♫

215
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,720
♫ (always secretly watching you) ♫

216
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,439
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

217
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,250
Now we're even.

218
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,299
Yes.

219
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,819
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

220
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,559
Everyone.

221
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,119
Cheers!

222
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,180
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

223
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,839
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

224
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,719
Nuea, let's sit over there.

225
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,199
Hey, let's go to the front.

226
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,100
- Quick quick. Let's go.
- Okay, hurry.

227
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,759
- Come on, hurry up!
- Go! Go!

228
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,240
Okay, hurry all right?

229
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,319
Was that reality or was I dreaming just now?

230
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,679
Did any of you take photos?

231
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,799
Who could take it in time? We were all stunned!

232
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,299
True.

233
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,879
- Toh, that was marvelous.
- Agreed. Fab!

234
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,279
What was marvelous? So no one took photos for me?

235
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,713
Here.

236
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,353
Jao!

237
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:16,479
Satisfied now?

238
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,060
- What?
- Let me see.

239
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,500
Why are you screaming?

240
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,900
Let me see.

241
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,980
- Woah!
- It's so clear.

242
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,040
Awesome!

243
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,239
- Look at him.
- Yeah.

244
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,540
- He knocked out after drinking.
- Right?

245
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,640
Ai Nuea.

246
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,080
I know what you're doing here.

247
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,699
If you're going to do that, why don't you pursue him straight on?

248
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,359
Thanks for your concern,

249
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,610
but you'd better worry about yourself.

250
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,900
I am worried about my matters.

251
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,940
- Understood, Little Sky?
- Whoops!

252
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,160
I haven't washed my hands.

253
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,110
What the hell Ai Nuea! That's nasty.

254
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,080
How are you guys doing? Are you still good?

255
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,159
Yes, of course P'Sky!

256
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,860
I'll be fine even after ten glasses.

257
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,519
Great that you're not drunk. Then stay and have fun.

258
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,039
But allow me to take Kaojao back first.

259
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,773
Huh?

260
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,613
Why is that?

261
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:45,919
Well, there's a stubborn kid.

262
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,770
He has a fever, yet he insists to come.

263
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,230
This morning you said you wouldn't come because you were sick, right?

264
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,080
Stop meddling!

265
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,419
Jao.

266
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,419
Are you not feeling well?

267
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,520
Nosy!

268
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,399
Then how about we

269
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,600
- take him back?
- Yes.

270
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,619
That's all right, Som.

271
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,879
I'll call a taxi and leave with Toh.

272
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,079
That's fine. Daisy and Som will take care of everything.

273
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,419
Huh?

274
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,159
Don't worry. I'll drop Jao off.

275
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,819
You want me to take Toh back as well?

276
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:31,739
- Ah, that's okay, P'Sky.
- Yeah.

277
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,659
- We'll take care of Toh.
- Yeah.

278
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:36,319
Please take care of Jao for us.

279
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,439
My pleasure. Don't worry about him.

280
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,359
You can leave now.

281
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,439
- P'Sky, Please take care of him.
- My pleasure.

282
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:47,119
- Please take care of him P'Sky.
- No problems, Daisy. Don't worry.

283
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,679
- Come on.
- Go now.

284
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,639
- Go get some rest.
- Don't be so stubborn.

285
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,759
- Go.
- You didn't tell us you were sick.

286
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,740
Bye-bye! And take your medication.

287
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,030
- Let us know when you're back in your room.
- Yes.

288
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,333
Toh!

289
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,653
Shit!

290
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,940
P'Sky.

291
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,139
Where are you taking me?

292
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:22,440
You're sick, yet you're out partying, huh? I'll drive you back.

293
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,210
You can drop me off right here.

294
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,220
And... how did you know I'm sick?

295
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,159
Jao.

296
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,019
How many days do you think I have been giving you rides?

297
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:50,220
I can tell something is off even with the slightest change.

298
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,499
With your body temperature this high, I can't let you go back by yourself.

299
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,079
Get in the car. I'll drive you back. Quickly.

300
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,713
No.

301
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,013
I'm not going.

302
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,140
Don't be stubborn.

303
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,830
I have a question to ask.

304
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,833
Um.

305
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,840
Why are you doing this, P'Sky?

306
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,750
It's been more than seven days already.

307
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,160
Why are you still doing this?

308
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,600
You don't even have to give me rides.

309
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,420
You're right, Jao.

310
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,280
Seven days passed.

311
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,470
As for the reason why I still keep doing it,

312
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,590
you should try to think about it.

313
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,980
Let's go. I'll drive you back.

314
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,920
Are you coming or not?

315
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,833
I'm not going.

316
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,313
Hey!

317
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,030
What are you doing?

318
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,500
Let go of me.

319
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,760
My sniff kisses are a special medicine.

320
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,733
Hey!

321
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,540
Enough already.

322
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,620
Let me drive you back.

323
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,473
Fine.

324
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,900
Let me go already.

325
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,953
Get in the car.

326
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Can you open the door?

327
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
Would you like my kiss to help you open the door as well?

328
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,433
No need!

329
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,259
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

330
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,519
Be careful of your step.

331
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,839
Ah! What's with both of you? Why are we leaving already?

332
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,940
Ah! Damn it!

333
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,559
You are really...

334
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,199
Ah, Toh!

335
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,559
- Stop nagging so much.
- Toh, you're heavy.

336
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,859
I don't want to go back

337
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,739
I'm done with you.

338
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,020
Toh!

339
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,510
How come you're so drunk?

340
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,560
Who's drunk?

341
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,120
I'm feeling so fine.

342
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,400
How are you going to go home?

343
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,300
Daisy and I will get a ride from P'Tor.

344
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,880
Please take care of Toh, P'Nuea.

345
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
Good luck, my friend.

346
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,540
Let's go!

347
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,180
Thank you for giving me a ride.

348
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,410
Do you still have a headache?

349
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,420
Not anymore.

350
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,039
You still have a fever.

351
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,440
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

352
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,053
Yes, I am.

353
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,040
I've always lived alone.

354
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,670
I know you can take care of yourself,

355
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,420
but it's better if you have someone taking care of you.

356
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,619
Go up to your room, wipe yourself down,

357
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,319
take your medicine, and get some rest.

358
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,970
If you need anything, just let me know.

359
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,593
Okay?

360
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,710
I can take your call all night, so call me if anything goes wrong.

361
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,600
Promise me first.

362
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,833
Jao.

363
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,633
Um.

364
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,630
Is the reason why your face is turning red now because...

365
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,793
you're sick?

366
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,560
Drunk?

367
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,400
Or shy?

368
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,153
Meddlesome!

369
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,480
I'd better leave.

370
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,720
Get well soon. My little cute one.

371
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,260
Leave already.

00:33:52,940 --> 00:34:01,440
Two, three, four, five, six...

422
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,600
Calm down. Breathe. Toughen up, Toh.

423
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,490
I'll come back to look at it later.

424
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,960
I'll be right back.

425
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,639
If you want to have good skin, take care of yourself both, inside and outside.

426
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,459
Avoid sugar. Avoid consuming dairy products. Sleep early.

427
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:50,199
More importantly, don't forget to take the Anti-acne vitamin, CollaAc As recommended by me.

428
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:52,399
one tablet can reduce acne from the entire body.

429
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:55,839
Whether it's on your face, chest, back, or scalp.

430
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,200
It also reduces excessive facial oil.

431
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,613
Toh!

432
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,680
Toh, what's wrong?

433
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,999
- Hurts.
- Hurts?

434
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,179
My leg hurts.

435
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:06,919
- Your leg hurts?
- Yeah

436
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:08,159
Let me see your leg.

437
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,959
Ouch! Not that leg.

438
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,479
No? Is it this side?

439
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,940
Ouch, P'Nuea! No, not this one!

440
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,280
Which one then, Toh?

441
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,059
Neither of them.

442
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:29,700
It's th-the—

443
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,940
One in the middle...

444
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,880
Ouch! P'Nuea.

445
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,559
It hurts.

446
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,520
Then...

447
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,600
Do you need me to help you with anything?

448
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,700
Are you going to help by,

449
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,600
applying ointment...

450
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,720
or is it...

451
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,780
a massage?

452
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:32,260
Or will you... bandage it for me?

453
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,040
Are you nuts?

454
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,100
Let's find something to eat. I'll take a shower first.

455
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,870
Make yourself at home.

456
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,130
Think of this as your own room.

457
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,560
"Think of this as your own room"

458
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,360
You said it yourself, P'Nuea.

459
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,300
[Sky: So, how's your Van Gogh?]

460
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,020
Ah, I can't see anything.

461
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,560
Hey! Hey! Hey!

462
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,520
Hey!

463
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,900
What are you going to do, P'Nuea?

464
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,160
What about you, little one? What are you going to do?

465
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:37,880
I was just wondering what kind of room this is.

466
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,640
It's the room... of secrets.

467
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,380
Take a shower already. Then we can grab some food.

468
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,173
Okay.

469
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,259
We've arrived at your room, right?

470
00:41:57,259 --> 00:41:59,220
Yes.

471
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,520
And... Will you not thank me?

472
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,239
Oh. Thank you so much, P'Nuea

473
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,319
for giving me a place to sleep

474
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,180
and... treating me to a meal.

475
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,280
And...

476
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,260
even letting me borrow your clothes.

477
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,340
I'll wash them and quickly give them back to you.

478
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,140
And when will you give me some of your heart?

479
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,813

Right.

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,833
Toh.

492
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:11,520
Did anything happen in P'Nuea's room last night?

493
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,740
Well...

494
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,800
Nothing happened.

495
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,280
Ugh! The more I think about it, the more upset I feel.

496
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,700
Jao, I shouldn't have been drunk last night.

497
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,513
Hey, you!

498
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,080
Sorry, sorry.

499
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,520
But this is really something.

500
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,040
- Yeah.
- What is P'Nuea's nickname?

501
00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:49,519
- "The pub hunter"
- "The pub hunter"

502
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,619
But think about it. He dragged our friend all the way back to his condo but did'nt even lay a finger on him.

503
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:56,300
Our friend is really something. Right?

504
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:58,159
- Girl.
- Huh?

505
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,379
I think P'Nuea adores Toh like a younger relative.

506
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:04,360
In a "no sexual attraction involved" kind of way.

507
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,699
- Ouch, so mean.
- Fine!

508
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:11,060
So what if he doesn't hunt me?

509
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,959
I'll be the one to hunt him myself!

510
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,919
- Ooh?
- Stop!

511
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,759
What the heck?

512
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,839
Watch out for cars.

513
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,760
Toh!

514
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,279
Toh! Wait for me too!

515
00:45:26,279 --> 00:45:28,580
- He's playing it big again.
- Quick quick.

516
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,059
- Hey, Ai Nuea.
- What's up?

517
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,379
I met your boy today.

518
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:38,539
He's actually pretty cute.

519
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:42,160
When he smiles, his eyes form a single line.

520
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,420
When I see him I'm reminded of baby powder.

521
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,460
Ai Tor!

522
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,579
You're talking way too much. That's my boy!

523
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:52,979
Are you being possessive with this one?

524
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:55,330
Can't I give him a little compliment?

525
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,879
Of course, you can praise him, but you're crossing the line now.

526
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,699
Then how about I go tell him this,

527
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:10,680
"Nong Van Gogh, you've made my friend fall head over heels for you."

528
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,239
Why? You can't handle it or what?

529
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,979
Hey, where are you going?

530
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:23,140
Ai Nuea, wait for me!

531
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,940
"Van Gogh"

532
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,199
- Where's the paper?
- Didn't you buy one?

533
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,733
Huh?

534
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,140
What will we draw on then?

535
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,940
Toh, didn't you say you would return P'Nuea's clothes?

536
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,980
Toh, is there something wrong?

537
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,240
Is it a "code red"?

538
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,880
How red is it?

539
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,250
It's red... like...

540
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,840
Bleeding and hurting deeply.

541
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,560
Tell us what happened.

542
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,439
Ai Tor, you're talking way too much. That's my boy!

543
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,799
Why? Are you protective of this one?

544
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,150
Can't I give him a little compliment?

545
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,279
Of course, you can praise him, but you're crossing the line now.

546
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,059
Then how about I go tell him this,

547
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:32,100
"Nong Van Gogh, you've made my friend fall head over heels for you."

548
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,120
"Van Gogh?"

549
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,340
But. Well...

550
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,480
I haven't heard of anyone named Van Gogh in our university.

551
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,439
I'm serious.

552
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,100
Me neither.

553
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,199
Maybe it's a nickname, like mine.

554
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,179
Yeah. That's possible.

555
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:03,039
Van Gogh...

556
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,240
Van...

557
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,099
Maybe P'Nuea is referring to English words?

558
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:12,619
How so?

559
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,839
- Som, try to keep up with me a little.
- Okay.

560
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,799
"Van" refers to a van or freight car.

561
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,919
"Go" means travel, depart, or leave.

562
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,879
If you put both together, it means "travel by van".

563
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,959
Does he mean he wants to be with a van driver?

564
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,610
Is that right?

565
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,359
I don't think that's the case.

566
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,819
Why would he like a van driver?

567
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:38,353
True.

568
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,440
And someone like you is going to drive a van?

569
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,420
Make sure you can ride a bicycle first.

570
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,679
Don't think too much.

571
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,540
But he seems to really like that person.

572
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,479
- You know?
- Hm?

573
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,719
I've been watching him secretly for so long.

574
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:05,620
I've never seen him like someone this much.

575
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,860
Besides, he calls the person...

576
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,040
- His boy.
- Oh.

577
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,273
Toh.

578
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,159
Listen to me. Don't think too much of it.

579
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,880
I think there's nothing behind it.

580
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,400
Oh, I have an idea.

581
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,070
I think I may have a way to help you.

582
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,800
Why don't I go ask someone for you?

583
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,470
Maybe we'll get to know who Van Gogh is.

584
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:54,939
Does the person's name start with "S" and ends with "Ky"?

585
00:50:54,939 --> 00:50:56,620
Daisy!

586
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,220
Be quiet.

587
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,820
Stop overthinking things, okay? There are four of us.

588
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,539
If we investigate, we'll find out who this Van Gogh is.

589
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:13,580
You should cheer up now.

590
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,873
All right?

591
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,959
Don't stress yourself out.

592
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,500
- Come. Group hug.
- Group hug.

593
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,719
You make me sad as well when you feel sad.

594
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,559
- Same.
- Me too.

595
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,959
Thank you all so much.

596
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,599
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

597
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,219
But it's all right.

598
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:45,939
It's a rule for...

599
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,899
the person who has a secret crush.

600
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,920
Hey!

601
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,599
- Are you surprised?
- There he is.

602
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,280
Of course, I am.

603
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,179
So why is Ai Nuea in such a good mood?

604
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:08,879
Look at how happy he is.

605
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,559
I think he's in a good mood,

606
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:15,179
because I told him about Nong Van Gogh.

607
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,990
It was right after he got out of your car this morning.

608
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,139
Oh? Nong Toh came with him?

609
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,779
Well, I picked them up this morning.

610
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:27,459
Both Jao and Van Gogh.

611
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:30,079
Hey, dude.

612
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,819
Did you drink so much liquor you've gone nuts?

613
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:36,020
It's long past 7 days. Shouldn't you let the kid go already?

614
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:38,980
Or are you serious this time, Sky?

615
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,679
Very clever of you, Fon. I am serious.

616
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,159
When I like someone I want them to know so I don't miss my chance.

617
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,600
Oh!

618
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,819
Oh. Toh.

619
00:52:57,819 --> 00:53:00,459
Go. Go and ask him directly.

620
00:53:00,459 --> 00:53:05,060
It's better to ask about Van Gogh so you're clear.

621
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,730
When did he bring?

622
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:32,620
Here. I'm here to return your clothes.

623
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,100
I already told you there was no rush.

624
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,390
And, do you have class?

625
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,140
Yes, I do.

626
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,980
What time will you finish?

627
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,400
I'm not so sure.

628
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,560
Are you okay?

629
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,360
P'Nuea! I have something to ask you.

630
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,399
Do you... know Van Gogh?

631
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,679
And... Do you like him?

632
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,239
If you like a "van driver" or "Van Gogh,"

633
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,639
I will learn how to drive a van for you.

634
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,019
Just let me know where you want to go.

635
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:50,160
I will take you

636
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,160
until you forget about that darn Van Gogh.

637
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,460
Please start a new life with me.

638
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,333
Toh.

639
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,913
Is something the matter?

640
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,253
It's nothing.

641
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,440
Hey, Toh!

642
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,539
Please excuse us.

643
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:13,359
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

644
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,893
Jao.

645
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,760
- Toh.
- Toh!

646
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,820
What was that?

647
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,300
Come on.

648
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,340
- At least you got to return his clothes.
- Yeah.

649
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,599
Toh.

650
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,900
I think you should not pay any attention to the Van Gogh thing.

651
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,820
I understand your feelings.

652
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,560
Hey, hey.

653
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,380
I have some good news to share.

654
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,273
Here.

655
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,199
The gallery in front of our campus is organizing a photo competition.

656
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,000
Shall we do it?

657
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,379
What do you think? Would you like to send a photo to the competition?

658
00:57:26,379 --> 00:57:28,759
Yeah, I'm in.

659
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,259
Then we can practice our skills.

660
00:57:31,259 --> 00:57:34,180
But, where should we go to take photos?

661
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,790
Not around here again, all right?

662
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,520
How about Samed Island, you guys?

663
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,059
Well, we can go take photos there.

664
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:52,159
It's also a great opportunity for Toh to take a break.

665

Want to go?

- Good idea, Som.

Me. You.

Jao.

669
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:09,720
Or do you have to ask permission from your boyfriend-to-be first?

670
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,180
That's not it, Daisy!

671
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,820
All right. I'm in.

672

- Yeah.

673

- Toh, what do you say? Are you going?
- Right.

674
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,130
Let's go together, Toh.

675
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,773
Deal?

676
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,140
- Come.
- Power up time.

677
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,019
- Daisy!
- Som!

678
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:41,899
