We're not upset or anything.

We only ask for one thing.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,879
Please don't come around us anymore.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,499
It's better that you know now

5
00:00:07,499 --> 00:00:11,739
so from now on... I can do what I want to take him from you!

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,439
But isn't this before we've started dating?

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,239
I love you, P'Nuea.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,219
I love you too, Toh.

9
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,819
You all must go to Suphanburi with me.

10
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,839
I wonder... if it's a good idea to take P'Nuea with you.

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,120
How about putting everything here?

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,693
Toh.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,920
Seems like your dad is not so fond of me.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,279
Aren't you overthinking it?

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,339
Actually, my Dad just looks stern.

44
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:42,020
I'm with you. The way he stared at you

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,240
actually gave me chills.

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,313
Toh.

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,130
I think your dad surely knows about us.

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,893
Yes.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,119
In fact, I think my Mom was the one who told him.

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,459
I knew it.

51
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,580
That's why Toh's Dad looked at you like that.

This is going to be a tough job for you, Ai Nuea.

- Right, right. I'm going.

- Nong Som!

- Hurry up.

Jao, where are you going? I'm coming with you.

- Come here.

66

- I can't sweet talk a bit?
- No, he's mine.

Oh, this looks so nice. Very pretty!

Are you thirsty? I have some fresh coconuts ready for you.

Yes, Mom. I'm so thirsty.

- I picked them from our front garden.
- Thank you.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,919
This is delicious food.

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,599
- I brought this for you.
- It has to be cut...

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,500
He knows that Dad is sulking.

That's great, Dear! Very good!

82

Let me join in as well. I want to dance too.

83
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,059
Go ahead! It's a dance troupe.

84
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:10,400
Okay, yes. Move your body!

85
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,519
- You don't really want to dance, do you?
- Probably not.

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,399
Toh, hurry.

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,039
Hey, calm down, dear. You're going to make your father lose his image.

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,639
You keep insisting on eating.

89
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,519
You'd better finish it or I'll make sure you regret it.

90

Mom, calm down.

91

Ah, perfect timing. Come on, move your body.

92

Yeah, keep moving your body.

- Go now.
- Okay, okay.

Hey, kids!

98
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,890
I prepared some snacks. Let's eat snacks first.

99
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,419
- That's awesome, Mom. Thank you!
- Thank you.

100
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,039
Let's have some sweets for appetizers first.

101
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,079
I'll prepare today's dinner myself.

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,030
If there's anything you want to eat, just let me know. I'll make it for you.

103
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,719
But I've never met this one before.

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,339
I don't know what you like. Do you have any allergies?

105
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,479
Can you eat spicy food? My dishes are known to be quite spicy.

106
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,079
- I can eat spicy food.
- You can, great.

107
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,439
- What about prawns? Are you allergic to prawns?
- Mom, he's mine!

108
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,139
Dear me, can't I just touch him a little?

109
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,810
No...

110
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:28,679
Mom, please let me help you today.

111
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,860
Perhaps I can add some culinary skills as a charm.

112
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,439
Why do you need cooking skills?

113
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,420
Everyone sitting around here are all dating, right?

114
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,039
I never thought Toh would be dating, but look at that.

115
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,760
He has zero skills!

116
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,119
Mom! I'm your child.

117
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,100
Of course, you are. That's why I'm happy you have a lover.

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,919
- Mom.
- Yes?

119
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Actually, I want to come here to properly introduce myself...

120
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,620
to both you and Dad.

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,780
Actually, I wanted to come and apologize

122
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,719
to you both for shocking you with the unexpected relationship

123
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,300
between me and... Toh.

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,719
I'm not startled, Dear. I'm not weak-hearted.

125
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,919
This is nothing to be surprised about. What era are we in now?

126
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,039
Why would there be anything to be shocked about? Don't overthink.

127
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,859
I'm totally fine with it.

128
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,779
Really, I'm not stressed out or anything.

129
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,599
Why are you startled? You're overthinking. Don't assume I'll be like that.

130
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,200
Toh opens up to me about everything.

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,499
Mom, you're really cool.

132
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:09,380
Besides looking young, your mindset is also modern.

133
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,519
You're good-looking and such a smooth talker. You understand elders.

134
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,860
You're a true sweetheart, huh?

135
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,439
Oh, no. Oh, dear...

136
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
Mom, they're dating.

137
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,470
You don't keep your composure at all, hm?

138
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,779
Mom, aren't you going to tease me too?

139
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,659
- I could do that if you don't mind.
- Hey!

140
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,710
Why would you say that?

141
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,940
That's it. No more drinking for you.

142
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,999
My dear, Som. Have you got enough coconut water?

143
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:50,339
Would you like some more? I have a garden full. It'll help you calm down.

144
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,400
I will go tease that one over there.

145
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,510
He's just standing still. Hey, Honey!

146
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,980
Honey, can I touch your cheeks?

147
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,599
- He's sulking.
- He's jealous because I touched my son's friend's cheeks.

148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,039
- Everyone, raise your glass.
- Cheers.

149
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,773
Let's go!

150
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Let's get it started!

151
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,720
- Like this? This?
- Yes, that's right!

152
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,440
Hurry, hurry.

153
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,380
Well...

154
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,760
- I... I'll get more ice for you.
- Huh?

155
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,340
Hey, can't you wait just a minute, Som? What's with the rush?

156
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,419
Oh, P'Touch. Is there something you need?

157
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,120
I actually don't want to back off.

158
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,999
But seeing what you're doing...

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,380
But I'm transgender.

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,600
Don't you find it weird?

161
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,660
Even if you're a man...

162
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,640
and ask me to be your wife,

163
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,739
I'm willing to do it for you.

164
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:58,240
So does that mean I can go back to being my usual self again?

165
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,530
Like the slutty one, okay?

166
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,773
Cheers!

167
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,999
Bottoms up, everyone. Bottoms up!

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,780
Hey, stop!

169
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,440
Daisy is back!

170
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,980
- Let's go.
- Music, please!

171
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,400
My bestie is back!

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,780
I'm heading to bed now. I've exceeded my limit.

173
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,100
Out of my way. I'm going.

174
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,359
- Hey, I'm coming with you.
- Let's go!

175
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,319
P'Touch!

176
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,060
Wait for me.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,819
I'll go check how Som is doing.

178
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:06,639
Jao, where are going? I'm coming too. Hurry.

179
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,159
- Are you all right?
- Toh...

180
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,859
It's a piece of cake. I can do ten more glasses.

181
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,120
Gosh!

182
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,719
Nong Jao, watch your step. You'll fall.

183
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,900
We're still here as a pair.

184
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,079
Oh, they're all gone. I'm going too.

185
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,860
- Hey, you all.
- Toh, keep it down.

186
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,130
- Toh!
- P'Nuea.

187
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,699
Toh.

188
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,619
Lower your voice.

189
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,100
Your parents will wake up.

190
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,973
Wake up?

191
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,899
Wake up...

192
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,119
Aren't they all asleep?

193
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,940
And...

194
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,620
Why aren't you sleeping, P'Nuea?

195
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,079
It's because I have to look after my little monkey here.

196
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,799
- Come on. Get up.
- Nuea....

197
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,399
- Lower your voice, Toh.
- Are you scolding me, P'Nuea?

198
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,160
Toh, let's go to bed.

199
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,100
Toh!

200
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,819
Toh?

201
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:22,560
Today is Friday. Are you not gonna "tutor" me?

202
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,199
Please, please, please.

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,539
We can't, Toh. Be careful. Toh.

204
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,719
- Otherwise, I'll jump in the water.
- Toh! Toh!

205
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,550
All right. All right.

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,270
I'm here. I'm right here.

207
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,519
Toh!

208
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,199
Stop yawning.

209
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,839
Remove the chili stems. I want the small red peppers.

210
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,059
Make sure you remove the stems entirely.

211
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,079
And this here, the tamarind is too watery.

212
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,699
You have to separate and squeeze them. Don't waste the juice.

213
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,779
Yes, you can use the spoon to do it.

214
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,259
And what are you doing?

215
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,959
Look at all your friends. They each have a task.

216
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,839
I'm fanning and giving you a massage, of course.

217
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,639
Don't just press onto my leg and call it a massage! You silly kid.

218
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,579
You guys in the back, are you doing okay?

219
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,819
- Do you know how to light up the stove?
- It's no problem, Mom.

220
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:29,680
Easy, yet I don't see any sign of a flame.

221
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,639
- Plenty of smoke here.
- Okay, that seems okay.

222
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,639
Don't play with raw food. I'll turn you into food itself if you don't eat it.

223
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,339
Do it well, there.

224
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,380
Hey, focus on what you're doing.

225
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,200
No, add extra.

226
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,060
I think one more should be enough.

227
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,313
Toh.

228
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,980
How are you? Do you still have a headache?

229
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,759
My head doesn't really ache.

230
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,100
But my body aches instead, P'Nuea.

231
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,800
Did I fall last night?

232
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,980
Last night...

233
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,239
Hmph. The better question should be "How many times did you fall?"

234
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,759
You were so drunk you gave the ghost in the room a headache.

235
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,399
- That's true.
- Yes!

236
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,420
You were too much.

237
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,739
- Honey.
- Yes?

238
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,919
I'm going to go clean up the garden.

239
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,479
- Well, let's continue.
- Ah, right.

240
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,139
That's good, Jao. Peel them nicely.

241
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,540
Mom!

242
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,299
Can you reach for the lime for me? I dropped it.

243
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,459
What's with you? You're so young.

244
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,319
Why do you still watch "Nang Nak"?
(T/N: Famous horror movie in Thailand)

245
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,550
It's been over 20 years since the film was released, you know? Enough already.

246
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,360
It was scary!
(T/N: A popular scene from the movie was the ghost reaching for a lime)

247
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,993
Toh.

248
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,113
I'll be right back.

249
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,873
Okay.

250
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,119
You can take a break. We have to wait for this kid to finish.

251
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,420
Mom, see. It'll melt soon.

252
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,640
- Let's go. Come on.
- Okay, Mom. Jao, let's go.

253
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,033
Dad.

254
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,700
About last night...

255
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,253
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,020
Why are you apologizing?

257
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,599
It's normal for young people these days when they're in a relationship.

258
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,060
But next time if you're going to do anything, do it in the room. Do you understand?

259
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,353
Yes, Sir.

260
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,560
I'll be careful next time.

261
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,460
I won't let this happen again.

262
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,920
I'll take good care of Toh

263
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,980
and not do anything disgraceful.

264
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,200
Good.

265
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,120
Dad.

266
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,033
Now what?

267
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,020
I really love Toh.

268
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,620
If you have anything else you don't like,

269
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,150
please let me know anytime.

270
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,700
I hate that you're handsome.

271
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,419
Oh, what the heck?

272
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,353
Gosh.

273
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,959
Dad, I promise you

274
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,960
that I will not flirt around. I will not cheat on Toh.

275
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,839
I will only have him.

276
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,879
I don't care whether you're a player or not

277
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,380
because you're still handsome regardless. I don't like it.

278
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,939
- Oh, well...
- I'll have to interfere.

279
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,780
I agree.

280
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,730
- Please do, Mom.
- Do your best, Mom.

281
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,919
Dear, my honey.

282
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,739
What seems to be the problem, Dear?

283
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:47,359
Look, the kids are all scared now.

284
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,859
Come on.

285
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:51,419
We're so old that our hair is turning grey.

286
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,870
Why are you still sulking?

287
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,579
Isn't it your fault that I'm like this?

288
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,213
Huh?

289
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,573
Here.

290
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:11,560
♫ You're the magic in my life ♫

291
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,279
Nuea, look at my phone wallpaper screen.

292
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,480
You can go ahead and look. There's no passcode or anything.

293
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,813
Here.

294
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,720
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

295
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,339
Gosh, Mom!

296
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,859
You cropped me out again!

297
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,699
Well, you're not as good-looking as P'Nuea.
(T/N: She refers to Nuea as Phi because she's following her son)

298
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:50,599
Be better looking so I don't have to crop you out, my dear.

299
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,999
See, that's why my lock screen only has P'Nuea.

300
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,919
Mom!

301
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,330
Well...

302
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,640
What's this about?

303
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,539
Actually, my dad isn't upset about anything in regard to you, P'Nuea.

304
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,659
He's being jealous because of his wife.

305
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,460
His wife

306
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,879
is crazy for good-looking men.

307
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,799
Toh, what nonsense are you talking about?

308
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,620
Who's jealous? I'm not.

309
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,799
Look at this old woman.

310
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,299
She grins from ear to ear whenever she sees good-looking people.

311
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,839
She should have been more reserved when her son-in-law pays a visit.

312
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,040
She's ruining the system here.

313
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,180
Am I right, Daisy?

314
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,720
Ah, yes, Dad.

315
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,079
What I mean is, you really are jealous!

316
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,879
- You're right, Daisy!
- Absolutely!

317
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,879
- I'm jealous?
- Yes!

318
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,559
- How?
- Gosh!

319
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,359
That was loud.

320
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,880
I actually heard Ai Sky say earlier that you're so good-looking.

321
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,519
Hey, this one knows how to talk.

322
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,839
Then, I'll let this one sleep inside the house.

323
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,519
Let the rest sleep outside.

324
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,199
Don't even be ridiculous, you old man!

325
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,619
Let the good-looking ones sleep inside the house. We can sleep outside.

326
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:24,159
Who was the one that complimented him? You can accompany him and sleep outside.

327
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,279
Toh, you come as well. Let's all sleep outside

328
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,430
Such an annoying bunch.

335

Let's have a coconut-picking competition!

336
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,519
The losing team must...

337
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,119
pay for the meal.

338
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,499
We're good. This is easy peasy.

339
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:09,600
- How about it?
- Do you want to start now?

340
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,939
Three, two, one start!

341
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,000
- How do we do this?
- Hurry! Hurry!

Hey, do it like this! Like this!

Huh? Oh, here's one. Yay!

344
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,099
We got one! We got one!

345
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,819
Got it. Got it!

346
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:29,240

353
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,473
Here.

354
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,070
What kind of crazy person would bring two hats with him?

355
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,560
A crazy person who's your boyfriend.

356
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,700
Since I'm your boyfriend, I should always be mindful, right?

357
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,180
Yes.

358
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,760
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

359
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,659
What are you doing?

360
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,340
I'm grating the coconut.

361
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,359
So... what do you think about this place, P'Nuea?

362
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,200
Is it beautiful?

363
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,833
It quite beautiful.

364
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,940
What are you smiling about, Toh?

365
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,179
Well... beautiful... right?

366
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,140
I'm talking about the banana trees.

367
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,880
The banana tree?

368
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,879
Didn't you tell my Dad that you wouldn't be a player?

369
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,479
Hey! Toh!

370
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,759
Toh. I'm sorry.

371
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,620
I didn't know you'd be jealous even of the banana trees.

372
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,839
I don't discriminate. I'm jealous of everything.

373
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,519
Toh! Toh! Calm down. Calm down.

374
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,959
Calm down. Put it down first.

375
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,980
You're pretty. You're the prettiest.

376
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,019
Put it down, okay?

377
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,953
All right.

378
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,993
Toh.

379
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,320
I really want our parents to meet.

380
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,100
Let me know when your parents plan to go to Bangkok.

381
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,173
Of course.

382
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:15,140
But before that...

383
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,333
Hm?

384
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,079
Can I take a photo of you as a keepsake first?

385
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,460
Please, come on. All right.

386
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,799
Come here.

387
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,659
Who takes a photo keepsake alone?

388
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:31,399
They take them as a couple.

389
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,033
Huh?

390
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,499
Hey, you didn't even count. Do it one more time

391
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,179
- Not like this.
- Check it out.

392
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,159
Geez. Let's do it again. I'll do the setting myself.

393
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,020
Hey, not yet. Ah, count first. Gosh!

394
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,173
Toh!

395
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,019
- Yes?
- Let's hurry up and pack.

396
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,359
Mom and Dad are calling for us.

397
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,359
- Yeah, come quickly.
- Quick, quick.

398
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,219
Okay, let's go.

399
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,839
- Let's go.
- Go go.

400
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,780
- Hurry, hurry.
- Come on.

401
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,800
Be careful there!

402
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,780
Let's hurry up.

403
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,679
♫ No matter what you do ♫

404
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,759
♫ What you're thinking or who you're with ♫

♫ Just like that (always secretly watching you) ♫

412

♫ It fulfills my heart, this is all I'm asking for ♫

413
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,420
Come here.

414
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,199
- I'll wash it for you.
- Thank you.

415
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:49,160
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

416
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,779
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

417
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:58,119
♫ There's someone who's been watching you ♫

418
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,859
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

419
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,719
♫ Who has a secret crush on you ♫

420
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,460
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

421
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,560
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

422
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,519
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

423

♫ Oh, baby ♫

424
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,980
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

425
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,199
It happened so quickly, now they're all grown up.

426
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,079
Would you like to stay longer?

427
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,940
- Now you're asking them to stay?
- A day or two longer maybe?

428
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,139
Come come. Sit down.

429
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:39,240
It'll be lonely when you all leave.

430
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,759
Dad, Mom.

431
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,039
We'll have to excuse ourselves and return to Bangkok.

432
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,719
Right. Before you leave, we've talked and agreed that

433
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,339
we'd like to do the handfasting for all of you.

434
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:57,300
Take this as our blessing to you, okay?

435
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,680
Bring out your arm, P'Nuea.

436
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,440
Have a safe trip, my dear.

437
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,560
Please take care of Toh for me.

438
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,499
He's still young. If there's a problem, please guide him.

439
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:17,039
- All right?
- Yes.

440
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,673
Toh.

441
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,879
You keep fidgeting. You just don't know how to stay still.

442
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,999
Don't be self-conceited. Take care of Nuea as well.

443
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,399
As lovers, you should always talk things through calmly.

444
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,059
Be more reasonable and don't just your emotions.

445
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,859
Yes, Mom.

446
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:40,159
I wish you both happiness.

447
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,400
Thank you so much.

448
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,159
Come here now, son.

449
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,693
Nuea.

450
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,880
I know that you're serious about this.

451
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,720
But there's a whole lot more in life.

452
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,540
So, do not rush into tying down everything right now.

453
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:03,639
The knotted string that makes us suffer the most is the one that we tie by ourselves.

454
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:07,460
The tighter you tie the knot, the more uncomfortable you'll feel.

455
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,339
When you feel uncomfortable, you will want to escape from it.

456
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:15,039
Relationships should develop naturally.

457
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,680
There's no need to make promises or put pressure on anything.

458
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,399
Just make sure you're happy when you're together.

459
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,260
- Understand?
- Yes, Sir.

460
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,360
Toh can tell the difference between a good and a bad person. I know this.

461
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,200
If he chooses you, it means you're a good person.

462
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,539
That's why I trust you both.

463
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,073
All right?

464
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,919
Thank you so much.

465
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,559
- He's in your care now.
- Yes.

466
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,439
Take good care of Nuea too.

467
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,179
Go pay respect to your dad.

468
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,339
I'm worried about this one, really.

469
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,759
Come here. What about the other couples?

470
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,900
- My turn, Mom!
- Ah, yes.

471
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,650
- Sure. Come here. Come here.
- Excuse us.

472
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:08,820
All right. I won't touch his cheeks. I'll put the string on his wrist instead.

473
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,119
Take care of each other. Learn to forgive and forget.

474
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,460
Try not to look frown so much. Don't sulk.

475
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,219
If you play around too much, people might misunderstand.

476
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:24,839
That will bring unnecessary troubles, you understand?

477
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,679
- All right. Gather here.
- Okay, next.

478
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,619
Make sure you bring this person next time.

479
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:30,559
I don't want to remember new names anymore.

480
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,159
- Go easy on me.
- Right. I'll go easy on you.

481
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,399
Come, come, come.

482
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,599
- I think the color of your shirt is a bit muted.
- Oh, Really?

483
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,479
- Yeah, I think so.
- It's too plain, right Mom?

484
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,880
It's a bit plain. Come here, Dear.

485
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,559
Will I run out of coconuts because of these two?

486
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,759
- Go easy with her, okay? She's a headstrong one.
- Understood.

487
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,460
Talk calmly and be as cool as icy water.

488
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,119
Be as cool as the coconut water you had the day before.

489
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,539
So you don't snap so easily.

490
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,399
Mom, please tell her to go easy on me.

491
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,140
Go easy and stay calm.

492
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,039
Don't be a hot-tempered woman.

493
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,559
Don't make scary faces. You're scaring your man.

494
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,060
If there's anything that upsets you, sort it out between yourselves calmly.

495
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,619
Come on.

496
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,239
- There, there.
- Thank you.

497
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,479
- Good luck. Good luck, kids.
- Best of luck to all of you. Good luck.

498
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,620
Ah, let me give you a hug first.

499
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,560
- Oh, there, there. Come here, my children. Let's hug.
- Yes, let's hug!

500
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,313
Oh gosh!

501
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,039
Jao, hand it to me. I'll put it away for you.

502
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,480
Okay.

503
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,560
Come on, hurry!

504
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,313
All right, give it here.

505
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,699
Is that all of it?

506
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:49,280
- There's one more.
- Hand it to me, Nong Jao.

507
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,019
- Som, do you need a hand?
- No, it's fine.

508
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,953
P'Sky.

509
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,090
Oh, look at them.

510
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,793
What is it, Jao?

511
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,980
Did you see that, P'Sky?

512
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,239
See what?

513
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,620
Toh and P'Nuea, of course.

514
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,560
Isn't it great?

515
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,900
That P'Nuea was able to pass the barrier of Toh's parents.

516
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,270
Were you cheering for them on the side?

517
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,753
No, I wasn't.

518
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,959
I'm just... happy

519
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,440
that Toh's family now welcomes P'Nuea.

520
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,159
- Jao.
- Yes?

521
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,719
Are you free this Saturday?

522
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,479
Saturday...

523
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,700
Yes! I'm free. What is it, P'Sky?

524
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,290
Let's go meet my mom.

525
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,633
What?

526
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,059
Jao!

527
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,539
Let's go! Let's get going. Quickly.

528
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:08,479
- Come quick!
- Let's go.

529
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,119
- Hurry up.
- Right, hurry.

530
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,959
Let's hurry back to Bangkok so we can go meet my mom.

531
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,359
- Let's get in the car.
- P'Sky!

532
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,599
- Hurry.
- Come on now.

533
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,440
Get in the car!

534
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,039
- P'Sky.
- Yes?

535
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,320
Where are you taking me?

536
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,540
I'm taking you to all the places where my memories lie.

537
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,239
I used to play hide and seek with my friends here when I was young. I still remember.

538
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,060
[Sky, the handsome]

539
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,740
You've remained the same all this time, P'Sky.

540
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,180
Sky, the handsome.

541
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,193
Where are you handsome?

542
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,410
Tell me where I'm not handsome, hm?

543
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,500
- Just you wait.
- What's up? You've finally come, huh?

544
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,280
Yeah. This is my boyfriend, Kaojao.

545
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,779
These are my friends since elementary school. Attaphon and Wichean.

546
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:15,019
Hey, that's my dad's name. You asshole.

547
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,819
Hello.

548
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,119
My name is Win. And this is Pol. We've been friends with Ai Sky since grade six.

549
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,219
Then he moved during high school to follow a girl.

550
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:26,140
I moved because the basketball team was popular, damn it.

551
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:30,239
Nong Jao, you must be careful. Don't trust his words too much.

552
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,560
He's been a player since he was this tall.

553
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,690
You were a player?

554
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:43,479
But, but, but, but... ever since he has a lover, he hardly comes out when we ask him to come drink with us.

555
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
Why are you smiling?

556
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,119
Don't let me catch you.

557
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,919
Catch me on what?

558
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,840
Being a player!

559
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,399
Anyway...

560
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:01,479
whenever you want to hang out or have a meal

561
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,260
you can take P'Sky with you. I don't prohibit it.

562
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,140
You give me the permission,

563
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,400
but I no longer want to go.

564
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,940
I want to be with my lover more.

565
00:38:15,979 --> 00:38:17,940
Lover, he says.

566
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,939
- P'Sky.
- Hm?

567
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:26,360
What are we here for—

568
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,599
Don't ask just yet.

569
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,640
Get in the car first. There are several places we still need to go to.

570
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,399
Hey guys, I'll head out first.

571
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,520
Yeah, go ahead.

572
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,620
It's just that tonight,

573
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,199
I have a big surprise for my wifey.

574
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,639
- Whoa.
- Hey.

575
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,759
Really?

576
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,899
- I think it is.
- Yeah.

577
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:52,819
- See you.
- Yeah, sure.

578
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:56,919
Don't believe him. I'm not his wifey— I'm really not!

579
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,079
Come on.

580
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,513
Bye.

581
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,300
P'Sky.

582
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,720
Yes?

583
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,320
Where else are you taking me?

584
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,640
You'll know soon enough.

585
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,919
Right there, Jao.

586
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,799
That's the vendor I told you about that I liked eating from when I was younger.

587
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,359
- That, too!
- P'Sky, come here quick.

588
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,000
Hey, Jao!

589
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,959
Come on, Jao.

590
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,060
What are we doing?

591
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,693
Jao!

592
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,959
Hey!

593
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,500
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

594
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,790
Come this way.

595
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,780
One, two, three...

596
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,279
Smile!

597
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:04,579
One more, one more. Pucker up. One... two...

598
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,619
Hey, y'all.

599
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,939
- Hello!
- Hi!

600
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:15,899
- Hello.
- Jao, come sit down.

601
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,819
You look cute today.

602
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:21,339
- Hello.
- Hello.

603
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:23,820
Have you eaten yet?

604
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,240
Oh, I already have.

605
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,050
You can eat more.

606
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,319
Isn't that too much, buddy?

607
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,520
I meant, eat food.

608
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,199
Hello! Hi! Hello.

609
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,580
- Hello.
- Hey!

610
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,340
Surprise!

611
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,559
Why are you all here?

612
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,819
Of course, we have to be here. That's because...

613
00:41:01,819 --> 00:41:03,939
three equals to four.

614
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:09,139
Wherever three go, all four tag along!

615
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:11,040
Aw, Jao!

616
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,370
Thank you...

617
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,310
They're all here.

618
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,799
Hey, Ai Sky. Does Jao know about Ai Tew yet?

619
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:21,740
Khongkwan!

620
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,920
Who is P'Tew?

621
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,639
The one who's been sending you flowers.

622
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,239
But, don't worry about it. My friend has already taken care of him.

623
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,090
He won't bother you ever again.

624
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,900
- Good job.
- Well done.

625
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,480
Why did you have to do that?

626
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,899
P'Sky.

627
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:46,500
I don't want anyone to pursue you.

628
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,360
Look at him.

629
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,140
So, P'Sky, have we gone to every place yet?

630
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,960
Not yet. There's one other place left.

631
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,219
P'Sky!

632
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:20,930
What is it?

633
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,100
What is this place?

634
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:30,160
Wow. It's so beautiful.

635
00:42:33,939 --> 00:42:35,830
This is my house.

636
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,679
This is your house, P'Sy?

637
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,720
But why did you bring me here?

638
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:52,100
No need to be nervous, Jao.

639
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,399
I already told my mom that I was bringing her daughter-in-law for a visit.

640
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,099
♫ Because in reality, you're too high ♫

641
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,860

00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,300
No.

654
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:20,181
Thank you.

655
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,419
Let's go together, shall we?

656

♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

♫ That tomorrow when I wake up ♫

Shall we go now?

662
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:54,380
Okay...

663
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,639
♫ Feel love since the day you came ♫

664

668
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,170
P'Nuea.

669
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,640
Yeah?

670
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,799
I'm sure Jao must be passing out right now

671
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:33,400
because it's the first time that P'Sky is introducing him to the family.

672
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,059
- Toh!
- Yes?

673
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:39,510
Nobody can be as shocked as I was when I met your dad.

674
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,759
But anyway...

675
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:50,840
I really must thank you for agreeing to go everything I wanted to.

676
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,319
Sure.

677
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,040
But, there's another place I really want to go.

678
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,540
Where is it, Toh?

679
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,220
You need to promise me first that you'll take me there.

680
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,780
Of course.

681
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,660
I promise you.

682
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,020
I will take you to wherever you want to go.

683
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,799
- But before that...
- Yes?

684
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:33,000
Please give me a reward.

685
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,250
Here, an extra bonus.

686
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,620
I'll take you there.

687
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,373
Okay.

688
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,110
- Wow, the sound of waves is so refreshing.
- I agree.

689
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,280
Toh.

690
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,880
You sure know what you're doing, huh?

691
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,820
You picked the same exact resort and even the exact same room.

692
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,190
That's some skill you have.

693
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

694
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,400
- Ai Nuea.
- Come on.

695
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,040
Oh, wow!

696
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,100
- Hey, let's play beach volleyball. Come on.
- Sure.

697
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,140
- Toh.
- Okay, sure!

698
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,700
We're on the same team, right?

699
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,320
Sure.

700
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,160
♫ Everything about you ♫

701
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,220
♫ What you go through, good or bad ♫

702
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,300
♫ There is me who notices it ♫

703
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,520
♫ I'm right here (watching you all along) ♫

704
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:34,840
♫ In my own space, I've never thought of bothering you ♫

705
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,880
♫ Just like that (always secretly watching you) ♫

706
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:44,140
♫ It fulfills my heart, this is all I'm asking for ♫

707
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,240
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

708
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,680
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

709
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,940
♫ That there's someone who's been watching you ♫

710
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,780
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

711
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,540
♫ Who has a secret crush on you ♫

712
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,640
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

713
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,470
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

714
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,380
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

715
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,159
♫ Oh, baby ♫

716
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,460
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

717
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,120
What is it?

718
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,359
You asked me to come look at the stars, but why are you only looking at my face?

719
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,260
I'm good-looking, right?

720
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,250
Is there something wrong Jao?

721
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,260
I'm thinking...

722
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,960
I probably won't have to look up at the stars anymore.

723
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,200
Because...

724
00:50:22,899 --> 00:50:25,290
my star

725
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,219
is right here in front of me.

726
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:34,160
♫ Maybe just like you ♫

727
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,500
♫ You are the beauty in my eyes ♫

728
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,380
♫ You make me realize ♫

729
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,060
Oh, right. Just a minute.

730
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:49,780
♫ What I was searching for  ♫

731
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,313
Here.

732
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,073
Open it.

733
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,580
[You're My Star | With you I'm always home]

734
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,233
Jao.

735
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,920
Thank you...

736
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,020
for always being so patient with me.

737
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,700
Also...

738
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:00,080
I'm sorry that I tend to think too much at times,

739
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,710
and I act annoying and bothersome.

740
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,580
You're never boring to me.

741
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,080
And you're never annoying to me.

742
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,980
You have to stop thinking like that too, all right?

743
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,813
Okay.

744
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,040
I love you, Jao.

745
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,500
I love you too, P'Sky.

746
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,473
Love you.

747
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,060
Let's watch our stars, okay?

748
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,213
Okay!

749
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:30,420
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

750
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,680
Gosh. One couple down.

751
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,993
Oh!

752
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,900
A cheek kiss. Go ahead and kiss.

753
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,200
P'Khongkwan, you're joining them as well?

754
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,650
And... what about the two of us?

755
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,440
Don't make me start ranting, P'Tor.

756
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,780
Look there. Look over there.

757
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,213
Here.

758
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,120
Do you really know what you're taking photos of?

759
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,933
Of course, I do.

760
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,580
It's the North Star (Nuea)

761
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:33,280
P'Nuea, do you know that the North Star is so cool?

762
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,500
How so?

763
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,133
Well...

764
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,740
It's a star that leads the way for people.

765
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:59,340
When we're lost or have no idea which direction we should take,

766
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,400
we simply look up at the North Star

767
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,320
and it'll lead us home.

768
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,040
And do you know...

769
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,260
that the North Star...

770
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,320
is also loyal.

771
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,040
Because it will always wait for us

772
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,500
when we're searching for it.

773
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:05,080
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

774
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,220
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

775
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,260
P'Nuea.

776
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,160
Yes?

777
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,440
Why do you like me?

778
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,480
♫ What we have today ♫

779
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:41,340
♫ Is like a dream come true ♫

780
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,840
Must there be a reason?

781
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,390
You're unique, I think.

782
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,110
Well...

783
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,900
Normally,

784
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,220
when we like someone

785
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,010
we would want to be as close to them as possible, right?

786
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,060
But that wasn't the case for you.

787
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:22,660
You always looked at me... from afar.

788
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:29,640
Ironically, it was me...

789
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,740
who ended up looking for you.

790
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,300
If there was a day

791
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,800
that I didn't see Van Gogh,

792
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,700
I would feel so empty,

793
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,200
like something was missing in my life.

794
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,040
Especially right now.

795
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,280
I can not live without you, Toh.

796
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,000
P'Nuea, do you know...

797
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:31,070
that I'm really lucky

798
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:35,640
that you love me.

799
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,150
The lucky one

800
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,820
is me.

801
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,060
If you hadn't entered my life,

802
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,190
I wouldn't have known

803
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,530
what real happiness feels like.

804
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

805
