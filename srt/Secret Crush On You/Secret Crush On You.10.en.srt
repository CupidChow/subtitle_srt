00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,140
I planned an exercise session with P'Nuea.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,159
Why haven't you got dressed yet?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,539
We're going to the fitness gym downstairs, right?

4
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,079
I have a gathering at the pub for my line-code tomorrow.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,119
- Here.
- Why are you giving me these?

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,719
We didn't get to that stage yet last night.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,679
I think you should just go there and catch him red-headed.

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,380
Because someone is caught in the act already.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,910
- Huh?
- Where?

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,550
You're truly a legend today.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,899
Did you bring me here?

12
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,339
Then I'll give a special training session.

13
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:38,660
Trainer P'Nuea will give you, an intensive lesson.

Well...

56
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,580
I was just lost in my thoughts.

57
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,180
Toh, what do you think one plus one is equal to?

58
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,300
It's two, of course.

59

And do you think this answer can be changed?

that "one plus one" will always equal two.

- What's up?
- No clue.

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,153
Jao.

78
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,980
What's happened?

79
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,879
You've been spacing out for the last two days.

We're worried about you.

81
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,899
Right, right.

82
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:13,920
You shut up, Toh.

83
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,979
You're such a troublemaker.

84
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,359
Where have you been in these past two days?

85
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,059
- I'll interrogate you next.
- Yeah.

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:32,180
Jao, you might think that we're nosy... which is true,

87
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,559
but we are also worried about you.

88
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,639
Tell your friends what's on your mind.

89
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,073
All right.

90
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
Well...

91
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,920
You've given yourself to P'Sky?

92
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,459
Gosh! He just opened up his heart!

93
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,159
Jao, P'Sky is taking this very seriously.

94
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,620
Why are you still paranoid, huh?

95
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,659
Som, think about it carefully.

96
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:16,799
How can someone like P'Sky be serious with me?

97
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,759
What about someone like you, Jao?

98
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,473
Jao.

99
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,380
Jao, listen to me.

100
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,560
Try not to think too much about anything. Just let it be.

101
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,380
And believe it the same way you believe that "one plus one equals two."

102
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,540
See, you have no doubts about the equation.

103
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,400
Try to put faith in P'Sky like that.

104
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,820
- Hey.
- What?

105
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,260
- He almost sounded sensible.
- Right.

106
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,370
But why am I confused?

107
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,839
- I am too.
- Right.

108
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,093
Jao.

109
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,359
You like P'Sky. P'Sky likes you.

110
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:18,639
- That's it. The end.
- True.

111
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:26,039
See, this is what I meant. "one plus one equals two."

112
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,279
Ugh! Enough of that. Now it's your turn.

113
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,460
So, where were you the past two days? Tell us.

114
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,079
Hurry up.

115
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,880
I was exhausted,

116
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,460
so P'Nuea told me...

117
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,299
to take some rest.

118
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,219
Gosh! Toh!

119
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:51,859
How was it?

120
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,459
- Tell us more.
- Yes, spill it.

121
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:59,070
Nah. It's personal between me and my hub...

122
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,119
I told you, didn't I?

123
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,380
It's NueaToh, not TohNuea.

124
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,739
Right. And since you have given yourself to him,

125
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:13,139
cancel the rules of having a secret crush.

126
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,330
- Moreover, it's time to stop collecting weird stuff as well.
- Yes.

127
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,960
Why!? No way!

128
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,139
Then let the two of us discuss this for a moment, okay?

129
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,479
- All right.
- Right.

130
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,599
- If P'Nuea sees what Toh has, he'll be shocked.
- Yeah. Then, what should we do?

131
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,659
I don't think it's possible to make him stop collecting stuff.

132
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:37,459
He'll suffer from withdrawal.

133
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,479
How about this?

134
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,319
He can collect one thing from each date. Sound good?

135
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,959
- Just one thing.
- Uh-huh. Good.

136
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,893
- Okay.
- Okay.

137
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,139
Here's what we agreed upon.

138
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:53,499
For a person like you, it's unlikely to make you quit cold turkey.

139
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,719
So, the rule is changed to... "One date, one item."

140
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
"One date, one item."

141
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,839
For every date, you can collect only one thing.

142
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,079
Do not cheat.

143
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,960
And when you're used to it,

144
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,830
we'll switch to one item per week,

145
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,639
to one item per month, and then one per year.

146
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,679
Until you stop this habit on your own.

147
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,300
That's right. It's fabulous.

148
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,640
One date, one item.

149
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,679
Who will be able to do that?

150
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,280
"One date, one item" that's crazy. Gosh, Jao, Som, and Daisy!

151
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,820
Toh, what did you say?

152
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,699
P'Nuea, well, we're going to...

153
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:59,599
have a meal, go for a walk, watch a movie, and we'll go back to the condo together.

154
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,540
Could we count them as four separate dates?

155
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,900
It will be counted as one date, Toh.

156
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,833
What?

157
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,593
What?

158
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,350
Don't you want to come with me?

159
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,279
Of course I do. Please, don't sulk, P'Nuea.

160
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,440
P'Nuea, I want to.

161
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,919
I want to go with you.

162
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,539
P'Nuea!

163
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,720
P'Nuea...

164
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Please don't sulk, P'Nuea.

165
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't be upset with me.

166
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:24,700
P'Nuea! You like to tease me!

167
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,470
That's because you always act like you are waiting to be teased.

168
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,440
Tonight...

169
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,610
let me tease you some more.

170
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,079
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

171
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,719
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

172
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,119
♫ That there's someone who's been watching you ♫

173
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:01,919
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

174
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,959
Let's go.

175
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,759
♫ Who has a secret crush on you ♫

176
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,320
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

177
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,460
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

178
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,160
Are you tired?

179
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,260
No. I can still run.

180
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,339
Are you okay, P'Sky?

181
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,399
I'm a little short of breath.

182
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,060
Take a rest first. Let's sit down now.

183
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,593
Yes.

184
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,740
Are you okay?

185
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,559
I think it's been a while since I last exercised.

186
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I can't keep up with my breathing.

187
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,693
Here.

188
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,093
For me?

189
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,660
Thank you, P'Sky.

190
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,740
Didn't you say you were exhausted?

191
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,919
I am.

192
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm so exhausted.

193
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,839
But if you let me lie down on your lap,

194
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,990
I'll recover in an instant.

195
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,560
- If I could...
- No, no, no, no. No way.

196
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,619
- Just a little. Come on, Jao.
- Don't, P'Sky!

197
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,639
- Sit up properly.
- No.

198
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm angry now. Sit up properly.

199
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,799
Can't you see there are so many people around here?

200
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,079
Where? I don't see anyone, Jao.

201
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,120
There. Over there.

202
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,460
Jao, are you okay?

203
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,470
Are you not feeling well, Jao?

204
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,360
Natal grass.

205
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,620
I think it's because of the pollen.

206
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,540
Shall we run one more lap and head back?

207
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,273
Okay.

208
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,859
- Well, P'Sky.
- Yes?

209
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,799
I want to ask you something.

210
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,633
What is it?

211
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,399
What do you think one plus one equals?

212
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,233
Two, of course.

213
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,759
Why didn't you think about it?

214
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,059
Do I need to think about it?

215
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,059
There's no need to over-complicate what's easy to understand.

216
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,560
It's better to save our brains for other stuff.

217
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,640
- I see.
- Or... did you plan to do a pun?

218
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,220
Like one plus one equals "you and me"?

219
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,593
That's not it.

220
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,093
You're meddlesome!

221
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,980
I won't joke like that.

222
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,880
Oh, are you free tomorrow?

223
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,873
Tomorrow?

224
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,899
Yes, I am.

225
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:34,900
What's going on?

226
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,850
I'm meeting my friends tomorrow. I'd like you to come with me.

227
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,513
Friends?

228
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,319
Oh, P'Nuea and the squad?

229
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,859
No.

230
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:48,959
They're my high school buddies.

231
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,420
Oh, I don't know them then.

232
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,239
But everyone is as nice as I am.

233
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,279
You don't have to be afraid, okay?

234
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,159
If you're not coming with me, I won't be able to eat anything

235
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,560
because I'll keep thinking of you.

236
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,873
Silly!

237
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,019
But P'Sky. I think I...

238
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:19,399
Whenever you feel like leaving, I'll take you back. You have my word.

239
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,079
Deal?

240
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,140
It... it's not like that, P'Sky.

241
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,920
What I mean is...

242
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,119
if I don't enjoy it, I can go home by myself.

243
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,439
You don't have to drive me back or anything.

244
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,040
It's better you stay with your friends

245
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,180
What you're saying is...

246
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,759
- so adorable.
- Stop your track!

247
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,610
What are you doing?

248
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,820
Can I just hug you once?

249
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,700
- Please?
- No way!

250
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,959
I'm not talking to you anymore.

251
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,310
I'm going to continue my jog.

252
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,520
Don't let me catch you, then. Jao!

253
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,659
Hey everyone!

254
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:25,159
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

255
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,299
Thank you.

256
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,340
This is Nong Kaojao.

257
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,799
Hello.

258
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,719
- Oh. Hello, hello.
- Have a seat.

259
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,779
- Hey, what do you want?
- The crisp fried catfish.

260
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:36,900
Dig in.

261
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,379
- Why did you even ask, then?
- This here is Kraw Pao.
(T/N: minced beef in basil)

262
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:42,199
- Don't want it.
- No, I'm just telling you what it is.

263
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,999
- What the heck? I want Tom Yum.
- Have you guys been here long?
(T/N: spicy soup)

264
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:47,650
Here here here here. It's your favorite dish, shellfish.

265
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,959
Let the cockles tilt. Don't tilt the cockles.

266
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,419
- They're clams.
- Yeah

267
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:53,799
Are they?

268
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,580
Jao, have this.

269
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,359
- What's with you?
- I think you'll like this.

270
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,040
What's with you?

271
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,559
Eat quickly or the food will be cold.

272
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,239
Honey, can you pass me the crisp fried catfish?

273
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,719
- Crisp fried catfish.
- Yeah, I like anything crispy.

274
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,759
- Leave some for me.
- Eat up.

275
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,610
- I only had one bite last time.
- Sure.

276
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,199
Pass me the tissue.

277
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,839
Here goes.

278
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,940
- You ate.
- It's mine.

279
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,519
- Ah, I have changed my mind.
- Hurry up and eat.

280
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,640
Here, take it back.

281
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,213
Is it good?

282
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,820
It is.

283
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,800
- Excuse me, one more Padthai, please.
- Yes.
(T/N: stir-fried noodles)

284
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,533
Eat some more.

285
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:39,859
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

286
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,219
Ai Sky.

287
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:46,479
Seriously, I'm not used to this at all.

288
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,079
You normally bring girls along,

289
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,539
but you bring this young boy this time?

290
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,279
Hippo, you're exaggerating. I didn't have company every time.

291
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,759
All those you brought were hot though.

292
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,739
- Ai Ball.
- You're jealous, aren't you?

293
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:02,899
Totally.

294
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:05,659
I'm a gleaner. I pick up whatever remaining.

295
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:08,579
Hey, stop digging up my past.

296
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm losing my points here.

297
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
What points?

298
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,699
You say it like you're currently pursuing someone.

299
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:20,239
Yeah. As if you are pursuing someone around here.

300
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,599
That's suspicious.

301
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,260
Hey, hey, hey! Are you guys flirting?

302
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,779
Hey, friends can't do that, all right?

303
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,959
No! Why are you guys curious?

304
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,760
I think I'm making myself very clear here.

305
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,313
Huh?

306
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,413
Are you joking?

307
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,719
He's playing with us.

308
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,799
It's not even remotely funny.

309
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,419
- You're asking for this, you jerk.
- Hey, you'll slip and hit him.

310
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,880
What joke? I'm not joking.

311
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,993
Let's eat.

312
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:59,139
Here, I'll peel the shrimp for you.

313
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:04,099
It's okay, P'Sky. I can do it myself.

314
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:08,340
Are you refusing to share food with me? So stingy.

315
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,139
Ah, that's not it.

316
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:12,840
- I can peel...
- I'll do it for you.

317
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,399
You want one, Pop?

318
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,759
Yeah, peel it for me as well.

319
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,219
Ai Sky.

320
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:19,739
Let me ask you seriously.

321
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:23,100
So are you really pursuing him?

322
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,820
Yes.

323
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,979
I am pursuing him.

324
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:37,060
Shit. But you used to like...

325
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,139
That was the past.

326
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,040
I only have him right now.

327
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,500
Would you like some lime juice? It'll be less greasy.

328
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,959
Argh! What do you expect from him?

329
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,759
Whenever he wants someone, he's always so courteous.

330
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,799
- Absolutely.
- Correct.

331
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,759
You said the right thing today.

332
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,040
- Right?
- Yes.

333
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,279
That's true. When I'm pursuing someone, I'm always like this.

334
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,919
And right now I want him so much.

335
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:18,340
I want him as my lover for another 10-20 years. May I, Nong Jao?

336
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,633
Now that's lame!

337
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:26,620
How about this? If you really like him, confess to him right now.

338
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,539
- Right.
- Yeah.

339
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:31,359
Why wouldn't I do it?

340
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,220
I'm afraid the kid around here will be embarrassed.

341
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,679
Who's embarrassed?

342
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,159
Ouch! Nong Jao. It hurts

343
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,679
Ouch! You've been hitting me so hard these days. Hmph?

344
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,880
- Oh, don't be a wimp.
- Ouch! That hurts.

345
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,099
Which temple did you pray at? Don't forget to go repay your luck.

346
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:52,259
because I don't think you'll be as lucky so often.

347
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,039
That's a good one!

348
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,179
Bua, the one who must fulfil the vow is me.

349
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:02,060
He was so dang hard to pursue. It was difficult to succeed.

350
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,519
Wait!

351
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,610
Did he yield to your pursuits already?

352
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,759
So, do you like my friend?

353
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,800
Ai Hippo!

354
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,980
Don't pressure him.

355
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,739
If he wants to say it, he will.

356
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:19,879
Don't try to act cool. You want to know too.

357
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,779
- Do you like him?
- Yeah, do you?

358
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:22,959
You guys can stop it.

359
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,159
It's true that I want to know, but I can wait.

360
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,539
I'm not in any rush. Don't pressure him.

361
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,940
Eat. Eat your food.

362
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,379
Jao, listen to me.

363
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:39,940
Try not to think too much about anything. Just let it be.

364
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,840
And believe it the same way you believe that "one plus one equals two."

365
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,420
There's no need to over-complicate what's easy to understand.

366
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,440
It's better to save our brains for other stuff.

367
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,113
Well...

368
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,780
I...

369
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,740
I like P'Sky.

370
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,660
What did you say, Nong Jao?

371
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
I said...

372
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,700
I like you, P'Sky.

373
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,473
Jao!

374
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Did my friends pressure you to say this?

375
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,413
No, they didn't.

376
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,160
- Then...
- Stop!

377
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,300
You can't.

378
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,900
Can't I?

379
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,400
We can't date.

380
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,520
You were saying you liked me a second ago.

381
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,580
If you date me...

382
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,220
you will be the laughing stock among your friends.

383
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,093
Kaojao.

384
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,939
Can you not pay attention to other people?

385
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:20,840
Let them think whatever they want.

386
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,099
I'm only focused on you.

387
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,519
There's only one reason I won't date you, and that's if you don't like me.

388
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,000
Thank you for giving a guy like me a chance.

389
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,659
Though I'm less handsome than Ai Nuea

390
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,079
and not as studious as Ai Tor,

391
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,419
I love only you.

392
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,420
Let's go.

393
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,460
Hey guys, here. It's my treat.

394
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,819
I'm leaving now.

395
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:01,219
- See you later.
- Hey!

396
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:02,879
- Let's go, Jao.
- He even treats us the meal.

397
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,639
- Hurry.
- Oh, all right.

398
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,120
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

399
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,570
Good luck, dude!

400
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,839
The movie is about to start.

401
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,590
- Yeah.
- Let's hurry.

402
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,040
P'Nuea, I want to go over there.

403
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,519
The movie is starting soon, Toh. Come on.

404
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,220
Ah, no, wait.

405
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,779
Let me have a look, please.

406
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,799
Toh. We will miss the movie.

407
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,319
- Let's go.
- Ah, no!

408
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,719
I don't want to. No, don't want to.

409
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,259
- Toh.
- I'm staying right here.

410
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:41,980
Please. I really want to take a look

411
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,399
Toh, we will miss the movie.

412
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,799
What do you mean we'll miss it? We'll see it.

413
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,079
- We will definitely make it in time.
- Toh.

414
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,379
They won't let us enter the cinema.

415
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:58,399
I don't care if they won't. I want to go see it.

416
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,579
I don't want to!

417
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:03,459
Take me there, please...

418
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:06,340
Please, come on.

419
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,140
I'm staying here, then.

420
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,980
I want to go see it. Hurry.

421
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,259
Fine. Let's go check it out.

422
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,259
Come. Hurry

423
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,079
- Come. Hurry.
- Yay.

424
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,713
Let's go.

425
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,039
Just a moment. Over there, okay?

426
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,240
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

427
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,339
- Let's go.
- Quick quick.

428
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:33,739
- Where? Where is it?
- Here. Here it is.

429
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:36,920
It's a brand-new picture that just arrived.

430
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,999
- This one?
- Nuea?

431
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,633
Yes.

432
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,220
Nuea. Are you here to watch a movie?

433
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,379
Yeah.

434
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:50,660
- Us too!
- What a coincidence.

435
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,959
And who's this?

436
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,759
- This is my boyfri...
- I'm his junior.

437
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,380
I'm his junior at the university. My name is Toh.

438
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,459
My name is Fai And here is Kratai.

439
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:07,599
Nong Toh, is there a movie you can recommend to us?

440
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,519
Nowadays, horror films are pretty entertaining,

441
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,559
but I'm not really a fan of them.

442
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,739
So, I think I'll watch animation instead.

443
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:19,520
Oh! We also like the bright and cheerful animation.

444
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,239
Yeah. Shall we watch it together? The more, the merrier.

445
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,419
Nuea, can we? Let's watch it together, please?

446
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:27,879
Of course.

447
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Then, why don't you go buy your tickets?

448
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,833
All right.

449
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,133
Take them then.

450
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,399
I'm not watching anymore.

451
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,639
- Huh? What's the matter?
- Nuea?

452
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,940
P'Nuea, what's wrong?

453
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,720
P'Nuea, what's happened?

454
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,440
Those two were startled.

455
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,219
I should be the one to ask. What's wrong with you?

456
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:05,859
Why did you say we were senior and junior?

457
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:08,640
Well then...

458
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,859
would it be all right if I said we are lovers?

459
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:14,999
What's so bad about it, Toh?

460
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,433
Well...

461
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,839
I don't want to trouble you.

462
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,680
Troubling me?

463
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,079
Why do you have to be considerate?

464
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,880
We're already lovers. Why would you tell people otherwise?

465
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,600
Or was it that

466
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,840
you've never taken this relationship seriously?

467
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,300
You're blowing it out of proportion, P'Nuea. It's not like that.

468
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,860
I'm sorry then.

469
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,460
All right, if you want to watch, then go ahead.

470
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,420
Call me when it's over. I'll come pick you up.

471
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,999
No way, P'Nuea!

472
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,540
Let me go too.

473
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,753
Please.

474
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,580
Please get in the car.

475
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,920
So you're a jealous type, huh?

476
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,879
What did you say?

477
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,720
Oh, nothing.

478
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,940
But, well...

479
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,500
So, are you jealous or not?

480
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,919
Refusing to answer, I see.

481
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,740
Then... I'll go watch the movie.

482
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,719
Huh?

483
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,960
What did you say?

484
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,820
Yes, jealous.

485
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,879
I couldn't hear you at all.

486
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,820
Can you say that again?

487
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,013
I'm jealous.

488
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,399
You said it too soft. Can you say it louder?

489
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,300
- Say it louder. Like very loud!
- I'm jealous!

490
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,080
That's it.

491
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,039
Satisfied now?

492
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,000
I am. Then...

493
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,820
I'll go watch the movie.

494
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,340
I'm jealous!

495
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,020
You're jealous?

496
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:23,740
Jealous. Jealous. Jealous.

497
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,480
Get home by yourself, then.

498
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,720
No! I'm coming with you. Wait for me!

499
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I'm coming with you.

500
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,460
P'Nuea.

501
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,673
I...

502
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,619
Back then, in fact...

503
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,240
Hey, wait. P'Nuea!

504
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,640
Gosh, Toh!

505
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,700
What should I do now?

506
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,719
What would you like, P'Nuea?

507
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,460
Between...

508
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,539
coffee or me?

509
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,300
You, of course.

510
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,253
Shit!

511
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,753
Toh.

512
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,853
Well...

513
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm so sorry.

514
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,790
I really didn't mean to break it.

515
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:18,180
This pot costs 4,000 baht.

516
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,680
If you are my junior...

517
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,870
I will have to scold you.

518
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,900
But if you are my boyfriend...

519
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,140
I won't say a word.

520
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,540
So, what kind of relationship do you want to be in with me?

521
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:49,300
I want to be... your boyfriend.

522
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,950
What did you say?

523
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,999
P'Nuea, please don't be upset with me.

524
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,599
I really do apologize about what happened at the cinema,

525
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,559
and about this pot.

526
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,799
I'm really sorry.

527
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,539
I won't be anything else apart from being your boyfriend.

528
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,640
Please?

529
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,540
Pretty please?

530
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,020
Coffee or me?

531
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,940
Definitely you.

532
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,759
P'Khongkwan!

533
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:46,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,119
Dance. Let's dance a bit.

535
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,853
Come sit here.

536
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,819
- Will it be okay?
- Are you sure it's okay?

537
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:58,160
Let's go!

538
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,920
Hurry. Come over.

539
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,100
Here. Take it.

540
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,360
You can do it.

541
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,399
Gosh!

542
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,159
There are a million people here, but the two of you are flirting among yourselves.

543
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,659
That's true.

544
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:32,239
By the way, Toh, what did you collect from yesterday's date?

545
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,679
Yes, that's right.

546
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,059
You guys really want to know?

547
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,799
- The more you talk about it, the more I want to know the detail.
- Exactly.

548
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:39,779
- Hurry up and say it.
- Spit it fast.

549
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:41,313
Well...

550
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,880
A button.

551
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,500
- What's up?
- It's nothing.

552
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,539
- Nothing at all.
- There's nothing.

553
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:55,090
- I'm just warming up my vocal cords.
- I see.

554
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,879
That's right.

555
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,499
Toh, why did you collect the button?

556
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,759
Jao, I'll subscribe you to "OnlyFans" when we go back home.
(T/N: OnlyFans is a site for adult content)

557
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,319
- Hey.
- What?

558
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,679
There's no need for him to sign up for "OnlyFans" content.

559
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,180
He already has a lover. He'll learn about it soon enough.
(T/N: Wordplay on "Fan" and "faen/lover")

560
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,980
Som, enough already.

561
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,180
- He's embarrassed.
- Yes, totally.

562
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,073
And look at you now.

563
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,700
Daisy! What the hell are you doing? That's disgusting.

564
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,599
- Daisy.
- What?

565
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,639
What secret code are you sending to P'Touch?

566
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,619
What code? Absolutely none!

567
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:48,399
Geez, you're tone is higher than your IQ right now.

568
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,219
Agreed.

569
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:51,879
If you're flirting so openly,

570
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,240
do you have to give him a reward if he wins?

571
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,039
I think so.

572
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,120
It's a piece of cake for me.

573
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,400
Then, I challenge you... to kiss him if he wins.

574
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,900
Sure! Come on!

575
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,239
If his team wins I will kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, P'Touch in front of you.

576
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,999
I will kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss! Kiss, kiss, kiss!

577
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,859
Keep being sassy! I'll wait and see.

578
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:26,280
What? What

579
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,399
- Hey, youngsters!
- Yes?

580
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:35,959
Let's give our support to the Engineering team.

581
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:38,439
- Sure!
- Yes.

582
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,319
- On your feet.
- Okay okay.

583
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,899
- Okay okay.
- Left first. Start from the left.

584
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:43,339
Three... four!

585
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:50,520
Engineers do your best! Do your best Engineers! Engineers are the best! Woohoo!

586
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,800
Toh! Your lover is so hot! Oh my god!

587
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,160
P'Khongkwan.

588
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,840
Dang it! What the heck!

589
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,110
They're cheating!

590
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,440
- Is he all right?
- Is he okay?

591
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,640
Oh gosh! Is he okay?

592
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,020
- Still good.
- Sit down. Sit, sit.

593
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,480
- Sit, sit.
- Sit, sit.

594
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,200
Pass!

595
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,460
Shoot!

596
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,799
P'Nuea, is here!

597
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,859
P'Nuea!

598
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:10,599
You were fantastic.

599
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,420
Jao, sit down.

600
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,360
Here.

601
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,540
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

602
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,880
P'Nuea.

603
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,359
Let's help each other.

604
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,799
It's the end, everyone. Please be on your way.

605
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,239
Please, exit this way.

606
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,980
- Here.
- This way, please.

607
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,700
Do I look cool today?

608
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,380
Of course! My lover is the coolest today!

609
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,460
You sure know how to talk, huh?

610
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,540
- Right, Toh.
- Yes?

611
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,840
I'll drink with my friends at my place today.

612
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,359
Sure. Then, be careful not to get too drunk.

613
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,959
Why are you... saying it like you won't be coming?

614
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:38,300
Oh, aren't you drinking with your friends?

615
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,820
My friends are the ones you already know.

616
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,220
Come join me. All right?

617
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:55,160
Please come. Please. Please.

618
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,140
Okay.

619
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,480
Everybody, please come over.

620
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,299
Are you inviting us as well?

621
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:10,260
Yes, of course. Come and drink at my place.

622
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:15,320
- Very well, then.
- Also... P'Touch is going as well, Daisy.

623
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,419
Oh, do you know about that too, P'Nuea?

624
00:50:18,419 --> 00:50:22,040
Gosh! P'Nuea!

625
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,339
Alright then. Meet me at my condo, okay?

626
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,459
I'll go get changed first.

627
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:30,799
Yes, of course.

628
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,280
- I'll see you soon.
- Yes. I'll see you soon.

629
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,339
Take the towel.

630
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,319
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. I'll see you again in a bit.

631
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,640
- See you soon.
- Bye, P'Fon and P'Khongkwan.

632
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,959
Jao!

633
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:55,920
Let's go to P'Nuea's condo today.

634
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,080
P'Nuea's condo?

635
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,340
Please. Let's go together.

636
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,500
- Let's go.
- Let's pack up.

637
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,399
- Yes, pack up.
- Toh, this is your bag.

638
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:06,140
I'm exhausted.

639
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,279
- Let's clink our glasses!
- Come on! Cheers!

640
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,919
P'Touch, you as well.

641
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:18,320
It's an orange juice and sweet drinks party.

642
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,000
There are only couples here today, right?

643
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,480
How about we start with our couple, Nong Som?

644
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,139
Som! When did you guys start talking?

645
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,300
It was my beauty. He came to me.

646
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,330
Are you perhaps... pursuing me?

647
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,800
I think it's pretty obvious.

648
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,860
- Woah. Tor.
- Here we go. Go for it!

649
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,940
Hey, he's good enough to teach me now.

650
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,780
Let's have some snacks, Khongkwan.

651
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,559
But I'd rather eat you, Fon.

652
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,880
- Stop!
- That's slick.

653
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
You're not meant to say that in front of other people.

654
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,820
- That's just for us.
- Okay?

655
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,900
- Do you understand that? - Yes.

656
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,480
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah.

657
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,700
- Am I good?
- Seriously?

658
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,250
You must be full by now, huh?

659
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,179
P'Nuea, are those two lovers? Or does one of them have muscle weakness?

660
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:25,420
Toh!

661
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,420
There are people here...

662
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,673
Toh.

663
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,259
- Yes?
- Should we do it here, then?

664
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,020
- Oh, gosh!
- Wow!

665
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,390
That's enough! That's enough!

666
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,660
- Let's play some games.
- Okay.

667
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,800
You all know how to play UNO, right?

668
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,900
- Five cards each.
- Here, Daisy.

669
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,579
- Do it faster!
- Wait calm down.

670
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:14,960
All right. Come on.

671
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,760
Oh, yeah. I have to do it first.

672
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,360
What about...

673
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,039
- Take it.
- Yeah, pass it to me.

674
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:27,200
- P'Touch.
- My turn now. I only have two cards left.

675
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,940
- That doesn't mean you will win.
- You have a handful though.

676
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,920
I do have a lot right? Now, I'm the boss.

677
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,080
- Six plus two. Not again.
- Don't I have a single normal card?

678
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,839
- Can I see it?
- Daisy. You can surrender now.

679
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:51,120
- No way.
- Stop fighting.

680
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,460
- What color is it?
- Red.

681
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,680
Red?

682
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,001
- Toh.
- Toh, your turn.

683
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:58,000
- Here it is.
- Toh, not again!

684
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,800
- Hey!
- You have to put down two cards, Toh.

685
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,480
Look at my cards too.

686
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,200
- P'Nuea!
- P'Nuea, you cheated.

687
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,319
Stop teasing him.

688
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,379
- Why are you like this?
- Put it all down!

689
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:15,940
What is this?

690
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,600
Uno!

691
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,300
Here it is!

692
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,060
- Our gang is awesome!
- Very good, Toh!

693
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,040
Look! Look!

694
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,020
- You should plan well next time, P'Kwan.
- Yes!

695
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,919
I won't anymore. I won't play next time.

696
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:39,620
That's fine but you have to receive punishment today.

697
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,270
You have to dance to the "Grilled Chicken" song.

698
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,040
Don't embarrass the Engineering faculty.

699
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,160

708
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,930
Hey, are we done?

709
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,579
Khongkwan, don't go down without a fight.

What are you doing?

714
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,380
Nong Jao, did you come to get something?

715
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,460
Do you want some ice? I'll bring it over.

716
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,100
What were you doing?

717
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,633
What?

718
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,400
What are you hiding?

719
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,033
It's nothing.

720
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,920
So, you're not telling me?

721
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,800
- Poke!
- Ouch!

722
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,330
See.

723
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,800
Why didn't you tell me something is wrong?

724
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,660
Don't give me that.

725
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,880
Let me have a look.

726
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,780
P'Sky.

727
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,880
Please let me have a look.

728
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,250
You're not taking good care of yourself.

729
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,160
See, there's a bruise.

730
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,560
It's not too bad.

731
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,480
- Ouch!
- Not too bad, you say?

732
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,800
Give me the ointment. I'll put it on for you.

733
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,900
Be more careful next time.

734
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,860
Let me see.

735
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,740
Does it hurt?

736
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,680
Well, a bit.

737
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,893
It's all done.

738
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:58,260
Try to take care of yourself.

739
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,333
Do you understand?

740
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,420
Thank you.

741
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,680
I was feeling blissful.

742
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,660
Feeling blissful, huh?

743
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,273
- There.
- Ouch!

744
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,840
Are you still in bliss?

745
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:21,500
One more?

746
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,440
Here. Take this!

747
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,640
Aren't you hurt?

748
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,440
Why are you still smiling?

749
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,740
If I look like I'm in pain, I won't look cool.

750
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,179
You don't look cool right now anyway.

751
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:05,020
Jao!

752
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,473
P'Sky.

753
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,580
What?

754
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,020
We're boyfriends now.

755
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,570
Whether you're cool or not,

756
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,440
I want to see every side of you.

757
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,330
You don't have to think too much.

758
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:45,150
If not, what's the point of being boyfriends, right?

759
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,093
Hm?

760
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:52,860
Then, if one day I no longer look cool, you mustn't abandon me.

761
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,693
Yes.

762
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,240
P'Sky.

763
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,060
Will someone see us?

764
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,380
Jao! I can't stand up anymore.

765
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,980
I'm in pain...

766
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,080
- It hurts so bad.
- Enough already.

767
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,100
- Jao, I can't stand properly.
- That's enough.

768
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,760
P'Sky!

769
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,900
Ow, it hurts so bad.

770
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,880
You're being naughty again, Thima.

771
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,320
Why are you taking their photos?

772
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,520
Kaojao will be mad at you.

773
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,780
Jao won't be mad at me.

774
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,380
He likes it so much.

775
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:09,180
Plus, he took photos for me so many times.

776
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:12,200
I must return the favor, right?

777
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,240
Took photos?

778
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,000
What photos?

779
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,010
He took photos of me when I'm with you.

780
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,500
What photos?

781
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,920
Photos...

782
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,040
Photos when we went for the trip in the Northern region.

783
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,840
But, P'Nuea, what are you doing around here?

784
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,180
Oh...

785
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,720
I just wanted to ask you something.

786
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,580
Are you free this Saturday?

787
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,080
Yes, I am.

788
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,840
I can go anywhere with you.

789
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,180
Um... but...

790
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:56,360
where are we going?

791
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,720
My house.

792
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,940
Let's meet my father.

793
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,820
What?

794
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:27,100
♫ You are the magic in my life ♫

795
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,640
♫ That makes my whole heart ♫

796
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:37,000
♫ Feel love since the day you came ♫

797
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,680
♫ You're the one that changed my life ♫

798
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,280
♫ That made me realize ♫

799
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,000
♫ That tomorrow when I wake up ♫

800
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:58,320
♫ I will spend every moment, to love you ♫
