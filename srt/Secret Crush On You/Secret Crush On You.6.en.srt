Then, I'll volunteer to share the room with Nong Jao.

3

All right. Then I can share rooms with Toh.

Khongkwan, you share the room with Nong Som.

You have to accept that everything will change.

00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:35,119
That's right.

165
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,539
Toh.

166
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:38,399
Enough already.

167
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,119
You guys, that's enough. Let's go.

168
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,400
- Yes, let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

169
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,073
Come, Jao.

170
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,440
I'll go with my friends. You may go ahead, P'Sky.

171
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,320
- Hey, Nuea.
- Yeah.

172
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,039
- Where do you think you're going?
- What?

173
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,799
Come here right now!

174
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,339
You!

175
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,799
- That was a close one.
- Yeah.

176
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,659
You must tell us right now.

177
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:17,939
What else did you take from him?

178
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:19,259
- Tell us!
- Say it.

179
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:20,879
- Tell me.
- Nothing!

180
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,239
- You sounded really high-pitched there.
- Right.

181
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,019
The toothbrush was one.

182
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:28,699
What else? Say it.

183
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,179
Spit it out, now!

184
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,679
Guys, search his bag!

185
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,759
- No!
- Jao, go hold onto him.

186
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,319
- Jao, let go!
- No way.

187
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,479
- Let go.
- Toh, stay still.

188
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,620
Here here. This one.

189
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,913
Toh!

190
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,960
Dude! A pillowcase?

191
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,219
But it's not what it looks like. I didn't steal it.

192
00:15:55,219 --> 00:16:01,340
I told the resort it was dirty and bought it from them.

193
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:08,159
Dude, you truly never disappoint me.

194
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,379
Right?

195
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:11,780
- It's not a compliment!
- Exactly!

196
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's go, kids.

197
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,460
- Yes, we'll be right there.
- We'll be right there!

198
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,999
We will talk about this later.

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,020
- We've got a lot to talk about.
- Yeah.

200
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,119
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

201
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,639
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

202
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,019
♫ That there's someone who's been watching you ♫

203
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:47,819
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

204
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:49,639
♫ Who has a secret crush on you ♫

205
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,360
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

206
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,340
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

207
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,439
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

208
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,259
♫ Oh, baby ♫

209
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,000
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

210
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,359
♫ Every time that I see you ♫

211
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,519
♫ I'm always thinking ahead of myself ♫

212
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,120
♫ That you might notice me ♫

213
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,299
♫ Just you looking at me ♫

214
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,039
Where is it?

215
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,119
Your dang hair!

216
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,539
- Hey, can you lift this for me?
- Yeah.

217
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,839
This is for Daisy.

218
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,759
Som, Jao, and Daisy, how are you gonna get back home?

219
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,199
Oh, we'll call a taxi.

220
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,700
I see. How about Toh? Are you going with Nuea?

221
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,939
Yes, of course.

222
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,439
How about this, you drop me off first and then drop them off. Okay?

223
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:50,200
- Okay.
- Sure, sure.

224
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:51,199
- Let's head back together.
- Let's go you guys.

225
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,999
- Sure, okay.
- Shall we leave now then?

226
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,659
- See you later.
- Bye, Toh!

227
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,919
Goodbye. Bye. Bye-bye.

228
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,319
Toh and Nuea, goodbye.

229
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,980
Goodbye.

230
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,450
Come with me, okay?

231
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,079
I'll be taking Nong Jao, okay?

232
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,880
Where are you going?

233
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,340
Well, we... have some "business" to attend to.

234
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,899
Then, please make sure he returns to his dorm safely, P'Sky.

235
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,560
- Very well, Nong Som.
- Great.

236
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,519
- Let's go.
- I'm leaving then.

237
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,739
- I'm going now.
- Take care, Tiger.

238
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,639
- Bye!
- See you.

239
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:40,379
- Nuea, I'm leaving.
- Yeah.

240
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,580
- See ya.
- See ya.

241
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,360
- P'Sky!
- Come here.

242
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,753
- So, Toh.
- Yes?

243
00:18:56,753 --> 00:19:00,340
How was the trip? Did you get the photos you like?

244
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,460
Yes, I did.

245
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,680
But I must thank you for being my model.

246
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,720
But, Toh... do you still remember

247
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,370
that I didn't do it for free?

248
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,680
Yes, of course.

249
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,259
Let me know if you want anything.

250
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:40,320
I will... save my money and buy it for you.

251
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,300
I told you I didn't want payment in money,

252
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,580
but something else...

253
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Please come to the camp with me.

254
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,359
The volunteer camp that organized the concert the other day?

255
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,873
Correct.

256
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,019
Donations from the concert were used to build the camp.

257
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:28,250
We aren't going anywhere far this year.

258
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,859
But I'm not an Engineering student.

259
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:34,860
Would I be able to go too?

260
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,820
Off course you can. I'm inviting you to join.

261
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,820
Unlike you, who forbids me from going to your dorm.

262
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,200
P'Nuea.

263
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,173
Hello, Prao.

264
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,030
You're going too, right?

265
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,870
Then I'll put your name on the list.

266
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,200
So, are you in a hurry to go somewhere?

267
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,519
No.

268
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
Then come and have lunch with me first, okay?

269
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,833
Want to go?

270
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,913
Yes.

271
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,993
Let's go.

272
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,913
P'Sky.

273
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,260
Well, How much was it? I'll pay you back.

274
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,739
Don't worry about it

275
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:01,840
You just have to follow my workout program. That's enough.

276
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,020
Oh, but if you'd like to help me, can you help me with one thing?

277
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,073
What is it?

278
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,170
Go to the volunteer camp with me.

279
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,540
I know that you would definitely go if Nong Toh does.

280
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,879
Then please realize that the reason I'm going is because of Toh.

281
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,460
Not because... of other people.

282
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,900
Although I may be "other people" right now,

283
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,300
later on, I'll be the one for you.

284
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,639
It's quite rare, you know?

285
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,760
A person as handsome and as sincere as this.

286
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,220
When will you open your heart to me?

287
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,433
Meddlesome!

288
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,559
I'm leaving.

289
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,860
What? Jao?

290
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,453
Jao.

291
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,520
Here. The menu of my condo's restaurant.

292
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,290
Order for me as well.

293
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,353
Sure.

294
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,239
Do I have to order a drink also?

295
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
What drink should I order?

296
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,860
I'd better ask P'Nuea.

297
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,480
P'Nuea!

298
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,420
Is there something wrong, Toh?

299
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,780
You called me just now, was something the matter?

300
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,920
It's nothing.

301
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,460
♫ Oh, my love ♫

302
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,510
♫ Oh, my love... ♫

303
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,680
♫ Oh, my love ♫

304
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,120
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

305
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,899
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

306
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:37,139
♫ That there's someone who's been watching you ♫

307
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:39,839
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

308
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,560
I'm so sorry.

309
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,620
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

310
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,780
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

311
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,760
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

312
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,679
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

313
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,460
Are you okay, Toh?

314
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,939
Toh?

315
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,473
Yes?

316
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,653
Blood.

317
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,400
Blood...

318
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,619
Such a pity. I shouldn't have put my camera away just now.

319
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:47,960
What did you say, Toh?

320
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:57,379
Well... I said... it was a pity. I shouldn't have packed my camera away.

321
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,553
Why?

322
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,320
If you hadn't put it away, then what?

323
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,730
Would you have taken photos of me while I was naked?

324
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,679
Just take care of yourself first.

325
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,460
See? You were so mischievous.

326
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,993
And...

327
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,910
has your nose stopped bleeding yet?

328
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,439
It's almost stopped, I think.

329
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,590
Come, let me have a look.

330
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,473
Let's see.

331
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,773
Toh.

332
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,693
Yes?

333
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,880
About the person you like.

334
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,560
Have you ever thought about pursuing them?

335
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,480
No, I haven't.

336
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,920
I just feel that,

337
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,960
I'm happy to see them from afar.

338
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,273
And...

339
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,110
Is the person a man or a woman?

340
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,480
Could you tell me?

341
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,230
What about you, P'Nuea?

342
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,490
Is the person a man or a woman?

343
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,040
Could you tell me?

344
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,840
What about you, P'Nuea?

345
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,840
Who do you like?

346
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,279
Well, I overheard your conversation.

347
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,220
You talked to P'Tor about "Van Gogh."

348
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,200
It seems you really like them.

349
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,139
So...

350
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:17,979
Are they a senior or a junior to me?

351
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:19,930
So I can address them correctly.

352
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,110
How about this...

353
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,300
You tell me who you like first

354
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,410
and I'll tell you everything.

355
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,500
I don't want to.

356
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,499
That's how it is.

357
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:42,379
Now that you have a person you like,

358
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:45,920
a model like me is probably no longer needed.

359
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,799
Ah, no!

360
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,679
P'Nuea, don't be upset.

361
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:54,920
Whether it's P'Red or P'Nuea, I want to take your pictures regardless.

362
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,800
So, their name is "Red"?

363
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,513
Toh.

364
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,900
You can tell me directly.

365
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,920
I don't mind.

366
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,580
And, do you know that dating a man

367
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,750
isn't the same as dating a woman?

368
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,020
How come...

369
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,060
you're asking as if you knew the difference?

370
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,790
I know more about it than you.

371
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,100
At least I do know that...

372
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,600
kissing a man

373
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,010
doesn't feel the same as kissing a woman.

374
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,820
Have you ever kissed them yet?

375
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,060
Did you like it?

376
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,420
Since you're quiet like this,

377
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
don't think too much.

378
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,760
We've kissed three times already.

379
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,340
But... But...

380
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,620
♫ (watching you all along) ♫

381
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,780
♫ (always secretly watching you) ♫

382
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,559
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

383
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,359
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

384
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,559
♫ That there's someone who's been watching you ♫

385
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,540
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

386
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,319
I think the food has arrived.

387
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,960
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

388
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,040
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

389
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,460
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

390
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,199
♫ Just you looking at me ♫

391
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,199
- Good? Do I look good?
- Yes yes.

392
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,199
P'Red.

393
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,900
- Huh?
- Huh?

394
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,233
P'Red.

395
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,580
P'Red!

396
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,600
What are you waiting for, then? Go to him now.

397
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,360
Our friend will finally have a lover.

398
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,140
What is he doing? Why can't I see?

399
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,070
Would you like me to lead the way to the registration table?

400
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,613
Yes, please.

401
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,940
Oh. P'Touch.

402
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,780
- What the heck is he doing?
- Yeah, what's he doing?

403
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,640
Let's go.

404
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,853
Toh.

405
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,193
Toh!

406
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,720
Toh!

407
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,439
What the hell are you doing!?

408
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,600
Let go! Let go quickly. Let go of his hand.

409
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,039
I must apologize for my friend's behavior. I'm sorry.

410
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,939
The registration table is over there.

411
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:19,419
- Oh...
- Would you like me to take you there?

412
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:22,559
- Oh. It's okay.
- It's fine.

413
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,820
- Okay.
- We can go by ourselves.

414
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,919
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

415
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,760
- I'm sorry for causing trouble.
- So sorry.

416
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,699
Let's go sign up.

417
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:32,799
- Let's go.
- Go.

418
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,220
I knew it.

419
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,119
I was wondering whose name would be "Red".

420
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,100
So this is how it is.

421
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,080
Is this why you always come to my faculty?

422
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,980
Nong Toh, you like P'Touch?

423
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,700
But I like Jao.

424
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,800
Come, Jao. I'll take you to the registration table.

425
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,840
Jao, wait for me.

426
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,760
- Shall we go?
- Let's.

427
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,240
So? Do you like him?

428
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,470
What are you looking at, Toh?

429
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,360
Oh. It's nothing.

430
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,433
Well...

431
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,040
I'm not looking at your lips.

432
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,740
When you say that,

433
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,580
does this mean you want me to tutor you again?

434
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,960
Why did we come here?

435
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,900
You want to practice, don't you?

436
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,260
Well... I was going to say,

437
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,040
are we going to practice right here?

438
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,300
Since you're so keen to learn,

439
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,190
you'll probably be the model student.

440
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,820
I'll give you a hand.

441
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,680
You can put it here.

442
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,400
There's one more. Are you all right?

443
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,220
Ah, y-yes.

444
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,100
You can put it here.

445
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,119
Let me help you.

446
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,470
You should go carry something lighter, Nong.

447
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,900
Thank you very much!

448
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,890
You're not even blinking.

449
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,019
Put it here.

450
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:43,939
I'm reserving this.

451
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,799
Gosh, Toh.

452
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,559
You're over the mood just because P'Nuea left his bag with you.

453
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,240
So true.

454
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,860
He's overjoyed.

455
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,760
That's Nuea's bag.

456
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,919
I'm going to sit right here.

457
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,680
Eh, but...

458
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,720
We got here first.

459
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,479
It doesn't matter when I got here.

460
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
But I'm going to take this seat.

461
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,980
Hey, sis.

462
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,959
Didn't your teachers teach you as a kid not to cut in line?

463
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:23,680
That's right.

464
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,379
People like this probably cut in line to use the bathroom. Right, Jao?

465
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,260
Like people who have diarrhea?

466
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,359
Ew! Peach!

467
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:40,380
That stinks!

468
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,130
Excellent.

469
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,639
And look how they dress to the camp.

470
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,339
That's true. They are food for the mosquitoes.

471
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:07,659
Look at each of them. They're wearing such short shorts.

472
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,720
I'm wearing shorts because my legs are short, all right?

473
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,959
Unpretty.

474
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,620
- P'Tor, hello.
- Hello.

475
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,499
- P'Fon, P'Khongkwan. hello.
- Hello.

476
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

477
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,119
P'Sky, would you like to sit here?

478
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,900
No, thank you.

479
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,880
- Hello.
- Hello, P'Sky

480
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,780
May I sit here?

481
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,060
No.

482
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,239
P'Sky, why don't you go sit with P'Nuea?

483
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,040
Toh, come sit with me.

484
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,019
- Go, Toh.
- Hurry, Toh.

485
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,020
Go sit with P'Nuea.

486
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,719
Nuea, are you going to sit right here?

487
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,079
I think the back makes me carsick.

488
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,320
- Ah, I'm dizzy.
- I'm gonna throw up.

489
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,839
It's all right, Prao. I can sit here.

490
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,219
Sitting with the juniors is kind of fun.

491
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:29,479
Hey, aren't you laughing too loud? They'll know that you're satisfied.

492
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,199
The man doesn't pick her.

493
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,733
Silence!

494
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,380
Prao.

495
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,720
What's the matter?

496
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,080
It's nothing P'Touch.

497
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,780
Then, let me know if your friends haven't arrived.

498
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,470
- Quick, quick.
- Hurry up, everyone.

499
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,620
Come on.

500
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,399
We're from St. Stephen University.

501
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,699
Today, we're here to help renovate your school building and the surrounding area.

502
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:19,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

503
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,199
Very well, then.

504
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,779
Let me officially welcome you to

505
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:26,779
the fourth "Engineering: Send Love for Children Volunteer Camp"

506
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:29,079
My name is Intouch. You may call me P'Touch.

507
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,519
I'm a fouth-year student from the Engineering faculty.

508
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,070
I'm the president of this volunteer camp.

509
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,079
That way is where you'll be sleeping.

510
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,939
It is divided by male and female wings and by class year.

511
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:44,839
I'll let you put your bags away and get ready to work.

512
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,719
If there's anything else you need,

513
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,699
just let me know through the walkie-talkie.

514
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:50,079
- Yes.
- Sure.

515
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,180
Then let's get going.

516
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,399
Hey, Toh.

517
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,940
Your P'Red is the camp president.

518
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,919
- Som!
- What?

519
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,653
He's over there.

520
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,119
Toh.

521
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,959
You've already spent your entire day on the bus with the real P'Red.

522
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,239
Do you still want to sleep with him tonight?

523
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:29,199
- Can I?
- You can't!

524
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:31,079
Didn't you all hear what Touch was saying just now?

525
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,399
Our rooms are assigned according to class year.

526
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,200
- That's right.
- Too bad for you.

527
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,919
We can't help you with that.

528
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,759
I think we should go put our things away so we can help the seniors.

529
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:42,799
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

530
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,640
Let's hurry, Jao.

531
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,880
Let's go.

532
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,979
What is it, Prao?

533
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:55,679
- Hurry.
- Slow down.

534
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,579
Gosh! There are only so many rooms.

535
00:47:58,579 --> 00:47:59,939
Hey, this is the men's room.

536
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:01,739
Let me go put my bag away.

537
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:04,359
- Oh okay.
- I'll be right back.

538
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,139
Hurry up, Som! Let's go.

539
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:07,439
Is it this room?

540
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,079
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

541
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,660
Come quicky. Hurry.

542
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,199
I'll make the arrangements.

543
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,439
Toh. Jao. And me, will sleep here, okay?

544
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,980
Why is my space so small?

545
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,599
What's happened? What's wrong?

546
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,179
What's happened?

547
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:35,479
What's wrong?

548
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,430
There's a prince!

549
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,420
- What prince?
- The Frog Prince!

550
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,919
- Where?
- There, Som!

551
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,679
Seniors, is there something wrong?

552
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,259
- Excuse me. Are you two afraid of frogs?
- No, we're not.

553
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:54,999
Then, can you do me a favor and catch it for me? Please.

554
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,150
Quickly, quickly. Thank you!

555
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,099
It's behind the pillow. Behind the pillow.

556
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:03,280
The pillow. The red pillow.

557
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,019
Thank you. Please do me a favor and release it for me.

558
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:15,180
My friends are afraid of it.

559
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,819
Why are you pulling on my shirt?

560
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,110
I don't care!

561
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,860
You have to sleep with me tonight.

562
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,359
Gosh! And if I sleep next to you,

563
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,419
are you going to try something funny under the blanket?

564
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:32,899
Maybe. Maybe!

565
00:49:32,899 --> 00:49:34,660
Daisy!

566
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,159
Enough already. I think we should go now.

567
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,820
- Yeah.
- Go.

568
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:47,280
That's P'Nuea and P'Prao.

569
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,379
Nuea, which room are you sleeping in?

570
00:49:52,379 --> 00:49:56,100
I don't know either. I asked a junior to reserve me a space.

571
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,900
Oh...

572
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,160
I want to sleep with you.

573
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,400
I know that this looks bad,

574
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,990
but I don't have anyone else I can rely on.

575
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,620
Can you please help me?

576
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,113
Prao.

577
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,020
I'd like to help you.

578
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,993
However,

579
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,430
I don't think I can do that anymore.

580
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,320
I don't want the person I like to misunderstand me.

581
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,470
The person you like?

582
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,530
Who is it?

583
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,590
Is the person here as well?

584
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,850
I'd rather keep this a private matter of mine, Prao.

585
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,500
But you're telling me this here and now?

586
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,870
Isn't that too cruel?

587
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,540
I think...

588
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,900
it would have been worse hadn't I told you about it.

589
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,600
I'm truly sorry.

590
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,113
No.

591
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,360
I'm not accepting your apology.

592
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,080
I love you.

593
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,650
Can you think about it one more time?

594
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,033
Prao.

595
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,240
I really don't love you like that.

596
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,720
But we can be friends, Prao.

597
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,960
No, thanks. I don't want to be your friend.

598
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,293
Then...

599
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,310
I'll let you decide on your own.

600
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:44,760
Let's say, I am clear with my standing.

601
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,080
Please excuse me. I'll go help others.

602
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,439
- Hey, man.
- Yeah?

603
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,320
Let's do it.

604
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,999
You guys! P'Red is so fierce.

605
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,559
You're right. As far as I can see, he's totally head over heels for that Van Gogh person.

606
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,419
Ah! I'm sorry, Toh. My tongue slipped.

607
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:21,020
Yeah, he didn't mean what he said.

608
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,260
Why are you apologizing? There's no need to.

609
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,360
You're right about everything.

610
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,339
Toh.

611
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:35,259
Well, just don't think about it.

612
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:38,110
Keep the positive vibe. Let's enjoy the camp activities.

613
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,500
I'm really fine.

614
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,140
This is already worth it.

615
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,960
I get to be like a younger brother.

616
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,920
I get to have meals and hang out with him.

617
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,799
And I even got to sleep over at his condo.

618
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,160
What more should I expect? Just being able to be in his life

619
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:11,260
has already far exceeded my wildest imagination.

620
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,300
