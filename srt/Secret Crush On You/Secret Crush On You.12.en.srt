164
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,820
Let me have a look.

165
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,513
Please?

166
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,853
Gosh.

167
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:31,599
I think this is going too far. Let's report it.

168
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,399
Yeah.

169
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,799
Give it to me.

170
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,539
I'll report them all.

171
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:39,199
I have five fake accounts.

172
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,499
I have six.

173
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,320
Let's do it.

174
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,219
Hey, I've reported them all.

175
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:55,780
Oh, and don't you have to go see P'Sky?

176
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,333
Jao.

177
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,779
Do you want me to go with you?

178
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,399
That's right. Let Toh tag along with you.

179
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,200
- Right?
- Yeah, true.

180
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,453
It's all right.

181
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,390
I can go there by myself.

182
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,959
Nong Jao.

183
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,900
- P'Fon, hi.
- Hello.

184
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,079
Are you to see Sky? He's at the copy and print center.

185
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,439
Thank you.

186
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,000
Then, I'll go...

187
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,820
- Hello, P'Touch.
- Hello there.

188
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,979
Are you here to see Sky?

189
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,959
- Yes.
- Hey, he's the person dating P'Sky.

190
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,719
Really? The one whose photos are circulating?

191
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,959
The one that has become the talk of the town.

192
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,360
- Such a fatty.
- So fat.

193
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,719
Nong Jao, it's okay.

194
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,779
Everyone has a belly.

195
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,700
See, I have one too. P'Touch also has it. Look.

196
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,773
Yeah.

197
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,320
Thank you so much.

198
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,920
Then, I'll look for P'Sky now.

199
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,540
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. Goodbye.

200
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,939
Hey, have you seen Nong Jao's pic?

201
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:04,599
- The one that account posted this morning.
- Yeah. I saw it.

202
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,319
It's so mean. I think this is way too much.

203
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,399
But he was so plump back then. So cute. I wish I could tease him.

204
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,519
Have a look if you don't believe me.

205
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,479
That's enough. Don't show it to me.

206
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,520
Huh? How come?

207
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,790
I don't want to see it.

208
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,233
Oh, wow.

209
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,519
If you didn't want to see it, you could have just said it nicely.

210
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,440
Sky! Wait up!

211
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,713
Jao.

212
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,120
I understand why you walked away.

213
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,000
However, shouldn't you have finished listening to their conversation first?

214
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,260
I agree.

215
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,740
To be frank, things might not be what they appear to be.

216
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,373
Correct.

217
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,300
I don't know either...

218
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,520
my legs moved on their own.

219
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,100
Jao.

220
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,200
But you're not as chubby as you were before.

221
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,000
But if I became chubby like before,

222
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,680
P'Sky won't like me, right?

223
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,399
Jao.

224
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,100
Take it easy. Don't overthink yet.

225
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,360
It won't do you any good by overthinking things.

226
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,700
Why don't you go ask P'Sky?

227
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,190
If he really says he doesn't like you,

228
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,079
you can decide if you want to break up

229
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,480
or look after yourself so you won't become overweight again.

230
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,733
That's true.

231
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,753
I agree.

232
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,439
- Hey, he's the person whose dating, P'Sky.
- Really?

233
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,699
- The one whose photos were circulated?
- That's right. The one that became the talk of the town.

234
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:30,859
- Such a fatty.
- So fat.

235
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:33,379
He was so plump back then. So cute. I wish I could tease him.

236
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:35,499
Have a look if you don't believe me.

237
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:37,399
That's enough. Don't show it to me.

238
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,920
Huh? How come?

239
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,950
I don't want to see it.

240
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,500
Jao!

241
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,320
What's wrong? Are you upset?

242
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,379
♫ Oh my love ♫

243
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:37,120
It's nothing.

244
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,959
You're still going to deny it?

245
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,359
You can tell your friends anything.

246
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:45,439
You don't have to keep it to yourself.

247
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,439
♫ Oh my love... ♫

248
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,039
If you're scared, I'll be right beside you.

249
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,359
And if you're stressed, I'll be the one to listen to you.

250
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,720
♫ Oh my love ♫

251
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,999
Toh.

252
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,539
Yes?

253
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,660
Thank you.

254
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,280
Thank you so much.

255
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,160
What about you?

256
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Are you all right?

257
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,290
You're dealing with a lot of criticism as well.

258
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,739
I'm totally fine because I have a special spell.

259
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,359
Special spell?

260
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,839
Yes!

261
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,799
Do you want to know what it is?

262
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,333
Yeah.

263
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,239
It's such a simple way of thinking actually.

264
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,219
Because others have to deal with gossip as well.

265
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:59,479
We are no exceptions.

266
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,959
Who knows, the people who are gossiping about us right now

267
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:06,119
might be the same people whom we gossiped about in the past.

268
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,199
So, I say this to myself. "We're even."

269
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,260
Simple as that, Jao.

270
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,239
We're even now. Like this?

271
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,060
Yes! Just like that.

272
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,440
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

273
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,973
Jao!

274
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,400
Jao, are you okay?

275
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,659
You didn't reply to my message. You didn't pick up my calls.

276
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:48,880
You didn't come to collect your worksheets.

277
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,560
You scared me.

278
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,853
Here.

279
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
I am okay.

280
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,633
It's just...

281
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
there's something I need to think about.

282
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,679
- P'Sky?
- Yes?

283
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
I want to ask you something.

284
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,280
No!

285
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,360
No what?

286
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,519
I'm not breaking up with you.

287
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,179
Breaking up?

288
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,759
What did I do wrong, Jao?

289
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,359
Was it because I took so much time photocopying the worksheets?

290
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,519
But there were so many people!

291
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,179
If I knew you would be this angry,

292
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:46,680
I would go in and make the copies myself next time.

293
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,390
Please give me a chance.

294
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,770
No breaking up, okay?

295
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,880
- It's not about that.
- Oh?

296
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,080
What would you like to talk about, then?

297
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,373
This.

298
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,060
What do you think...

299
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,300
about this picture?

300
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,820
I think you're cute.

301
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,830
We should have met each other at the freshman welcoming ceremony.

302
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,180
Are you lying?

303
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,720
I overheard what you said

304
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,319
when you talked to P'Khongkwan.

305
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,120
You said you don't want to see this picture.

306
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,879
You went to the copy and print center?

307
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,313
Yeah.

308
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,920
Why didn't you stay and listen till the end?

309
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,880
Because after hearing that,

310
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,859
I left right away.

311
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:40,860
It's true I don't like this picture,

312
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,919
but it's not because you don't look cute.

313
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,000
Look!

314
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
Your clothes are too revealing

315
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,120
I haven't even gotten a glimpse yet. How can other people see it first?

316
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,340
Right there and there.

317
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,650
Shouldn't I be the only one who gets to see it?

318
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,360
That's absurd. You pervert!

319
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,679
Let me conclude it for you.

320
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,679
You're so damn cute in this picture.

321
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,879
After seeing it, I want to lock you up and kiss you all day.

322
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,399
Stop! What do you think you're doing!?

323
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,959
- Just a sniff kiss... a little one.
- No!

324
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,679
Stop! Stop!

325
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,519
Oh, P'Sky.

326
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,359
This person looks kind of familiar.

327
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,959

That's up to you, Peach.

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,859
Thank you. Let me go order my coffee quickly, okay?

331
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,800

What?

Oh. It all finally comes back to me.

I know why his face looks familiar.

340
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:54,240
You're here with a celebrity today, P'Sky?

341
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,859
Celebrity? Who do you mean?

342
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:02,579
Right here! I saw his picture being shared all over Instagram.

343
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:06,480
Especially the one shared this morning. Have you seen it?

344
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,700
I'll show it to you.

345
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,059
No, thanks. I don't wanna see it.

346

Oh, Why not?

347
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:19,899
Well, it doesn't look good indeed.

348

I think it's funny though.

349

I don't want to see it,

350
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,560
because I'm afraid that if I did,

351
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,100
I'm going to beat up the person behind the account.

352
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,500
Is that so? But... the person might be a girl, you know?

353
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,139
Doesn't matter what gender they are. They have no right to post pictures of my boyfriend

354
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:48,090
or to post mean comments to bully others.

355
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,580
I agree. I think those people have bad behaviors. Right, Jao?

356
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,100
Yes! I think so too.

357
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,660
I think the person who did it probably realizes that it's bad behavior.

358
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,639
That's why they didn't use their real name.

359
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:24,280
Yeah, that's true.

360
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,679
If they believed that it was the right thing to do, why would they use a fake account?

361
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,300
I think deep down they're ashamed of themselves

362
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:41,759
I'm kind of curious now, if I reveal their real account, how would they feel?

363
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,379
- I'll have someone look into it.
- P'... P'Sky! Are you being serious?

Of course, Peach.

Do you know what the word "loh-pu" means?

What does that mean, Toh?

375
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,439
It means "get busted".

376
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,019
It refers to a person who's not so slick or not very good at covering up their lies.

377
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:34,559
That's why it's "loh-pu."

Sure, go ahead.

490
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,940
Bye-bye.

491
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,399
- Bye.
- See ya.

492
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,033
Let's go.

493
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,500
Look at them.

494
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,919
Even the patches and keychains on their bags look similar.

495
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,399
Geez.

496
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,919
Right! What about the plan you mentioned earlier?

497
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,553
This.

498
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,593
Marvelous.

499
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,733
Jao.

500
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,573
Jao?

501
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,400
My little cutie.

502
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,140
Fine. I'll go.

503
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,780
Whose boyfriend is this? So sulky.

504
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,150
Whose the one that's teasing me first?

505
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,460
You've become more and more mischievous recently.

506
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,720
Are you still taking photos? Take one for me.

507
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,719
Hurry. Just one.

508
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,520
So meddlesome! I'm not taking it.

509
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,159
Taking one photo of me is so hard, is it?

510
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,540
Give it back. No. Give my phone back.

511
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,160
What's that, Jao?

512
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,673
It's nothing.

513
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:26,000
- Can I see it?
- No way.

514
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,940
May I see it, please?

515
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,279
So meddlesome!

516
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,813
Here.

517
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,879
Cut down carb intake. Exercise.

518
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,599
No desserts allowed. Get enough sleep.

519
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,759
Stop reading already.

520
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,010
Are you serious about this?

521
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,380
What if you become even cuter and someone snatches you from me?

522
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,990
I'll cry to death.

523
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,473
You're silly!

524
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:13,940
P'Sky! Don't exaggerate.

525
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,320
I was just scribbling for fun.

526
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,479
Promise me, then.

527
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:29,370
You can always be cuter, but don't ever let your heart waver.

528
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,513
Understand?

529
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,873
Excuse me.

530
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,919
Is your name Kaojao?

531
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:57,620
Well... someone asked me to deliver these flowers to you

532
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,459
For me?

533
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,159
Hey!

534
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,120
P'Sky, please calm down.

535
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,379
Who the hell asked him to give you this?

536
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:11,459
How can they give flowers to someone else's lover?

537
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:13,619
I have no idea either.

538
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,820
Don't be upset, P'Sky.

539
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,479
P'Sky...

540
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,600
- Hello, P'Sky.
- Hello.

[Flowers for the lovely one, from T.]

542

Who the hell is this "T."?

543
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,279
I have no idea either.

544
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,479
I've never met him before. And I've never heard of his name either.

545
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:46,600
Please don't be upset.

546
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,260
Nong Kong, wait here for a second.

547
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,773
Sure.

548
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,380
I got you.

♫ Oh my love ♫

553
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,839
So... have you been waiting for long?

554
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,659
Just half an hour.

555
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,419
Not that long.

556
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,879
But...

557
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,900
I'm starving.

558

P'Toh.

559
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:33,239
This is P'Nuea. The one I told you about.

560
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,979
P'Nuea, this is Nong Kong.

561
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:38,580
He's the one P'Thep talked about the other day.

562
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,980
I thought you were meeting your real uncle.

563
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,093
Boyfriend.

564
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,099
Yes, that's how it is.

565
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,420
Hello, P'Nuea.

566
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,380
Let's go.

567
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:11,559
Huh? Wait just a minute. How do you go home, Nong Kong?

568
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,079
Where do you live?

569
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,780
My place is in Yim-gnam alley near here.

570
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,499
Oh, that happens to be the same way to your condo, P'Nuea.

571
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:25,440
Then... should we drop him off first?

572
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,219
I'll let you decide.

573
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:31,820
Then, let's go together. We'll drop you off.

574
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,780
- Alright?
- Sure.

575
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,540
- Let's go.
- P'Nuea, let's go together!

576
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,440
Wow!

577
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,690
Did you start to learn about photography ever since you were in middle school?

578
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,300
You're so brilliant.

579
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,379
What style of photos do you like to take?

580
00:45:22,379 --> 00:45:24,219
I like lifestyle photography.

581
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:25,999
I see.

582
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,700
Like the "You are magic" photo that won the competition, right?

583
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,020
I like that photo a lot. Wait.

584
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,710
Is the person in the photo Uncle Nuea?

585
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,980
I mean is it, P'Nuea?

586
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,519
- Yes, that's right.
- I knew it!

587
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,160
That's why I thought his face looked familiar.

588
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,700
I really like that photo.

589
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:59,419
During the showcase exhibition, I went to see that photo every day.

590
00:45:59,419 --> 00:46:01,719
I was hoping I could run into you.

591
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,560
Oh, I see.

592
00:46:06,913 --> 00:46:12,259
P'Nuea, shall we find something to eat before we go to your condo?

593
00:46:12,259 --> 00:46:16,000
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- I'm starving as well.

594
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,620
May I tag along?

595
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,779
Sure.

596
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:35,040
Then, let's eat together.

597
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,120
Thank you so much, P'Toh.

598

- Thank you so much. You're the best.

- What's going on? You seem exhausted.
- True.

Right, Di—

- It's Day.
- Fine. Day.

Huh? Wasn't it you who ordered it?

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,039
It wasn't me. Isn't it you?

611
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,480
It wasn't me.

612
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,090
Who ordered it?

613
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,333
- So that means... someone really did send flowers.
- That's right.

It's not the two of you?

So, this "T." is a real person.

And the person is really pursuing Jao.

617

Isn't that good, then? Everything goes exactly as our plan.

No! Anything that you can't control is not good.

- Who the heck is it?

- No clue.
- But Jao already accepted the flowers.

This is not good. It won't go well.

- Throw it away. Throw it away.

See? It's so cute.

642
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,060
I think it's all because of that fake account.

643

They kept posting pictures and now someone's flirting with my lover.

The account was deleted ages ago. Why are you still holding a grudge?

You're acting nonchalant, Ai Nuea. Let it be Toh.

I bet you'll thrash anyone who's going after him by now.

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,139
You told me you'd take me earlier.

654
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:53,240
- Well... I...
- Please?

655
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,119
Please take me to take photos.

656
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,639
Please? I want to take photos.

657
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,300
P'Nuea, would you like to come along?

658
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,513
No.

659
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,139
It'll be such a waste if we don't go now.

660
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:13,990
The light is perfect right now.

661
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,599
Please?

662
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,480
Well...

663
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,900
Come on.

664
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,280
Okay. Fine

665
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,239
- I'll text you later.
- Shall we go now?

666
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,059
- Let's go quickly, P'Toh.
- Hey, I'll see you all later.

667
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:36,700
- Toh.
- See you.

668
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,233
Bye.

669
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,260
Well, then. Please excuse us. We need to go to class now

670
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,479
Goodbye. Goodbye.

671
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,419
- Come on, Jao. Let's go.
- Let's go, Jao.

672
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,799
- Excuse me.
- Jao, hurry up.

673
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:51,433
Quick.

674
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,590
Bye-bye.

675
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,639
- Come here!
- Ouch!

676
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,759
- Ouch! Khongkwan!
- Be gentle!

677
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,819
Let's go. Move your feet.

678
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:11,180
Everything's fine. Let's go.

You sure are putting in effort.

684
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:29,539
You even try to dress and act like him.

685
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:31,899
This just happens to be P'Nuea's taste.

686
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:35,879
I don't think P'Nuea can date Ai Toh for long.
