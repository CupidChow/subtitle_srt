00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,719
You eat a lot.

167
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:33,219
- I want to go to the hotel now.
- I'll go too.

168
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,560
- Let's go.
- Hey, I need to pee. Let's go to the restroom.

169
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,379
- Let's go together.
- Right right. I'm going with you.

170
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:40,539
Me too. Let me go too.

171
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,319
I'm going as well, P'Kwan.

172
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,579
- Are you coming, Toh?
- Coming? Hurry?

173
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,070
Oh, right. Okay.

174
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,580
Wait for me.

175
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,640
Toh isn't going.

176
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,380
What are you looking at?

177
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,900
Aren't you going to go with them?

178
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,473
I will.

179
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,433
Excuse me.

180
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,193
Toh!

181
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,150
Stay if you don't want to go.

182
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,940
Sit here and wait.

183
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,780
Yes.

184
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,860
Today... you look cute.

185
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,040
Thank you.

186
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,199
You ruffle your hair so much that it's all messed up now.

187
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:16,550
Come. Let me tie your hair for you.

188
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,820
Oh... it's, all right.

189
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,079
No, it's fine. Let me do it for you.

190
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,519
Ah! No!

191
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,220
Well...

192
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,380
Well, I think I should do it myself.

193
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,660
Okay.

194
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,379
Then how about I go tell him this,

195
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:54,460
"Nong Van Gogh, you've made my friend fall head over heels for you."

196
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,293
Toh.

197
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,480
Are you all right?

198
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,220
I have someone I like as well!

199
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,653
Huh?

200
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,200
Who is it? Do I know the person?

201
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,799
Well, I can't tell you yet.

202
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,080
But you know the person.

203
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,860
Then why...

204
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,219
didn't you invite them as well?

205
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:31,970
You like them, right?

206
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,740
P'Nuea...

207
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,260
Why do you like to hang out with me?

208
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,140
Do you like me?

209
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,540
I do.

210
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,340
The ocean!

211
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,999
Seniors! Please wait for us!

212
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,639
Wait for us!

213
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:12,159
Hurry up, Daisy! You're too slow!

214
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:19,799
Right now, we have 4 rooms altogether.

215
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,859
How are we going to split the rooms?

216
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,040
Well...

217
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,319
P'Tor, please share the room with me tonight.

218
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,979
Then, I'll volunteer to share the room with Nong Jao.

219
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:40,599
P'Sky!

220
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,519
Hey, what about me?

221
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,370
You sleep alone, of course.

222
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,259
All right. Then I can share rooms with Toh

223
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,159
so I can sniff kiss his cheeks all night long.

224
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:58,359
- Ooh. Kwan.
- Woah!

225
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:01,859
- Khongkwan.
- What?

226
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:03,760
You share the room with Nong Som.

227
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,959
Nong Kaojao, you and Daisy stay together, okay?

228
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,593
Sure.

229
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,860
And you two, go sleep together.

230
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,080
- Damn it.
- Fine.

231
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,753
As for Nong Toh...

232
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:23,959
Yes?

233
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,793
Room with me, all right?

234
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,100
- Darn!
- Does anyone have an issue?

235
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,160
- Nope!
- No, problems.

236
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,519
Then let's meet again in 30 minutes.

237
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,959
- Yes, P'Nuea.
- Yes, okay.

238
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,639
Okay.

239
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,173
Let's go.

240
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,819
Hey, are you going to sleep right here?

241
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:53,760
Oh...

242
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,733
Come on.

243
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,750
He'll be done for.
(T/N: Samed island is known as a place to rendezvous)

244
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,099
- Let's go, Som.
- Let's go.

245
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:15,159
Let's go. Take my luggage as well.

246
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,859
You can share a room with me, right?

247
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:21,319
- I'll smooch your cheeks instead.
- Please calm down.

248
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm not into that.

249
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,080
P'Nuea?

250
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,960
Put your stuff here.

251
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,350
Yes.

252
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,570
Oh, yes.

253
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,940
Never mind. Let me help you.

254
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,679
Thank you.

255
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,830
- Give it to me.
- Here.

256
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,499
What made you so happy?

257
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,600
Why are you smiling like that?

258
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm happy about the bed.

259
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,833
Huh?

260
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,259
- The bed?
- The bed...

261
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,160
Well... I...

262
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,599
I finally have an idea about the photos I want to take.

263
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,960
I see...

264
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,013
Then...

265
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,810
What kind of photos would you like to take? Have you thought about it?

266
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,053
Well...

267
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,900
I want to take your photos.

268
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,540
Can you be a model for me?

269
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,153
Sure. Of course.

270
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
But...

271
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,940
You must pay me.

272
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,760
Is it expensive?

273
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,600
I only have 2,000 baht with me.

274
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,240
What can I do with this amount?

275
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,880
Oh, but I can transfer to your bank account if it's not enough.

276
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,460
I'm not charging you with money.

277
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,279
♫ Oh my love ♫

278
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,780
I'll charge you with something else...

279
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,800
♫ Oh my love... ♫

280
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:12,599
♫ Oh my love ♫

281
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll let you know later.

282
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,760
♫ Oh my love... ♫

283
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:24,760
♫ Oh my... ♫

284
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,299
♫ No matter what you do ♫

285
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,479
♫ What you're thinking or who you're with ♫

286
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,319
♫ There is me watching you ♫

287
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,959
Everyone, let's take photos together.

288
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,379
One...

289
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:33,779
two... three...

290
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,919
♫ There is me who notices it ♫

291
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,059
♫ I'm right here (watching you all along) ♫

292
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:45,339
♫ In my own space, I've never thought of bothering you ♫

293
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:47,419
♫ Just like that (always secretly watching you) ♫

294
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:53,920
♫ It fulfills my heart, this is all I'm asking for ♫

295
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,099
♫ I can't let you know that I'm secretly watching you every day ♫

296
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:02,820
Everyone. Let's play beach volleyball.

297
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,839
Come on!

298
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,299
P'Sky, now no one will mess with you anymore.

299
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,860
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

300
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,600
- Are you all right?
- I'm good. Perfectly fine.

301
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,559
Okay.

302
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,260
- Go, quick.
- Jao, go.

303
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,499
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

304
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,840
Hey!

305
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,439
What the heck got into my eye?

306
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:29,159
Is he sulking because he couldn't catch it?

307
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,199
Three people is fine too! I am waiting for you!

308
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
How is it?

309
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,260
I'm better now.

310
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,859
Let's continue to play.

311
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:43,359
♫ Just you looking at me ♫

312
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,619
♫  Without knowing your intentions, it still makes me waver ♫

313
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:51,619
Toh, did you take the photo yet?

314
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:54,019
How about you, Jao?

315
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:58,159
I got a few, but they're not exactly satisfying.

316
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,319
Give it your all. You must win this competition.

317
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,699
True. You've studied so hard.

318
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,839
You must get it.

319
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Jao.

320
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,001
Here.

321
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:17,379
Damn you, Ai Sky!

322
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:19,859
There're so many people standing around here,

323
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,519
but you only give the food to Nong Jao.

324
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,479
May you have a prosperous life! Satu!

325
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,619
- Satu!
- Satu!

326
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,059
It's too bad your names aren't Kaojao!

327
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,739
- Damn it.
- Here.

328
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,819
P'Khongkwan would you like to have some?

329
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,479
I do!

330
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,313
Jao!

331
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:45,619
I brought it for you, why are you giving it to other people?

332
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:49,959
Well, you already gave it to me, so it's mine now.

333
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:52,319
I can give it to anyone.

334
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,100
I don't need to ask for your permission.

335
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,730
Want some?

336
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,879
Then, me too. Me too.

337
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,879
- Here. Have some.
- This one is fine. Here

338
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,680
I haven't eaten yet.

339
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,139
- It's delicious.
- It is.

340
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,319
- Is it good, P'Kwan?
- It is very good.

341
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,939
- Here. For you, P'Kwan.
- It's really good.

342
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:14,279
Jao!

343
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,119
He left. Let me take a look.

344
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,599
Yes, go ahead and look.

345
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,799
Come here.

346
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,150
- Come here.
- Where are you taking me?

347
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,533
Is it good?

348
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,740
Everyone, let's eat.

349
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,130
We have plenty!

350
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,359
- Thank you, P'Nuea!
- There's more on the grill.

351
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,699
Right here, he's the real gentleman.

352
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,900
He cooked for us and is paying for it. A round of applause, please.

353
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,099
So awesome!

354
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:55,181
- Thank you, P'Nuea!
- Here, take this.

355
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:56,739
- Thank you.
- I would like one kebab.

356
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:58,840
Let me eat first.

357
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,119
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry!

358
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,079
- It's okay, there's a lot.
- Let me help you carry it.

359
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,139
Thank you.

360
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,279
Come quickly, Toh.

361
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,559
Come sit down. Quickly.

362
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,320
Tor, why did you spill it like this?

363
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,600
How is it, Toh? Did you get any photos you like?

364
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,179
Not yet.

365
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:34,400
Actually, I have to wait for it to be later in the night for the stars to appear.

366
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
Wow...

367
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,050
Why are you going to wait for the stars? I thought you said you would take my photos.

368
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,779
Of course, I have to take photos of the stars, P'Nuea.

369
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,439
Maybe I can get some decent photos.

370
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,619
Do you see any?

371
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:54,039
Did you get any yet?

372
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,820
Not yet. There aren't any.

373
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,159
Would you like to take a look?

374
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,439
Hey, Nuea. Come here, quick.

375
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,439
- Yeah.
- Quickly.

376
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,220
- Let's go.
- Come quickly.

377
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,270
- Let's go inside.
- Toh, come here.

378
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,060
Come quickly!

379
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,860
Here they are.

380
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,579
Is it good, P'Sky?

381
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,213
It's great!

382
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,339
I think you should come and sit here, P'Nuea.

383
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:30,079
You grilled and barbecued for us. It must be exhausting.

384
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,699
- Please come sit here.
- That's true.

385
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,270
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

386
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,619
Toh, move over.

387
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:39,499
- Toh, let P'Nuea sit with you.
- Wait a sec, P'Nuea.

388
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,760
- I'll open it for you.
- Thank you.

389
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,939
- Here you are.
- Jao.

390
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:44,440
- Sit here, P'Nuea.
- Thank you.

391
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,999
While we're waiting to take the photos, want to do something fun?

392
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,900
- Sounds nice.
- Yes. That's a good idea.

393
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,439
- Okay.
- I want to play.

394
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,259
Ta-da!

395
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:02,879
Ugh! Ai Sky, you're unbelievable.

396
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,479
You bring this I'm Your King thing with you everywhere you go, huh!?

397
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,439
Of course, I have to bring it. Especially with so many people. It's more fun.

398
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,120
- Really?
- Yes.

399
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,419
Nong Daisy and Nong Som, you two know the rules, right?

400
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,399
- Uh, yes we do.
- Yes.

401
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,999
Good job.

402
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,940
But I have an extra rule today.

403
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,299
If you pick up something you don't want to do, I allow you to fold the card.

404
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:27,679
But you have to exchange it for 1,000 baht.

405
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,719
We'll use that money for this trip. How does that sound?

406
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,599
Okay.

407
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,519
- Without further ado.
- Come on!

408
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,679
Let's play.

409
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,399
- Let me sit with you.
- Okay.

410
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,639
This is for Nong Daisy.

411
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,399
- Nong Som.
- Thank you.

412
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,199
- Ai Nuea.
- Toh, move a bit.

413
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,840
Right, thanks.

414
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,873
Here, Jao.

415
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,340
Let's begin. You're the first one, Ai Tor.

416
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,619
Yeah, all right. I'm the first.

417
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,919

421
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:06,439
This is thrilling.

422
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,860
- There you go.
- What is it, P'Tor?

423
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,759
- What is it, P'Tor?
- Touch.

424
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,439
You'll know soon who you'll have to touch.

425
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,319
Come. Everyone.

426

00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,719
That's too much!

432
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,759
So amazing!

433
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,779
Touching my hand is more than enough for you!

434
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,130
Yeah, definitely. I won't touch anything else.

435
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,839
- That's no fun at all.
- True.

436
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,160
What is up with the hand shake?

437
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,999
- Exactly.
- Right.

438
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,479
Anyway, come here. Let's continue.

439
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,439

Oh!

Huh? Sniff?

463
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,920
I'd like to fold!

464
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,679
Do you feel like your body has been a little stiff lately?

465
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,119
Ah, I need to stretch.

466
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,640
So tired.

467
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,340
Here, got it. I can fold, then.

468
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,773
Here.

469
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,540
The rule says both sides must agree to it.

470
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,600
I didn't say I would fold.

471
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,519
Toh. Toh!

472
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,420
What are you so afraid of?

473
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,920
It's just a game.

474
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,940

479
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:15,919
Shall we proceed?

480
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,299
I think we should continue.

481
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:24,979
If that's the case... Don't smile. It's your turn, Ai Nuea.

482
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,980
- My turn?
- Let's see.

483
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,719
Ouch! Som.

484
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,499
Why are you pinching me!?

485
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,320
I'm on cloud nine.

486
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,559
Jao, how was it? Was it great?

487
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,639
Right.

488
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,360
What's great about it? Nobody helped me at all.

489
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,519
Well, you've been yielding to him these days.

490
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,953

When P'Sky drives you here and there, did he teach you anything?

Ai Nuea has to kiss Nong Toh again!

Do you want to fold, Toh?

I really couldn't avoid it.

Oh... that's totally fine.

537
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,160
It's just a game anyway.

538

It was all just...

539
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,150
a game to you, Toh?

540
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,033
Huh?

Well...

It's nothing.

543
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,000
You can just think of it as kissing someone you like.

544
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,633
Okay.

545
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,620

I'll excuse myself. That way I don't bother you guys.

- What?
- Gosh, you!

- You're over the moon.
- Yeah, true.

- Toh.
- Hm?

555
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:55,700
I think...

556
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,630
You aren't the star that no one looks at anymore.

557
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,960
Because...

558
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,460
P'Red is looking at you right now.

559
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,759
- So annoying.
- Hey, Toh.

560
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:18,459
Tonight you have to sleep with him in the room.

561
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,800
Are you ready?

562
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,259
Of course I am.

563
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:28,719
I'm more than ready!

564
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,559
Just wait and see. I'll conquer P'Red tonight.

565
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,219
Don't just talk the talk.

566
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:42,779
Hurry up and take the photo so we can go to bed soon.

567
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:44,359
- All right.
- I'm focusing.

568
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,719
Keep your focus, okay? Stay focused.

569
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,019
Give it to me. Move aside.

570
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:51,479
There's only two. What else can we do, right?

571

This one is funny. I don't want it. It looks kind of funny.

00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,790
Right. Right.

575
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,860
This one is beautiful.

576
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,360
Was it because I took the photo?

577
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,959
Just kidding.

578
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,679

- I'm just kidding.

579

What are you doing?

587
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,340
Why did you bring your camera?

588
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,420
Well...

589

Remove it for me, then.

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,920
Is there something on my face? Hm?

598

There isn't.

599
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,790
If there isn't then go to sleep.

Good Morning, Khongkwan.

You got up so early. Have you had your breakfast?

P'Khongkwan, are you talking to P'Fon?

Ah, Kwan. I need to go to class now.

00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,090
Did you eat water chestnut, Toh?
(T/N: Idiom for "failure")

654
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,359
Jao, Daisy.

655
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:19,079
I think the 3 of us should go get something yummy to eat.

656
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,279
Let a certain someone eat water chestnuts here.

657
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,480
Let's go.

658
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,739
Toh. I'll get you a glass of Tiger herb juice.
(T/N: Traditionally used as a tonic to heal wounds)

659
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,150
It may help treat your wounded heart.

660
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,200
Or your internal pain.

661
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,239
That's so harsh.

662
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,239
- Let's go!
- Yes, come on.

663
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,559
- I'll get you the Tiger herb juice.
- P'Kwan!

664
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,540
Let's go and get some more food.

665
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,499
- Okay.
- P'Tor, please come with us.

666
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,519
- Jao!
- Oh, I'm sorry!

667
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,419
Nong Som, you should walk like Daisy.

668
00:57:52,419 --> 00:57:55,579
- I'll get the Tiger herb juice for Toh first.
- No, that is impossible.

669
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:58,480
- Really?
- Yes.

670
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,119
Another "failure", right?

671
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,000
♫ (always secretly watching you) ♫

672
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:34,360
Toh, have this. It's much tastier than water chestnuts.

673
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:38,559
Thank you.

674
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:43,239
♫ I won't be able to control it if you start to notice ♫

675
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,519
♫ That there's someone who's been watching you ♫

676
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,740
♫ Not too far away, there is me ♫

677
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,959
Oh, right.

678
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,760
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

679
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,359
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

680
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,519
It's all gone now.

681
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,280
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

682
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,080
♫ Secret crush on you ♫

683
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,600
Come on, come on.

684
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,999
Here's your Tiger herb juice.

685
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,540
Jao.

686
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,159
Nong Som, your shirt is so cute.

687
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:36,039
P'Kongkwan, please stop praising me with the word "cute".

688
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,579
Because today, I intentionally dressed sassy!

689
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:43,540
I'll turn the sea into fire.

690
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,920
- Damn gorgeous.
- What about you, Daisy?

691
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,800
This is basic, P'Kwan.

692
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,360
Woah, really?

693
00:59:55,361 --> 01:00:01,100
I can guarantee you that all men at the beach will lay their eyes on me.

694
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,480
- That's enough, Daisy.
- How about you sit down first.

695
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,359
- Sit.
- I'll sit now. I'm tired.

696
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,193
Okay.

697
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,780
Nong Toh, your legs are so slim.

698
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,070
Your legs are the size of my arms.

699
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,840
Thank you.

700
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,330
You're also beautiful today, P'Kwan.

701
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:30,370
- True. A little touch of sexiness.
- So slender.

702
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,320
P'Sky!

703
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,133
What?

704
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,299
Aren't you hot in that outfit, Jao?

705
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:46,239
Yes, that's true.

706
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,759
Don't you want to take it off? Like me.

707
01:00:48,759 --> 01:00:51,279
- I'll take it off too.
- Som!

708
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,599
Jao, if you aren't confident,

709
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,639
how about tying it? Like me, here.

710
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,639
Yeah, try it.

711
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,039
Or maybe wearing shorts like Toh?

712
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,159
- Yeah, it looks hot.
- Right.

713
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,139
Show those long sexy legs.

714
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:09,159
- Maybe I'll wear shorts too?
- No, you're fine.

715
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,599
The shirt is beyond short enough.

716
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,699
- No?
- You're showing too much.

717
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:14,940
I'll take a walk.

718
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,160
Oh, is that what you want?

719
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,419
All right, you can go ahead. We'll follow as soon as we finish eating.

720
01:01:23,419 --> 01:01:25,679
- Okay.
- See you soon.

721
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,359
See you , Toh.

722
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,559
Jao.

723
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,359
You're gonna go change your clothes, right?

724
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,599
Daisy!

725
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,799
- I know it.
- You sure are something

726
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,139
Who knows? When he returns, his clothes may be more extreme than yours.

727
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,439
Oh, no. I'd better take my clothes off.

728
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,179
- Daisy, Som.
- I'm kidding.

729
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:44,079
I wasn't going to change my clothes.

730
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,260
- We know it. We know it.
- I'll wait and see.

731
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:32,200
Attention! One unhappy person is spotted.

732
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,879
I already told you these clothes were too hot.

733
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,780
Don't you want to go get changed?

734
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,060
It's fine. I...

735
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,300
I can't wear what other people do.

736
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,470
So this is what you've been thinking about.

737
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:03,259
It's okay if you don't feel comfortable with it.

738
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:05,900
Just do what you feel okay with.

739
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,540
But if you ask me, you are so darn cute.

740
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,500
You're cute regardless of what you wear.

741
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,820
You're cute even with a cloth cover all over you.

742
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:28,960
You're crazy. P'Sky, don't exaggerate.

743
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,140
I'm serious.

744
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:36,230
But if you don't like how it is right now, do you want to change yourself?

745
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,000
Even you don't like the me right now.

746
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,313
Jao!

747
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,740
Hey! Jao!

748
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,600
Jao!

749
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,260
Jao!

750
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,660
Jao!

751
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,680
Jao!

752
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,900
Jao!

753
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,559
Jao! Jao! Jao!

754
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,093
Shit!

755
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,700
I'm sorry, Jao!

756
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,793
Jao!

757
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,780
Are you all right?

758
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,420
I'm okay. I'm totally fine.

759
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,820
Are you fooling me?

760
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,159
No. No, I didn't.

761
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,600
Jao!

762
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,479
P'Sky.

763
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,980
What are you playing at? It's dangerous, you know?

764
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,960
But you also like to tease me.

765
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,680
I'm not.

766
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,900
Your tummy is really cute.

767
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,620
But I don't like to be teased.

768
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,279
And about what you said, are you really gonna help me?

769
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,813
Yes.

770
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,060
But, if it's too hard to change yourself,

771
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,990
would you try changing to become my lover instead?

772
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,100
I think...

773
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,453
I'll take a nap.

774
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,199
Peekaboo!

775
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,100
Where did you come from?

776
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,380
What are you smiling at?

777
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,780
I'm not.

778
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,760
Where did you come from?

779
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,080
Come here.

780
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,839
- You're stubborn, huh?
- P'Sky.

781
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,999
Let go.

782
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,359
You think your acting can fool me?

783
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,039
P'Sky, I said let go.

784
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,420
Don't do that again, understood? It's dangerous.

785
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,253
Toh.

786
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,319
Yes?

787
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,519
Do you know how to give a massage?

788
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,340
I can manage.

789
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,079
Then, do it for me.

790
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,799
Shit!

791
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,750
My back is aching.

792
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,080
Er... sure.

793
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,599
Shit!

794
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,400
Okay.

795
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,733
All right.

796
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,000
Massage right here.

797
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,820
Okay.

798
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,353
Shit!

799
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,399
Hey, Toh. Massage a little harder.

800
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,160
Oh, okay.

801
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,679
Harder.

802
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:06,760
Yes, sure.

803
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,139
Is this the hardest you can do?

804
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:13,440
I can do it harder.

805
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,719
You're massaging too gently.

806
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:19,379
I'm using a lot of strength.

807
01:09:19,379 --> 01:09:21,660
Get on my body.

808
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,420
- Hurry.
- Sure.

809
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,199
Get on top of my body.

810
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,420
Come right on top!

811
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,099
- Oh!
- Quick.

812
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:42,260
Okay.

813
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,120
Harder, Toh.

814
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,300
That's good, Toh.

815
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,500
That's right.

816
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,960
Yes...

817
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,860
- That's right, Toh.
- Sure.

818

- Toh!
- Yes?

819
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,160
Just massage my shoulders. You don't need to go down to my waist.

820
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,879
Shit.

821
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,880
Oops. Shit.

822
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,019
Erm. well, I...

823
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:25,540
I forgot I had to go meet Jao.

824
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,859
Please excuse me.

825
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,319
What's the matter?

826
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,480
It's nothing.

827
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,620
Why don't you look at me when you talk to me?

828
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,253
Turn around.

829
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,373
Okay.

830
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:55,000
Please excuse me.

831
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,579
- Ai Sky!
- What's with you?

832
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:11,413
What the hell is your problem?

833
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,060
What?

834
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:23,320
What the fuck are you looking at?

835
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,339
- Little Nuea.
- What's with you?

836
01:11:26,339 --> 01:11:28,860
You seem to grow fast these days.

837
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,300
You're teasing.

838
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,840
What do you want?

839
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,380
Now you're not talking to me.

840
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,180
So damn cute.

841

Are you sure about this?

844
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,679
It's not something you should mess around with.

845
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,781
I'm sure. I'm giving this person my all.

846
01:12:01,781 --> 01:12:05,381
I'm giving up the Casanova title for you.

847

Sky.

848
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,299
Are you sure you really like him?

849
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:17,640
And not simply because you wanna win him over?

850
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:22,810
Win over what? It's me who always has to accept my defeat.

851
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:27,359
How about you? Are you finally sure?

852
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,950
Of course I am.

853
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,821
But let me warn you, Ai Nuea.

854
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:40,099
It's not just about you being sure or not.

855

Because if you choose this path,

856
01:12:42,699 --> 01:12:45,910
you'll have to accept that everything will change.

857
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,320
