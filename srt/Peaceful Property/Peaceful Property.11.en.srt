1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,730
If you hurt me, you as good as hurt Vimarnsukman.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,860
Our family has ruined enough lives already.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,490
It’s time for me to undo the Vimarnsukman’s family curse.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,680
I’d been applying for jobs in different kitchens before this.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,430
And?

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,690
I got the job.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,820
That's so cool!

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,130
Congrats!

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,810
If you don’t want him to go,

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,970
why did you lie to him?

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,360
If it were you,

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,980
wouldn’t you have let your best friend go and follow his life-long dream?

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,120
Gramps.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,420
When can I come home?

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,660
You keep asking that…

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,530
Can you finally tell me what the true meaning of home is?

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,970
You’ve asked me one too many times.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,560
A house is a home.

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,180
Home is my name.

20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,380
So the true meaning of home is me!

21
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,230
Correct— my bum!

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,890
You look even worse than before, Gramps.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,610
You sure you’ve been taking your medicines properly?

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,950
Of course he has.

25
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,530
I’ve been keeping an eye on him myself.

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,740
I think your Gramps looks worse

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,690
because you keep making him stay up talking to you, Home.

28
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,200
It’s just an old people thing.

29
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,470
We get sick out of nowhere sometimes.

30
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,650
I’ll put it here.

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,840
Let’s get back to you.

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,480
If you haven’t figured out what the true meaning of home is,

33
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,420
you’re not to return.

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,200
Got it?

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,840
Come on, Gramps!

36
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,300
How’d I figure that out on my own?

37
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,860
Vimarnsukman Ghost-Hunting Company Un…

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,930
Limited!

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,990
- We guarantee a ghost-free satisfaction.
- We guarantee a ghost-free satisfaction.

40
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,210
Terms and conditions are as specified…

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,900
Make sure you get everything.

42
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,630
Hurry up.

43
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,180
Put Mr. Samai’s things aside over there.

44
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,910
Be careful with the rest of the stuff.

45
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,160
How are we doing, Mr. Yai?

46
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,590
I’ve got the place cleaned up.

47
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,620
We’re moving Mr. Samai’s belongings to the little house.

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,010
All that’s left is the personal belongings to be included in the cremation.

49
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,940
I haven’t quite figured what those are, though.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,290
It’s alright.

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,720
I’ll handle it.

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,290
Speaking of… Has anyone seen Home lately?

53
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,700
I haven’t seen him around in a bit.

54
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,700
I believe he’s upstairs.

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,300
He’s been rather quiet, hasn’t he?

56
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,400
I guess he’s still trying to get over shutting down his company.

57
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,470
I would guess so.

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,580
It’s a bit concerning.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,950
Will you do me a favor and check up on him, Kan?

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,660
Maybe he needs something.

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,340
Of course.

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,340
Who’s there?

63
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,970
What are you doing, Mr. Home?

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,460
I’m working out, duh.

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,650
There’s a lot to do these days.

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,560
I gotta boost my energy.

67
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,710
But do you have to work out… in that?

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Oh, my my.

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,060
Is my sexy body a little too irresistible for you?

70
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,700
You must be worried about me.

71
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,320
Is that drinking yogurt for me?

72
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,420
Thanks.

73
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,410
Worried about you?

74
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,120
This is for me.

75
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,000
I could sue you for indecent exposure, you know?

76
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,570
What a waste of my concern.

77
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,360
And you said you weren’t worried about me.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,950
Oh, so you really do care.

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,600
How adorable.

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,590
Give me a hug!

81
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,970
Give me a hug, Kan!

82
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,990
One hug!

83
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,720
Yes.

84
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,300
Two bedrooms?

85
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,960
Thank you.

86
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,700
Of course.

87
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,520
I’ll see you next week.

88
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,910
Pang.

89
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,680
The apartment in Chiang Mai that comes with the offer has two bedrooms.

90
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,230
You’ll get your own space to make your content for social media.

91
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,450
Oh?

92
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,740
You don’t seem too happy.

93
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,590
We’re finally moving into a nice place, you know?

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,450
Didn’t you say you hated this bar?

95
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
I know I did.

96
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,010
But after living here all this time…

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,120
This place just started feeling like home.

98
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,300
It’s not ours.

99
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,300
We have to return it eventually.

100
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,770
Peach.

101
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,770
Are you really going to just leave?

102
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,640
I’m happy you got the job as a chef and everything,

103
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,270
but are you really going to just say goodbye to Home like this?

104
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,960
There’s nothing to think about, right?

105
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,110
It’s not like he really cares all that much about us.

106
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,620
Maybe he said all that just so you wouldn’t overthink about leaving.

107
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,590
I just think that

108
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,310
it’d be best to part ways without leaving anything unsaid.

109
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,480
What are you looking for, young master?

110
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,300
Is this everything from Gramps’ room?

111
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:55,890
Yes.

112
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,290
Mr. Somkid has taken care of the rest.

113
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,790
What do you need, sir?

114
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,890
No, nothing.

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,770
Alright.

116
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
I’ll get back to work.

117
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,980
Oh, Peach?

118
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,380
How’d you get here?

119
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,590
By car, duh.

120
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,560
Obviously.

121
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,990
What’s up?

122
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,840
Home.

123
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,580
Yeah?

124
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,270
I have something important to tell you.

125
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,320
What is it?

126
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,620
I want to apologize

127
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,700
for not telling you about the job in Chiang Mai earlier.

128
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,650
I…

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,500
I think I probably won’t get to see you as often after this…

130
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,370
Found it!

131
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,660
What?

132
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,300
I’ve been looking everywhere for it!

133
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,470
Sorry.

134
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
You were saying?

135
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,880
You didn’t hear a word I said, did you?

136
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,060
What were you looking for?

137
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,840
Oh, it’s nothing.

138
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,000
Just keep talking.

139
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,570
I just want to tell you that—

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,410
Hold on, hold on.

141
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,410
Crap!

142
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,600
What is it?

143
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,470
Home.

144
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,750
Yes, Uncle?

145
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,200
Have you heard about Aunt Phorn?

146
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
Like, just now.

147
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,830
Let’s get going, then?

148
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,960
Yes.

149
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,640
Hey, where are you going?

150
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,830
I’m still talking to you.

151
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,060
Sorry.

152
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,170
Something urgent came up.

153
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,290
I’ll come back and talk to you later.

154
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,390
You can keep yourself busy while you wait.

155
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,000
Auntie, this guy is your help for the day so get him to work, alright?

156
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,420
What?

157
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,480
Home!

158
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
Mr. Peach.

159
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,080
I’m really happy you guys agreed to see me.

160
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,810
Of course.

161
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,240
We could never have let you bite your tongue off

162
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,090
or beat up the entire police department like you threatened to do.

163
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,530
I had to say that

164
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,210
because I needed to talk to my beloved nephew.

165
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,610
Home.

166
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,570
I’m sorry for what I did.

167
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,930
But I swear, Home,

168
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,370
that I never thought about getting you killed.

169
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,580
Yes, that car belongs to me.

170
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,940
But I swear it wasn’t me.

171
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,570
Help me out, Home.

172
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,640
I can’t be here anymore.

173
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,970
Enough, Phorn.

174
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,410
I think we’re well beyond that.

175
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,040
Please just plead guilty.

176
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,500
Save yourself from serving more time.

177
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,410
Well, I didn’t do it!

178
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,410
What is there for me to plead guilty of when I didn’t do it!

179
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,130
Why?

180
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,350
We’re family.

181
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,710
Why won’t you believe me?

182
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,720
I guess it’s no surprise someone wants you dead.

183
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,330
Someone like you deserves to go to hell just like your Gramps did.

184
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
Hey, watch it!

185
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,140
Don’t be ridiculous.

186
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,400
What does Dad have to do with this?

187
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,420
You don’t think there was something strange about Dad’s death?

188
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,100
Everyone agreed he had always been healthy.

189
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,950
But he suddenly fell ill one day and died soon after?

190
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,720
If that isn’t strange, I don’t know what is!

191
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,680
You’re talking nonsense.

192
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,940
Officer, please take her.

193
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,420
-Please, ma’am.
-		No.

194
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,550
Home, I didn’t do it!

195
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,120
Home!

196
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,060
I didn’t do it!

197
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,370
Let me go!

198
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,100
Home.

199
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,500
Yes?

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,540
About what Aunt Somphorn said,

201
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,380
don’t pay it any mind.

202
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,950
Of course we’re family.

203
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,340
But for what she did, I don’t think we should help her out.

204
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,890
Uncle Kid…

205
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,570
Is there no way to at least reduce her sentence?

206
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,920
Why?

207
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,090
She wanted you dead.

208
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,680
Why do you still want to help her?

209
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
I’m not doing it for her.

210
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,970
I’m doing it for Gramps.

211
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,040
I think Gramps wouldn’t be too pleased to know our family is fighting.

212
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,450
Your kindness was exactly why Gramps loved you so much.

213
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,240
I’ll ask Attorney Yai to find a way to help her.

214
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,400
Thank you, Uncle Kid.

215
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,740
Can I consult you on one more thing?

216
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,830
I’ve made up my mind

217
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,950
to go back to America right after Gramps’ cremation.

218
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,510
So I’m thinking…

219
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
I want to sell the mansion.

220
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,330
What do you think?

221
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,680
It doesn’t belong to me, does it?

222
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,000
I have no say in this.

223
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,460
But your grandfather specifically left that mansion to you, Home.

224
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,370
Don’t you think selling it would make him sad?

225
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,160
I don’t know.

226
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,480
I just think… Gramps would understand.

227
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,360
Please just stop.

228
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,680
Mr. Peach is a friend of Mr. Home’s.

229
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,200
He’s not a hired help.

230
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,470
Thanks, Kan.

231
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,080
I thought they’d make me clean the bathrooms, too.

232
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,950
You’re welcome.

233
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,520
Have you talked to Mr. Home?

234
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,950
No.

235
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,490
He just went and left me here.

236
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,530
How has he been?

237
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,100
I haven’t talked to him much lately.

238
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,570
He seemed sad at first.

239
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,980
But now he’s just…

240
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,840
He’s just so full of life.

241
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,510
To be honest, I’ve never seen him happier.

242
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,730
Really?

243
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,160
He hasn’t been acting weird at all?

244
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,920
What do you mean?

245
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,330
I don’t know.

246
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,400
I just think Home’s been… out of sorts lately.

247
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
It’s like there’s something he’s keeping from everyone.

248
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,840
You seem to be really worried about him, Mr. Peach.

249
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,400
Worried about him?

250
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,940
Hardly.

251
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,940
Nobody’s buying that, bro.

252
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,390
Kan?

253
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,010
I think you’ve been spending too much time with Pang.

254
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,850
I should get going.

255
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,490
Oh?

256
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,240
Won’t you wait for Mr. Home to come back?

257
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,430
No.

258
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,120
I know you’re by his side so I have nothing to worry about.

259
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,630
Take care of him, will you?

260
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,300
Suradech, you got the car ready?

261
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,260
Let’s go!

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,020
Oh, hey, Home.

263
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
Where are you going first thing in the morning, my nephew?

264
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,360
Oh, I’m just going shopping.

265
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,250
There’s a bunch of things I need to bring back with me to America.

266
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,440
Let’s get going, Suradech.

267
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,260
Hold on.

268
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,420
I don’t think malls are open this early.

269
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,140
Uhh… you’re right.

270
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,960
Why didn’t I think of that?

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,960
Are you hiding something from me, Home?

272
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,260
You’ve been acting strange lately, I’d say.

273
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,340
Don’t think I wouldn’t notice, Home.

274
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,060
It’s nothing.

275
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,320
I’m fine.

276
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,310
If that’s the case, then just tell me where you’re really going.

277
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,910
I’m…

278
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,400
visiting Gramps’ body at the hospital.

279
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,900
Why?

280
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,970
Is this about what Aunt Somphorn said the other day?

281
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,170
No.

282
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,690
It’s just, I have something on my mind,

283
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,690
and talking to Gramps always helps.

284
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,180
I’ll ask Attorney Yai to go with you.

285
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,370
No, please.

286
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,140
I’ve got Suradech.

287
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,980
Home, someone just tried to have you killed.

288
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:05,500
I’ll feel better if Attorney Yai is also there with you.

289
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,210
But—

290
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,960
Home.

291
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,600
Please.

292
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,930
Okay.

293
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,340
MORGUE

294
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,170
Aight, Gramps.

295
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,660
Let’s take a selfie.

296
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,870
Smile, Gramps.

297
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,670
Cheese!

298
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,410
Kids these days really are beyond my understanding.

299
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,950
Oh?

300
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:38,970
Peach.

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,100
What are you doing here?

302
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,680
That doesn’t matter right now.

303
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,970
I have something to talk to you about.

304
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,250
Good.

305
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,160
I also have something to talk to you about.

306
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,280
What is it?

307
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,700
I’m going back to America.

308
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,170
What?

309
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,330
What did you just say?

310
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,970
I said I’m going back to America.

311
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,710
I’m selling the mansion and the bar that’s our office.

312
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,470
So you really meant it when you said this company didn’t mean anything?

313
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,760
Yes.

314
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,600
Nothing here means anything to me.

315
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,920
Not the mansion, not the bar,

316
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,620
not the ghost-hunting company.

317
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,020
What about us?

318
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
We also don’t mean a thing to you, then?

319
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,620
Are you really just going to walk away from everything, Home?

320
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,750
Watch it.

321
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,360
Who’s walking away here?

322
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,360
You’re the one who wants to leave this company for Chiang Mai.

323
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,480
You left me first.

324
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,560
I didn’t!

325
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,680
If I did, I wouldn’t be here arguing with you, would I?

326
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,990
What’s going on here?

327
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,970
Apologies for the trouble, sir.

328
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,610
I’ll talk to you outside.

329
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,490
Please.

330
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,490
How was it, Mr. Yai?

331
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,600
So what’s going on with Home lately?

332
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,500
There was an incident at the morgue yesterday.

333
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,500
His friend showed up.

334
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
They had a little fight.

335
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,000
His friend?

336
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,110
Peach?

337
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,040
Yes, sir.

338
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,230
The “Hottest Exorcist in Town,” so to speak.

339
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,960
But nothing serious broke out.

340
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,090
They cleared things up and went their separate ways.

341
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,520
These past few days,

342
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,580
Mr. Home has been going out to say goodbye to a few of his other friends.

343
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,760
It seems he’s serious about starting his life over in the United States.

344
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,670
Regarding him, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about, sir.

345
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,330
I’m glad to hear that.

346
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,650
There’s still one thing I want to do for my nephew, though.

347
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,330
One last thing.

348
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,060
What is it, sir?

349
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,370
It’s something special that will leave a lasting impression on him.

350
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,370
Careful.

351
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,660
You ready?

352
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,600
Yes, Uncle.

353
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Boo!

354
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,050
Oh.

355
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,200
Uncle, wasn’t it supposed to be just a typical dinner?

356
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,900
That can’t be, right?

357
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,240
This is for my only nephew.

358
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,130
Of course I have to go all out for this.

359
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,120
I’ve got another surprise for you, Home.

360
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,940
Surprise?

361
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,970
Let me introduce you to our chef for tonight.

362
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,810
Come on.

363
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,130
You’re going to say goodbye soon,

364
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,990
let’s part on good terms, shall we?

365
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,880
I need to go to the bathroom.

366
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,950
Don’t worry, Peach.

367
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,160
Home’s just being a little sulky.

368
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,570
He’ll come around.

369
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,360
Of course.

370
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,140
I’ll… be in the kitchen.

371
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:41,770
Sure.

372
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,200
Let me know when it’s ready.

373
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,010
I’ll be your waiter for the night.

374
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,630
Yes.

375
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,010
Thank you, Uncle.

376
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:27,870
Hang on.

377
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,970
I’ll go.

378
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,720
I’m imagining things, aren’t I?

379
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,580
Are you alright, sir?

380
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,860
Yeah, yeah.

381
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,990
I’m okay.

382
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,330
I thought you saw something, too.

383
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,820
What did you see?

384
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,720
I don’t know.

385
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,940
This place just feels strange.

386
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,430
On my way up here, I felt someone looking at you.

387
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,430
Someone old.

388
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
If you think it was my father,

389
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,260
I think your imagination is playing tricks on you.

390
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,460
I guess you’re right.

391
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,830
Shall we get back downstairs?

392
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,980
The food is ready.

393
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,330
Of course.

394
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,940
First of all,

395
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,080
let me say my official goodbye

396
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,960
before you leave for America.

397
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,390
You’ve been the best nephew ever, Home.

398
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,500
Everyone in our family loves you.

399
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,660
This was especially true with your Gramps.

400
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,280
Sometimes I couldn’t help but envy you,

401
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,240
because it almost seemed like he loved you more than he loved me.

402
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,260
Despite that,

403
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,340
I’m very proud to call you my nephew.

404
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,890
So this meal,

405
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,050
cooked by none other than your friend,

406
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,390
is my last gift to you, Home.

407
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,560
Thank you, Uncle Kid.

408
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,260
Alright.

409
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Shall we begin?

410
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,920
Will you go and see what’s going on?

411
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
Uncle…

412
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,090
Gramps?

413
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,330
Is that you?

414
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,900
No way.

415
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,330
You killed me.

416
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,660
You killed me.

417
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,370
Gramps, what are you talking about?

418
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,370
You killed me.

419
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,230
You killed me.

420
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,230
You died of an illness.

421
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,980
Nobody killed you.

422
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,890
Uncle Somkid.

423
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,860
You killed me.

424
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,690
That’s not true.

425
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
Uncle Kid had been taking good care of you.

426
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,770
Why would he kill you?

427
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,110
You killed me.

428
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,680
You killed me.

429
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,520
I don’t believe you.

430
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,410
Uncle Kid definitely didn’t kill you!

431
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,130
Gramps, if this was your idea of a prank, no one’s laughing!

432
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,750
Home!

433
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,590
Home!

434
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,040
Home, Home!

435
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,440
You killed me.

436
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,930
You killed me.

437
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,700
Help!

438
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,010
Uncle Somkid, did you really kill him?

439
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,210
Uncle Somkid.

440
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,220
Say something.

441
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,600
Did you kill him?

442
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,250
You killed me.

443
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,130
You killed me.

444
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,040
Tell us.

445
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,610
You killed me.

446
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,390
You killed me.

447
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,970
You killed me.

448
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,530
Stop this nonsense!

449
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,640
What the hell are you playing?

450
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,380
All of you.

451
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,230
What is this stupid farce?

452
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,850
Did you think I couldn’t tell?

453
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,310
Home.

454
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,570
Why are you doing this?

455
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,890
What do you want from this?

456
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,940
I needed to prove something.

457
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,680
Prove something?

458
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,700
What did you want to prove?

459
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,700
That I killed your grandfather?

460
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,470
I wouldn’t even have thought of it

461
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,690
if Gramps didn’t tell me himself.

462
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,450
Undo the family curse.

463
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,580
Undo the family curse.

464
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,490
Undo the family curse.

465
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,910
Undo the family curse.

466
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,620
Gramps?

467
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,970
Undo the family curse.

468
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,730
Who’s there?

469
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,940
I didn’t understand what exactly Gramps wanted to say.

470
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,320
What are you doing, Mr. Home?

471
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,840
I’m working out, duh.

472
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,980
Not until…

473
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,450
You don’t think there was something strange about Dad’s death?

474
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,040
Everyone agreed he had always been healthy.

475
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,500
But he suddenly fell ill one day and died soon after?

476
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,460
That was when I knew I couldn’t trust anyone in our family.

477
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,190
Don’t be ridiculous.

478
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,040
What does Dad have to do with this?

479
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,750
But I have someone else I could trust.

480
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,280
What?

481
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,280
Gramps’ ghost?

482
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,270
Yeah.

483
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,970
His body hasn’t been cremated, right?

484
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:20,400
Maybe his ghost stays around.

485
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,410
I bet that means he’s still got something tethering him here.

486
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,570
I’ll visit his body tomorrow to see if there’s something I can find.

487
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,210
Which… brings to my question.

488
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,960
Will you go with me?

489
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,750
No.

490
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,900
Oh.

491
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,540
Okay.

492
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,040
You’re still mad at me, then.

493
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,550
I’m kidding.

494
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,970
It was worth seeing your sad face.

495
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,970
I wouldn’t just say no now that you’d asked, right?

496
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,380
Come on.

497
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,720
Don’t scare me like that.

498
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,360
Aren’t you evolved and all that now?

499
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,080
You’ve finally developed a sense of humor.

500
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,950
But, well…

501
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,160
Thanks.

502
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,170
Sure.

503
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,120
ATTORNEY YAI IS STILL HERE.
BURST IN AND ARGUE WITH ME.

504
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Nothing here means anything to me.

505
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,930
Are you really just going to walk away from everything, Home?

506
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,370
Who’s walking away here?

507
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,370
If I did walk away, I wouldn’t be here arguing with you, would I?

508
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,170
What’s going on here?

509
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,020
Apologies for the trouble, sir.

510
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,650
I’ll talk to you outside.

511
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,480
You almost got us caught!

512
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Well, your acting was way too convincing.

513
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,190
Did you have to push me so hard?

514
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,970
Hey, it was supposed to look real.

515
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,300
They wouldn’t believe we were fighting otherwise, would they?

516
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,100
When you said you were going back to America,

517
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,100
you were just trying to rile me up, right?

518
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,960
No.

519
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,340
That was true.

520
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,170
What?

521
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,110
You—

522
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,990
But when I said nothing here meant anything to me…

523
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,990
That was a lie.

524
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,380
You guys mean so much to me.

525
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,900
You know that, right?

526
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,380
Let’s check up on your Gramps.

527
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,410
Hey.

528
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,280
All his fingertips have turned black.

529
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,280
What about them?

530
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,940
I’ve read somewhere online that

531
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,360
if the fingertips of a corpse turn black,

532
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,940
it means the person dies of poison.

533
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:56,440
Actually, toxins aren’t likely to show up on long-preserved corpses.

534
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,940
But I’ve looked this over

535
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,250
and found an arsenic-like substance in Mr. Samai’s toxic report.

536
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,900
This is the same chemical I found

537
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,970
in the medicine you asked me to look into earlier.

538
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,760
That makes Mr. Somkid our main suspect as of now.

539
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,220
It… does.

540
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,470
But I just can’t believe Uncle Kid would do that to Gramps.

541
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,280
If this was a legal procedure, we would need to prove it.

542
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,410
But…

543
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,210
How can we even do that?

544
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,820
Home, Uncle Somkid contacted me two days ago.

545
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,420
He wanted me to cook for your going away party.

546
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,920
I think something’s not right.

547
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,970
I don’t know what he’s thinking.

548
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,250
This could prove useful for us.

549
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:42,210
Let’s just take this opportunity to bring the truth to light.

550
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,540
To make this theatrics believable,

551
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,050
we need the help of a professional.

552
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,650
And so we asked a professional to help perfect our plan.

553
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,650
This is just basic physics.

554
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,690
Attach a magnet underneath.

555
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,260
We came up with this haunting house plan to prove our theory.

556
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,640
It seems everything points to you as our number one suspect, Uncle.

557
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,960
All that makes you believe I killed your grandfather?

558
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,890
No.

559
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,220
Even now, I still don’t believe it.

560
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,170
That’s why we need you to prove it.

561
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,950
You’re the only one who can clear your name.

562
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,080
In the end,

563
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,970
you found me out, huh?

564
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,910
Home.

565
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,930
I’m sorry

566
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,410
for disappointing you.

567
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,490
Why?

568
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,820
I didn’t mean to.

569
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,220
I never meant to kill him.

570
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,450
I was just hurt

571
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,110
that ever since I was a kid,

572
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,430
your grandfather always took me for granted.

573
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,960
A stupid thought crossed my mind.

574
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,950
If I poisoned your grandfather, I could be the one to take care of him,

575
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,880
and then he would have no choice but to appreciate me.

576
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,020
Still, he never did.

577
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,910
Eventually, his body couldn’t take it anymore,

578
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
and he succumbed to it.

579
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,030
Home.

580
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,810
I’m sorry.

581
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,850
But believe me when I say

582
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,200
I never meant to kill him.

583
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,960
Not even a little bit.

584
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,150
I believe you.

585
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,240
But…

586
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Please turn yourself in.

587
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,640
Make it right.

588
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Please.

589
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,450
Of course.

590
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,120
Thank you

591
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,670
for opening my eyes.

592
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,210
Home.

593
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,400
Before you take me to the police,

594
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,820
will you come to the little house with me?

595
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Your grandfather left something else for you.

596
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,710
Of course.

597
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,200
Home.

598
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,690
I’m coming with you.

599
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,450
No need.

600
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,850
I’ll be back soon.

601
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,680
Can you guys clean up over here?

602
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,610
At least take this.

603
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,540
Take a video, just in case.

604
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,130
Uncle Kid.

605
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,500
What is this thing Gramps left me?

606
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,410
Just follow me.

607
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,850
You’ll find out soon.

608
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,650
Hmm.

609
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,050
Where did I hide the key again?

610
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,950
Gramps wanted his ash enshrined here in this little house, right?

611
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,290
I guess so.

612
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,700
I still can’t quite figure out why he’d want to do that.

613
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,990
It’s just a house we used to squeeze in together when we had nothing.

614
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,920
It’s full of awful memories.

615
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,980
Maybe Gramps thought this house was more home than that giant mansion.

616
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,430
He used to keep asking me what the true meaning of home is.

617
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,970
Even now,

618
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,098
I still don’t know what it’s supposed to mean.

619
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,207
You’re going to sprain your neck at this rate, Mr. Giraffe.

620
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:21,287
He’ll be back soon.

621
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:22,741
Stop worrying.

622
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,970
You still have an appetite at a time like this?

623
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,636
I have an appetite at all times, mama.

624
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,829
All this food is just too good to ignore.

625
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,494
It’d be a waste to just throw it away, you know?

626
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,567
Come here, Suradech.

627
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:44,996
Take a seat.

628
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:47,614
Let’s dig in.

629
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:49,592
Open wide!

630
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,796
The true meaning of home?

631
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,883
Why would he ask that, I wonder,

632
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,578
when he never cared what the people in his family think or feel.

633
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,840
Mr. Suradech.

634
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:18,683
Suradech?

635
00:40:18,712 --> 00:40:19,636
Mr. Suradech!

636
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:22,880
- Suradech!
- Suradech!

637
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:23,723
Suradech!

638
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:24,181
Suradech!

639
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,134
Suradech!

640
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,400
We need an ambulance.

641
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:27,370
Someone’s had a seizure.

642
00:40:27,418 --> 00:40:28,218
Pang.

643
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,101
What did he eat?

644
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,352
He ate from that plate.

645
00:40:33,738 --> 00:40:35,730
This plate was for Home.

646
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,414
What… do you mean?

647
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,192
I’m talking about your Gramps.

648
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,596
Oh, here it is.

649
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:51,149
This is what Gramps left for you.

650
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,960
What is it?

651
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:10,101
Home.

652
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,425
Arrest him, officer.

653
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,603
He’s the cook who poisoned our master’s dinner.

654
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,461
What?

655
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,381
All the suspects must remain within the crime scene.

656
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:45,141
I believe these people hide Mr. Home somewhere in this mansion.

657
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,218
Or worse, maybe they’ve already murdered him.

658
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,210
Home’s been gone with Uncle Somkid for way too long.

659
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,898
He’s obviously in danger.

660
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,890
You’re awake now, my nephew?

661
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:57,120
Why are you doing this?

662
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:01,978
It’s time you follow your Gramps’ footsteps into hell.

663
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,218
You should learn to take the winning side for once.

664
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,327
I’ll send your beloved grandson to you, Dad.
