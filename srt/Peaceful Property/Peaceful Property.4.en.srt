1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:03,002
This is the employment contract between Mr. Home and you, Mr. Peach.

2
00:00:03,296 --> 00:00:06,460
Your duty is to exorcise ghosts from all of Mr. Home’s properties.

3
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:13,035
This was supposed to be his birthday present to you, Tarnsai.

4
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:19,037
Are we really going to let them do as they please?

5
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,373
We can’t stop these kids.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,622
Letting them do what they want under our close supervision…

7
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:26,703
That’s better.

8
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:27,574
Don’t you think?

9
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:31,779
Get out!

10
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:33,480
Get out!

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,808
GET OUT
Get out!

12
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:33,808
GET OUT

Get out!
GET OUT

GET OUT

15

Get out!
GET OUT

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,398
Get out!

17
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:36,158
Get out!

18
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:36,871
Get out!

19
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:37,665
Get out!

20
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,828
Crap.

21
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:41,668
I think we should get out of here.

22
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:43,309
This is getting dangerous.

23
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:44,243
GET OUT

24
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:44,802
Come on.

16 HOURS AGO

Every house has its story.

28
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:49,176
Same goes for this one.

29
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:53,308
My grandfather bought this house to rent it out.

30
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,050
But that was until last year.

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,365
Tenants just never stayed long

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,802
because they were all heavily harassed.

33
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,508
They said unanimously that

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,602
it was the ghost of the possessive former owner

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,679
who still doesn’t want anyone
to step foot on his beloved home.

Oh.

57
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:51,869
He hung up.

58
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:57,343
How many times have I told you to stop with online shopping?

59
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:58,368
It’s a waste of money.

60
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,220
Come on, Peach.

61
00:03:00,768 --> 00:03:02,680
It’s not a waste of money this time.

62
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:04,105
This is too much.

And Ghost Radar 2.0.

66
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,057
Awesome!

67
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,528
Fine.

68
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,200
As long as it’s on the company's dime.

69
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:37,522
I’m okay with that.

70
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:38,647
It was your dime.

71
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:39,964
I knew it!

72
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,320
Pang!

73
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,525
It’s such a waste.

74
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:44,503
Come on, Peach.

75
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:46,305
It’s great that we’re well-equipped.

76
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:48,469
It’ll make us look trustworthy when we’re out ghost-hunting.

77
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:49,346
That’s so true.

78
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,481
We’ve got a whole lot of followers now, you know?

79
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:55,617
I’m sure they expect quality content from us.

80
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,309
Furthermore, we must go all out this time around.

81
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,862
Because the next property we’re selling…

82
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:13,253
is very haunted.

83
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:32,960
Haunted, indeed.

84
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,124
Forget ghosts,

85
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,379
I think this place is infested with something else entirely.

86
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,915
There he is.

87
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,386
The infamous former owner.

88
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,382
Seeing as this is spooky from the get-go…

89
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,100
Exorcist Peach,

90
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,949
you must be crushed under some serious negative energy, aren’t you?

91
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:14,379
Not at all.

92
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,914
- Ow! - Ow!

93
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:18,164
Don’t cut us short like that, man.

94
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:20,608
This place is a legend around here, you know?

95
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:21,637
Be respectful.

96
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:22,494
He’s right.

97
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:25,300
How can we tie in the products we brought otherwise?

98
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,306
But I really don’t feel anything.

99
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:30,610
Home.

100
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,974
Are you sure this place really is haunted?

101
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,605
How about I take you on a home tour?

102
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:44,250
See for yourself if it’s haunted.

103
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:46,413
Just be prepared.

104
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:50,917
You feel it yet?

105
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:53,745
No.

106
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:55,657
You feel it yet?

107
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,117
No.

108
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:00,604
You yeel it fet?

109
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:01,782
- “Feel it yet!” - “Feel it yet!”

110
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,405
Don’t make me repeat myself.

111
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,709
I think it’s safe to say this place is ghost-free.

112
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:15,740
You can sell it.

113
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,810
Hey, not so fast.

114
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:19,029
This ain’t good.

115
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,309
What do you mean, “ain’t good”?

116
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,805
Isn’t it easier to sell the house when it’s not haunted?

117
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,300
But I’ve talked heaps in that radio show.

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,663
What if I got accused of making up ghost stories to sell my properties?

119
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:29,860
Who asked you to do that?

120
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:34,702
I guess this calls for our newest equipment.

121
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:55,508
See, Peach?

122
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,165
Told you there’s a ghost here.

123
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:58,740
You’re off your game.

124
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,613
AI has disrupted you, dude.

125
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:12,724
Crap, this thing really freaking works.

126
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,245
Yessir?

127
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:17,817
It’s just you, Suradech?

128
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:19,019
It is me.

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,902
You called me, didn’t you, sir?

130
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,405
Pang, I think this machine is just a thermal scanner,

131
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:29,066
not a ghost scanner.

132
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:32,007
Let’s just go.

133
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:34,416
I agree.

134
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:39,917
You coward.

135
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:43,762
I heard so much about you.

136
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,271
Thought you’d be more menacing.

137
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,411
If you’re really all that, just come out if you dare.

138
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:48,605
Home.

139
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,026
That’s wicked.

140
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:51,217
Do it more!

141
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,210
I’ll give you one last chance.

142
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,826
If you don’t come out right now,

143
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,308
don’t ever bother coming out to scare the next buyer when they move in.

144
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,324
Otherwise, you’ll catch these hands!

145
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,056
Home, stop it.

146
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,056
Shouldn’t you be spending your time selling other houses instead of this?

147
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,903
What now?

148
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,318
He–He looked right at me just now.

149
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,216
What?

150
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:21,579
His portrait.

151
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:29,512
Stop it.

152
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:30,602
We’re going back.

153
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:36,607
Peach! There!

154
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,308
Peach!

155
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:38,314
Peach!

156
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,311
What?

157
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:40,417
I saw him!

158
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:45,902
Home, you don’t have to be so dramatic.

159
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:47,979
You really can’t lose face even once, can you?

160
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,454
I’m not shitting, man.

161
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:51,524
I really saw someone!

162
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,602
If you’re the only witness, it doesn’t count as the truth.

163
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,179
Fine, then.

164
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:03,762
I’m exercising my right as your employer.

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,604
You are all to stay here and exorcise this place before the night ends.

166
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:08,386
What?

167
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:09,905
You can’t do that.

168
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,857
What are you, a dictator?

169
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:13,180
I second that.

170
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,118
You’re exactly the kind of people dragging our nation down.

171
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,468
Oh, you want democracy?

172
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,730
Let’s vote.

173
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,659
If you want us to stay here tonight,

174
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:24,674
hands up.

175
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,314
It’s 2-2.

176
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:29,200
Wrong!

177
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,315
There we have it, we’re all staying.

178
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:34,311
What?

179
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:36,311
No way! You’re cheating.

180
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:37,917
Suradech doesn’t count.

181
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:40,102
He’s employed by you so he does what you do.

182
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:41,674
- I second that. - Democracy rules, man. It’s 3-2.

183
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,174
- Our team consists of the four of us. - You can’t do this.

184

I’ve got another piece to introduce to you guys.

215
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:26,690
It’s the Ghost Whisperer Microphone.
OH, COME ON, GIRL!

216
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:26,718
It’s the Ghost Whisperer Microphone.

217
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,250
WHAT IS SHE SELLING TODAY?
It’s the Ghost Whisperer Microphone.

218
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:27,278
It’s the Ghost Whisperer Microphone.

219
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,569
GHOST-HUNTING, NO. SELLING PRODUCTS, YES.
It’s the Ghost Whisperer Microphone.

220
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:28,598
It’s the Ghost Whisperer Microphone.

221
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,124
WHERE IS IT?
It’s the Ghost Whisperer Microphone.

222
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:29,166
WHERE IS IT?

223
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:29,736
Oh?
WHERE IS IT?

224
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:29,890
WHERE IS IT?

225
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,290
THAT’S A FLASHLIGHT.

226
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,290
YOU GOT SCAMMED, SIS.

227
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:32,720
HAHAHA.

228
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:33,930
DON’T CALL HER OUT LIKE THAT.
Excuse me for a bit.

229
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,318
Where’s the microphone?

230
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,090
HEY, ANYONE HEARS THAT?

231
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,159
OH SHOOT YES!
The night has begun, guys.

232
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,530
AIN’T NO WAY!

233
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,197
NOOOO!
It’s begun.

234
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,970
SPOOKY! SCARY!

235
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:49,970
I’m scared of rain.

236
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:52,321
I’m scared of thunderstorms.

237
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:56,050
I’m scared of being stuck in traffic for too long.

238
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:58,912
That’s just the speaker.

239
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,102
Evidently.

240
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:04,871
This is like being a judge on the Masked Singer.

241
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,450
AIN’T NO GHOST, JUST PANG SCAMMING US.

242
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,810
BUMMER.

243
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,250
WHERE’S THE GHOST?

244
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,050
I DON’T MIND THAT SILLY GADGET BUT THIS AIN’T FUN.

245
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,450
YOU’RE AS BS AS OUR GOVERNMENT.

246
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,290
DISAPPOINTED.

247
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:11,890
FUNNY, THOUGH.

248
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,290
YOU PEOPLE ARE SCAMMERS.

249
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,610
TRUE OR FALSE?

250
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,370
WHERE’S THE GHOST?

251
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:13,576
WHERE IS IT?

252
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:14,916
The ghost will come out soon.
WHERE IS IT?

253
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:15,351
WHERE IS IT?

254
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:16,679
Don’t cancel me, you guys.
WHERE IS IT?

255
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:17,370
Don’t cancel me, you guys.
ENOUGH PLAYING AROUND.

256
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:18,429
Wait just a little longer.
BORING! NO MORE WAITING.

257
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:22,068
Peach.

258
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,672
Don’t you think Pangpang’s been kinda full of energy lately?

259
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:30,474
She’s been, like, active, lively, energetic, and dynamic.

260
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,373
You have no right saying that about my sister,

261
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,616
not when you’re the one egging her on.

262
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,715
She’s always been generally intense.

263
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:38,870
But now she’s beyond even that.

264
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:40,985
Nah.

265
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:45,545
I think Pangpang’s been more serious with everything

266
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,411
because she just wants to be useful to you.

267
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,968
You don’t notice that?

268
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:52,208
Really?

269
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:54,918
How so?

270
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,570
WHAT NOW?

271
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,630
OH, THAT SCARED ME!

272
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:08,530
I will no longer be cancelled.
OH, THAT SCARED ME!

273
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:08,558
I will no longer be cancelled.

274
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,001
WAS THAT ATTORNEY KAN?
I will no longer be cancelled.

275
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:09,130
WAS THAT ATTORNEY KAN?

276
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,370
The real deal is here.
WAS THAT ATTORNEY KAN?

277
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,680
The real deal is here.

278
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,370
I THINK THIS IS REAL!
The real deal is here.

279
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,610
FINALLY!

280
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:11,619
Let’s go.

281
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:21,500
Kan.

282
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:22,774
What happened?

283
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:26,376
Just–Just now…

284
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,588
 You came into my life just in time. 

285
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:33,373
 You came into my life like it’s been destined. 

286
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:41,979
Kan.

287
00:12:43,248 --> 00:12:44,379
Did you just see a ghost?

288
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:08,801
I literally got that on camera.

289
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,912
Wait.

290
00:13:10,444 --> 00:13:11,872
How come all of you can see him?

291
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:14,308
Get out!

292
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,927
Get out!

293
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:16,952
Get out!

294
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:17,651
Get out!

295
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:18,629
Get out!

296
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,137
Get out!

297
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,191
Peach, wait!

298
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,810
GET OUT

299
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,013
What the hell?

300
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,327
This guy really is the real deal.

301
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,050
SCARY!

302
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,570
NOW THIS IS IT!

303
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:35,693
Holy crap…

304
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,342
Get out!

305
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:38,314
Get out!

306
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,059
Get out!

307
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:40,081
Get out!

308
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:40,560
Get out!

309
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,122
HAHAHAHAHAHA.
Get out!

310
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:41,355
HAHAHAHAHAHA.

311
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:41,448
Get out!
HAHAHAHAHAHA.

312
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:42,305
Get out!

313
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:43,342
Get out!

314
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,800
I think we should get out of here.

315
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,309
This is getting dangerous.

316
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:47,050
Get out!

317
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:47,977
- Get out!
- Come on.

318
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:48,740
Get out!

319
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:49,314
Get out!

320
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:50,250
Get out!

321
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,751
LOVE THIS. PRAY THEY RUN INTO MORE GHOSTS.

322
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:52,635
It’s really happening…
LOVE THIS. PRAY THEY RUN INTO MORE GHOSTS.

323
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,240
SCREECHING!

324
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,450
I can see ghosts, guys!
SCREECHING!

325
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:54,970
CONGRATS, GIRL.
I can see ghosts, guys!

326
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:54,990
I can see ghosts, guys!

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,490
RUN, GIRL!
I can see ghosts, guys!

328
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:55,770
PANG, BABE, EVERYONE’S GONE!

329
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,810
PANGPANG, GET OUT OF THERE!

330
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,130
SPOOKY!

331
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,450
THIS IS SO REAL!

332
00:13:59,022 --> 00:13:59,570
Pang!

333
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:00,591
Pang!

334
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,478
Peach!

335
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,505
Peach.

336
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:11,549
Peach.

337
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:12,754
Peach.

338
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:18,733
Let’s go.

339
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,376
Peach.

340
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:25,533
Suradech, get out of here!

341
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:27,130
Peach, you okay?

342
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:29,801
Look!

343
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,194
What the hell?

344
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,480
Let’s just go.

345
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,582
- Peach, come on. - Run!

346
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,315
Go!

347
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,130
VIMARNSUKMAN GHOST-HUNTING COMPANY UN LIMITED

348
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:55,407
Sit down.

349
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:58,204
Hold on.

350
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:59,106
You okay?

351
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,474
Oww, it hurts.

352
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,911
It’s swollen.

353
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,571
I won’t accept this.

354
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,703
Ghost or whatever,

355
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:12,216
causing physical harm is simply unacceptable.

356
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,463
I hear you, Kan.

357
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,982
But what are you gonna do? Take that ghost to court?

358
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:18,705
Take a chill pill, girl.

359
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,256
But it’s strange, isn’t it?

360
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:24,108
How come all of you can see him?

361
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:26,506
And he’s unusually outrageous.

362
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:31,444
Maybe it’s because he has a thug mug?

363
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,911
That might make him more powerful than most ghosts.

364
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:37,607
I don’t know about that.

365
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,765
But I can look up information on former tenants.

366
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,542
Maybe we can find some clues there.

367
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:45,920
Thank you, Kan.

368
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:58,703
Why… don’t you go take a rest for now?

369
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,555
We’ll get back to this tomorrow.

370
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:19,871
Come on.

371
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:23,371
Let’s get you rested, too.

372
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:24,417
Careful, careful.

373
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,490
VIMARNSUKMAN REVENUE ACCOUNTS

374
00:17:19,965 --> 00:17:21,074
Whatcha got there?

375
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:31,411
Kan, I told you to come to me if you need anything.

376
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:34,782
I apologize, Mr. Somkid.

377
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:38,380
I was looking for the list of former tenants for Mr. Home.

378
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,321
I thought it would be in one of these binders.

379
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,417
I think this is the correct one.

380
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:03,309
Kan.

381
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,407
I don’t mind you grabbing some of these files.

382
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,814
Just let me know beforehand next time.

383
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:09,617
Alright?

384
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:12,909
Understood.

385
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:26,915
This is the list of all former tenants?

386
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:27,680
Yes.

387
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:27,837
RENTAL AGREEMENT
Yes.

388
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:28,170
RENTAL AGREEMENT

389
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,729
It includes the tenant who lived there right before these strange things happened.
RENTAL AGREEMENT

390
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,308
It includes the tenant who lived there right before these strange things happened.

391
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,115
This is the latest photo of him I could find.

392
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,303
Hey.

393
00:18:39,642 --> 00:18:41,405
He looks exactly like the man we saw.

394
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:45,306
Maybe… he died inside the house?

395
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,602
I think so, too.

396
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:53,512
I guess they’re ghosts now, both the father and the daughter.

397
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:55,103
What?

398
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,407
What daughter?

399
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:00,801
Yeah, his daughter.

400
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,007
You didn’t see her?

401
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:03,697
No, I didn’t.

402
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,860
What the hell?

403
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,176
Let’s get out of here.

404
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,576
Hey, Peach.

405
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:23,611
Look at his occupation.

406
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:35,401
Home.

407
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:38,379
I think I could piece the puzzle together somehow.

408
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:42,567
Let’s get back there.

409
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:53,982
Alright, gang.

410
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,312
Let’s go ghost-hunting!

411
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:12,017
We’re back to play your victims, Mr. Ghost, sir.

412
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:13,100
Come on out.

413
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,223
Maybe it’s too bright outside for ghosts to come out?

414
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,416
If you don’t come out right now,

415
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,213
I’m going to sell this place right away.

416
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:43,500
 You came into my life just in time. 

417
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:47,202
 You came into my life like it’s been destined. 

418
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,930
GET OUT

419
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,613
Get out!

420
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:21,456
Get out!

421
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,371
Get out!

422
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,019
Get—

423
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:28,586
I ain’t going!

424
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,120
So you come on out here if you dare!

425
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:31,925
I ain’t scared of no ghosts.

426
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:34,922
Try me if you’re the real deal!

427
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:35,928
Get out!

428
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:36,906
Get out!

429
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,114
Get out!

430
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:41,460
Get out!

431
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,641
You want to try us?

432
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:47,315
Dead or otherwise, I’m going to drag your bum to court!

433
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:50,549
Get out! Get out!

434
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:52,899
I ain’t going nowhere.

435
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:54,222
You get out!

436
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:55,208
Get out!

437
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,232
Get out!

438
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:57,245
Get out!

439
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:58,042
Get out!

440
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:58,961
Get out!

441
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:01,180
Get out!

442
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,005
Hey, how did you get in here?

443
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,231
Let go!

444
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,717
Let go!

445
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:19,410
Let go of me!

446
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:27,512
It’s just like you said, Peach.

447
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:34,536
We know it’s you who does all the haunting here, Mr. Magician.

448
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:39,069
The hell are you on about, nerd?

449
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,400
Let go of me!

450
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:41,645
Let go!

451
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,170
I said let go!

452
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:45,968
Let go!

453
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:54,708
Mr. Chobkol,

454
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:58,057
you lived here two years ago,

455
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:00,259
before disappearing without a trace.

456
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:04,306
But you’ve actually been hiding inside the house ever since, haven’t you?

457
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,650
You’re trespassing.

458
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:10,305
Why are you doing this?

459
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,638
None of your business.

460
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:12,918
Alright, jerk.

461
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,494
I’m trying to be nice here.

462
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,780
Let go!

463
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,380
Let go of me!

464
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:27,720
Let go!

465
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,297
Fine.

466
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,610
If you won’t talk to us, we’ll just call the cops on you.

467
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,813
You are never stepping foot inside this house ever again!

468
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:34,779
Hey, calm down.

469
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,042
I have something I want to ask him about first.

470
00:23:37,063 --> 00:23:38,625
Peach, there’s no point talking to a guy like him!

471
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:39,927
Did you not see the kind of thing he did around here?

472
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:40,951
I hear you.

473
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:43,007
I only have one question.

474
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:45,491
Let go!

475
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,717
Mr. Chobkol.

476
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,275
Did you do all this

477
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,222
for your dead daughter?

478
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:16,669
Here comes the performance

479
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:21,063
of Cherry’s greatest magician in the world:

480
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:25,508
Chobkol, the Magician!

481
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:34,400
What spectacle do I have for you today, you wonder…

482
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:39,084
It’s turning this egg into a bowl of fried egg on rice!

483
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,207
Your food is here, milady.

484
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:48,536
Can you get up?

485
00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:52,120
Oh?

486
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:53,708
You forgot the sauce, Dad.

487
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,514
How could I forget that?

488
00:25:12,068 --> 00:25:12,961
Let’s eat.

489
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:16,820
Here.

490
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:18,527
Say “ah.”

491
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:27,269
Dad, I want to see that performance.

492
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:28,619
Can you do it for me?

493
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,979
That’s quite a difficult performance.

494
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:38,567
I’d love to perform it for you,

495
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,109
but unfortunately I no longer have my assistant.

496
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,176
It’s okay.

497
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:48,791
I love watching all your performances.

498
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:58,605
I think you’re going to become the world’s greatest magician.

499
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:01,108
You do?

500
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,112
Yes.

501
00:26:02,282 --> 00:26:03,579
The greatest, huh?

502
00:26:04,407 --> 00:26:05,005
Of course.

503
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:09,500
(It was nice of my daughter to say that.)

504
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,269
(But you all know…)

505
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,579
(In this economy,)

506
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,914
(it is nearly impossible for someone in my profession to find work.)

507
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,130
CHOBKOL THE MAGICIAN

508
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,320
I know I was a failure of a father.

509
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,777
But I did everything I could in my power at the time.

510
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:50,677
And I didn’t think…

511
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:54,967
that day would come.

512
00:27:09,974 --> 00:27:15,112
The greatest magician is back to perform the world’s most amazing performance.

513
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:20,254
Chobkol, the Magician!

514
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:25,533
What spectacle do I have for you today, you wonder…

515
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,401
It’s fried egg on rice!

516
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:51,909
Cherry, dear?

517
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,703
Cherry.

518
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:07,185
Cherry, talk to me.

519
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:09,866
(When I saw that,)

520
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,112
I knew she hasn’t gone away.

521
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:17,980
My daughter is still around.

522
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,469
This place is our home.

523
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:35,663
That’s why I came up with this ghost story.

524
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:39,841
It’s still trespassing and terrorizing.

525
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:41,207
What would you have me do?

526
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,512
I have nowhere else to go.

527
00:29:45,093 --> 00:29:46,306
My daughter is here.

528
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,616
She’s still here!

529
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:49,951
I understand you.

530
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:52,506
But it’s still wrong.

531
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:57,407
The haunted house act you put on,

532
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,213
if it had caused anybody physical harm,

533
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:02,202
it would have made you guilty of offenses of bodily harm.

534
00:30:02,226 --> 00:30:03,306
Well, did it?

535
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,099
I just scared them all away.

536
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:07,714
Did it?

537
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:09,205
It certainly did.

538
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:10,198
Look at my friend’s ankle.

539
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:12,198
Home, I’m fine—

540
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:13,398
You’re not fine, Peach.

541
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:14,305
Who knows?

542
00:30:14,336 --> 00:30:16,914
Maybe his ghost story has already hurt someone else like it hurt you.

543
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:18,468
Hey, Home.

544
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:22,614
He said he only wanted to scare them away.

545
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:25,176
He didn’t mean to hurt anyone.

546
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,730
I don’t care.

547
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,574
For me, what he did is wrong.

548
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:29,914
Peach.

549
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:33,654
Won’t you say something?

550
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:38,245
Pang.

551
00:30:39,841 --> 00:30:41,007
I agree with Home.

552
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:43,765
Wrong is wrong.

553
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,680
What’s wrong with you all?

554
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,905
You guys are not looking at this from his point of view at all!

555
00:30:53,377 --> 00:30:55,531
If it were me, I’d have done the same thing.

556
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,508
No, I’d have done even worse than this.

557
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:14,717
You don’t know how painful it is to feel helpless and worthless.

558
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:18,448
Pang.

559
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:22,868
I’m not saying I won’t do anything about this.

560
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:25,511
Calm down.

561
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,420
We still haven’t accomplished our mission.

562
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,302
Mr. Chobkol.

563
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:41,419
I need your help.

564
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:44,965
Yours, too, Pang.

565
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:24,124
Here comes the performance

566
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:28,220
of Cherry’s greatest magician in the world:

567
00:32:28,444 --> 00:32:31,179
Chobkol, the Magician!

568
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:35,075
He’s here with none other than his assistant,

569
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:40,216
Pangpang of the Vimarnsukman Team!

570
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:45,576
Is she going to be okay?

571
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:34,717
Honestly.

572
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:37,608
What’s the point?

573
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:42,122
I don’t even know if my daughter really is watching.

574
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:49,425
What is the point?

575
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:52,078
Who is it for?

576
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:55,041
What for?

577
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,103
I can’t give you an answer.

578
00:36:03,982 --> 00:36:05,503
But one thing I can confirm is that

579
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:08,908
your daughter really did get to watch the performance.

580
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:51,708
Dad.

581
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:53,608
Yes?

582
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:55,179
Watch my magic trick.

583
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:04,007
I can turn a fried egg into a star.

584
00:37:07,128 --> 00:37:08,502
You’re amazing.

585
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,022
You’re going to end up being my assistant when you’re older at this rate.

586
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,376
But you’re so good that you don’t need an assistant.

587
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,207
You’re already doing everything so well all by yourself.

588
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:22,217
Trust me.

589
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:29,980
I’ll let you borrow my magic trick.

590
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:38,814
I may not be with you for long but this magic will stay with you forever.

591
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,508
If you ask me who you’re doing this for,

592
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,702
I think it’s for you, Mr. Chobkol.

593
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,010
VIMARNSUKMAN GHOST-HUNTING COMPANY UN LIMITED

594
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:40,850
Peach.

595
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,204
I’m…

596
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:52,202
I’m sorry for being an idiot and getting you hurt.

597
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,909
For being silly and useless.

598
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:00,604
For always causing trouble for you.

599
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,182
What are you talking about?

600
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:10,518
Don’t you know how helpful you’ve been?

601
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,066
Look.

602
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,629
It was exactly because of your ghost radar

603
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,974
that showed me where Chobkol was inside that house.

604
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:25,312
You did great.

605
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,512
You may not be resourceful like Kan.

606
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,983
You may not be loaded like Home.

607
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:39,229
And you may not see ghosts like I do.

608
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:47,017
But you’re the best assistant our team could ask for, Pang.

609
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,777
I didn’t mean anything by all the scolding, you know?

610
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:01,309
Just couldn’t help it.

611
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:11,207
I really couldn’t ask for a nicer and kinder brother even if I tried!

612
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:15,102
Good, better, best… the bestest!

613
00:41:15,736 --> 00:41:17,819
You know “the bestest” isn’t a word, right?

614
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,530
That is so incorrect.

615
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:21,691
What?

616
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:22,774
You stink.

617
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:26,850
Stop it! You’re making me stinky, too!

618
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,706
I postponed the sale on that house like you’ve asked, Mr. Home.

619
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:37,703
The lease agreement on that house states that

620
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,706
Mr. Chobkol can continue to stay rent-free.

621
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:45,210
When do you want the lease to end, Mr. Home?

622
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:51,774
How about until Mr. Chobkol becomes a famous magician again?

623
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:56,259
That wouldn’t be in your best interest.

624
00:41:57,262 --> 00:41:57,908
What?

625
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,408
You don’t agree with me?

626
00:42:00,903 --> 00:42:01,567
No.

627
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:03,567
I agree with you this time.

628
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:13,604
Is it just me or are we getting along so much better now?

629
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,373
Allow me to skip the formality…

630
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,977
But you’re being annoying.

631
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:19,819
I was just joking.

632
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:24,222
I mean it, though.

633
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:26,020
It’s not just us,

634
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:29,817
but we seem to be working well with the rest of the team as well.

635
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:32,514
I really like the vibes right now.

636
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:35,675
I… have no objection to that.

637
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,968
It’s like we get each other’s drift and actually get along.

638
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,410
There’s really nothing to worry about,

639
00:42:43,056 --> 00:42:44,973
except…

640
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:46,973
What still concerns you, Mr. Home?

641
00:42:48,814 --> 00:42:50,768
Oh, no. It’s nothing.

642
00:42:51,573 --> 00:42:52,774
If that is all you need me for,

643
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:55,312
allow me to get back to my work.

644
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,930
VIMARNSUKMAN REVENUE ACCOUNTS

645
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:50,714
Suradech.

646
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:54,317
The ghost was hardly scary this time,

647
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:55,814
how come Peach’s hands were still shaky?

648
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:01,413
What did he see that scared him so bad?

649
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:42,362
(I hope this is enough money for you, Inspector Poochong.)

650
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,004
(Mr. Somkid, this is a murder case.)

651
00:44:51,115 --> 00:44:54,714
(And that’s exactly why I am asking for a favor, sir.)

652
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:58,780
(What happened at that restaurant)

653
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:04,511
(must be buried six feet deep.)

654
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,054
The old owner of this restaurant was Chef Hong.

655
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:23,209
After a scandal, Chef Hong committed suicide.
FAMOUS RESTAURANT SHUT DOWN

656
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,820
After a scandal, Chef Hong committed suicide.

657
00:45:25,137 --> 00:45:29,205
I need the file on that case you covered up for Mr. Somkid.

658
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,029
You might want to be careful if you want to be my enemy.

659
00:45:33,103 --> 00:45:34,780
If I can’t sell it as a restaurant,

660
00:45:34,977 --> 00:45:36,413
I’ll just sell it as something else.

661
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,103
Alright. Let’s go discuss this with Peach and Pangpang.

662
00:45:39,131 --> 00:45:39,644
I refuse.

663
00:45:39,663 --> 00:45:40,216
What?

664
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:41,545
Find someone else.

665
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:42,770
I just can’t do this.

666
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,807
You have no choice.

667
00:45:44,105 --> 00:45:47,512
Did you forget you signed a contract to exorcise ghosts from my properties?
