1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,333
I got all the ingredients here.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,542
Making a simple stir fried vegetable dish shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,450
I really can’t do this!

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,080
Don’t you see how much I’m trembling?

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,210
How’d you know you killed her?

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,450
Maybe Chef Hong didn’t kill herself.

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,950
I can’t help but wonder what my life would be like

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,250
if I didn’t get hit by that car three years ago.

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,630
Did you ever find out who the driver was?

10
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:21,609
No.

11
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,686
It was a hit-and-run.

12
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,426
Here they are, guys.

13
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:45,426
Alright. Grab yours.

14
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,606
Cheers!

15
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,576
Why did you kill me?

16
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,356
What’s wrong, Home?

17
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,906
I had a nightmare.

18
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:08,986
Go back to sleep.

19
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,896
I’m here. Don’t be afraid.

20
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:12,916
- Come on. - Okay.

21
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,026
Peach.

22
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:26,836
How the hell did you get in my bed?

23
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,596
Yeah, good question.

24
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:35,296
Wait.

25
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:37,346
I remember now.

26
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:41,876
I came to see you, Home.

27
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:47,796
You killed me.

28
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,996
You killed me.

29
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,026
You killed me!

30
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:51,716
You killed me. You killed me.

31
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,656
You killed me.

32
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:53,696
You killed me.

33
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,046
…Crap.

34
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:25,316
Guys.

35
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,446
It’s all thanks to you that

36
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:31,486
half of the Vimarnsukman properties

37
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:33,836
that were once infested with ghosts

38
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:35,806
are now sold.

39
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:45,286
There are only a few places left.

40
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:50,546
Mainly Avenue Khlong Sai Daeng that Ms. Somphorn is taking care of,

41
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:53,936
and the grand mansion Mr. Home hasn’t decided whether to sell or not.

42
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:56,476
See?

43
00:03:56,496 --> 00:04:00,126
It’s because everyone on the internet believes you can really exorcise ghosts, Peach.

44
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,016
It’s giving fabulous.

45
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:02,696
It’s giving dream team.

46
00:04:03,806 --> 00:04:06,726
Home, congrats.

47
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:10,246
Soon enough we won’t owe each other anything anymore.

48
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:17,526
What’s wrong?

49
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,126
Hey.

50
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:25,566
You okay?

51
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,596
Home, are you alright?

52
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,486
You look like you just saw a ghost.

53
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:31,796
Are you feeling unwell?

54
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:35,216
Maybe Mr. Home is getting haunted by all these ghost stories

55
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:37,546
that the stress starts giving him some kind of hallucination.

56
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,776
How about we call it a day for now?

57
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,736
I suggest we hold off on ghost-hunting this week.

58
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:46,026
I’ll call Mr. Suradech to come pick up Mr. Home.

59
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,846
You sure you’re okay?

60
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,976
It’s too sweet.

61
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,246
Did you ask for extra sugar?

62
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:22,356
Sugar helps reduce stress.

63
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:26,856
I don’t need to ask if you’re okay, do I, Mr. Home?

64
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:29,486
Hey, I’m super.

65
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,056
It’s just like you said, Kan.

66
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:34,336
Too many ghost stories just kinda mess up my mind.

67
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,576
If you need some advice,

68
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,326
or just need to talk,

69
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:42,916
you’re free to let me know.

70
00:05:53,836 --> 00:05:54,866
Kan.

71
00:05:57,506 --> 00:05:59,506
Have you ever made a mistake?

72
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:03,046
The kind of mistake that’s…

73
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:03,796
Deadly?

74
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:04,866
Severe.

75
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,556
It happened long ago.

76
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,446
But now that the truth has come to light,

77
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:15,506
it’s back to haunt me again.

78
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:21,036
Did you just find out this truth?

79
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,476
If it is weighing on your mind,

80
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,566
why not confess to whomever this concerns?

81
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:34,716
In court, most convicts who confess end up with a reduced sentence.

82
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:36,616
By half, in the worst cases.

83
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,726
But I don’t want any sentences at all!

84
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,296
Is there no way I’ll be 100% forgiven?

85
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,296
But you must take the consequences of your actions.

86
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:48,796
Did you think the other party went through any less pain than you did, Mr. Home?

87
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:55,186
If it were me, I’d confess as soon as possible.

88
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:58,916
It is better than concealing the truth until it reveals itself.

89
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,866
What if…

90
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,146
I’m not ready to confess?

91
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,236
Come on, Mr. Home!

92
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,756
Just confess before things get worse.

93
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,516
The sooner the better.

94
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:13,136
That is my fair warning.

95
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:47,656
THE FOUR-EYED EXORCIST

96
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:58,346
Hey.

97
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:00,796
Peach.

98
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,356
Can I ask you something?

99
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:04,386
Yeah?

100
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:09,346
Let’s say someone did you wrong,

101
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,336
and then apologized one day…

102
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,186
Would you forgive them?

103
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:19,176
Well, it depends on what they did.

104
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:23,526
Like, do I hate them or can’t even stand looking at them?

105
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,626
Well…

106
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,386
Kind of, I guess.

107
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:30,936
Then…

108
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,756
No, I won’t forgive them.

109
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,906
I’ll even make their life miserable.

110
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,196
What?

111
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,166
Why you gotta be so mean, man?

112
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:40,336
I’m not saying I’ll hurt them or anything.

113
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,416
I’ll just ignore the hell out of them

114
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:45,136
and just focus on achieving my own dreams.

115
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,926
That’s the best revenge there is.

116
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,026
Hold on. Hold on.

117
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,416
What do you mean?

118
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:50,666
I don’t get it.

119
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:55,006
Well, it’s basically rubbing in their face that I’m living my dream

120
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:56,476
so I don’t care about you, kind of thing.

121
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:57,446
Something like that.

122
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:58,556
You get it?

123
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,756
I see.

124
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:04,666
What is your dream, though?

125
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:09,706
It’s cooking.

126
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:13,976
I want to make a full-course meal that

127
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:15,876
tells my life story.

128
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:17,056
What?

129
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:18,936
That’s it?

130
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,676
That’s not it.

131
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:27,196
We gotta cook at a palace and invite all the high-brows to dine with us.

132
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:29,596
This will be broadcast live on national television, no less.

133
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:31,406
It’s gotta be exceptional.

134
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:32,016
Sure.

135
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,126
You agree?

136
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:34,216
Sure, whatever.

137
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,316
That’s your dream now. It’s not mine.

138
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,126
Stop it.

139
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,596
Since when are you sarcastic?

140
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:41,636
Hey.

141
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:44,926
Kan said I’m taking the week off, but I changed my mind.

142
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:47,646
I’ll have Suradech pick you guys up first thing tomorrow morning.

143
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,396
What? Why?

144
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,596
I was thinking we’d get to relax a little bit.

145
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:51,356
Yeah.

146
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:53,096
It’s not nice to go back on your words, you know?

147
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:54,536
You don’t have to come, Pangpang.

148
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:55,906
What? No way!

149
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:56,846
That’s worse!

150
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,136
I’m coming.

151
00:09:58,156 --> 00:09:59,016
Take me with you.

152
00:09:59,036 --> 00:09:59,846
I’m coming with you.

153
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,806
Take me with you.

154
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:07,886
What the hell’s going on?

155
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:08,836
Where are you taking me?

156
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:09,666
Hang in there.

157
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:11,106
You’ll find out soon enough.

158
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:11,926
Ready?

159
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:12,546
Yeah.

160
00:10:12,576 --> 00:10:15,736
One, two, three.

161
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:18,726
Ta-da!

162
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,126
Don’t tell me…

163
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,896
We’re exorcising a ghost in a palace now?

164
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,546
Oh, my gosh.

165
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,196
Are we… exorcising a royal ghost?

166
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:41,246
I’m actually making your dream come true.

167
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:42,736
What?

168
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:46,036
Don’t be ridiculous.

169
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:47,416
Are you being serious?

170
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:48,836
This ain’t no joke, man.

171
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,836
You’re cooking at a palace, Peach!

172
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:54,646
Oh, Home, you sugar daddy, you.

173
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,216
I’m not done granting wishes.

174
00:10:56,236 --> 00:10:58,056
Look at this.

175
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,726
Are we going to be on TV?

176
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,426
Who’s the host?

177
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,576
Are they famous?

178
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,486
Can I get a photo with them?

179
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,956
Of course.

180
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:15,606
So it’s gonna be a selfie, then.

181
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,066
You love it.

182
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:18,956
I can tell.

183
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:21,706
Clearly I do, mama.

184
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,216
FAKE CHEF

185
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:25,436
Wait.

186
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:27,566
I did not sign up for this.

187
00:11:27,976 --> 00:11:32,146
Can I love you? How many scores do I get?

188
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,386
What should I do to be with you?

189
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:37,106
If you refuse to do this,

190
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:40,766
I guess it’s time the world gets to know…

191
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:44,966
Vimarnsukman’s best Lawyer-Singer.

192
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:48,916
Mama, you’ve got good taste in music.

193
00:11:55,026 --> 00:12:01,656
Welcome to Master Coming-Back Chef Thailand!

194
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:08,376
PANGPANG, HOST We get a chance to watch this challenger chef take back his pride.

195
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:10,756
Peach.

196
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:11,616
Peach.

197
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:13,666
Hello.

198
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:15,196
I’m Peach.

199
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:17,216
Chef Peach. PEACH, CHALLENGER

200
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:20,366
Oh, come on!

201
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,586
Can you make it more dramatic?

202
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,926
Give me that energy.

203
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:25,406
Fit the mood, will you?

204
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,116
Take this seriously!

205
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:28,746
Are you slacking off?

206
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,316
KAN, FAKE CHEF

207
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:36,196
Can you please cooperate so we can get this over with?

208
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:41,046
You only have one day

209
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,586
to achieve your dream.

210
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,066
Take this seriously.

211
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:46,916
This feels so much like the real deal.

212
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:48,606
I wish I had Chef Hong with me now.

213
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:52,136
The Fake Chef Hong is here! HOME, FAKE CHEF HONG

214
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,206
Fine.

215
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,656
Since you guys seem to be really invested in this,

216
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:01,156
I’ll do my best, too.

217
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:03,476
And now…

218
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:06,456
Please give a round of applause to the owner of this palace

219
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:09,556
who will also be our judge for today:

220
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:12,376
Mr. Chai-Un!

221
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:19,106
CHAI-UN, JUDGE

222
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,156
Chai-Un, thank you for meeting up with me and my team, sir.

223
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:40,416
Our families have been friends since Mr. Samai was alive.

224
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,756
Of course I’m okay with helping you with this little thing.

225
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:43,846
No problem.

226
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,296
Well, if that’s all you need me for…

227
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:45,956
Bye.

228
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,446
Wait, sir.

229
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:56,166
My team and I are grateful that you have granted our request to film here.

230
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:57,416
What request?

231
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,926
As thanks for that,

232
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:04,096
we’d like you to take the honor of being the judge for this event.

233
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:10,816
My brother is a new man now, sir.

234
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:15,336
I assure you he’s not unaliving you with his food this time around.

235
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,136
What did she say?

236
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,356
What language is that, dearie?

237
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,526
Peach, introduce yourself.

238
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,646
I—

239
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:49,676
We’re back with the mission to achieve the challenger chef’s dream.

240
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:53,706
Let’s see what his first dish is.

241
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:13,316
Hello.

242
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:18,776
Allow me to officially introduce myself through this soup.

243
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:21,436
PEACH SOUP, CHEF PEACH

244
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,016
I really must eat this?

245
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:24,846
Can’t we just fake it with the camera angles?

246
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,116
You really must eat it, sir.

247
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:28,176
There’s no way around it.

248
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:29,726
The camera’s right in front of you.

249
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:00,236
Oh, my God.

250
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:05,306
My name is present in the soup.

251
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,526
Now that you have tried it, what did you taste, sir?

252
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,436
Fish sauce?

253
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:14,966
Is that your name?

254
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:16,756
There’s no fish sauce in it.

255
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,356
I knew that.

256
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:20,326
Who would name their child “fish sauce”?

257
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,556
Weird.

258
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:25,796
I feel citrus.

259
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,156
What’s the smell?

260
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:29,136
Fruity.

261
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,236
Peach?

262
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,146
Is your name Peach?

263
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:32,996
Yes.

264
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,046
That’s my name.

265
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,196
Peach!

266
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:40,336
Well, the first dish had us all on the edge of our seats.

267
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:42,856
Let’s move on to the next.

268
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,136
They really gotta test me if I’m still scared, do they?

269
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:01,356
Home.

270
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,236
Can you toast this for me? Should be easy enough for you.

271
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,056
Sure.

272
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,736
Keep tossing and don’t stop.

273
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:07,566
Yep.

274
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,026
Mr. Peach.

275
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:12,876
Yes?

276
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:15,116
What inspires this dish?

277
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:19,426
This dish is inspired by when I was hit by a car.

278
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,576
Were you in a severe condition after the hit?

279
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:26,136
Well, let’s say this is how smashed I felt.

280
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,756
Are you sure your brother really is okay?

281
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,696
I’ll be honest with you. I don’t trust him.

282
00:17:41,716 --> 00:17:43,506
My brother is all good, honest!

283
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:46,896
That scream just now sounds a lot like Home’s, though.

284
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:51,656
What’s wrong, Mr. Home?

285
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:55,196
No–nothing.

286
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:56,306
I’m alright.

287
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,236
You seem strangely agitated.

288
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,666
Did you graze your finger on the stove?

289
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:01,806
Can you do it?

290
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:07,946
Well, it’s time to hurry up and finish it.

291
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,516
You’re running out of time.

292
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:10,336
Hurry.

293
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,206
Yes.

294
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:28,136
This dish is called Smashed Shrimp Pad Thai on Death’s Door.

295
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:28,796
SMASHED SHRIMP PAD THAI ON DEATH’S DOOR, CHEF PEACH

296
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:33,436
It’s a reimagined version of the famous Pad Thai into an appetizer.

297
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,626
Interesting.

298
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,266
My dream was to become a chef,

299
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:43,676
but a terrible accident had prevented it.

300
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:47,136
I didn't look much better than the shrimp in your dish right now.

301
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:51,466
Oh, you poor thing.

302
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:52,916
That’s a terrible story.

303
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:55,156
I never knew that.

304
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:59,566
By the way, Chef Peach, what’s with all this?

305
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:00,396
A lot.

306
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:04,076
I thought I’d make enough for your family, sir.

307
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,326
So funny.

308
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:33,706
It’s so good.

309
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:37,336
But there’s no need to make so much next time.

310
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,006
It’s just me here.

311
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:40,306
So good.

312
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,356
What three words would you use to describe this dish?

313
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:46,586
Fun.

314
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,096
Delicious.

315
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:49,566
And…

316
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,026
Soft Power.

317
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,326
I can’t wait to taste the next dish.

318
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:56,866
I’m so excited.

319
00:19:56,886 --> 00:19:58,916
Oh, excited?

320
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,626
What is this dish called, Chef Peach?

321
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,466
This is the main dish.

322
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:13,016
I have to be very careful because it has peas in it.

323
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,696
Peas is one of the ingredients.

324
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:21,956
But didn’t Chai-Un get hospitalized because of his legume allergy last time?

325
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,456
It’s not actually peas.

326
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:27,366
This is a plant-based protein that looks and tastes just like peas.
PLANT-BASED PROTEIN, MAIN INGREDIENT

327
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,896
Home, will you grab a bowl for me?

328
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,936
Sure.

329
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,196
This is the moment-of-truth dish

330
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:36,136
that surely puts our challenger under a lot of pressure.

331
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:40,046
Where’s the peas I asked you to toast?

332
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,146
It’s here.

333
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:45,536
Wait.

334
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:47,246
Why are there two bowls of them?

335
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,446
One of them is mine.

336
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:54,076
I’m about to take a shot of it to compare the real one to the plant-based one.

337
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:56,926
CHICKPEAS, IN COMPARISON TO THE MAIN INGREDIENT

338
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:01,386
But they look exactly the same once they’re toasted.

339
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,956
Which bowl is plant-based?

340
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:12,766
It seems our challenger has come face to face with a colossal obstacle.

341
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:14,286
Which bowl carries real peas?

342
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,166
And which carries plant-based peas?

343
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:19,836
Find out after a short commercial break!

344
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,966
This programme is brought to you by

345
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:29,026
the Vimarnsukman Ghost-Hunting Company Un Limited.

346
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:32,046
We guarantee a ghost-free satisfaction.

347
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:36,136
Which bowl carries real peas?

348
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:38,236
And which carries plant-based peas?

349
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:39,996
Suradech.

350
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:42,826
You’re not supposed to mess around when someone’s in the kitchen.

351
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,836
Oh, my God.

352
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:46,716
What are you going to do now, Peach?

353
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:49,966
He takes a while to cook this dish, doesn’t he, Kan?

354
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:51,486
My stomach is digesting itself.

355
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,086
The priority is my stomach.

356
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,926
I will give him a nudge, sir.

357
00:21:58,356 --> 00:21:59,936
(Are we almost done?)

358
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:02,496
(Buy us some time, mama.)

359
00:22:02,516 --> 00:22:04,496
(Use whatever is available in my bag.)

360
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:12,926
Are you hungry?

361
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,536
Mr. Chai-Un, do you like to sing?

362
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,536
No, I don’t.

363
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:37,396
I don’t mind listening to music, though.

364
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:40,296
If you’re going to sing, I’ll be your audience.

365
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,926
Let me try it.

366
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:59,026
They taste exactly the same.

367
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:00,506
Think again.

368
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:01,946
Which one were you toasting?

369
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,216
How would I know that?

370
00:23:04,246 --> 00:23:06,166
You toasted it so you gotta know.

371
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:07,316
Hurry up.

372
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:17,696
I’m missing you, my love.

373
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:20,226
- Never knew I’d be missing you—
- P–Please.

374
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:23,566
For the sake of everyone watching at home,

375
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:25,566
and for my sake.

376
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:26,536
Stop.

377
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,566
The manual states that

378
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:31,506
the mic sounds disconsolate

379
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:33,586
because this is the only frequency in which ghosts understand.

380
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:35,246
Really?

381
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:37,826
Can it get across to ghosts?

382
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:38,526
Yes.

383
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:39,736
Can I try?

384
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:41,136
Ghosts, you sure?

385
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:42,116
Yes.

386
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,166
Check, check.

387
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,016
Niw, you lowlife little sister.

388
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:56,516
I know you stole my makeup and trash-talked me and Mother to the press

389
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,096
You wretch!

390
00:23:58,116 --> 00:24:00,626
You’re the reason why my life is miserable, you snake.

391
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:02,376
You idiot!

392
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:10,146
For someone dead, you guys sure are lively!

393
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,686
Home, pick.

394
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:13,926
Hurry up.

395
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:16,486
Peach, I think…

396
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,116
And you, Grandfather.

397
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:20,226
You were old and slow as hell.

398
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,906
Old man, you fool.

399
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:24,356
Like a snail.

400
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:25,596
I hate waiting.

401
00:24:25,616 --> 00:24:27,016
What’s the point of waiting?

402
00:24:27,036 --> 00:24:28,016
What?

403
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:28,896
Home, hurry up.

404
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,156
Don’t you hear he doesn’t like to wait?

405
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:32,606
Peach, I think you shouldn’t serve this dish.

406
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:34,636
How could I not? It’s my main dish.

407
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,476
Mother, I have something to confess.

408
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,536
I told you I had a wife.

409
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,246
I really was telling the truth.

410
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:43,666
My wife just happened to be a man.

411
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:45,806
I’m sorry.

412
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:48,626
Peach, I…

413
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:51,546
I have something to confess.

414
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:52,536
Yeah?

415
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:55,626
Actually, I—

416
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:57,556
Peach.

417
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,936
We have to serve the main dish now.

418
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,146
I’m being serious.

419
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:02,156
Keep that for later.

420
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:05,436
You just need to tell me which bowl is the peas you toasted.

421
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,226
I think it’s this one.

422
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:12,636
I can see the peas I burned.

423
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:27,196
This is today’s main dish.

424
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:30,536
It’s called Scaredy Lamb Steak.

425
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:33,176
SCAREDY LAMB STEAK

426
00:25:33,436 --> 00:25:36,106
It is paired with pea salad.

427
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:38,166
Oh, my God.

428
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:40,916
I am allergic to peas.

429
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:42,826
I am well aware, sir.

430
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:45,426
That’s exactly why this dish scares me.

431
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:49,316
This once ended my career and my dream.

432
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:54,636
But this time,

433
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,496
I added a lot of trust into this dish.

434
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,446
A trust in myself.

435
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,066
And a trust in my friend.

436
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:11,286
If you refuse to try it, I’ll understand.

437
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:17,146
It also took me a long time to get myself back.

438
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:21,736
I actually love peas.

439
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,996
I know I’m allergic, but I just love peas.

440
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:29,236
It’s been years since I’ve had some.

441
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:33,686
I believe the same mistake won’t happen again.

442
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:38,126
I want you to get over your fear with me, sir.

443
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:55,016
Is this real pea—

444
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:58,486
Peach.

445
00:26:58,506 --> 00:26:59,496
Peach.

446
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,326
Peach.

447
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:02,266
Peach.

448
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:05,096
Mr. Suradech, get the car. We’re going to the hospital.

449
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:07,726
Peach.

450
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:08,966
I’m sorry.

451
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:10,076
No.

452
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,026
Wait.

453
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:23,646
It tastes exactly like real peas!

454
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:27,576
I can’t tell at all.

455
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,756
I have no idea!

456
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:39,136
What is your verdict on this dish, Judge?

457
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:40,806
It’s delicious.

458
00:27:41,216 --> 00:27:43,056
It makes me feel so elated

459
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:45,586
to have overcome my own fear.

460
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,126
It’s never as scary as it seems, is it?

461
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,416
It’s not that bad.

462
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:05,836
This is the last dish on this course.

463
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,026
Nothing to present here, Chef?

464
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:14,036
I’ve said everything in my food, sir.

465
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:19,296
FORGIVE ME NOT
FORGIVE ME NOT, CHEF PEACH

466
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:24,986
I want you to decide how you want this full-course meal to end.

467
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:47,726
FORGIVEN

468
00:28:54,626 --> 00:29:00,126
Our Chef Peach has finally and officially taken back his pride and dream!

469
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:02,476
Congratulations!

470
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:13,236
You go, Peach!

471
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,736
How was it, Mr. Chai-Un?
I’M A FAN OF THIS CHAI-UN GUY.
NOT OVER THAT PEACH-HOME HUG SOON.
		BRO, MY MOUTH WATERING.

472
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,046
How was your second time dining with Chef Peach?
GETTING HUNGRY.
I WANT TO TRY THE FOOD, TOO.

473
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:22,676
I nearly died.

474
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:25,776
I meant, it was so good I thought I’d been to heaven.
HE’S SO OVER THE TOP.
HAHAHA, HE’S FUNNY.

475
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:27,386
It’s a shame…

476
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:32,546
That the dead will never get to experience it.
SHADE HAHAHAHA.
CAREFUL WITH YOUR WORDS.

477
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,506
You’re amazing, huh?

478
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:44,016
What?

479
00:29:44,536 --> 00:29:45,296
That’s so unprompted.

480
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,336
What do you want?

481
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,716
I don’t want anything.

482
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:50,936
I meant it sincerely.

483
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,846
How’d you come up with the idea to cook for him

484
00:29:55,096 --> 00:29:57,126
to ask for his forgiveness?

485
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:58,896
Because I’m amazing.

486
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,026
That’s it. Period.

487
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:02,126
Oh, dear.

488
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,426
Not humble anymore, are you?

489
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:10,456
Thank you, though,

490
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,316
for making my dream come true.

491
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:25,046
Speaking of which, what is your dream?

492
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:34,936
It’s having a huge house in the States and, like, 10 wives.

493
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:37,246
Come on.

494
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:38,616
Be serious.

495
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:52,636
I just want a normal family like any normal person.

496
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:57,916
Oh, pulling a sad homeboy stunt today, I see?

497
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:07,826
Home.

498
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:13,766
Pang and I are your family.

499
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:21,746
If your definition of family doesn’t involve 10 wives, that is.

500
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:26,006
Oh, right.

501
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:29,546
You said you had something to confess. What is it?

502
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:35,136
FORGIVEN

503
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:40,916
Peach.

504
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,226
Will you wait for me?

505
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:48,356
I just have to talk to my family about this first.

506
00:31:49,966 --> 00:31:51,316
What is this about?

507
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:54,286
It sounds like something super serious.

508
00:31:54,306 --> 00:31:56,726
I’ll tell you as soon as I talk to them.

509
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:01,456
Okay.

510
00:32:01,476 --> 00:32:02,576
I’ll wait, then.

511
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:38,486
Hey, hey there.

512
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,886
What’s my dear nephew doing?

513
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:41,866
I’m learning how to make pancakes.

514
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,296
You wanna try some, Uncle Kid?

515
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:49,476
I’ll have to pass on that.

516
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,046
I’m watching my carbs intake.

517
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:52,516
I’m more worried about you.

518
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,216
You don’t look like you’re doing well.

519
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:54,886
Let me help.

520
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:56,006
No, it’s okay, Uncle Kid.

521
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:57,696
I want to do this myself.

522
00:32:58,146 --> 00:33:00,256
Alright, then.

523
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:42,926
REAL ESTATE HEIR HIT-AND-RUN KILLED CHEF

524
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:55,766
Pok, I’ve sent you the file.

525
00:34:23,216 --> 00:34:24,936
(Peach, you saw the news?)

526
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:26,506
(I think it’s your case.)

527
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,886
Going viral last night

528
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:38,466
was this video of a drunk driving case from three years ago.

529
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:40,876
Posted by an anonymous account,

530
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:42,626
the truth has come to light overnight.

531
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,026
Let’s take a look.

532
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:46,736
REAL ESTATE HEIR

533
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:48,736
DRUNK DRIVING

534
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:51,436
NEARLY KILLED YOUNG CHEF!

535
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,926
3 YEARS AGO

536
00:35:01,206 --> 00:35:02,926
Here they are, guys.

537
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:05,786
Alright, grab yours.

538
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:07,726
Cheers!

539
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:20,326
Again?

540
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:22,936
We’re at a club and you’re not drinking again?

541
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:27,826
Well, I don’t need alcohol to have fun when I have you, baby.

542
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:29,916
Hey!

543
00:35:30,446 --> 00:35:32,096
Hands off my girlfriend.

544
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:35,316
What?

545
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:36,746
You said you broke up with him.

546
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,436
Home, wait. Home.

547
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:48,836
Home, will you listen to me?

548
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,066
Home.

549
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:51,796
I can explain.

550
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:52,656
Home.

551
00:35:52,676 --> 00:35:54,816
Home, talk to me.

552
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,746
CHEF HONG: YOU’RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE DISH FOR CHI-UN TOMORROW.

553
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:08,736
DO YOUR BEST, OR ELSE.

554
00:36:08,926 --> 00:36:16,766
OF COURSE. I WILL DO MY VERY BEST. SEE YOU.

555
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:26,576
Damn it.

556
00:36:26,586 --> 00:36:28,036
What a bummer.

557
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:24,226
Hello there, my dear nephew.

558
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:25,726
Uncle. Uncle.

559
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,196
What should I do?

560
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:28,546
Uncle, what should I do?

561
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:30,236
Home, what’s wrong? What’s happened?

562
00:37:30,266 --> 00:37:32,826
I–I just hit someone with my car.

563
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:34,616
I hit someone with my car.

564
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,106
Home, calm down. It’s going to be okay.

565
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,616
It’s not going to be okay!

566
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:41,566
He must be dead!

567
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:43,346
Listen to me.

568
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:45,136
Is there anyone around?

569
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:49,966
N–No.

570
00:37:49,986 --> 00:37:52,016
Let me check on him.

571
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,136
Don’t you move.

572
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:56,836
Send me your location and get out of there.

573
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:02,506
Aren’t–Aren’t we going to help him?

574
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:04,026
I’ll do it.

575
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:05,526
You leave that place immediately.

576
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:08,116
I’ll call the ambulance and the cops.

577
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:09,766
Just get out of there, Home.

578
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,526
What’s wrong?

579
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:35,016
You look super serious right now.

580
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:47,806
FORGIVE ME NOT

581
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:13,126
He knew all along and never thought to tell me?

582
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:16,036
Peach, calm down.

583
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:18,286
Let’s hear what Home has to say first.

584
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:19,626
“Calm down,” Pang?

585
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:22,246
Was any of what he did for us even real?

586
00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:03,726
Uncle Kid.

587
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:04,936
What’s up?

588
00:40:04,966 --> 00:40:07,146
Home, have you seen the news?

589
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,126
What news?

590
00:40:14,226 --> 00:40:16,756
REAL ESTATE HEIR HIT-AND-RUN KILLED CHEF
I don’t know how the video got out.

591
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:19,626
But it went viral online last night.

592
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:21,096
I think everyone knows about this now.

593
00:40:22,936 --> 00:40:24,516
Suradech, hit the gas.

594
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:25,616
Where are you going?

595
00:40:25,786 --> 00:40:26,936
I have to talk to Peach.

596
00:40:26,956 --> 00:40:28,636
No. I got that covered.

597
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:32,056
Listen to me, Home.

598
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:34,446
This isn’t just about you and your friends anymore.

599
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:37,156
This is about Vimarnsukman now.

600
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:42,246
I already sent Attorney Yai to take care of this whole thing.

601
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:46,436
Uncle Kid, how could you do that?

602
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:48,156
You should have talked to me about it first.

603
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:50,516
This is the only way out, Home.

604
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:52,926
Suradech, we’re leaving.

605
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:54,616
Don’t you dare move, Suradech.

606
00:40:56,946 --> 00:40:57,826
Home.

607
00:40:58,936 --> 00:40:59,836
Home.

608
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:00,886
Home, wait.

609
00:41:00,906 --> 00:41:02,036
Home, don’t go!

610
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:08,426
Home!

611
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:09,926
Home, wait!

612
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:10,916
Home!

613
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:12,326
Home!

614
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,726
What’s going on, Mr. Yai?

615
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:49,316
Where have they gone?

616
00:41:50,236 --> 00:41:52,916
I have negotiated with the plaintiff,

617
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:54,956
and they have been evicted.

618
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:56,116
There’s nothing to worry, Mr. Home.

619
00:42:06,636 --> 00:42:07,746
Mr. Yai.

620
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:09,726
What did you say to them?

621
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:13,316
I’ve come here on behalf of Mr. Home.

622
00:42:13,456 --> 00:42:17,746
This contract contains one important condition.

623
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:23,016
You two must not report, pursue litigation, speak about,

624
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:30,186
or even post about Mr. Home or the Vimarmsukman family.

625
00:42:34,806 --> 00:42:36,596
This is your offer.

626
00:42:57,426 --> 00:43:00,026
Can I add one more condition?

627
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:11,026
This money,

628
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:15,286
together with all the money I’ve received for my service,

629
00:43:15,836 --> 00:43:17,616
I’m returning it all of to you

630
00:43:18,146 --> 00:43:19,286
in exchange for…

631
00:43:34,426 --> 00:43:37,736
Never being in contact with anyone from the Vimarnsukman family again.

632
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:39,836
For good.

633
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:48,146
In all my career,

634
00:43:48,566 --> 00:43:52,346
I’ve never met a plaintiff who backed down without a fight before.

635
00:43:57,236 --> 00:44:00,106
This is the best solution for you, sir.

636
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,246
How would you know what is best for me?

637
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:15,406
How?

638
00:44:15,426 --> 00:44:16,516
How would you?

639
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:17,746
Let go of me!

640
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:19,766
Let go!

641
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:20,876
Let go of me!

642
00:44:20,896 --> 00:44:21,696
Let go!

643
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:24,856
How could you do that to my friends?

644
00:44:25,056 --> 00:44:26,516
Let me go!

645
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:28,016
How could you?

646
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,266
NOT FORGIVE

647
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:32,476
Let go of me!

648
00:44:56,806 --> 00:44:59,036
GO TO HELL.
Have you heard the kind of things people say about us?

649
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:00,126
You troublemaker!

650
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:01,656
If you want me to lay low,

651
00:45:01,676 --> 00:45:03,876
I’ll just sell the rest of my properties quietly.

652
00:45:03,896 --> 00:45:06,756
Are you the buyer, Dr. Phoom?

653
00:45:08,826 --> 00:45:11,126
If this is the house we’re hired to exorcise, then I refuse.

654
00:45:11,146 --> 00:45:12,266
I just can’t stand the owner.

655
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:13,896
I can exorcise ghosts just fine on my own.

656
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:17,936
It’s not like what you usually do will work this time around.

657
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:19,376
Don’t get so cocky.
