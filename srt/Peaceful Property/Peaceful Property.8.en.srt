1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,450
I have a bad feeling about this.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,590
This happened three years ago.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,090
How come it just came out now?

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,890
I think someone intentionally leaked it.

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,950
If he doesn’t pick up your call,

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,300
just show up at his place.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,510
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,600
Peach.

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,080
Who are you talking to?

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,260
Home, who else?

11
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,310
Hello. Is this Mr. Peach’s number?

12
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,290
Yes.

13
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,090
I’m a paramedic, and there’s something I need to tell you.

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,200
Car accident.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,490
Patient is in critical condition and unconscious.

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,170
Out of the way! Out of the way!

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,600
The patient is unconscious.

18
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,390
Get out of the way!

19
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,100
The patient’s heart temporarily stopped.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,130
We were able to get it back.

21
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,800
Luckily his other organs aren’t badly injured.

22
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,920
We have treated him accordingly and given him the medications he needs,

23
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,810
however, his body doesn’t respond very well at the moment.

24
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,230
His toxic report shows there's 70 milligram of alcohol in his blood.

25
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,920
I estimate that it could be the cause of the accident.

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,450
Doctor, there’s a cardiac arrest case.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,990
Excuse me.

28
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,700
You must be… Home’s friend, Peach.

29
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,290
Yes.

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,710
I heard you guys aren’t on speaking terms.

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,450
Home told me all about it.

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,570
He’s been really troubled about this fight with you.

33
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,670
He was actually on his way to apologize to you.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,290
Peach.

35
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,590
This isn’t your fault.

36
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,350
If someone is to blame, it’s the person who leaked that video clip.

37
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,730
You and Home wouldn’t have got into a fight for this to happen in the first place.

38
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,000
Right, Kan?

39
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,500
Yes.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,890
…all these reporters!

41
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,860
We’re going to make headlines yet again!

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,100
Home, that troublemaker.

43
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,900
He can’t just die quietly without causing us trouble, can he?

44
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,730
Home!

45
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,680
How would I live without you, my dear Home?

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,350
You’re gone far too soon, dear!

47
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,690
“Gone far too soon”?

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,130
He’s still alive.

49
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,290
Not for long, by the look of him.

50
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,800
What would we do with all the money you’ll leave behind, dear?

51
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,720
Phorn.

52
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,790
No inheritance talk right now.

53
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,450
- Come on here. - Home, my beloved nephew.

54
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,290
My heart is so heavy for him!

55
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,590
I can’t go on living like this.

56
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,610
She wouldn’t win any award with that performance!

57
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,180
What’s wrong, Kan?

58
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,890
It seems Mr. Home already made headlines.

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,940
GOOD RIDDANCE./SERVES HIM RIGHT.
KARMA IS SO REAL./#CANCELVIMARNSUKMAN

60
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,010
Oh, dear.

61
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,840
These people…

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,100
I feel bad for Home.

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,890
Peach, what should we do now?

64
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,680
Maybe…

65
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,140
His body isn’t responding well to the treatment

66
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,760
because his ghost isn’t in his body.

67
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,590
Come again?

68
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,630
Home.

69
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
Just say what you’re here to say!

70
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,740
If you’re going to just stand there dumbfounded, then go away!

71
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,660
Oh, you’re right.

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,820
He came all the way to our place just to see you.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
But…

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,040
But that means…

75
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,510
Home is dead?

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
No.

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,720
I can’t let him die with his name ruined like this.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,410
We need to put his ghost back where it belongs.

79
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,020
I think he might make it through with his soul back in his body.

80
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,730
And how would we even find his soul?

81
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,310
I don’t know.

82
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,210
But we need to find it.

83
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,580
We got this.

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Let’s go find his ghost.

85
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,290
Oh, my God.

86
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,630
I forgot about all these reporters.

87
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,490
Hey, that’s the victim from the last incident.

88
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,290
You must be Peach.

89
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,440
How are you feeling about this accident?

90
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,390
Do you agree that he deserves it for what he did to you?

91
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,170
Pang?

92
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,420
Pang, what’s wrong?

93
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Pang!

94
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,730
Pang!

95
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,880
Patient, please take a breath.

96
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,590
Oh, no.

97
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,590
I think travelling in a group would slow us down.

98
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,800
You should go on ahead, Kan.

99
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,510
Yes.

100
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,310
I’ll go to the garage to see if there’s anything worth finding.

101
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,360
Pang and I will go to his mansion.

102
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,580
Good luck, Kan.

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Thanks.

104
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,910
It’s all thanks to whoever dug up that old incident.

105
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,720
In the latest development of Saharat Vimarnsukman’s car accident,

106
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,220
Mr. Saharat is currently…

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,380
They’re a hero, for sure.

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,290
We might not know who they are,

109
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,910
but they did everyone a favor to unmask these rich jerks for their crimes.

110
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,490
That family has it coming, honestly.

111
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,230
I heard they were the ones that destroyed the Khlong Sai Daeng community.

112
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,710
So many people were affected back then.

113
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,630
Karma really comes around to claim their heads.

114
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,710
All the Vimarnsukmans are greedy bastards.

115
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,640
- Greedy! - Greedy!

116
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,490
SAY NO TO VIMARNSUKMAN - Greedy! - Greedy!

117
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,050
Do we want Vimarnsukman gone?

118
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,670
Yes!

119
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,430
We want them gone!

120
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,380
- Go away! - Go away!

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,410
- Go away! - Go away!

122
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,300
- Go away! - Go away!

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,610
- Go away! - Go away!

124
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,880
- Vimarnsukman, go away! - Vimarnsukman, go away!

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,130
Thank you.

126
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,430
- Greedy! - Greedy!

127
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,230
- Go away! - Go away!

128
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,810
Sorry.

129
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,380
I didn’t see you coming.

130
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,510
I can have it cleaned for you.

131
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,290
Cleaned?

132
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,570
Do you even know how expensive this jacket is?

133
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,080
No.

134
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,850
Neither do I.

135
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,960
Gramps bought it.

136
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,620
You’re not mad at me?

137
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,090
Why would I?

138
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,110
I should be the one asking that. I spilled your drink.

139
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,450
Uncle, can I get one more of this?

140
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,300
Thank you.

141
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,540
My apology for spilling your drink.

142
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,140
Please take it.

143
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,210
My grandpa is buying some land in this area

144
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,910
so I should start making new friends here.

145
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,100
Buy some land?

146
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,470
Yeah.

147
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,670
That’s my family.

148
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,870
Vimarnsukman.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Can I ask you something?

150
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,100
Why does your grandfather want the lands in this neighborhood?

151
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,980
We’re just a poor community.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,130
There’s nothing here.

153
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,560
I don’t really know, either.

154
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,620
But Gramps says this place is full of potential.

155
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,770
He says it’s gonna be a good place once it’s developed.

156
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,490
Gramps also promises he will make everyone’s quality of life better.

157
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,990
Home.

158
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,320
Let’s go home.

159
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,410
Yes, Gramps!

160
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,700
I have to go.

161
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Oops.

162
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,210
GO TO HELL, YOU TRASH.

163
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,980
It was much worse a while ago.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,380
Someone even trashed the place.

165
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,180
This is already better.

166
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,890
People can be so mean.

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,810
How’s the young master doing?

168
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,590
He’s not well at all.

169
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,150
Home is still unconscious.

170
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,580
The doctor said there’s alcohol in his bloodstream.

171
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,470
They said he was drunk-driving.

172
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,870
Drunk-driving?

173
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,490
That’s impossible.

174
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,210
What do you mean?

175
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,460
The young master didn’t even touch his drink before he left.

176
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,020
He couldn’t possibly be drunk-driving.

177
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,370
What?

178
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,810
6 HOURS PRIOR Have a drink.

179
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,000
Maybe that will loosen your lips a little bit.

180
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,690
I’d rather not.

181
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,570
You know I don’t drink, Uncle.

182
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,810
If you insist.

183
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,500
Well, do you have something on your mind you want to tell me?

184
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,690
You can talk to me about Peach, if you want.

185
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,910
I swear all the young master did was blaming himself for his flaws,

186
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,430
which nearly made him lose his best friend.

187
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,490
Then how come the doctor said there’s alcohol in his toxic report?

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,390
I don’t know.

189
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,390
I think someone doesn’t wish Home well.

190
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,990
He didn’t drink at all?

191
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,170
Not a sip, mama.

192
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,320
Peach thinks someone is trying to sabotage Home.

193
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,690
Is there anyone you think might be suspicious?

194
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,190
Hello?

195
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,390
Mama, you still there?

196
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,620
I can’t think of anyone.

197
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,780
I’m at the garage right now.

198
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,950
I’ll call you immediately if I find anything.

199
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,540
How can I help?

200
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,170
I’m looking for a car.

201
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,510
That one, actually.

202
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,250
I see.

203
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,730
The rich brat’s car.

204
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,690
We love their kind around here.

205
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,190
They are just so reckless.

206
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,120
I believe it isn’t wise to speak baselessly.

207
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,490
Slander is a legal offense.

208
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,690
I’ll see what I can do.

209
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,650
I see you’ve arrived, Ms. Kan.

210
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,040
Yes, just now.

211
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,480
Is that Mr. Home’s car?

212
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,090
Not yet.

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Mr. Home is currently abroad.

214
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,190
You seem to know this family better than I thought.

215
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,130
You even know Home.

216
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,000
I can’t quite figure out

217
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,600
why someone of your calibre

218
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,100
would want to work as a legal consultant for the Vimarnsukmans.

219
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,510
Working with the Vimarnsukman family is my aspiration, sir.

220
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,710
Vimarnsukman helped develop the neighborhood I lived in as a kid.

221
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,680
The neighborhood is now a prosperous avenue,

222
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,260
unlike the poor community it once was.

223
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,720
I see.

224
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,790
That must be the Khlong Sai Daeng Renovation Project.

225
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,000
It was quite a hassle back in the day for us.

226
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,190
Good thing the community leader fell ill at such a perfect timing.

227
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,440
Otherwise, the project wouldn’t have gone through so successfully.

228
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,840
When will Mr. Home come back to Thailand, sir?

229
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,500
I don’t know.

230
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,580
You seem to take an interest in him.

231
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,170
Do you want to work with him?

232
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,990
Yes.

233
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,590
I met him once.

234
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,570
I think he’s a good person.

235
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,490
Good person, huh?

236
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,630
Yes.

237
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,670
I believe so.

238
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Well, if you insist on that,

239
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,500
let me consult this with Mr. Somkid before getting back to you.

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,980
I’ve checked the car.

241
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
Nothing’s out of the norm.

242
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,030
I’ll check elsewhere and let you know once I have something.

243
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,410
Alright.

244
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,640
Excuse me.

245
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,980
Yes?

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,010
This is the camera that comes with the car.

247
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,110
You should have it.

248
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,100
We’ll be on our way.

249
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,330
So he’s not here at his mansion,

250
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,330
and Kan didn’t find anything.

251
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,450
Hey, Home!

252
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,990
Where are you?

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,990
Just come out.

254
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,970
We all forgive you!

255
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,610
I don’t think that’ll work.

256
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,310
Why not?

257
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,600
I think it’s because of me.

258
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,590
When he was at our door,

259
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,610
I told him to go away.

260
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,000
Peach…

261
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,980
Yes?

262
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,330
Uncle Somkid, hello.

263
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,350
Yes.

264
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,300
What?

265
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,280
Yes, we’ll be right there.

266
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,110
Peach, what did he say?

267
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,410
Uncle Kid said Home’s in trouble.

268
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,990
Let’s go, Pang.

269
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,910
The patient is in a very critical condition.

270
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,440
We gave him adrenaline and got his heart rate back.

271
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,040
If this happens again,

272
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,100
I’m afraid the patient might not make it till morning.

273
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,460
I suggest you brace yourselves for the worst case scenario.

274
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,530
I guess you heard all that, Peach.

275
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,010
I’ll leave you with him here.

276
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,190
I have to go deal with those reporters and talk to his Aunt Somphorn.

277
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,330
Are we really never going to see Home again?

278
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,950
I found it.

279
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,410
Home’s ghost?

280
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,610
No.

281
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,280
I found a way to call his spirit back to his body.

282
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,800
That’s clearly clickbait.

283
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,180
How could you fall for that?

284
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,090
What else will you have me do?

285
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,980
Sit and watch Home’s life slowly leave his body?

286
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,780
It says here this ritual requires a strong desire.

287
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,360
Maybe Home went to you because

288
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,000
he wanted very strongly to see you.

289
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,990
What about you?

290
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Don’t you want to see him?

291
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,290
I’ll try it.

292
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,320
What else does it say?

293
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,030
It says,

294
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,710
place something he loves or is attached to

295
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,060
inside a circle of holy thread tied to his finger,

296
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,580
then focus your mind on his spirit to call it back.

297
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,250
What?

298
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,450
Something he loves?

299
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,730
What do you even love, Home?

300
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,120
I think I know.

301
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,090
Hold it! No more chillies.

302
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,550
You already added enough chillies!

303
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,320
What about it?

304
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,020
T’s too spicy!

305
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,450
I like it spicy.

306
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,620
But I don’t!

307
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,040
- What does that have to do with you? - I can’t handle that much heat.

308
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,510
- Then go and buy your own food and leave mine alone. - But I’m hungry right now.

309
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,790
Home loves watching you cook.

310
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,790
He said it feels like finally coming home.

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,150
Really?

312
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,000
He said that?

313
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,780
Nah.

314
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,660
Made that up.

315
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,140
Ugh!

316
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,290
But you know he loves your food.

317
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,780
I think he’ll definitely come back if you cook for him.

318
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,370
How can I do that?

319
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,190
We’re in a hospital.

320
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,380
It hurts!

321
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,560
Hey!

322
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,690
Suradech, take the glasses off!

323
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,620
How the hell did you do that?

324
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,960
It hurts, hurts, hurts!

325
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,180
It hurts bad!

326
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,860
Hey.

327
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,600
Do you really think this will work?

328
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,190
A bit late for that now.

329
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,810
We’ll never know if we never try, right?

330
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,090
Thank you.

331
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,000
I got everything here.

332
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,290
The rest is up to you.

333
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,320
Suradech and I will buy you some time.

334
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,590
Let’s go, Suradech.

335
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,430
To think I’d be the idiot who tries to cook in a hospital.

336
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,530
It’s all for you, Home.

337
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,540
What the eff…

338
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,550
How did I get here?

339
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,410
Holy shit!

340
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,410
Am I… dead?

341
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,400
Well deserved, I guess.

342
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,780
No, it ain’t, you dummy!

343
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,690
An–Angel of Death!

344
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,520
You’re Death, aren’t you?

345
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,700
Exactly.

346
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
And you must be punished for what you did!

347
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,310
I’m kidding.

348
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,950
Gramps!

349
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,250
Careful, careful!

350
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,490
Gramps!

351
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,310
Wait.

352
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,760
If I’m here with you,

353
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,100
that means I’m really dead, aren’t I?

354
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,390
Not really.

355
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,180
This is the limbo between life and death.

356
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,700
Even I gotta stay here for 100 days before I can leave.

357
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,410
But it’s not your time yet, Home.

358
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,000
So hurry back before you run out of time.

359
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Hmm?

360
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,370
Can I not go back, Gramps?

361
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,800
Why’d you say that?

362
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,700
I don’t know.

363
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,110
I just don’t feel like going back.

364
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,110
THREE YEARS UNPUNISHED… HOLY COW.
KIND-HEARTED, NO. GUILT-RIDDEN, YES.
#CANCELVIMARNSUKMAN

365
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,500
I’d only be going back to being hated and cursed.

366
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,100
I feel like I’ve been a burden to everyone ever since I was born.

367
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,190
All I ever did was cause problems for our family.

368
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,420
What a disgrace.

369
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,780
Home, you troublemaker, you fiend.

370
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,520
GO TO HELL.
I did the same to everyone.

371
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,780
Without me, the Vimarnsukman’s reputation wouldn’t have gone to ruins.
GO TO HELL, VIMARNSUKMAN!

372
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,370
I wouldn’t have become the bad guy everyone hates…

373
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,980
Including everyone around me.

374
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
So…

375
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,390
It’d be good riddance if I just died.

376
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,400
No more scandals for Vimarnsukman.

377
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,090
And since everyone wants me dead anyway,

378
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,560
it’d be a win-win situation.

379
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,650
You think?

380
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,810
You think everyone wants you dead?

381
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,550
Take a look at this.

382
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,090
I don’t see anything.

383
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,420
Of course not.

384
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,790
It’s new.

385
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,120
I just want you to check out how cool it is.

386
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,420
Come on, Gramps!

387
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,270
Well, here’s the real deal so take a good look.

388
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,750
These people are just as mad at me as everyone else is.

389
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,400
That’s not true.

390
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,800
They are even more mad at you than the rest.

391
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,780
You know why?

392
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,340
Because they love you more than anyone does.

393
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:37,140
I don’t believe these people want you dead, Home.

394
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,810
On the contrary,

395
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:46,580
I think they’re probably doing everything in their power right now to get you back.

396
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,980
And yes, people hate Vimarnsukman,

397
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,480
but it’s not because of you.

398
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,010
It’s because of the curse our family carries.

399
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,290
Curse?

400
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,490
Yes.

401
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,300
That one was entirely my fault.

402
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,420
That one was entirely my fault.

403
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,630
Your cervix must be dilated.

404
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,770
Or maybe we need a C-section.

405
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,770
I’ll book the OR.

406
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,660
You wanna cut me up?

407
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,220
I think there’s been a misunderstanding.

408
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,590
Maybe my tummy hurts, not because I’m giving birth,

409
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,940
but because I need to go number two really badly!

410
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,820
Please at least let the doctor check up on you, ma’am.

411
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,200
This could be dangerous for the baby.

412
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:25,960
No, it ain’t.

413
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,760
I’m fine.

414
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,300
Really.

415
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,430
- The baby might— - I said I’m fine!

416
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,330
Uh-oh.

417
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,460
My baby.

418
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,310
What do you think you’re playing?

419
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,160
Is that what it looks like we’re doing? Playing?

420
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,170
But this guy here really is sick.

421
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,070
He’s sick.

422
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:44,700
He is.

423
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,830
He’s extremely sick.

424
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,520
Sir, sir, hang in there.

425
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,990
I’ll get the nurse...

426
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,290
Oh, no!

427
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,700
What do you think you’re doing?

428
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,830
Cooking is not allowed inside the hospital.

429
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,730
Same goes for performing superstitious rituals!

430
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,730
Please.

431
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,500
I can explain this.

432
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,150
He’s right.

433
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,490
We can explain.

434
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,280
Please stay calm.

435
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,200
Security!

436
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,360
We need you here!

437
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,790
Hey, sister.

438
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,040
I told you we can explain!

439
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,160
Save your explanation for the police, ma’am.

440
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,340
Fine, if you don’t wanna make peace,

441
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,890
I’ll give you war.

442
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,890
I choose you, Suradech!

443
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,110
Take your time, Peach. No pressure.

444
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,690
PROTEST AGAINST VIMARNSUKMAN

445
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,330
I never knew our family was so heavily under fire.

446
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,320
I was cursed the same way you are, Home.

447
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,280
They said I’d be doing everyone a favor if I just went to hell.

448
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,170
Well, now that I’m on my way there,

449
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,020
it still doesn’t help with Vimarnsukman’s reputation at all, does it?

450
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,320
There’s nothing I can do anymore.

451
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,820
But you’re not dead, Home.

452
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,680
You can still do something about this family curse.

453
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,830
SERVES HIM RIGHT. NOT SORRY FOR HIM. DESERVES IT.
#CANCELVIMARNSUKMAN

454
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,700
If I don’t change something,

455
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,480
I gotta live with this for the rest of my life.

456
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,220
Gramps.

457
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,150
I’ve made up my mind.

458
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,010
I’ll undo our family curse!

459
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,990
Now we’re talking!

460
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,620
Now that’s my grandson!

461
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,000
Gramps, but…

462
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,950
How can I go back?

463
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,940
Easy-peasy.

464
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,970
You still remember that silly dance from your childhood?

465
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,600
Yes, but… why?

466
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,930
There you have it.

467
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,350
Close your eyes.

468
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,120
Take a deep breath.

469
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,890
And just dance.

470
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,410
Ya-ya-ya.

471
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,560
Yi-yi-yi.

472
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,540
Yu-yu-yu.

473
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,200
Gramps does laundry.

474
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,550
Uncle is hairy.

475
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,880
We share candy, then brush our teeth.

476
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:14,200
The magic word for Home is… Please!

477
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,970
Come on, Gramps!

478
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,110
Be serious!

479
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,540
I’m dying to get back!

480
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,380
I’m saving that for later.

481
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,410
Now, let’s talk business.

482
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,060
Close your eyes.

483
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,680
Focus on your breathing.

484
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,390
Set a goal in your mind why you want to get back out there,

485
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,930
who you wanna do it for.

486
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,200
Your spirit will lead the way.

487
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,970
I want to reverse the curse.

488
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
I want to see my friends.

489
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,550
Holy shit!

490
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,050
Get back in your body before sunrise.

491
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,120
Don’t forget to undo our family curse.

492
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,760
Yes, Gramps.

493
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,660
I’ll do my best!

494
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,550
I’m sorry this is all I can help you with.

495
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,890
Watch your back with your friends.

496
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,580
Come again?

497
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,910
I can’t hear that last bit!

498
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,000
I need to get back.

499
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,840
Hi, excuse me.

500
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,880
You happen to know which room my body is in?

501
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,910
Ma’am?

502
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,460
Hey.

503
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,220
Hey!

504
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Come back!

505
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Hey!

506
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,990
Excuse me.

507
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,210
Hello.

508
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,440
Do you see me?

509
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
Hey.

510
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,850
Hey!

511
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,190
Nobody can see me?

512
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,670
What the eff!

513
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,640
Where the hell is my body!

514
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,430
Come on!

515
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,520
Stay back!

516
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,870
I’ll never find it in time.

517
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,080
No, Suradech!

518
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,010
That’s the smell of basil.

519
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,720
Help!

520
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,100
Stay put!

521
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
No!

522
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,900
Get them all!

523
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,180
No. Please, wait!

524
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,790
Please, wait!

525
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:17,930
Stop it!

526
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,990
I’m almost done!

527
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,070
Please!

528
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,250
Let me finish it!

529
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,340
The smell’s gone.

530
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,830
Let me go!

531
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,860
Please!

532
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,580
Please, I beg you!

533
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,470
Doctor! Doctor!

534
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,690
Home.

535
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,380
Home, wake up.

536
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Home, wake the hell up.

537
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,290
You said you like my food, so wake up and eat it!

538
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,010
Home.

539
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,610
Please just wake up.

540
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,740
I really do forgive you.

541
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,220
Home.

542
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,990
I wasn’t even that mad at you in the first place.

543
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,170
Home.

544
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,620
You still haven’t tried my Chef’s Table dishes.

545
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,050
Home.

546
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,020
Home, please, just wake up.

547
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,810
Home.

548
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,880
I’m really not mad at you anymore.

549
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,550
I’m sorry.

550
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:44,910
Please wake up. I forgive you. I really do.

551
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,640
Wake up.

552
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,530
Please, just wake up.

553
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,710
I still want you to try my food.

554
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,040
Home.

555
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,930
Please wake up.

556
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:14,470
Who’d play with my sister if you weren’t here?

557
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,280
Peach.

558
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,180
I’m sorry.

559
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,150
You don’t have to say anything.

560
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,000
It’s truly a miracle.

561
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,500
Your body is now responding well to treatment.

562
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,160
I suggest you stay a few more days to make sure everything is okay.

563
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,980
Thank you, Doctor.

564
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,680
Are you sure you’re alright now?

565
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,790
Sure, man.

566
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,440
I’m just a bit dizzy.

567
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,670
But I’m okay now.

568
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,200
I know who’s not okay, though.

569
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,560
This guy.

570
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,680
Come on, Suradech.

571
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,980
I’m back.

572
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,570
Don’t cry.

573
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,710
Hold it, Suradech.

574
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,400
No need to cry anymore, Suradech.

575
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Hey.

576
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,000
Is something the matter?

577
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,210
Yeah.

578
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,970
There’s something important I need to do.

579
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,790
Something important?

580
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,390
What is it?

581
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,920
When I was out,

582
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,010
I met Gramps.

583
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,290
But your grandfather is dead.

584
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,590
How could you have met him?

585
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,640
That doesn’t matter right now.

586
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,640
What’s more important is that

587
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,380
I promised him I’d clean up this mess and get the Vimarnsukman’s reputation back.

588
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,670
I need your help with this.

589
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,890
Will you help me?

590
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,550
Of course, we will.

591
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,610
We’re a team.

592
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,720
I’ll call Kan over so we can all be here.

593
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
Pangpang.

594
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,390
We can’t let Kan know about this.

595
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,480
Really?

596
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,800
My nephew is alright now?

597
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,330
Yes.

598
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,840
Thank you.

599
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,480
Mr. Somkid.

600
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,530
We’re in trouble.

601
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,260
Mr. Yai.

602
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,900
What is missing?

603
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,890
I’ve checked,

604
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,510
and only a few documents of our past cover-ups were gone.

605
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,110
However…

606
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,420
What is it?

607
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,380
All the information on the Khlong Sai Daeng project from 10 years ago…

608
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,030
are gone.

609
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,620
TIME TO UNVEIL
THE UGLY SIDE OF THE REAL ESTATE MOGUL FAMILY

610
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,900
What do you mean Kan can’t know about this?

611
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,080
Because I think…

612
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,910
Kan has something to do with this entire Vimarnsukman scandal.

613
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,130
Besides…

614
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,000
I think Kan also has something to do with the car crash.

615
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,900
Your Vimarnsukman callout video seems like a hit, Kan.

616
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,460
Yes.

617
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,720
KHLONG SAI DAENG PROJECT

618
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,400
And this is everything I acquired.

619
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,590
Everything is in order, then?

620
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,020
Yes.

621
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,080
Everything we’ve waited over the past 10 years for

622
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,070
is finally coming to fruition.

623
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,070
Hang on, Home.

624
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,600
Why would Kan do something like that, or want you dead?

625
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,240
I don’t know, either.

626
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,410
Maybe…

627
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,900
Maybe Kan has a grudge against your family?

628
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,960
I’ll finally get revenge for us…

629
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,210
Dad.

630
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,670
So Kan only chose to work for you

631
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,130
to get revenge?

632
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,650
What you always wanted is about to become true, Dad.

633
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,480
I think the curse Gramps talked about

634
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,710
has something to do with this community.

635
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,920
I have the original copy that will guarantee us our victory in court.

636
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,690
I don’t want it to end this way.

637
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,360
Let’s do what we can do.

638
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,740
Mr. Sing is…

639
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,330
still alive, isn’t he?
