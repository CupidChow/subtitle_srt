1
00:00:01,443 --> 00:00:02,443
Dad.

2
00:00:02,873 --> 00:00:06,383
- Dad! - No parents can stay with their kids for the rest of their lives.

3
00:00:06,403 --> 00:00:08,113
You need friends.

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,173
I’m thinking that maybe the family curse Mr. Home mentioned

5
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:16,643
has nothing to do with my community.

6
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:18,043
KHLONG SAI DANG PROJECT

7
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:27,823
Those idiots!

8
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:30,843
I have to take care of this myself again.

9
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:38,533
Please undo our family curse, Home.

10
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:40,143
Please, Home.

11
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:41,233
The family curse.

12
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:42,193
Undo the curse.

13
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,823
Undo our family curse.

14
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,303
Curse.

15
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:56,753
What were you thinking staying so close like that?

16
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:58,613
What are you making such a fuss for?

17
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,713
Do your ears still hurt?

18
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,833
Yeah.

19
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:12,933
They still kinda sting.

20
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,223
And…

21
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:17,903
I’m hearing this weird noise.

22
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,403
I don’t know where it’s from.

23
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:21,953
You guys hear that?

24
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:27,533
Can you tell me what kind of noise it is?

25
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:29,043
It’s…

26
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:32,833
It’s like a scraping,

27
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:34,123
or scratching.

28
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:37,163
Kinda like “SCREEEEK.”

29
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:40,023
Like there’s something scratching against something else.

30
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:44,123
I’ve noticed this since yesterday.

31
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:48,143
I think what’s going on with your ears

32
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,743
is supernatural.

33
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,543
What do you mean?

34
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:56,973
Well…

35
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,433
Right over here,

36
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:04,743
there’s a ghost of a boy scout scratching the wall with his nails.

37
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:06,623
Oh my God!

38
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:11,793
When you came back after your heart stopped,

39
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:16,813
I think you got a homecoming gift.

40
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:22,943
I think, right now, you can hear ghosts.

41
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,813
Oh my gosh.

42
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:29,963
You’re gifted

43
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:32,433
with the ability to hear ghosts.

44
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,773
Why did my life turn out like this!

45
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,853
This might come in handy, you know?

46
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,113
Peach is the eyes.

47
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,583
You’re the ears, Home.

48
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:47,173
I wish it were useful.

49
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:51,423
I still haven’t done anything about the stolen contract for Kan’s community.

50
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:53,963
There’s also the ongoing family curse.

51
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:56,213
I literally have no idea what that curse is.

52
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,493
I think we need to take one step at a time.

53
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:03,593
Obviously none of us knows what the curse is,

54
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:08,203
but I believe someone intends to cause you some serious harm, Mr. Home.

55
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:11,453
SOMPHORN VIMARNSUKMAN’S RESIDENCE

56
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,493
Everything looks quite normal from out here,

57
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:33,813
but somehow I can’t shake these goosebumps at the back of my head.

58
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:41,833
Kan, are you sure the stolen contract is here?

59
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,053
I can’t be 100% certain.

60
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:47,403
But there’s something I haven’t told you.

61
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,483
I have the footage from the camera in Mr. Home’s car from the accident.

62
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,893
When I got to the scene,

63
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:14,143
the car in the footage was already gone.

64
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:17,773
I believe you recognize the car, Mr. Home?

65
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,253
It belongs to Aunt Phorn.

66
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:41,043
Peach, come on.

67
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,243
If I remember correctly,

68
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:48,403
the garage should be out back.

69
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:50,443
We have to walk through this hallway.

70
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:01,753
She’s got some weird taste in decorations.

71
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,433
As expected of the bad guy in our story.

72
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,133
Good thing she isn’t home today.

73
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:12,033
She might wanna come back for a big cleaning day.

74
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:13,833
It’s so dusty in here.

75
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:19,803
Home!

76
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:21,173
My ears are hurting again.

77
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:22,533
What’s going on?

78
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,663
Peach, come over here and take a look at him.

79
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:25,683
Peach!

80
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:32,723
Peach?

81
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:35,133
- Peach! - Peach!

82
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:36,603
Peach!

83
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:38,103
Peach!

84
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,983
Let go of my brother! Let go!

85
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:40,783
Peach!

86
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:42,153
Peach!

87
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:45,093
- Peach! - Peach!

88
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:47,863
Peach!

89
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,053
Peach!

90
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:50,713
Peach! Peach!

91
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,013
What’s wrong?

92
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,173
Peach, wake up!

93
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,623
Peach!

94
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:56,423
Wake up!

95
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:57,533
Peach!

96
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:58,443
Peach, wake up!

97
00:06:58,463 --> 00:06:59,353
This is way too strange.

98
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:00,283
We need to get out of here.

99
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:01,303
Let’s get him up.

100
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:06,693
Peach, just hang in there, alright?

101
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:07,993
Peach!

102
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,113
You want to try me, huh?

103
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:39,793
So be it.

104
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:58,503
That’s the same footage twice like a deja vu.

105
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:00,083
No doctor required this time, though.

106
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,783
Just this DIY holy water.

107
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:03,803
What?

108
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:06,083
You sprayed me with holy water?

109
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:08,943
At least it works, right?

110
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,363
You’ve been out cold for so long.

111
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:11,273
We didn’t know what to do

112
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:14,753
so we asked a monk in the temple next door for some holy water.

113
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,643
You should have taken me to the hospital.

114
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,103
As if that would work.

115
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,643
Look.

116
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:27,873
She’s got some tricolor cloths, rotting offerings, and all the voodoo stuff.

117
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,174
There’s no way around it. This is the work of the occult.

118
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:35,193
Peach, what the hell actually happened?

119
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,313
Home!

120
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,403
What’s going on?

121
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,833
Peach, come over here and take a look at him.

122
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:46,933
Peach!

123
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,283
I’ve never seen anything so scary in my life.

124
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,323
They aren’t regular ghosts.

125
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,083
Do you think she’s put a hex on me?

126
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:10,133
It makes sense.

127
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,723
This would answer my question.

128
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:14,613
What question is that, mama?

129
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:21,153
Why all of Vimarnsukman’s properties are diabolically haunted.

130
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,413
Kan.

131
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,093
Are you saying that...

132
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,003
Hello, Best?

133
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,033
Hey, Peach.

134
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:33,663
I think something strange is going on in the house again.

135
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:35,303
What’s wrong?

136
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:37,423
I…

137
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:41,013
I feel like I’m not alone in the house.

138
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,423
Hold on.

139
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:46,653
Are you saying the ghost of that construction worker is back?

140
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:49,853
No, not like that.

141
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,343
The house just feels oddly eerie.

142
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:56,643
My throat also hurts.

143
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:59,763
I swear I keep the place squeaky clean.

144
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:01,573
It just...

145
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:04,963
Best?

146
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,813
We’re in trouble.

147
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,283
All the buyers are suddenly texting me all at once.

148
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,663
They say there’s something strange going on.

149
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,643
They cough, their throats hurt, and they feel suffocated.

150
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:21,313
They’re all saying the same thing.

151
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:27,783
Home.

152
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:31,493
I think this is going to be more dangerous than anything we went through.

153
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:33,623
Because we’re not just dealing with regular ghosts.

154
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:36,843
We’re dealing with the occult here.

155
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:44,793
This is obviously…

156
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,383
Enigma.

157
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:50,523
The occult. The Dark Arts. Black magic.

158
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:05,803
Don’t you think this is too much, ma’am?

159
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,743
Too much?

160
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:14,813
I’d say these lowly ghosts are perfect for these lowlifes.

161
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:21,853
Those puny kids don’t deserve to face my little secret trump card.

162
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,823
How was it, officer?

163
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:21,133
Would you mind letting us take a look, ma’am?

164
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:22,383
By all means.

165
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:23,513
Sergeant, check it out.

166
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,533
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:32,573
We’ve checked everywhere.

168
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:34,943
There’s nothing you said there would be.

169
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,873
Next time this happens,

170
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:40,493
I’m charging you with false reporting, Ms. Kan.

171
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,123
I understand. Thank you.

172
00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:44,143
Of course.

173
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,623
Where could she have hidden that car?

174
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,243
Excuse us for now, ma’am.

175
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:53,853
Good day.

176
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:11,783
There’s no use racking your brains over it.

177
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:16,863
Why not just ask a suspect?

178
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:29,593
Now answer me, you scum!

179
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:32,273
How come the cops didn’t find the car at Aunt Phorn’s house?

180
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:34,033
Where the hell is she hiding it?

181
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,463
Is she really using black magic?

182
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,103
Answer me!

183
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,943
You think he’d go along with your little act?

184
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:47,103
Mama, don’t you know how long I’ve been wanting to do this?

185
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,033
Pok.

186
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:01,603
Can you please tell me

187
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,223
what you know about Aunt Phorn?

188
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,533
Please stay calm, sir.

189
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,553
I know you’re scared.

190
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,673
I am, too.

191
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:19,043
But you’re safe here, I can assure you that.

192
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:21,043
We’re here with you.

193
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,263
Please help us out.

194
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:27,133
Maybe you know something that will be useful to us.

195
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:31,623
I don’t know anything much.

196
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:32,803
It’s alright.

197
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:35,043
Just tell us what you know.

198
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:40,103
I just want to know where Aunt Somphorn hides her car.

199
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:48,593
Then… Does she have help?

200
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,513
Help?

201
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:53,713
Baanchuen.

202
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:55,673
Baanchuen!

203
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:56,463
Baanchuen?

204
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:59,183
Isn’t Baanchuen the maid who’s always been with Aunt Somphorn?

205
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:06,493
Let me see.

206
00:15:14,153 --> 00:15:15,263
Good.

207
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,193
Take it away.

208
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:22,993
Be careful.

209
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,883
Won’t it be dangerous for you to keep this kind of thing in the house, ma’am?

210
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,363
I’m the Somphorn.

211
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:37,303
I own all the big shots in the police department.

212
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:44,213
And even a tiny bit of my money can buy off all the rest of them.

213
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:47,333
Aren’t you afraid they’d stab you in the back?

214
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,643
Them government dogs are not to be trusted, ma’am.

215
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,533
Just carefully put it there.

216
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:06,733
Thank you.

217
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,223
Where’s Baanchuen, ma’am?

218
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:11,253
She should be here helping you out.

219
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:17,323
Well, you told me cops are not to be trusted.

220
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:21,033
So I found myself a reassurance.

221
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:25,953
Hey, Baanchuen is nowhere so far off.

222
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:29,003
She’s still around, helping me out.

223
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,843
Am I right, Baanchuen?

224
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:46,963
Oh, look at your face!

225
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:49,273
I’m only joking!

226
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,033
That’s not possible.

227
00:16:57,063 --> 00:17:02,233
From the record, Ms. Baanchuen was sent back home to Myanmar.

228
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:03,343
Look.

229
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:06,283
What’s on paper doesn’t prove anything, mama.

230
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:09,053
Rich people can forge that quite easily.

231
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,653
Peach, just hang in there, alright?

232
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,433
Peach!

233
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,113
Guys.

234
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:33,243
I saw Baanchuen’s ghost when we were back at the house.

235
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:39,773
So she has resorted to black magic and murder.

236
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,763
This is way too dangerous for us to handle.

237
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:45,233
What did you slam the table for?

238
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:46,553
Just wanted to lighten the mood.

239
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:50,503
We can’t give up.

240
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,723
Since it’s come to this,

241
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:54,783
I guess we have no choice but to strike back.

242
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,753
How would we even do that?

243
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:02,663
It’s time for the two of us to pull some real theatrics.

244
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:13,623
GHOST ESTATE REVIEW

245
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:18,093
Ghost Estate Review featuring your boy, Homie!

246
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,473
On today’s special episode, we’re here at none other than
WELCOME BACK, BABYHOME!/MISS YOU.

247
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:26,533
Thailand’s most sophisticated millionaire. 
I’LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING, BABY!/BABYHOME IS BACK!/WHO IS IT?

248
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,243
Thailand’s most sophisticated millionaire.
SOPHISTICATED (ADJ.) HAVING GREAT WORLDLY EXPERIENCE AKA OLD

249
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:35,653
It’s Aunt Somphorn!
WHERE’S PEACH?/THIS IS WEIRD./HELLO!/WOW. HOME’S AUNT.

250
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:36,823
What on earth are you doing?
HEY, AUNTIE.

251
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:39,643
I don’t have time for your shenanigans.

252
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:41,343
Oh, Aunt Phorn.

253
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:44,213
I’ve checked your schedule for the day

254
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:49,123
and you’re soooo free.

255
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:50,873
Your chauffeur is also off duty today.

256
00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:51,923
Where else do you have to be but here?

257
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:53,583
Where I am or I am not going is none of your business.

258
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:54,683
Leave me alone.

259
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:56,403
You lowlife nephew.

260
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:58,113
Uh, Auntie.

261
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,603
You’re currently live.
EH… THERE ARE CHILDREN WATCHING, LADY.

262
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,223
Oh, my lovely nephew.
SO CLOSE./OI, BE NICE TO BABYHOME.

263
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,673
Pangpang, you too, have a lovely day.
#CANCELSOMPHORN

264
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,743
Here’s the thing, children.

265
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:11,463
I am very busy today.

266
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,763
I am generally a busy woman.

267
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:15,583
I don’t think this is a good time, guys.

268
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:19,053
This will take no time at all, Aunt Phorn.

269
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:22,883
Won’t you help your beloved nephew out?
LMAO GO FOR IT, HOME./IF THIS AIN’T THE CUTEST TEDDY BEAR EVER./HE PLAYS HER GOOD.

270
00:19:22,903 --> 00:19:23,903
Fine.

271
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,343
Well…

272
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,633
Since you’re all here…

273
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,243
Why not?

274
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,033
Oh, dear.

275
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:38,423
Oh, my my.

276
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,863
What’s wrong, children?

277
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:41,713
You should go home and rest if you’re not feeling well.

278
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:42,813
Go on, dear.

279
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,163
Go take a rest.

280
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,373
Huh?

281
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:51,393
What?

282
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:52,303
What was that?

283
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,863
It’s just a photography effect, ma’am.

284
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:55,823
It’s called the Polca Effect.

285
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:56,883
It’s Bokeh.

286
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:00,053
Bokeh, yeah.

287
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:04,563
Let’s get started on this home tour, shall we?

288
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:08,773
If you have nothing to hide, that is.

289
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:14,133
So you’re really going to do this, then, my nephew?

290
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,133
Be my guest.

291
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:29,073
We’re now on the second floor of the house, guys.
HER ENERGY IS IMMACULATE.

292
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:33,633
As you can see, she’s all for maximalism.
I’M TEAM KANPANG, FYI.

293
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:35,658
I’M TEAM KANPANG, FYI./SHE’S THE PILLAR OF THE GHOST-HUNTING TEAM./CAN I LOVE PANG? I’LL GIVE YOU A MILLION SCORE.

294
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:38,898
It fits so well with the coming ageing society.

295
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:43,843
Aunt Somphorn.

296
00:20:45,013 --> 00:20:50,533
I think this spot here looks kinda… fishy.

297
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:52,243
What are you talking about?

298
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:57,643
Why don’t you let me take you further inside?

299
00:20:57,993 --> 00:20:58,993
Come on.

300
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:01,293
Well…

301
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,023
Let me take a look behind it.

302
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:06,043
Home!

303
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:17,213
Ms. Kan!

304
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,593
What are you doing here?

305
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,253
Are you trying to steal something from us again?

306
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:21,273
Come here!

307
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:23,393
I’m not stealing.

308
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:26,543
I’m looking for evidence that will save Vimarnsukman.

309
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,693
You? Save Vimarnsukman?

310
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:32,533
After all the troubles you caused us, you think I’d believe you?

311
00:21:32,663 --> 00:21:34,113
I mean it, Mr. Yai.

312
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:40,263
We know now that the car crash that nearly killed Mr Home

313
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:41,553
was the scheme of Ms. Somphorn.

314
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:42,913
What are you talking about?

315
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:43,983
You’re out of your mind.

316
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:44,923
Come with me and get out of here.

317
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:45,943
Get out!

318
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:47,023
Let go of me!

319
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:48,403
Stop resisting!

320
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:50,183
What’s going on here?

321
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,503
Well, Kan?

322
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,363
Will you tell me what’s going on?

323
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:16,573
See?

324
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:18,373
I told you there’s nothing there.

325
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:20,753
Do you know how hurtful it is for me

326
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,243
to be seen as a bad person by my own kin,

327
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:24,973
as if I’m always hiding something?

328
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,143
Home?

329
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:34,943
Home!

330
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:35,963
Home!

331
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:39,493
Home.

332
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,523
Oh, dear.

333
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:49,963
Home, what’s wrong, my dear nephew?

334
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,423
Home!

335
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,213
Time to go.

336
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:55,333
No, I’m not leaving.

337
00:22:55,353 --> 00:22:57,913
I don’t think you look well, dear.

338
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,343
Aunt Phorn.

339
00:22:59,593 --> 00:23:02,053
Stop acting.

340
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,813
I know you’re using black magic,

341
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,713
and that you killed Baancheun.

342
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:13,623
What of it?

343
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:18,643
Even if you think you know the truth,

344
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,443
do you have proof?

345
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:26,023
Baanchuen had been taking good care of you, hadn’t she?

346
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:28,213
Is this how you repay her?

347
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:29,533
And so what?

348
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:33,083
She was just a maid.

349
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,413
What do you care?

350
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:37,433
She was every bit a person as you and I are!

351
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,513
No matter what you say,

352
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:43,243
you’ll never stop her.

353
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:49,153
Oh, dear.

354
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,323
Home, you jerk.

355
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:09,533
What did you do to her?

356
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:13,333
I did what my ghost-hunting team always does.

357
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:40,543
Sir.

358
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,403
One more thing.

359
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:47,233
Do you know what was Baanchuen’s favorite dish?

360
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:49,753
Won’t you help your beloved nephew out?

361
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:50,573
Please.

362
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:51,203
Just a bit.

363
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,223
Fine.

364
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:56,483
Well…

365
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:58,033
Since you’re all here…

366
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:15,073
Since you’re all here…

367
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,433
Home!

368
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,453
Stop it!

369
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:47,713
Home, you jerk!

370
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:48,823
Stop it right now!

371
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:49,733
Home!

372
00:26:49,753 --> 00:26:50,753
Home!

373
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:56,043
Let go!

374
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:57,003
Let go of me!

375
00:26:57,023 --> 00:26:58,823
Do not touch my things!

376
00:26:58,843 --> 00:27:00,263
Get out!

377
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:01,743
Get out!

378
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,493
Home, what are you doing?

379
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:09,713
If you hurt me, you as good as hurt Vimarnsukman.

380
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:13,223
Are you going to be the heir that lets everything we’ve built crumble down, Home?

381
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:15,393
If I do everything right,

382
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:17,133
I won’t ruin Vimarnsukman.

383
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:18,803
I won’t let you!

384
00:27:22,593 --> 00:27:23,713
Home!

385
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:24,733
Home!

386
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:27,123
Home!

387
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:28,563
Home, I’m here.

388
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,303
Peach, help.

389
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:31,363
Catch!

390
00:27:36,313 --> 00:27:37,603
I told you to catch!

391
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:40,463
Did you think I was Thor and that was Mjonir?

392
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,163
The necklace.

393
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:45,833
Peach.

394
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:46,453
The necklace!

395
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:47,243
The necklace.

396
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:48,933
- The necklace. - The necklace.

397
00:27:48,953 --> 00:27:50,233
What necklace?

398
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:54,553
The necklace.

399
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:56,923
The necklace.

400
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,633
Peach, grab the necklace!

401
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:00,803
The necklace!

402
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:07,833
Give it back!

403
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,073
Here.

404
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:20,953
I understand now whose voices it is I’ve been hearing.

405
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:24,933
It’s the voices of the people you never bother to listen to.

406
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:28,133
But I hear them.

407
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:29,933
Loud and clear.

408
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,873
So cringe!

409
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:40,003
Our family has ruined enough lives already.

410
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:44,393
It’s time for me to undo the Vimarnsukman’s family curse.

411
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:47,783
No!

412
00:28:54,713 --> 00:28:56,693
Home!

413
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,623
Just give up, Aunt Somphorn.

414
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:25,473
I’ve got the contract in my hand now.

415
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:27,113
I won’t.

416
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:29,703
I won’t let anyone get to me!

417
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:37,413
You again?

418
00:29:37,433 --> 00:29:39,083
Let go of me!

419
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:40,543
What is this about?

420
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,413
Somkid.

421
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:46,293
You dare get me arrested?

422
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:47,493
Phorn.

423
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:49,713
I don’t know how you had the heart to do any of this.

424
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:51,303
But please don’t run anymore.

425
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,933
I’ve got all the evidence I need here.

426
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:59,523
Your chauffeur confessed.

427
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:04,243
He also confessed to being hired by you to cause the car crash that night.

428
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:09,063
That was attempted murder, ma’am.

429
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,663
How could you do this to me!

430
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:12,553
Let go!

431
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:15,083
I didn’t do anything!

432
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:18,043
You saw there was nothing there, officer!

433
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:39,043
This job was just way too tough.

434
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:43,043
You’re so weak, man.

435
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,733
I’m, like, not tired at all.

436
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,063
Well, what do you want for dinner?

437
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,453
I’ll cook.

438
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:05,673
Hey there, what you two talking about?

439
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:06,533
Ain’t telling you.

440
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,153
Tell me!

441
00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:07,823
I’m not telling you!

442
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:08,843
Why not?

443
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:10,273
Let me in!

444
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:11,183
You really want to know?

445
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,933
Tell me, tell me, tell me!

446
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:15,873
VIMARNSUKMAN GHOST-HUNTING COMPANY UN LIMITED

447
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:17,733
Please listen up.

448
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:23,743
UPDATE ON THE COMPANY
Concerning Mr. Peach’s previous canceled contract,

449
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:26,273
we are now going to renew it.

450
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:29,963
Vimarnsukman Ghost-Hunting Company Un Limited

451
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:32,493
will be back in full operation.

452
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:35,853
Everything else also seems to be going well.

453
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:41,653
Following the dispute between the Khlong Sai Dang community
VIMARNSUKMANS KEEP THEIR WORDS

454
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:43,383
and the Vimarnsukman family,

455
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:47,323
Mr. Saharat Vimarnsukman, the sole heir,

456
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:50,553
is now making good on his family’s promise to the community,

457
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:54,733
just as Mr. Somkid Vimarnsukman stated in a previous interview.
KHLONG SAI DANG MARKET

458
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:57,283
As for Ms. Somphorn Vimarnsukman,
SOMPHORN VIMARNSUKMAN ARRESTED FOR ILLEGAL POSSESSION

459
00:31:57,303 --> 00:31:59,763
she has been charged with attempted murder

460
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:02,703
as well as possession of illegal items.

461
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:07,583
Police have found a myriad of evidence inside of her garage.

462
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:12,993
The situation at all the properties sold are now back to normal.

463
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:15,743
We’re nearly at the end of our project.

464
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:19,613
There are only two properties left unsold

465
00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:22,903
which are this company and the family mansion.

466
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:24,063
Hey, hands off. That one’s mine.

467
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,253
- What? - That pork is mine!

468
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:26,693
- Don’t be ridiculous. - No, it’s mine!

469
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:27,703
Stop fighting!

470
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:28,733
- It doesn’t belong to you. - It’s mine!

471
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:30,443
Are you listening?

472
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:34,333
Kan, this ain’t no time to be working.

473
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:37,033
It’s time to celebrate the new company contract.

474
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:39,133
Here. Let me feed you.

475
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:41,553
Say “ah.”

476
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:48,763
Is it good?

477
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:51,153
Peek-a-boo!

478
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:52,823
I’m here!

479
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,763
Uncle Kid!

480
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:56,353
Hello.

481
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:56,783
Hi.

482
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:57,513
Hey, guys!

483
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:59,393
Come on here, Uncle.

484
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:03,323
Oh, did you bring this for our party?

485
00:33:05,003 --> 00:33:06,643
Oh, oh, my hand slips.

486
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,633
Kidding!

487
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:11,153
Like this.

488
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:12,763
And like this.

489
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:26,833
You’ve grown up so much

490
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:28,973
after everything you’ve been through, my dear nephew.

491
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:31,373
You used to be this small.

492
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:32,893
That’s just too tiny, Uncle!

493
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:35,203
I’m a grown up now, you know.

494
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:36,463
You are, aren’t you?

495
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:43,433
I’m really glad everything’s nearly come to an end, though.

496
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:48,133
I undid the family curse like Gramps asked me to,

497
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,143
and there are only two properties left for me to sell.

498
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,333
By the way, Home…

499
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:58,623
What are you going to do with this place?

500
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,393
I think I’ll…

501
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:13,113
I’ll just give it to Peach and Pangpang as a surprise.

502
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:16,433
When everything is over,

503
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:20,133
I hope I can still keep doing this.

504
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:22,913
Just us, ghosting-hunting.

505
00:34:23,933 --> 00:34:25,823
Staying together.

506
00:34:27,703 --> 00:34:29,643
You really love your friends, huh?

507
00:34:47,123 --> 00:34:48,233
Hey, Peach.

508
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:49,423
What’s wrong?

509
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:54,883
Well…

510
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:58,053
I’d been applying for jobs in different kitchens before this.

511
00:34:58,313 --> 00:34:59,643
And?

512
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,233
One of them finally responded.

513
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:05,013
I got the job.

514
00:35:05,783 --> 00:35:07,733
As a sous-chef.

515
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:12,583
Oh my God!

516
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,463
That's so cool!

517
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,043
Congrats!

518
00:35:18,773 --> 00:35:23,363
But the restaurant is… in Chiang Mai.

519
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:30,973
What do you think?

520
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,223
Take it!

521
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,423
It’s your dream, right?

522
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:36,813
You should take it.

523
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,523
But what about our company?

524
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:43,643
VIMARNSUKMAN GHOST-HUNTING COMPANY UN LIMITED

525
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:49,083
Oh, come on.

526
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:52,033
This ghost-hunting company didn’t mean anything from the beginning.

527
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:53,593
Once we sell everything,

528
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:55,693
the job is done and the end credit will roll like nothing ever happens.

529
00:35:55,713 --> 00:35:57,843
Home, weren’t you going to give this place to...

530
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:00,013
To celebration, that’s right, Uncle!

531
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,313
Yay!

532
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,283
Come on, Peach!

533
00:36:02,303 --> 00:36:03,163
Home, careful!

534
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:04,433
Home, no!

535
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,943
Let me down!

536
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,023
Home, stop it!

537
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,113
Uncle, help me.

538
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,543
Home, stop!

539
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,563
Home, don’t you dare spin me around!

540
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:14,873
No!

541
00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:17,283
- Peach, you can do it. - Home!

542
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:34,523
If you don’t want him to go,

543
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:36,923
why did you lie to him?

544
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,093
Kan.

545
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:44,833
If it were you,

546
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:51,933
wouldn’t you have let your best friend go and follow his life-long dream?

547
00:36:57,123 --> 00:37:00,423
Would it be right for me to tell him I don’t want him to go?

548
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,313
Would it be right to say I want him to stay with me,

549
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,923
that it’d be just us, ghost-hunting?

550
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:11,033
Would it be right to say any of that?

551
00:37:25,773 --> 00:37:28,033
It’s such a bummer to say goodbye now.

552
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:37,133
I didn’t think the fun would be over so soon.

553
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:52,893
If you want to cry,

554
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:54,843
you can cry to me, Mr. Home.

555
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,423
You said it was okay.

556
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:40,923
I didn’t think you wouldn’t hold back!

557
00:38:54,823 --> 00:38:57,703
I’ll have to go back to America soon anyway.

558
00:38:58,523 --> 00:39:00,833
It’s been almost a hundred days since Gramps passed.

559
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,153
Sad time is over!

560
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:08,033
I gotta get Gramps’ last party ready.

561
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:11,023
But before we do any of that,

562
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:14,323
we need to sleep, sleep-sleep.

563
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,703
Sleep-sleep, sleep-sleep, sleep-sleep!

564
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:20,723
Sleep, sleep-sleep, sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep!

565
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:22,949
Sleep-sleep, sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep, sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep.

566
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:25,843
Sleep-sleep, sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep, sleep-sleep-sleep-sleep.

567
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:29,653
Are you sure you can sleep when you’re so excited?

568
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:32,343
Goodnight, baby!

569
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:06,043
Has anyone seen Home?

570
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:09,063
I think he’s still sad about shutting his company down.

571
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,833
Are you really going to just leave like this?

572
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:11,953
What’s there to do?

573
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:14,493
It’s not like Home really cares about us.

574
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:15,933
I’m going back to America.

575
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:17,663
What?

576
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:25,343
You’re going straight to hell, just like your grandfather did.

577
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:27,753
I think there’s something going on here.

578
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:32,423
Gramps, if haunting us is your idea of having fun, it ain’t funny!

579
00:40:32,623 --> 00:40:33,813
Home!
