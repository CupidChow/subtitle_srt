00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,949

Peach.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,300
Is Pangpang being possessed or something?

4
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:10,031
When I see ghosts,

5
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:11,074
I only see them.

6
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,922
I never hear what they’re saying.

7
00:00:13,457 --> 00:00:14,607
Is she gone?

8
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,807
It looks like she was happy in the end.

9
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,620
It’s mission complete!

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,619
I guess not all rich people are evil.

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,665
Which resident orders takeout so late in the night?

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,810
You can leave the food on the delivery table over there.

16
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:09,300
Hey.

17
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,105

We haven’t paid her?

75
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:44,377
- What about the money we got from Home? - Rent, rent, rent!

76
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,207
I already spent it on the necessities.

77
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,834
You know, like makeup and vitamins…

78
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,834
- You call those “necessities”? - Open the door, or else…

79
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,200

Peach?

81
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,368
And that’s why you’re here asking for my help?

82
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:44,911
Yep.

83
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:47,422
You have so many houses, Home.

84
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:51,509
Can you please let Peach and me crash at one for a bit?

Yeah.

I did call you that.

00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:07,007
Sorry.

90
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:15,090
Are you saying you realize now that I am a nice, kind, and generous guy?

91
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:19,346
Yes.

92
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:20,921
You are nice.

93
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:21,933
You are kind.

94
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,117
And generous as heck.

95
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,853
Also handsome, good-looking,

96
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,768
with a mouth that doesn’t run, like yours.

97
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,404
Well, one thing to ask yourself…

98
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,885
Would good people speak the way you do?

99
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:34,943
Hey, you wanna go or what?

100
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:35,804
Mr. Home.

101
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:38,631
Why don’t you just let Mr. Peach and Ms. Pangpang know?

102
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,263
Let us know about what?

103
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:46,105
Mr. Home has already set up an office for our company.

104
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,508
It will be where you two live from now on as well.

105
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,441
Oh, Home, you really are generous!

106
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:57,103
But where is this place?

107
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:11,266
Home, you sure this isn’t a mistake or something?

108
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,985
Is this really where you want to set up our office?

109
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:15,214
It is.

110
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:16,597
Think about it.

111
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,204
It’s pretty cool to have a bar for an office, right?

112
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:30,214
Look at the state of this place.

113
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:33,663
Forget an office. This can hardly be lived in.

114
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:34,514
Suradech.

115
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,804
There you have it, a nice place to crash.

116
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:44,937
Allow me to begin elaborating on your contract.

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,451
This is the employment contract between Mr. Home and you, Mr. Peach,

118
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:54,416
for the Vimarnsukman Ghost-Hunting Company Un… Limited.

119
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,017
Best name ever.

120
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,385
I’ve written this contract per Mr. Home’s request.

121
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:07,506
In brief, your duty is to exorcise ghosts from all of Mr. Home’s properties.

122
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:10,405
Please read through the contract thoroughly for the details.

123
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:12,422
No need.

124
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,278
Trust is fundamental in business partners, right?

125
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:16,703
We’re signing.

126
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,108
You fools!

127
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:31,644
The contract says you’ll only get 1% of all the properties sold.

128
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:32,703
- 1%? - 1%?

129
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,100
Stupid!

130
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:37,714
It is an estimate of 1.2 million baht.

131
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:42,505
Oh.

132
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:44,828
That’s a lot!

133
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:46,342
Peach, we’re rich!

134
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:47,746
It is a lot, right?

135
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:48,333
It is!

136
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:49,810
You think 1% is a lot?

137
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:56,474
The contract also states that you two must work on Mr. Home’s terms.

138
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,619
For example,

139
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:00,816
Mr. Home can make you perform exorcism at any hours

140
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,961
and he can also tell you to do whatever he wants you to do.

141
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,408
She’s right.

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,262
“Violation of this contract will result in the cut in your paychecks.”

143
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,825
What the hell?

144
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:15,622
This isn’t fair.

145
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:18,312
Look who’s laughing now.

146
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,185
And the first thing I want you to do is…

147
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:31,506
What?

148
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,420
Don’t be ridiculous.

149
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:36,306
I’m not doing it.

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,762
If you don’t, you won’t get your full paycheck.

151
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:42,717
Go ahead.

152
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,164
If you’re gonna be so demanding,

153
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,148
go ahead and do that.

154
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,349
Because I won’t do it even over my dead bo—

155
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:00,294
Peach.

156
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,641
Do your best.

157
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:09,370
Alright.

158
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:11,462
Let’s talk business.

159
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,309
The next location for our ghost-hunting is a special, wowza, awesome place.

160
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,602
You say that about every place.

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,817
The ghost we need to exorcise only comes out

162
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,666
when it rains, like right now.

163
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,779
Come on, Peach!

164
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,300
Why are you so clumsy?

165
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,402
Now we need to reshoot that.

166
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,626
I’m here to exorcise ghosts, not walk the runway.

167
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:00,613
It’s for PR.

168
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:01,909
Stop being clumsy for a sec.

169
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:03,958
Please just hurry and get inside.

170
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:17,465
This apartment building belongs to the Vimarnsukman family.

171
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,379
Mr. Home currently holds the sole ownership of this place.

172
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,251
Home.

173
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:28,210
What did you mean when you said the ghost only comes out when it rains?

174
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:33,465
There was an incident with a delivery rider on one rainy night…

175
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,399
where a traffic accident decapitated the rider and killed him on the spot.

176
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,250
(GRIMLY DECAPITATED)
where a traffic accident decapitated the rider and killed him on the spot.

where a traffic accident decapitated the rider and killed him on the spot.

179
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:40,370
(AUGUST 30)

180
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:44,007
Soon after, residents started reporting complaints

181
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,314
about knocking on doors when no one was there.

182
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,608
Some claimed they saw mud-stained footprints when no one walked by.

183
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:59,223
Worst of all, some even claimed they saw the headless rider here.

184
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,214
All of these only happened on rainy days.

185
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:05,617
That’s spooky.

186
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,382
This sounds like it comes straight out of G-Host Radio.

187
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,511
Since the rumor of this ghost story started,

188
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:12,524
nearly all the residents have been moving out of here

189
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,908
even though all of this could have been a kind of mass hysteria.

190
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:20,108
You still don’t believe in ghosts after all this time?

191
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,111
I must be honest.

192
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,826
I do not get easily startled.

193
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:26,099
Especially when it comes to ghost stories,

194
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,585
I simply do not— Holy moly!

195
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,254
And you said you weren’t easily spooked.

196
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,629
I’m not afraid of ghosts.

197
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,980
It was just that your face scared me, Ms. Pangpang.

198
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,057
Harsh.

199
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,801
Excuse me, but I’ll be working in the car.

200
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:42,500
Oh, come on.

201
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:44,290
By the way, Home,

202
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,920
do we have to wait until it rains to exorcise this ghost?

203
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,651
Do not worry.

204
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,420
I’ve already got a solution.

205
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,773
Mega clever.

206
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,377
What a genius I am.

207
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:05,413
Don’t be ridiculous.

208
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:07,506
Unlike you, this ghost isn’t an idiot.

209
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,573
Can’t disagree with that.

210
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,071
Who’s that?

211
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:42,943
Peach.

212
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:44,229
Go check it out.

213
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,565
Why me?

214
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,690
Did you forget what’s written in the contract?

215
00:12:58,425 --> 00:12:59,614
That demanding rich brat…

216
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,869
I pray every day that I don’t ever see him again in this life or next—

217
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,025
Pang!

218
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,650
What?

219
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:23,914
Is the rider ghost here?

220
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,056
Let’s get cooking.

221
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,871
He’s here!

222
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,118
What should we do?

223
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:55,400
Everything’s in the car.

224
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,306
What?

225
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,515
You left all the cooking equipment in the car?

226
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,511
No. I’m going to spill it.

227
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:14,604
That’s it?

228
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,041
Stop complaining when I’ve already come up with a solution!

229
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,512
Can you two please hold it with the bantering.

230
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:21,413
Peach.

231
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:23,208
Where’s the ghost?

232
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:29,760
Stop shaking before you spill everything.

233
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,213
No one’ll get to drink that, ghost or otherwise.

234
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,697
We just need to hand it to him, right? I’ll go.

235
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,457
Where is he?

236
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:56,373
Home.

237
00:14:58,414 --> 00:14:59,268
Higher.

238
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,219
Too high!

239
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,774
Come on, Peach.

240
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:06,380
Where exactly is this ghost’s mouth?

241
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,911
Peach. Peach. Peach!

242
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,162
This is no time for that!

243
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:17,536
Where’s he gone?

244
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,317
Peach! Get it together!

245
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:21,404
Where is the ghost now?

246
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,503
The ghost… where is he?

247
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:24,937
He was over there just now.

248
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,111
Ghost-hunting. What nonsense is this?

249
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:43,177
They’re just a bunch of delusional people.

250
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:51,161
What’s going on?

251
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,229
What did you run away from now?

252
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,696
- The rider ghost! - The rider ghost!

253
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:56,688
Peach, did the ghost follow us?

254
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:57,802
Wait.

255
00:15:58,308 --> 00:15:59,010
Where is he?

256
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,328
Crap!

257
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:12,309
He’s got a motorcycle!

258
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,958
What is he, Ghost Rider?

259
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:18,817
Home, let’s get away from here.

260
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:19,920
He’s coming our way.

261
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,503
I don’t drive myself.

262
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:23,990
This is no time to be acting like a typical rich brat!

263
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,045
Start driving! He’s heading right into us!

264
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:29,515
Home!

265
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,647
Where has he gone?

266
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:02,102
- Suradech! - Suradech!

267
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,216
I can’t believe...

268
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:15,871
you’re all in this condition just because of some ghost story.

269
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:18,760
Girl, you screamed louder than any of us.

270
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,711
I was simply startled by your scream, Ms. Pangpang.

271
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,908
I told you I don’t believe in— Holy moly!

272
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,789
I’m just a rider with a delivery.

273
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,291
I am aware.

274
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:34,622
I was just startled by a stranger.

275
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,014
We get it, sis.

276
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:38,324
Thank you.

277
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,414
Peach, we’ll finally get to cook on a gas burner now.

278
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:50,380
Hold it.

279
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,140
Who said you can use gas burners here?

280
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,564
What’d you do if you accidentally burned this place down?

281
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,872
How else would we cook, then?

282
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,776
Just order takeouts.

283
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:05,585
New rule added: No gas burners in the building.

284
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,965
Just use the microwave.

285
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:07,826
Understand?

286
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:10,509
This place isn’t just your office, you know?

287
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:11,979
We live here.

288
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:14,814
It’s hard enough as it is, living here.

289
00:18:14,897 --> 00:18:16,782
Now you won’t let us cook?

290
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:17,576
What’s the big deal?

291
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,908
I’ve never cooked a single meal in my life and I’m alright.

292
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,905
It’s not alright.

293
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,957
We need to eat.

294
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,365
What’s your problem?

295
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,711
I told you to order takeouts!

296
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,391
I let you live here rent-free, you know?

297
00:18:27,444 --> 00:18:29,004
Okay, okay.

298
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:31,752
We’ll stick to just the microwave.

299
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,004
Since we’re all here,

300
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,880
shall we throw a little party to celebrate our company’s grand opening?

301
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,082
Just do whatever you want.

302
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:43,976
I’m going home.

303
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,863
What’s even so good about cooking?

304
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,463
Takeouts are so much better and easier.

305
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:17,893
How do I finish all this by myself?

306
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,413
Gramps, let’s share.

307
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:32,242
Good thing I’m used to being alone.

308
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:34,780
Eating alone never makes me lonely anyway.

309
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,084
I said I’m not lonely, Gramps…

310
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:11,162
As expected of a former chef.

311
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:13,918
You can even cook with just a microwave.

312
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:17,914
Oh?

313
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:19,077
Home?

314
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,025
What are you doing here so late?

315
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:28,370
Don’t tell me you’re too scared to sleep alone.

316
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:29,413
Me? Scared?

317
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:33,080
I’m just here to discuss how we can defeat the rider ghost.

318
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,508
Well, you gotta discuss it with my brother here for now.

319
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,204
I’m going to go take a shower real quick.

320
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,757
Why didn’t you just order something nice?

321
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,699
Why would you choose to struggle with a microwave?

322
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:02,271
How stubborn can you be?

323
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,871
I’m not being stubborn.

324
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,102
I’m just following the rule set by the guy who owns this place.

325
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
Right…

326
00:21:14,195 --> 00:21:16,653
What are you making, though?

327
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:19,177
Stir fried noodles with basil.

328
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:20,586
Damn!

329
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,324
What are you, Gordon Ramsay?

330
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:24,277
It isn’t even that hard to make.

331
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:35,165
You keep telling me to order takeouts.

332
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:37,918
Have you really never cooked for yourself?

333
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,300
Forgetting cooking for myself,

334
00:21:41,774 --> 00:21:44,105
I hardly ever even eat at home.

335
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,666
Ever since my parents passed away,

336
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:49,974
I’ve only ever been dining out.

337
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:51,888
Rich brat.

338
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,428
Obviously?

339
00:21:56,551 --> 00:22:00,414
But honestly, I just don’t want to eat all alone at home.

340
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:04,108
At least there are people around when I eat outside.

341
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,237
Wash that.

342
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:17,265
Me?

343
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:32,539
Where’s the soap?

344
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:34,997
You don’t need that.

345
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,164
Clean water is good enough.

346
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,776
I’ve never done it before, you know?

347
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,983
By the way,

348
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,207
who do you think the rider ghost was delivering something to?

349
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:55,601
I’m not sure.

350
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:58,352
But when he showed up,

351
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,840
I saw a brown paper bag and a rose in this hand.

352
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,829
It must have been something really important

353
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:09,511
if he’s still dead set on delivering it even now.

354
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:15,109
Maybe, if we deliver it for him,

355
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:16,915
he can finally cross over.

356
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,127
I bet he was trying to hit on a girl.

357
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:21,179
Are you saying that because there’s a rose?

358
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,911
But who else could have been the recipient if it wasn’t…

359
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,783
- A resident. - A resident.

360
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:37,739
Hey, Kan.

361
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:40,211
Can you get something for me?

362
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,807
No.

363
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:44,792
The residents’ profiles are confidential.

364
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,764
The apartment may be managed by the Vimarnsukman family,

365
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,912
but I cannot disclose the information to just anybody.

366
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:53,728
This is a request from Mr. Home, the owner of that building.

367
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:55,176
He’s not just anybody.

368
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:57,115
Mr. Home may own the place,

369
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,265
but it’s someone else I don’t trust.

370
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,379
I’m talking specifically about the employees he’s hiring.

371
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,571
What should I tell Mr. Home, then?

372
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,617
Should I tell him you’re withholding information from him?

373
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:10,390
Ms. Kan!

374
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:11,914
What are you talking about?

375
00:24:19,477 --> 00:24:23,977
Ms. Kan is asking me to disclose the profiles of Vimarnsukman’s residents.

376
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:28,571
If it’s just that,

377
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:31,705
then it’s no big deal at all, Mr. Yai.

378
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,613
Ms. Kan.

379
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:38,917
Just come straight to me next time you need anything.

380
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:40,954
Thank you, Mr. Somkid.

381
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:44,377
Well, then, follow me.

382
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,220
Mr. Somkid, Mr. Putchong is here to see you.

383
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:50,878
Is he?

384
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,222
Let’s go meet him, shall we?

385
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:10,779
These are the profiles of all former and current residents.

386
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:13,368
As for the last order on the rider’s delivery history,

387
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:15,814
there was no recipient in the record.

388
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:20,035
Your hypothesis that his last delivery could be a personal delivery

389
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,182
is very likely to be true.

390
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,776
Bullseye!

391
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:24,472
Good job, big bro.

392
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,579
According to the history from the delivery company our rider worked for,

393
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:31,179
the last order was from a fried pork restaurant.

394
00:25:31,595 --> 00:25:34,200
The order was a customized dish that wasn’t on the menu.

395
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,802
He was obviously trying to hit on a girl.

396
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:38,068
Let’s get on with our plan.

397
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,216
We’ve called every woman on the list.

398
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,210
No one knows this rider guy.

399
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:10,117
Home, are you sure about this?

400
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:15,011
If our rider ghost wasn’t hitting on some resident,

401
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:17,302
why would he hang around here even now?

402
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:23,980
Maybe there’s still something we haven’t found out.

403
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,690
(GRIMLY DECAPITATED)

404
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,810
(AUGUST 30)

405
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,081
What are you looking for, Mr. Peach?

406
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,038
There’s this one profile that sticks out to me.

407
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,309
It’s this one.

408
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,771
Are you sure about this, Peach?

409
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,505
It just seems strange.

410
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:50,808
I don’t know.

411
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:52,914
It’s a gut feeling.

412
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,625
Should we try contacting them?

413
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:22,675
Excuse me.

414
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:25,303
Are you Tarnsai?

415
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,118
Yes.

416
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,390
Please take a look at this, Tarnsai.

417
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,468
This is Ride.

418
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,040
I remember him.

419
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,568
He’s my boyfriend.

420
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,511
Really?

421
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,373
Kidding!

422
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,970
I’m just being delulu.

423
00:27:57,225 --> 00:28:03,008
But I used to think of him as my only family.

424
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:14,099
(I always get off work late.)

425
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,002
(So I always order takeout for dinner.)

426
00:28:17,952 --> 00:28:21,768
(But it was raining really hard one night,)

427
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:23,872
(and no one would take my order.)

428
00:28:28,102 --> 00:28:30,925
(Only Ride accepted it.)

429
00:28:30,949 --> 00:28:31,820
Your order, ma’am.

430
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,105
Oh, thank you.

431
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:36,149
It’s been raining.

432
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,214
Are you cold?

433
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,065
Wait here for a minute.

434
00:28:45,872 --> 00:28:46,660
Here.

435
00:28:47,054 --> 00:28:48,031
To warm you up.

436
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:57,752
Thank you.

437
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:05,804
(I’m not even going to deny that I like his face.)

438
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:13,023
(After that, I was always waiting to see him.)

439
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:17,869
Oh.

440
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:19,256
Your order.

441
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:20,170
Thank you.

442
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:35,880
Here.

443
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,269
It’s your dinner.

444
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:47,106
Are you sure it’s okay to give it to me?

445
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:49,671
I ordered too much.

446
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,964
I wouldn’t be able to finish it all by myself anyway.

447
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:53,103
It’s from my favorite fried pork place.

448
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,048
I can confirm that it’s the best.

449
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:56,451
Try it.

450
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:04,506
It’s really good.

451
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:05,463
Told you.

452
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:06,659
Can I have your number?

453
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,617
I mean…

454
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:14,520
So I can call you up when I need something delivered.

455
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:15,579
That’s all.

456
00:30:22,302 --> 00:30:23,724
Okay.

457
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:33,272
(After that, he became my go-to delivery man.)

458
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:44,872
(I always ordered more food than I needed)

459
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,026
(just in case he’d share it with me.)

460
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:47,903
Good luck with work.

461
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,508
(When I got to spend more time with him, I…)

462
00:30:56,525 --> 00:31:00,340
(actually fell in love with him and wanted to let him know.)

463
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:01,911
I like you.

464
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:09,871
I’m kidding.

465
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,567
Oh, look at how serious your face is.

466
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,859
It’s just a joke.

467
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:20,014
Uhh, I… should probably go.

468
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,517
(I said I was kidding,...

469
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,977
but I think he knew the sentiment was real.)

470
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:35,622
Soon after that, I moved out.

471
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:37,811
I just had enough money to buy a secondhand house.

472
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:42,035
It was a shame I never got to see him again.

473
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:44,616
I wonder how he’s doing now.

474
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,407
If you said that…

475
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:57,771
You don’t know what happened to him, do you?

476
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:00,995
What happened to him?

477
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,760
Actually…

478
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,925
He’s dead.

479
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:20,109
We think he died on a very important day to him.

480
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,702
I’m not making this weird order again, you hear me?

481
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,017
Thank you so much, sir.

482
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,487
Son.

483
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:48,705
Be careful, alright?

484
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:49,635
It’s going to rain soon.

485
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,604
Yessir!

486
00:33:04,762 --> 00:33:09,002
He died on August 30.

487
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,512
That’s…

488
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:16,405
your birthday, isn’t it?

489
00:33:23,671 --> 00:33:25,410
We’re really sorry for your loss, Tarnsai.

490
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:42,668
We tracked down the restaurant

491
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:47,029
and begged them to make the same order again.

492
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:54,063
This was supposed to be his birthday present to you, Tarnsai.

493
00:33:57,278 --> 00:33:58,420
Birthday present?

494
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:03,840
Well… Whatever’s fine.

495
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,903
I’ll be happy as long as it’s from you, Ride.

496
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:07,703
Be serious.

497
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:09,703
What do you want?

498
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,607
What I really want is a house.

499
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,266
I’m tired of paying rent.

500
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:23,111
When I finally have my own house,

501
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,008
I’ll ask you to come live with me.

502
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:13,271
He’s here.

503
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,219
It’s too bad…

504
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,115
Ride should have been here to share this with me.

505
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,010
How is it, Peach?

506
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:40,780
Yeah… I think he’s okay now.

507
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,278
It was a pity for Tarnsai.

508
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,823
She never got a chance to go out with our rider.

509
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,210
Not at all.

510
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:07,862
At one point in time, they were a family to each other.

511
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:13,874
This place might look a little old,

512
00:37:13,957 --> 00:37:18,056
but I reassure you that it will be renovated like it’s all new.

513
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,210
(OMG! HOME!)
More importantly, this place is safe to live in

514
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:19,238
More importantly, this place is safe to live in

515
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,449
(SELL HOUSES, NO. SELL HIS CUTE FACE, YES.)
More importantly, this place is safe to live in

516
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:20,811
More importantly, this place is safe to live in

517
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:24,244
and is 100% guaranteed ghost-free!

518
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:25,912
Am I right, Exorcist Peach?

519
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,650
(THEY’RE ON GOOD TERMS NOW.)

520
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,316
(ATTORNEY KAN AND HER PERPETUAL FROWN.)

521
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:32,102
That is so fabulous!
(ATTORNEY KAN AND HER PERPETUAL FROWN.)

522
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:32,290
(ATTORNEY KAN AND HER PERPETUAL FROWN.)

523
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,411
(GOOD GIRL PANGPANG)

524
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:33,529
I give that 50 Pangs!
(GOOD GIRL PANGPANG)

525
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:33,560
I give that 50 Pangs!

526
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:35,978
(HOW MANY PANGS?)
I give that 50 Pangs!

527
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:36,730
(HOW MANY PANGS?)

528
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:39,954
Don’t hesitate to contact us if you’re interested.

529
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,001
Bye.

530
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,374
Finally!

531
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:46,434
I’m so tired and hungry.

532
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,762
You’re so right.

533
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,508
I’m very hungry.

534
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,841
Suradech, let’s go home.

535
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,173
Oh?

536
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:56,973
He’s going home?

537
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:58,715
I was just about to ask him over for a party.

538
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:02,380
It’s alright.

539
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:04,407
I’ve still got Kan.

540
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:07,014
Wanna have a party with me, girl?

541
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:12,734
Din-din-din-din-din-din-dinner time.

542
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:14,659
Dinner time.

543
00:38:15,112 --> 00:38:16,620
Dinner time.

544
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:18,502
Dinner time.

545
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,675
Dinner time.

546
00:38:20,954 --> 00:38:23,151
Dinner time…

547
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:46,780
It’s the magic of the microwave, guys.

548
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:50,711
Thank you for all the tips on how to cook rice in a microwave.

549
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,614
You’re good.

550
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:53,782
That’s not an easy feat.

551
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:59,105
How about I let you take care of cooking with a microwave from now on?

552
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:04,234
I hereby declare myself the Chief of the Microwave Department.

553
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:07,654
That isn’t a thing, the Microwave Department.

554
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,477
Will you two really insist on struggling with cooking with a microwave?

555
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,503
I… bought too much food.

556
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:29,330
I can’t finish it all so I’m here to share.

557
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:30,872
What a coincidence.

558
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:34,108
Peach also made enough food just for you, Home.

559
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,509
What?

560
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:37,303
Who said I made it just for him?

561
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,586
The four plates of rice would disagree.

562
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:44,672
In case someone needs seconds.

563
00:39:44,736 --> 00:39:47,980
I see.

564
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,428
Hey, I have something I want to ask you.

565
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:55,711
Do you guys want to move somewhere else?

566
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:58,573
I have better houses.

567
00:39:58,844 --> 00:40:00,108
I’ll have Kan take care of it.

568
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:05,001
I don’t really like this place.

569
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:07,179
It’s dark and dusty.

570
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:09,042
It doesn’t have a kitchen.

571
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:11,013
Living here is a task in and of itself.

572
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:16,011
But for some reason,

573
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:19,920
I feel like no ghosts will ever disturb me here.

574
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,850
(RESERVED FOR HOME)

575
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,940
I guess that’s settled, then, Dad.

576
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:39,408
Well, then, we’ll sell it.

577
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:41,308
Gramps.

578
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,921
If you don’t want this place anymore, will you give it to me?

579
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:47,982
This place has so many toys in it.

580
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:49,180
I like it.

581
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:53,007
Will you, Gramps?

582
00:40:53,595 --> 00:40:54,801
Will you?

583
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:56,709
If you give it to me,

584
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:59,407
I’ll bring so many friends over to play every day.

585
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,918
What’s the magic word?

586
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,044
Ya-ya-ya.

587
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:06,542
Yi-yi-yi.

588
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,066
Yu-yu-yu.

589
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:09,847
Gramps does laundry.

590
00:41:09,914 --> 00:41:11,312
Uncle is hairy.

591
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:14,383
We share candy, then brush our teeth.

592
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,976
The magic word for Home is…

593
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:19,522
Please!

594
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:25,536
Alright.

595
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:28,826
Write your name on it.

596
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:31,989
I won’t let anyone touch this place.

597
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:33,302
I promise.

598
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:35,721
Thank you, Gramps.

599
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,010
(RESERVED FOR HOME)

600
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:55,512
So you guys are okay with living here?

601
00:41:58,133 --> 00:41:59,608
Yeah, we are.

602
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:03,364
Well, then, come on in, Suradech.

603
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,702
I said no gas burners.

604
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,712
I didn’t say anything about electric stoves.

605
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:20,029
Is that why you’re acting all cool right now?

606
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:22,309
I’m not acting cool.

607
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:24,902
I’m just being a generous boss.

608
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:29,533
Does that mean no more cooking with a microwave?

609
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:30,891
No way!

610
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:33,632
I just got promoted to the Chief of the Microwave Department!

611
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:35,392
That department is never a thing.

612
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,324
Since we’re all together,

613
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:43,711
shall we celebrate our grand opening day?

614
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:44,511
We shall!

615
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:45,551
Yeah!

616
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,592
Come on, Home. Stay for dinner.

617
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,610
(CAUTION! UNEVEN SURFACE)

618
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,848
Wow!

619
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:02,902
Thank you for the meal.

620
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,269
Eat a lot and grow strong, Home.

621
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:08,007
Now that I look at it,

622
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:13,865
we kinda look like a family, don’t you think?

623
00:43:16,924 --> 00:43:19,128
Kan is the eldest daughter.

624
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:21,582
Pangpang is the baby.

625
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,656
Home is the father.

626
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:25,791
Peach is the mother.

627
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:28,106
And Suradech is…

628
00:43:30,017 --> 00:43:31,626
Suradech.

629
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:32,509
See?

630
00:43:32,525 --> 00:43:33,748
We’re like a family.

631
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:37,845
- No way! - No way!

632
00:43:37,976 --> 00:43:39,426
- Who’d want to be this jerk’s family? - Who’d want to be this jerk’s family?

633
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,850
And by the way, I do everything around here.

634
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:42,960
I should get to be the father.

635
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:44,207
Nah, you’re the mother.

636
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:45,130
You cook.

637
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,909
Oh, shut it with your last century family roles.

638
00:43:46,942 --> 00:43:48,823
Everyone’s equal now.

639
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,299
Well, Pangpang said I’m the father so I’m the father.

640
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:52,216
Fine. No food for you.

641
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,299
Peach, give that back!

642
00:43:54,336 --> 00:43:54,911
I made it!

643
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:55,765
Don’t be immature!

644
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:04,314
Are we really going to let them do as they please,

645
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:07,703
especially when it comes to anything to do with the Vimarnsukman family?

646
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:11,709
If we let them gain access to more information,

647
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,411
it’s going to be dangerous.

648
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:18,451
We can’t stop these kids.

649
00:44:19,096 --> 00:44:20,616
That will only add more fuel to the fire.

650
00:44:21,281 --> 00:44:25,179
Letting them do what they want under our close supervision…

651
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,305
That’s better.

652
00:44:28,514 --> 00:44:29,213
Don’t you think?

653
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:44,155
The next property we aim to sell

654
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,985
is simply very haunted.

655
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,980
It’s obviously scary.

656
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,511
You must be crushed under the negative energy, right, Peach?

657
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:53,617
I don’t feel anything.

658
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:03,656
Get out!

659
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:04,503
Get out!

660
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:05,506
Get out!

661
00:45:05,734 --> 00:45:06,882
Get out!

662
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:07,857
Get out!
