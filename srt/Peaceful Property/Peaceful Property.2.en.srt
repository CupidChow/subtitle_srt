1
00:00:02,358 --> 00:00:04,884
I don’t know what technology you used to make this video,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,457
but spreading that kind of rumor

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:08,597
affects the properties I’m about to sell.

4
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:09,783
You have to take responsibility for that.

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,336
You want me to exorcise that ghost or something?

6
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:13,442
This house you helped build…

7
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:15,245
It’s beautiful.

8
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:19,290
You must want to make some money and buy a nice house.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,210
Why don’t we work together as a team?

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,220
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

11
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,151
We hereby invite the spirit
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

12
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:33,469
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,898
residing in this wig factory
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

14
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:35,970
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

15
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:39,757
to take control of this glass.

16
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:41,980
Make your presence known

17
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:45,711
and we shall communicate.

18
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:59,022
What the hell kind of board game of yours is this?

19
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,592
And what idiot dies in a wig factory anyway?

20
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:05,505
You clearly never heard of the vengeful ghost of the girl

21
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:07,611
who was the reason they had to shut this place down.

22
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,601
Everyone swears she’s evil.

23
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:12,235
I think we should leave.

24
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,170
Like hell I will!

25
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:17,306
I have to prove to you that this factory really is haunted.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,456
(A)

27
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:21,867
I hardly finished my sentence, man!
(A)

28
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:22,290
(A)

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,170
(AM)

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,407
(AM E)

31
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:25,176
What the hell?
(AM E)

32
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:26,785
What?

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,268
(AM ERE.)

34
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:33,576
“...Am ’ere?”
(AM ERE.)

35
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:34,543
(AM ERE.)

36
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:34,568
I told you!
(AM ERE.)

37
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:35,398
I told you!

38
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,764
It’s really the ghost of that girl!

39
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,386
Oh, stop it.

40
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:40,509
Your arm is clearly shaking with the effort it takes to move the glass.

41
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:41,743
This ain’t fun.

42
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:42,644
You scared me there.

43
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:46,788
Ju, what the hell are you playing now?

44
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:47,730
I–I’m not doing anything!

45
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:48,733
Is it you, Tan?

46
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:50,217
It’s not me.

47
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:53,380
Ju, you!

48
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,677
What’s your name?

49
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,308
R-A-K.

50
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,103
Rak…?

51
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,297
As in “lovely”?

52
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,743
J–Ju, freaking stop messing with us!

53
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,702
It’s not me!

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,788
Are you doing this, Tan?

55
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:16,305
“My.”

56
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:18,482
“Take.”

57
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:19,831
“Die.”

58
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,210
Dude, how do you read so fast?

59
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,111
“My. Take. Die.”

60
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,312
Wait. Hold on!

61
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,047
Let me at least see this with my own two eyes.

62
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:42,903
I can’t do this.

63
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:58,201
Ju, the hell?

64
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,505
This is no time to be playing with a wig, dude.

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,730
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

66
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:01,822
As a team?

67
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,204
As a team of what?

68
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,463
As a team of fried-rice or whatever exorcists, like you did.

69
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:11,008
I saw with my own eyes how you exorcised that ghost.

70
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:12,216
Are you out of your mind?

71
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,068
All I can do is see ghosts.

72
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:17,813
What happened with that construction worker ghost was just a coincidence.

73
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,400
Hey, I came all the way here with a job offer and loads of money, you know?

74
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:27,315
Who would want to work with you?

75
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:29,315
Get your foot off of my bed right now.

76
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:31,468
I’m sorry, man.

77
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:33,112
I honestly thought this was a rug.

78
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,998
Will you just consider it?

79
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,373
If you exorcise ghosts for me,

80
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:42,103
once the property is sold,

81
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:45,688
I’ll pay you right away.

82
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,308
Just the thought of working with you makes me shudder.

83
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,905
I happened to overhear the conversation…

84
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:59,272
When you said you’d pay us,

85
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,080
how much are we talking about here?

86
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:06,302
That’s something we can negotiate later.

87
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,668
The first gig will be a trial run so you gotta do it for free.

88
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,050
You’re going straight to taking advantage of me.

89
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,007
It’d be a waste of my time if I couldn’t exorcise the ghost, right?

90
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:18,576
Let’s all calm down.

91
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:21,311
Will you let us consult among ourselves for a bit?

92
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:23,314
Can you…?

93
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,613
Peach, just do it.

94
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:31,709
No way.

95
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,143
There’s no way I’d ever work with such a selfish jerk.

96
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,647
Who does he think he is, just slapping us with money?

97
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:39,234
I heard that.

98
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:48,921
Peach.

99
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,337
But we do need that money.

100
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,700
You know how broke we are right now.

101
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:53,666
Just do it.

102
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,134
One more thing, if this gig actually flies,

103
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,712
money won’t be the only thing we get.

104
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,712
You might even be able to finally cook again.

105
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:04,016
Win-win situation… You know?

106
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,259
Yes!

107
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,909
Oh, my God! It’s so exciting!

108
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:26,005
Finally we’re here at my factory.

109
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,518
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

110
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,807
This is where your trial run will be.
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

111
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:29,490
(BEWARE OF GHOST)

112
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:34,869
Don’t be ridiculous.

113
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,173
There’s nothing here to be scared of.

114
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:37,847
Was your watch not working, sir?

115
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:48,477
Say hello to Attorney Kan.

116
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:51,800
She’s the beautiful lawyer who’s working as a secretary for me.

117
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:53,974
You are one hour and 27 minutes late.

118
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,210
If I have to get off work late today,

119
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,774
I am eligible for overtime according to the Labor Protection Act.

120
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,537
No problem, baby.

121
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,537
You know I got the dough.

122
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,745
Do you remember Article 397?

123
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,410
Do not make me repeat myself.

124
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,770
Vicious.

125
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:15,420
You two must be…

126
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:20,376
the exorcist siblings, Mr. Peach and Ms. Pang.

127
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,700
I go by Pangpang now!

128
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,395
Your assistant sure takes her work and colleagues seriously.

129
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:32,884
She even knows my old name.

130
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:37,106
It is my duty to make sure you are not scammers.

131
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,354
Shall we begin?

132
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,080
Come on.

133
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:44,549
Come.

134
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,785
Hello!

135
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:10,066
This wig factory belongs to the Vimarnsukman family.

136
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,511
It was very prosperous ten years ago.

137
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,013
A rumor broke out one day that this place is haunted.

138
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:22,933
All the employees quit.

139
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,508
There was no other choice but to shut the place down.

140
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,579
Let’s get down to business, shall we?

141
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,208
What does this ghost look like?

142
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:34,560
The alleged witnesses claimed that

143
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,106
their friend suddenly started acting strange

144
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:38,822
by putting on a wig,

145
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:40,705
touching the hair,

146
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:42,478
and weeping.

147
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,291
Oh, my God.

148
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,106
Is the wig haunted?

149
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:50,122
I believe it was all content for social media.

150
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:56,127
Peach, what’s wrong?

151
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:58,034
I think we should go.

152
00:08:58,214 --> 00:08:59,434
This place feels weird.

153
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,411
Peach, since you’ve already come,

154
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,300
you might as well wait to see if there really is a ghost here.

155
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:05,208
Oh, there’s definitely a ghost in a place like this.

156
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:06,502
I don’t have to wait to see one to know that.

157
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:07,805
Wait to see what?

158
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:17,733
I’m so sorry.

159
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,411
I’m really sorry.

160
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,090
But… who are you?

161
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,223
I’m Pan.

162
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:33,309
I’m the expert on this Rak ghost.

163
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,908
You guys must be here on a dare.

164
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,404
May I interest you in my ghost-hunting kits?

165
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,170
I’ve got loads!

166
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,505
I just want to know what Rak was like when she was alive?

167
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:55,099
Well, it’s been a long time.

168
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:56,251
I can’t really remember much.

169
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:59,785
My business hasn’t been doing very well lately as well…

170
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,576
Four ghost-hunting kits, please.

171
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:03,847
Oh, I remember it now.

172
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:08,282
Rak used to work here in this factory.

173
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:12,278
When she was alive, she was so freaking lazy.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,610
She barely did her job, and she had a tendency to steal.

175
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,800
When she finally got caught stealing, she was fired.

176
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:24,506
Girl was so sad she died inside that place.

177
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,811
So she stole from Gramps’ company when she was alive,

178
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:30,112
and refuses to let me sell the place now that she’s dead?

179
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,205
We’re not just here on some ghost-hunting mission, sir.

180
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,514
We’re here to exorcise the ghost.

181
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,776
My big brother here is the currently viral exorcist.

182
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,475
Is that so?

183
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:44,397
It is so!

184
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:47,256
How does exorcism work?

185
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:50,814
Well, I’m not so sure.

186
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:53,976
Last time I did it with food.

187
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:56,013
That’s why I want to ask you something.

188
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:58,213
Do you happen to know

189
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,808
what kind of food Rak used to love?

190
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:03,402
What food, huh…

191
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:07,428
Hmm, it’s fading from my memory.

192
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:08,761
It’s been so long.

193
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:09,579
Come on.

194
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:11,370
Just tell us how much you want.

195
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:42,807
Rak’s favorite food was…

196
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,709
Fetch me when the ghost comes out.

197
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:59,100
I’ll be on the phone outside.

198
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:04,162
So that’s it?

199
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:06,059
That’s what Rak likes?

200
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,256
Doesn’t really look all that appetizing.

201
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:08,918
This is what typical Thai sandwiches look like.

202
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:09,840
Have you never seen one?

203
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:13,511
It might not look like much, but it tastes amazing.

204
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:14,786
Do you want to try some, Home?

205
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:15,838
Nope!

206
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:17,768
I don’t think I can stomach such a thing.

207
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:20,906
I didn’t make it for you anyway.

208
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:34,605
Please accept this offering and cross over, Rak.

209
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:46,659
Peach…

210
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,872
Is she here?

211
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,365
What now?

212
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:08,068
Peach.

213
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:11,805
Don’t tell me she’s really here.

214
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:13,828
Hey.

215
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,118
If she’s here, hurry up and tell her to go away.

216
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:23,859
Rak…

217
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,120
I’ve made you some food.

218
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,666
Please accept it and cross over.

219
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:47,760
Open up!

220
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,594
Why do ghosts always do that!

221
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:52,334
Kan, can you hear me?

222
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:54,201
Kan, help!

223
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:55,263
Yes. Goodbye.

224
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:56,805
Help! Can you hear me?

225
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,013
Help!

226
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,407
The ghost is here!

227
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:02,103
Yes?

228
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:03,835
Isn’t that why you are here?

229
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:04,349
Good for you.

230
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:06,168
“Good for you,” my bum!

231
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:08,410
Just hurry up and open the door!

232
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,623
It’s locked from the inside.

233
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:14,595
Unlock it.

234
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:17,357
It’s not us who locked it. It’s the ghost!

235
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:21,259
Open up!

236
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,217
Open!

237
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:27,154
Pang.

238
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,010
- Pang. - What?

239
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:42,540
She really haunts this place good, huh…

240
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:53,731
Open up!

241
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,389
Where are you going?

242
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,468
Run, sis. Run!

243
00:14:58,866 --> 00:14:59,517
Come on!

244
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:20,582
What are you all playing?

245
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:21,579
We’re not playing.

246
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,911
There really is a ghost.

247
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,674
It’s a real ghost, you know?

248
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:26,000
I heard you.

249
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,813
Did you take care of it?

250
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:29,896
Does it look like we did?

251
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,408
Didn’t you see how fast we bolted out of there?

252
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,367
Peach.

253
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:36,487
Why is that ghost so angry?

254
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:38,155
I don’t know.

255
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:43,179
I bet the cheap sandwich you made wasn’t a hit with her.

256
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:47,002
What’s your problem with my sandwich?

257
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,088
You heard her story.

258
00:15:49,096 --> 00:15:49,976
She was a thief in life.

259
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:54,051
She probably never had money to buy what she actually liked.

260
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,208
Maybe we should give her something expensive.

261
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,524
How’d you know she’d want something expensive?

262
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,810
Or is that the attitude rich people like you always have of poor people?

263
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,274
I’m not saying it because I’m rich.

264
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,881
This is all based on facts.

265
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:07,964
You’re the problem.

266
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:10,780
Did you make cheap food because you have to do this gig for free?

267
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:15,029
It was smart of me not to pay in advance.

268
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,546
Just do whatever you want, then!

269
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:17,982
I’m out of here.

270
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,312
It’s not like I need you!

271
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:21,517
Home.

272
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:22,502
Please calm down.

273
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:23,979
I’ll talk to him.

274
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:25,829
Peach!

275
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:26,884
Peach!

276
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,641
What will we do now?

277
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,982
If he won’t do it,

278
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:38,259
then we will.

279
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:43,108
Peach.

280
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:44,383
Peach.

281
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:45,786
Peach.

282
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:47,028
Where are you going?

283
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,014
I’m going home.

284
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:49,712
Will you please calm down?

285
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:52,300
Maybe we can try something else?

286
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,309
What else is there to try?

287
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,362
I’ve tried everything I know.

288
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:01,471
Maybe… Rak really doesn’t like my sandwich.

289
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:09,703
I think we need to get to know her better.

290
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,465
That might help.

291
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,057
You're right.

292
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,072
But where can we even find out more about her?

293
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,367
Are you talking about Rak?

294
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,678
Yummy!

295
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:36,022
Now that’s what a last meal should look like!

296
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:37,505
Am I right, Suradech?

297
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,675
If hiring people doesn’t work,

298
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:42,908
I’ll do it myself.

299
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:43,872
“Do it yourself,” my bum.

300
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,262
It was all Mr. Suradech’s doing.

301
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,970
(RAK)

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,009
(RAK LOVES AKE FOREVER.)

303
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,850
Hey, Rak.
(RAK LOVES AKE FOREVER.)

304
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:12,404
My name’s Home.

305
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:14,715
I own this place.

306
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,471
I’m here with some good food.

307
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:20,611
Have your fill, cross over, and just be reborn or something.

308
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:23,216
R.I.P.

309
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,823
Amen.

310
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:42,518
Suradech, you think this works?

311
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,623
I don’t know, sir.

312
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,309
Peach isn’t here.

313
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:51,706
How’d we know if she crosses over?

314
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,708
I think it’s working!

315
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:05,499
That must be her way of thanking us. Am I right, Suradech?

316
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,290
(DEAR RAK)

317
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,905
Ma’am, did Rak have a boyfriend when she was alive?

318
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,976
Yes.

319
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:47,414
They lived together until the day Rak died.

320
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:53,401
This is Rak?

321
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,297
Her hair’s gorgeous.

322
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:59,536
Rak used to be very beautiful.

323
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:01,177
Everybody loved her.

324
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:05,103
She was a lovely girl and always worked hard.

325
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:07,500
Her boyfriend was a hardworking man, too.

326
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:09,268
That’s nothing like the story we were told, Peach.

327
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:11,109
Because they blamed her for something she didn’t do!

328
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:14,977
There was no way a lovely girl like her would ever stoop to stealing.

329
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:23,037
Boy, please help me clear my daughter’s name.

330
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:26,977
Don’t let them misunderstand her.

331
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:30,370
Don’t let them hate her, please.

332
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:35,634
Pang.

333
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:37,869
Maybe…

334
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:40,970
What Rak really wants right now is

335
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,773
to clear her name of the things she never did.

336
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:48,407
Peach, you’re amazing.

337
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:49,817
I think so, too.

338
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:54,814
Ma’am, I think we should look for whoever started that rumor.

339
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:59,425
All this misunderstanding came from the manager.

340
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:01,340
He fired Rak.

341
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,280
The company never even gave me Rak’s compensation when she died.

342
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:07,912
Oh, even I am shaking with anger for you!

343
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:11,474
Who was this manager?

344
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:38,508
Uncle Kid!

345
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:39,819
What’s with the wig?

346
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:41,819
I’m just trying it on.

347
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,605
I’m going to a reunion soon and the theme is rockstars.

348
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:49,656
Hold on.

349
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,063
What’s with you? Why the long face?

350
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:54,697
I’m just a bit upset.

351
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:55,977
Tired, too.

352
00:21:56,949 --> 00:22:00,871
Our properties really don’t sell because they’re haunted.

353
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:05,191
How about I buy them off of your hands for now?

354
00:22:05,594 --> 00:22:08,303
I’ll just wait until the ghost stories die down and then sell them later.

355
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:11,521
Come on now.

356
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,740
I know you’re just looking to make profits with time.

357
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:16,205
You know me!

358
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:17,611
It’s okay.

359
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,967
I’m still set on selling them right now.

360
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,407
I even hired an exorcist.

361
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:23,361
You did?

362
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,631
That’s great.

363
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:29,308
Nothing great about him, really.

364
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:31,684
He constantly threatens to quit.

365
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,871
Arguing with him gives me such a headache.

366
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,746
Why did you argue with him in the first place?

367
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:40,514
He accused me of having an attitude just because I’m rich.

368
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,274
Isn’t that true, though?

369
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,773
Uncle Kid, you’re supposed to take my side!

370
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:47,069
Okay, okay, okay.

371
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,200
Fine.

372
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:51,712
But honestly,

373
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:53,705
Home, do you think you have an attitude?

374
00:22:58,317 --> 00:22:59,014
Home.

375
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:01,813
Do you even know them?

376
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,149
I think so.

377
00:23:06,614 --> 00:23:08,425
I know how they live.

378
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:11,388
I know where they live.

379
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,211
That’s hardly enough.

380
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,488
Home,

381
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,315
maybe you should try to get to know them better?

382
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,920
Honestly, Peach doesn’t even have a life for me to get to know.

383
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,765
It’s a waste of time coming all the way here.

384
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:52,717
Let’s go home.

385
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:01,811
But if I go home right now,

386
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,266
Uncle Kid would just call me out for not trying again.

387
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,900
Let’s just talk to him and get it over with.

388
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:13,928
Let me get to know you, Peach.

389
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,325
Peach, hurry up.

390
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,275
We’re gonna be late.

391
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:18,712
I’m done.

392
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,819
What are they doing?

393
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:02,383
Holy shit.

394
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:05,004
The more I get to know them, the worse they’ve become.

395
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:11,908
Who are you?

396
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:13,724
Why did you take me here?

397
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,231
What do you want from me?

398
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:18,188
Oh?

399
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:19,312
It’s you guys.

400
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:21,219
Why did you take me here?

401
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,985
Because we knew you wouldn’t come with us willingly if we just asked.

402
00:25:24,785 --> 00:25:25,411
Peach.

403
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,930
Let’s just do it.

404
00:25:36,805 --> 00:25:38,377
Help me!

405
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,440
Somebody!

406
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:41,604
Help!

407
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:42,973
What are you doing?

408
00:25:48,918 --> 00:25:50,829
I knew you people were scammers.

409
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,829
But resorting to murder?

410
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:53,979
What are you talking about?

411
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:56,614
We only want him to ask Rak for forgiveness.

412
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,807
Did you guys have to be so forceful?

413
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:08,402
What did he even do in the first place?

414
00:26:08,995 --> 00:26:11,715
He was the manager who blamed Rak and ruined her name

415
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,514
when she never did any of the things he accused her of.

416
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,170
(MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL)
(MANSAK CHARNVINAI, MANAGER)

417
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,416
I didn’t blame her for anything!

418
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,608
She actually did it!

419
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:24,804
Just stop it.

420
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:26,417
Look.

421
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:29,114
I think Rak only wants justice at this point.

422
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:32,502
Whatever you did to her, just ask for her forgiveness now.

423
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:34,205
Just set her spirit free.

424
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,417
I’m sorry for firing you, Rak.

425
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:48,717
I was just doing my job.

426
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:53,303
But… But you really did steal.

427
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,868
The most expensive wig, no less.

428
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:55,782
Come on.

429
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,245
You still insist on blaming her now?

430
00:26:58,705 --> 00:27:00,792
Can you be more sincere with your apology?

431
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:03,634
This can’t be right.

432
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:06,905
So this Rak ghost just wants money, right?

433
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:08,248
This is all I have on me right now.

434
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:09,720
I’ll bring more if she still needs it.

435
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:12,170
Can you stop it with that attitude?

436
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:13,518
It’s you who has an attitude.

437
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:15,037
What did this manager even do wrong?

438
00:27:15,054 --> 00:27:16,180
He was just doing his job.

439
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:17,309
But Rak didn’t steal anything.

440
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,522
Thieves will always be thieves.

441
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,871
Well, she wasn’t one!

442
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:21,817
- And how did you know that? - I talked to her mother.

443
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,408
- What did she say? - She said Rak didn’t do it.

444
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,777
- And you believe her? - Rak didn’t do it!

445
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:28,623
- How can you be so sure? - Her mother insists.

446
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:30,915
- Will you really believe anything? - I talked—

447
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:40,930
Pang?

448
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:43,453
Pang, what’s wrong?

449
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:48,118
Pang?

450
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:50,757
This isn’t funny.

451
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:09,354
P–Peach.

452
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,674
Is Pangpang being possessed or something?

453
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:29,982
Hey, manager jerk! Save your butt, why don’t you?

454
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:36,995
Peach?

455
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,917
What do I do?

456
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:10,414
Peach, wake up!

457
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:14,448
Peach, Peach.

458
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:16,887
Get it together, man. Get it together!

459
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:18,577
Where is Pang?

460
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,497
She’s being possessed by that Rak ghost, duh!

461
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,164
What should we do?

462
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:26,302
How the hell did we even get here?

463
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,662
What exactly does Rak want?

464
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:31,162
I don’t know.

465
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,357
But…

466
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,115
But what?

467
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:40,142
I think she wants to communicate.

468
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:48,619
What is she saying?

469
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:50,638
I don’t know.

470
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,608
I can only hear bits and pieces.

471
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,019
When I see ghosts,

472
00:29:58,435 --> 00:29:59,862
I only see them.

473
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:01,666
I never hear what they’re saying.

474
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:04,851
But I can see her lips move like this.

475
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:11,810
What are we, playing charades?

476
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,614
How’d we even figure out what she’s saying?

477
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:15,355
You’re freaking useless.

478
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,367
Why are you picking a fight with me!

479
00:30:17,758 --> 00:30:19,351
Not so loud! You’re gonna attract her attention—

480
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:33,903
Don’t come near me!

481
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:48,222
My.

482
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:49,394
Take.

483
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:50,702
Die.

484
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:52,173
Sorry?

485
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,017
Can you please say that again?

486
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:54,897
My.

487
00:30:55,385 --> 00:30:56,472
Take.

488
00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:58,783
Die!

489
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:02,506
Let go!

490
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:07,863
Enough!

491
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:21,068
Pang?

492
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:21,780
Pang!

493
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:23,247
Pang.

494
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,303
Pang.

495
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:26,404
Pang.

496
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,922
Kan, who’s this monk?

497
00:31:29,694 --> 00:31:33,037
This monk… was Rak’s husband.

498
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,890
(RAK)

499
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:49,106
Rak was just an average factory employee,

500
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:50,908
working to make ends meet.

501
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,500
She was poor.

502
00:31:56,078 --> 00:31:57,417
Luck just wasn’t on her side.

503
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:13,041
Oh, it’s you.

504
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,580
No wig in the entire factory measures up to your hair, darling.

505
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:19,290
Oh, Ake, stop it.

506
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:20,813
That’s because my hair is real.

507
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,237
We use real hair to make wigs here, don’t you know?

508
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,400
Is this any time to be flirting with your lover?

509
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:34,717
Anyone seen flirting on company time from now on,

510
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,820
I’ll deduct their pay.

511
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:54,208
The good time didn’t last long.

512
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,730
(STAGE FOUR MELANOMA)

513
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:08,216
Ake.

514
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:13,518
Will you promise me you won’t tell anyone about this?

515
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,228
If the manager finds out,

516
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:21,472
he’s going to fire me.

517
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:37,414
Rak ran out of money soon after starting treatment.

518
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,570
But she continued working,

519
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,709
hoping to receive compensation for her mother when she died.

520
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,482
Just stay home if you’re that sick.

521
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:02,075
That looks scary.

522
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:03,577
- Look at her. - That’s scary.

523
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:07,405
The only thing Rak wanted

524
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,381
(RESERVED)

525
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,314
was her beautiful hair.
(RESERVED)

526
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:17,490
(RESERVED)

527
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,748
So Rak didn’t—

528
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,517
Rak did steal something, didn’t she?

529
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:31,231
The answer is both yes and no.

530
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:46,610
So that’s where the wig went.

531
00:34:49,238 --> 00:34:50,862
You think I wouldn’t find out?

532
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,068
I’m not trying to steal it, sir.

533
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,893
I was just—

534
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:56,822
Liar.

535
00:34:57,877 --> 00:34:59,872
I caught you red-handed with it on your head.

536
00:35:00,805 --> 00:35:03,000
Be thankful I’m not calling the cops on you.

537
00:35:04,222 --> 00:35:05,400
I’m really sorry, sir.

538
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,459
I’m really not trying to steal it.

539
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,911
I just wanted to try it on.

540
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,813
You planned to steal and sell it for yourself, didn’t you?

541
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,703
No, sir.

542
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:16,780
Don’t lie!

543
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,016
Do you know what you get for stealing from the company?

544
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,115
You thief!

545
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:44,712
My hair… is all gone.

546
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:51,788
I just want to take it and try it on

547
00:35:53,032 --> 00:35:54,411
before I die.

548
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,805
Is there anything you can do for her?

549
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,302
I have been ordained as a monk for her soul for many years now.

550
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:15,365
But whether she crosses over or not depends on her will to let go.

551
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,715
There really is nothing else I can do.

552
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:24,105
My. Take. Die.

553
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:32,711
Pang.

554
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:37,008
Will you help me with something?

555
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:06,045
Peach.

556
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:07,802
Are you ready?

557
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:26,822
Rak.

558
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:30,306
I’ve brought you a wig.

559
00:37:32,703 --> 00:37:34,965
It might not be as beautiful as your real hair,

560
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,333
but…

561
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:39,204
Will you please accept it?

562
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,315
Peach…

563
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:50,520
Is she gone?

564
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,171
It looks like she was happy in the end.

565
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:00,120
Thank you.

566
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:11,625
Yes?

567
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:13,865
Yes.

568
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:15,650
Of course.

569
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:17,896
I will send you the details.

570
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:19,072
Thank you.

571
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:20,222
Mr. Home.

572
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,272
Someone wants to buy this factory.

573
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:25,185
Was that what that call was?

574
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,091
Yes.

575
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:27,761
They said they drive by here all the time,

576
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,705
but this is the first time they noticed this place.

577
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,072
That’s why they called us.

578
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,957
So no one’s ever looked twice at this place before,

579
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,309
but suddenly it’s going to sell?

580
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:37,063
It’s like there was some supernatural force shielding it from sight.

581
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:38,140
If that suits your thought, sure.

582
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:43,665
It’s mission complete!

583
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:52,014
Are these the old uniforms here?

584
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:53,392
It’s adorbs!

585
00:39:53,746 --> 00:39:55,450
Can I have some, Home?

586
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:56,564
Sure.

587
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:57,503
What do you even need it for, though?

588
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,405
It’s our ghost-hunting uniform, of course.

589
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:07,266
Let’s put it on for a PR campaign!

590
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:09,311
Cool!

591
00:40:09,428 --> 00:40:11,330
I’m so, so, so, so in!

592
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,308
I’m not “in.”

593
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:14,374
I am an attorney.

594
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,851
Excuse me, but do not count me in as one of your—

595
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,515
(Vimarnsukman Ghost-hunting Team!)

596
00:40:21,703 --> 00:40:24,354
Peach, the hot nerd exorcist.

597
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:29,050
Home, the real estate heir… who is hotter.

598
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:32,671
Kan, the do-or-die sales rep.

599
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:37,205
Pangpang, the BANG-BANG-BANG PR manager!

600
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:42,531
Looking for a beautiful, luxurious, and ghost—free home?

601
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:43,860
Listen up!

602
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:48,157
All Vimarnsukman properties are guaranteed to be ghost-free.

603
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:51,047
Houses are free of ghosts, like they’ve been pasteurized,

604
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,614
made possible by Peach, the exorcist.

605
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,274
Got your attention?

606
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:59,158
Contact our sales representative, Attorney Kan!

607
00:40:59,275 --> 00:40:59,819
Yes.

608
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:00,819
What she said.

609
00:41:00,937 --> 00:41:03,410
Vimarnsukman Ghost-hunting Company Un…

610
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,468
Limited!

611
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:07,102
We guarantee a ghost-free satisfaction.

614

(We reserve the right to any changes and cancellation without prior notice.)

615
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:14,672
(Good day!)

616
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,709
I totally hate the name Home came up with.

617
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:23,561
Be nice, Peach.

618
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:26,266
He’s our source of income now, you know?

619
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:30,610
Honestly, you reassured him all so confidently,

620
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:33,171
but what would we do if we failed to exorcise a ghost next time?

621
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:35,170
You worry too much.

622
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:36,917
No wonder you look older than you are.

623
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,601
Hey!

624
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,712
I’m sure a solution will present itself, like what happened this time.

625
00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:45,223
It’s me, Home.

626
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:47,257
I have something to talk to you about.

627
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,386
Speaking of the devil.

628
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,105
Yeah?

629
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,040
Your food really couldn’t exorcise that ghost.

630
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,933
I know that.

631
00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:03,502
Was that all you needed to say?

632
00:42:03,712 --> 00:42:04,798
Got it. Bye.

633
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:05,635
Hold on.

634
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:09,217
What I wanted to say was…

635
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:12,623
Your food couldn’t exorcise that ghost,

636
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:17,909
but it’s the best way for us to connect with them.

637
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:20,208
Without you,

638
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,271
we wouldn’t be able to exorcise any ghosts.

639
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:28,324
Is that all?

640
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:29,069
One more thing.

641
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:34,505
The compensation for Rak’s mother…

642
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,177
I already had Kan take care of it.

643
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,930
(COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR MS. RAK SUKSANGUAN)

644
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:53,802
You came all the way here to see us…

645
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:58,214
That means you have some good news, don’t you?

646
00:42:58,228 --> 00:42:59,320
Maybe to say that…

647
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,265
“Peach passed that trial run with flying colors!” Something like that?

648
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:09,472
A white envelope?

649
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:11,665
Why?

650
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:12,871
It’s been one day since Peach started working!

651
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:14,216
Why are you firing him already?

652
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,734
I’m not.

653
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:17,902
That’s your first payroll.

654
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,330
(MR. SANTIPHAP TANTITAYMITR)

655
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:41,979
Well…

656
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:43,180
There you have it.

657
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,405
I’ll contact you for our next gig.

658
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,751
Home is rather nice, isn’t he?

659
00:43:59,558 --> 00:44:01,708
I guess not all rich people are evil.

660
00:44:04,817 --> 00:44:06,808
This is going to be a difficult process.

661
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:08,561
It’s been so long, after all.

662
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:11,642
I understand.

663
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:13,677
But this is Mr. Home’s request.

664
00:44:13,974 --> 00:44:16,402
And Ms. Rak’s mother is eligible for all the benefits

665
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:18,724
Ms. Kan.

666
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:24,271
Between their benefits and Vimarnsukman’s benefits,

667
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,801
which are we supposed to choose?

668
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:38,808
Was refusing to pay the employees their due compensation because of bankruptcy

669
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,980
also for the benefits of Vimarnsukman?

670
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:51,171
Nobody in this world is pure good or pure evil, Ms. Kan.

671
00:44:52,453 --> 00:44:54,275
You need to learn that.

672
00:44:57,894 --> 00:44:58,900
It’s still too soon to say.

673
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,906
We don’t know anything about him.

674
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:09,905
And you’re not allowed to fall for him.

675
00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:12,114
I am not.

676
00:45:13,025 --> 00:45:13,933
Possessive, are you?

677
00:45:14,724 --> 00:45:15,340
What?

678
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:17,207
Nonsense.

679
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:18,734
He’s cute, too, isn’t he?

680
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:41,257
Here is the employment contract

681
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:46,625
for the Vimarnsukman Ghost-hunting Company Un… Limited.

682
00:45:47,026 --> 00:45:49,487
For our next ghost-hunting gig,

683
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,210
the ghost only comes out when it rains, like right now.

684
00:45:56,576 --> 00:45:59,063
Who do you think the rider ghost was delivering something to?

685
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:00,696
It must have been something very important

686
00:46:00,712 --> 00:46:02,696
if he still wants to deliver it even when he’s dead.
