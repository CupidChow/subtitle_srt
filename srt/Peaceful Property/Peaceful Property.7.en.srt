1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,358
I want you to decide how you want this full-course meal to end.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,629
How’d you come up with the idea to cook for him

3
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:07,838
to ask for his forgiveness?

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,490
FORGIVEN to ask for his forgiveness?

5
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,068
Thank you

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,068
for making my dream come true.

7
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:16,708
I’ve sent you the file.

NEARLY KILLED YOUNG CHEF

9
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:18,530
He knew all along and never thought to tell me? NEARLY KILLED YOUNG CHEF

10
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:20,411
He knew all along and never thought to tell me?

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,537
I have to talk to Peach.

12
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:22,190
No.

13
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:24,426
I already sent Attorney Yai to take care of this whole thing.

14
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,300
Never being in contact with anyone from the Vimarnsukman family again.

15
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:29,428
For good.

REAL ESTATE HEIR HIT-AND-RUN KILLED CHEF

00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,050
OH, WHAT A JERK. THERE’S REALLY ONLY ONE TYPE OF RICH PEOPLE, HUH?

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,810
BET IT’S GON BE COVERED UP AGAIN.
RICH BY CHOICE? NO. DIRTBAG BY BLOOD? YES.

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,410
SHAMELESS!
THIS NEWS HAS BEEN QUIET FOR DAYS.

#CANCELVIMARNSUKMAN

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,650
THIS IS THEIR HOUSE, GUYS. #CANCELVIMARNSUKMAN

22
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:03,811
You!

23
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,700
Do you even know how to drive!

24
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,503
Uh, madam.

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,250
GO TO HELL, YOU TRASH.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,410
SERVES YOU RIGHT! DIE, OLD FOOL!

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,890
YOU’RE ALL TRASH.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,490
YOU DESERVE DEATH.

29
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:42,019
That hit-and-run scandal your beloved nephew was in

30
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:45,757
is ruining the Vimarnsukman’s reputation.

31
00:02:46,197 --> 00:02:47,825
Did you see what’s outside?

32
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,377
They’re calling us names.

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,117
How wonderful!

34
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:54,367
Just calm down, Phorn.

35
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,106
This is why I gathered all of us here today.

36
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,576
Mr. Yai.

37
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,608
How should we handle this situation?

38
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,416
I think we should avert their attention.

39
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,309
Would that really be a good idea, sir?
VIMARNSUKMAN SCANDAL

40
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,382
Now that the news about Mr. Home has gained traction,

41
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:10,909
people are digging up old cases.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,570
VIMARNSUKMAN SCANDAL

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,698
BANKRUPTCY FRAUD: WIG COMPANY LAID OFF HUNDREDS

44
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:13,969
There are various anonymous online accounts BANKRUPTCY FRAUD: WIG COMPANY LAID OFF HUNDREDS

45
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,577
There are various anonymous online accounts

46
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:19,174
publishing allegations of Vimarnsukman’s past unfairness.

47
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:25,111
This could lead to new lawsuits on closed cases.

48
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,242
See how the fire has spread now?

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,767
I agree with Mr. Yai, though.

50
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,032
We should keep quiet for the time being.

51
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:36,964
We will overlook any slander directed at us.

52
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,374
As long as I am in charge of taking care of Vimarnsukman’s reputation,

53
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:45,014
I will not allow any information that could come back and harm us to get leaked again.

54
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:51,435
Let’s agree that our family should lay low for a while.

55
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Home.

56
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,392
You want to go back to America for a bit?

57
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,712
You can fly back later for your Grandpa’s cremation.

58
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,490
No, Uncle.

59
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,505
I won’t go back to America.

60
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,714
All these problems come from the fact that our family never talks in the first place.

61
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,920
All these problems come from you being a troublemaker, be sure.

62
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,764
What are you spouting now?

63
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:21,318
Somkid has been trying to save your butt for years.

64
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:25,365
I don’t know how to fix this, either.

65
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:29,214
I just know I won’t run away again.

66
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:35,520
If you want me to lay low, I will.

67
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,110
I’ll keep a low profile while I sell the rest of my properties.

68
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,567
If that’s what you want.

69
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,170
Kan.

70
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:50,362
Will you please draft up whatever papers are needed to sell those properties?

71
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:51,666
I’ll sell it all without a fuss.

72
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:52,712
Of course.

73
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:54,008
I will get everything in order.

SHE’S HERE!

78

I CAN BARELY CATCH UP WITH HER.

79
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,809
SHE SEEMS WEIRD TODAY.

80
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,450

81
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:30,921
Well, well?

YOU GUYS NO LONGER DO GHOST-HUNTING?

YOU GUYS NO LONGER DO GHOST-HUNTING?

84

“You guys no longer do ghost-hunting?”
DUDE, THAT’S A SORE SUBJECT!

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,600
Of course not! We still do!

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,162
ALL CHAOBAN AND HONEY ARE HEARTBROKEN.
Of course not! We still do!

There’s just been a little change, is all.

90
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:48,239
Let’s just say the Vimarnsukman Ghost-Hunting team needs our own solo projects.

104
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:15,965
Peach.

105
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,761
How was it? Did they email you back?

106
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,430
Rejected, like usual.

107
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:22,165
Oh, it’s just a slow process.

108
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:24,564
Someone will eventually hire you as a chef.

109
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,574
Can you help me promote our ghost-hunting gig for now?

110
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,005
We need new clients if we want more money.

111
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,906
What do you need all that money for anyway?

112
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,779
You should learn to live within your means.

113
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,271
Well?

114
00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:51,005
You wanna live within that means in this old rat hole?

115
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,231
Do you?

116
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:55,151
Peach.

117
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:58,862
Are you honestly going to let it end like this with Home?

118
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,112
Yes, I honestly am.

119
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,478
It’s his fault and he’s never contacting us again.

120
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:05,656
And how would he do that?

121
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,712
You blocked his number, and then made me block it as well.

122
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,250
With no way to reach you,

123
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:13,347
his only option of contact right now is probably to visit you in your dreams.

124
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,691
If he ever appeared in my dreams,

125
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,080
I’d jolt myself awake before I even got to see his face!

126
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,211
Won’t it be better to talk things out before parting ways?

127
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,511
I think it’s better if it ends badly than to keep both of you guessing like this.

128
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:34,576
When he comes begging me on his knees,

129
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,216
I’ll think about it.

130
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,300
But I just know someone like him would never come to us.

131
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,232
Don’t you open it.

132
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:47,715
Pang!

133
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:54,582
Uh, excuse me.

134
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,408
Is this where Mr. Peach, “the Hottest Exorcist in Town,” lives?

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Yes.

136
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:03,204
How can we help you?

137
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,734
My name is Phoom.

138
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,066
I need Peach’s help.

139
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:20,371
Did you guys learn the new Boo-Boo Dance?

140
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:24,204
Do you miss them?

141
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:32,868
I don’t think it’s them you should think of, Mr. Suradech.

142
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,822
It’s your boss you need to worry about.

143
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,964
I have to go to work.

144
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:45,946
Here.

145
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,980
The papers Mr. Home asked me to draft for him.

146
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,262
I’ll leave the rest with you.

147
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:58,928
Let’s do it.

148
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,776
I can’t help but to sell this house to someone who needs and deserves it more.

149
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:10,466
So I hope the spirit residing in this place crosses over soon.

150
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,362
R.I.P.

151
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
Unless…

152
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,976
You need to communicate with me,

153
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,678
please, contact me directly via Suradech.

154
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:41,737
I don’t know if it works.

155
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,414
But I’ll do what I can.

156
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,660
I just hope the ghost doesn’t haunt the new owner so much.

157
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,712
Won’t he?

158
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:56,306
Are you Dr. Phoom, the buyer?

159
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:57,906
Yes.

160
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:00,508
What are you doing?

161
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:05,462
Nah, we’re not doing anything.

162
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,602
You’re early, doc.

163
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,457
It’s not our appointed time yet, is it?

164
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:14,008
Well, I felt a little uneasy so I just wanted to come and make sure.

165
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:28,271
Pang.

166
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,380
If this is the house we’re here to work at, I refuse.

167
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,811
I can’t stand the owner.

168
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,268
You didn’t pick up any of my calls.

169
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:42,318
I was clear when I said I didn’t want to be in contact with your family again.

170
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:46,382
That includes you.

171
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,219
I just wanted to clear things up with you.

172
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,666
Since you’re here, will you hear me out?

173
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,444
I can’t.

174
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
I’m busy working here.

175
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:59,669
So you’re just going to walk away?

176
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:02,266
But you’re good with running away anyway, aren’t you?

177
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,534
Clearly not as good as someone who ran so far he ended up in America.

178
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,014
Excuse me, but…

179
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,140
Is something the matter between you guys?

180
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,014
Oh, it’s nothing.

181
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:16,069
We’re just teasing.

182
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,660
But you honestly didn’t have to rely on such an unstable exorcist, Dr. Phoom.

183
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:26,906
I’ll exorcise the place for you.

184
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:27,977
Exorcise?

185
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:32,325
I can exorcise ghosts like you just fine on my own.

186
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,217
Before you do that, you gotta understand ghosts,

187
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:37,785
and you don’t even understand the buyer.

188
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,945
Mr. Phoom didn’t want to buy this house and contacted us

189
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,290
because he wanted the place exorcised.

190
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:47,357
He wants to meet the ghost.

191
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:17,242
This place used to be a Thai classical dance school.

192
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,512
It was shut down after a student named Vicha died.

193
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,663
I think he’s the one Mr. Phoom wants to make contact with.

194
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,474
He’s the ghost people around here see dancing at night.

195
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:33,417
I think there was… something between these two.

196
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:40,105
I think so, too.

197
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:43,545
Mr. Phoom specifically requested

198
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,918
that Peach makes vegetable hummingbird sour curry to get in contact with this ghost.

199
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,805
He didn’t tell me anything.

200
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:53,121
Did he say anything else?

201
00:12:58,881 --> 00:12:59,881
Pang.

202
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,508
You don’t want to talk to me either?

203
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:07,414
Let me ask you honestly…

204
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,248
You didn’t send that lawyer to talk to us, did you?

205
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:19,512
I guessed as much.

206
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:23,560
I know your family must have their own way of dealing with such a big scandal.

207
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:27,408
I didn’t want it to turn out this way.

208
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,114
But it already has.

209
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:32,853
Now go and try to mend things with Peach.

210
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,274
Pang.

211
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:39,635
Did you really take forever to pick up some flowers for the curry?

212
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,368
Or did someone slow you down?

213
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:42,684
Should I just pick them myself?

214
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,391
Pang.

215
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,915
Tell your brother the vegetable hummingbirds are right here in my hands.

216
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
No need to pick more.

217
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:56,087
Pang.

218
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,774
Tell him I saw that from the first glance.

219
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:00,953
I just don’t want them now that they’ve been tainted by his hands.

220
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:02,977
Pang, tell your brother that...

221
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:03,988
Ugh!

222
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,303
Stop it.

223
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:07,204
We’re not in a boxing ring, for God’s sake.

224
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,324
I beg you.

225
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:11,562
Will you two just talk things out?

226
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:36,720
I did my best cooking this dish.

227
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:40,005
I hope you enjoy it, Mr. Vicha.

228
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,148
If you do, I hope you’re open to talking to Mr. Phoom.

229
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:09,296
Pang.

230
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:15,216
Tell your brother Mr. Exorcist that maybe what he’s done up to now

231
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,757
might not work so well like before after all.

232
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,308
Don’t get so cocky.

233
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:24,714
Maybe something is blocking him in?

234
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,410
Hey, what if it’s because of all these talismans?

235
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,779
Who the hell put them there!

236
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,690
Pang, come here and help me get them down.

237
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:39,263
What clueless idiot did this?

238
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,377
“Once she utters her last pleading prayer.”

239
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,173
“She holds her breath to end all her desire.”

240
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,465
“There she lays lifeless by the river.”

241
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:10,008
“Where she stays, her heart torn asunder.”

242
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Mr. Phoom.

243
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:20,517
How did Mr. Vicha die?

244
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:24,102
He died of an illness.

245
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:36,817
Mr. Vicha.

246
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:41,068
My name is Peach.

247
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:47,312
I did my best cooking this, so please, accept it.

248
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:48,491
He’s here?

249
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,801
Can you see him?

250
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:55,164
Yes.

251
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,845
Vicha.

252
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:02,663
Vicha, it’s Phoom.

253
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:04,542
I’m here to see you.

254
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,059
Are you here?

255
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,314
Can you hear me?

256
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,266
I miss you.

257
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:11,139
Are you right here?

258
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:15,857
Oh?

259
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:20,380
What’s happened, Mr. Peach?

260
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:56,845
Mr. Peach.

261
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:58,293
What do you see?

262
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,105
Mr. Vicha is dancing,

263
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,414
before falling down,

264
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,311
and then he dies on the floor.

265
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:12,958
But why do you look so shaken?

266
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:14,371
He…

267
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:18,574
He has been repeating this
for more than ten times.

268
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,625
He keeps doing it over and over again.

269
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:24,715
Just like…

270
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:33,982
Mr. Phoom.

271
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:38,915
Is there anything you didn’t tell me?

272
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:47,660
It might not be something pleasant,

273
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:50,302
but please tell me.

274
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:52,965
I really need to know.

275
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,262
Actually…

276
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,000
I killed Vicha.

277
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,290
23 YEARS AGO

278
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Phoom.

279
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:32,374
Yeah?

280
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,533
Can I ask you something?

281
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,610
Sure.

282
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:44,171
Since when did you start liking me?

283
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,508
Since the start of summer break.

284
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:56,564
I had two options.

285
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,491
Either I ordain as a monk through the summer, like Mom wanted,

286
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,180
or learn classical dance here.

287
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,903
Enough now.

288
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:12,838
You two don’t match each other on stage at all.

289
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,408
It just looks out of place.

290
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:17,106
Vicha, come over here.

291
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:18,429
Yes, Teacher.

292
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:28,162
Try it with him.

293
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,712
Now that’s more like it.

294
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,257
That doesn’t look half bad.

295
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:15,327
From now on, you two are partners on stage.

296
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,290
Yes, Teacher.

297
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:35,414
Quit sneaking around, you two.

298
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:38,382
If you’re so eager for dinner, be useful.

299
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,733
There.

300
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:41,515
Go pick some vegetable hummingbirds for me.

301
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:42,674
Yes, Teacher.

302
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:50,260
Hey, you’re good.

303
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:53,564
How’d you know which ones are ripe to pick?

304
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:54,814
They look all the same to me.

305
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:58,367
I’ve had vegetable hummingbird sour curry a hundred times before.

306
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,580
It’d be more strange if I couldn’t tell.

307
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:07,420
How about these?

308
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:08,645
Any good?

309
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:11,715
They’re too young.

310
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:14,287
What a shame.

311
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:15,550
They will never get to grow now.

312
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:16,820
You rid them of that chance.

313
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,819
I think they’re very beautiful for their age.

314
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,274
Thai dance is the art of body language.

315
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,111
It is divided into three categories:

316
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:51,368
First, gestures showing feelings.

317
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,315
Hey, you two.

318
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,007
Pay attention.

319
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:59,013
Alright, let’s revise it.

320
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,414
Do it together.

321
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:02,863
The gesture for “saddened.”

322
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:08,103
Gestures showing feelings are amazing, aren’t they?

323
00:24:08,828 --> 00:24:10,948
They can get the good feelings across so beautifully.

324
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,019
You’re right.

325
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,325
Some gestures are even better than words, aren’t they?

326
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,430
The gesture for “love” really embodies the feelings.

327
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:31,331
Hey.

328
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,570
If we’re getting better at this, ROTHASEN

329
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,430
do you think there’s a chance for us to be in a play together like this?

330
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:38,648
Of course.

331
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,460
But before that, you have to remember the basic gestures first.

332
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:45,205
Get up.

333
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:46,808
Hurry up. The exam is coming.

334
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:52,066
This is the gesture for “myself.”

335
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:53,262
“My…

336
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:56,816
…self.”

337
00:24:58,924 --> 00:24:59,924
Tilt your head.

338
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:03,786
Now back to the beginning stance.

339
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:05,921
Switch legs.

340
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:09,712
Next is the “saddened” gesture.

341
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:11,869
“Sad…

342
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,528
…denned.”

343
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,551
“Sad-denned.”

344
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,185
Back to the beginning stance.

345
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:24,474
Now, the gesture for “love.”

346
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:26,765
“Love.”

347
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,017
Your hands are too low.

348
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,982
Lift them a little higher.

349
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,714
You really never pay attention in class, do you?

350
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:47,623
Now that’s it.

351
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,371
Summer break is almost over.

352
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,671
I won’t get to see you every day anymore, then?

353
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:48,401
Even when I go back to school,

354
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:51,545
I’ll come by here to see you as often as I can.

355
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,112
I won’t just disappear.

356
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,216
I swear on my life.

357
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:37,851
Hey.

358
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,031
Were you sick?

359
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,320
You’ve been absent from class for days.

360
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,614
Next up, Phoom.

361
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:00,665
Your turn.

362
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:14,139
Do the gesture for “myself.”

363
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:21,592
The gesture for “go.”

364
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,512
The gesture for “happy.”

365
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:40,462
Listen carefully.

366
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:43,371
Is that the word I said?

367
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:44,776
Again.

368
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
The gesture for “happy.”

369
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:52,970
What are you doing?

370
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,102
Listen to what I said.

371
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,314
The gesture for “happy.”

372
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:10,813
Mom!

373
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,303
Mom, I’m sorry!

374
00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:16,444
Mom!

375
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:17,931
I don’t want to hear your sorry’s.

376
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:23,407
Having a gay son like you… How would I face people now?

377
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,570
Mom.

378
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,111
Please.

379
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,714
Let me go there…

380
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:46,308
Just one last time.

381
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,174
Phoom.

382
00:29:58,277 --> 00:29:59,277
We’re going home.

383
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,022
I said we’re going home.

384
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:10,328
Go home!

385
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:32,434
 Once she utters her last pleading prayer 

386
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:41,155
 She holds her breath to end all her desire 

387
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:51,868
 There she lays lifeless by the river 

388
00:31:52,254 --> 00:31:59,565
 Where she stays, her heart torn asunder 

389
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,217
PM I found out Vicha killed himself

390
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,614
two years into my medical school.

391
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:25,111
It was my fault.

392
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:29,103
I thought…

393
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,714
Just disappearing would be less painful for him.

394
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:41,671
I just want to apologize to him

395
00:32:43,684 --> 00:32:47,911
for leaving without ever saying goodbye.

396
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:04,162
I think this is simply impossible for me…

397
00:33:08,543 --> 00:33:11,902
impossible for me to do alone.

398
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,647
Peach, what’s your deal?

399
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:38,518
You refused to talk to me all day

400
00:33:38,782 --> 00:33:40,465
and only do now because you need my help?

401
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,210
I told you I didn’t come here to talk.

402
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:47,573
I’m here for work.

403
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,656
Is this your way of rubbing it in my face, then?

404
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,804
Isn’t this your job, too?

405
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,080
Don’t you want to get it over with?

406
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,075
The buyer is waiting.

407
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,210
GESTURE: “LOVE”

408
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:17,069
Vicha…

409
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:21,499
I’m sorry.

410
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:28,072
I’m sorry I wasn’t brave enough to tell you.

411
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,970
CREMATION CEREMONY FOR VICHA KANNULA

412
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,279
You never got to hear what I wanted to say.

413
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,880
DANCE-DRAMA: ROTHASEN You never got to hear what I wanted to say.

414
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,417
You’re back.

415
00:38:58,115 --> 00:38:59,420
Sorry to keep you waiting.

416
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:18,851
Is he gone?

417
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,308
He’s still here, isn’t he?

418
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:52,106
He is.

419
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:58,214
It seems he’s finally heard what you wanted to say, Mr. Phoom.

420
00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:05,800
Well, that is enough for me.

421
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:54,211
Oh?

422
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,665
How was it, my dear nephew?

423
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,311
It was all done.

424
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:02,379
He agreed to buy the house.

425
00:41:03,032 --> 00:41:04,032
That’s amazing.

426
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,974
What’s with the long face?

427
00:41:11,854 --> 00:41:12,854
Come on.

428
00:41:13,697 --> 00:41:14,697
Have a seat.

429
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:26,297
What’s wrong?

430
00:41:39,158 --> 00:41:40,158
Here.

431
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:43,779
Have a drink.

432
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:48,721
Maybe that will loosen your lips a little bit.

433
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:07,297
Peach.

434
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:11,914
I’ll say this one last time…

435
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:14,047
about Home.

436
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,176
I know.

437
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:24,671
I saw now that he really is sorry.

438
00:42:25,231 --> 00:42:26,231
Oh?

439
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:28,675
Why are you still giving him the cold shoulder, then?

440
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,730
A guy gotta play hard to get, don’t you know?

441
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,250
DANGER DO NOT ANSWER

442
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:45,801
If he agrees to apologize sincerely right to my face this time,

443
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:47,801
I might forgive him.

444
00:42:53,392 --> 00:42:54,392
Stop it!

445
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:56,637
Get back together! Get back together!

446
00:42:56,653 --> 00:42:58,271
Get back together! Get back together!

447
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:01,802
I haven’t cleared things up with him at all, Uncle.

448
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,970
I called him a hundred times before every day,

449
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:07,106
and he has my number blocked!

450
00:43:08,105 --> 00:43:09,571
Doesn’t matter. I’ll call again.

451
00:43:10,244 --> 00:43:11,568
I’ll call until he folds!

452
00:43:13,877 --> 00:43:15,914
If he doesn’t pick up your call,

453
00:43:16,808 --> 00:43:17,914
just show up at his place.

454
00:43:21,822 --> 00:43:22,872
Since I’m drunk,

455
00:43:23,774 --> 00:43:25,469
I’ll pretend I don’t see you leaving.

456
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:27,834
I can’t stop you anyway, can I?

457
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:30,810
Do whatever you want.

458
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:35,000
Just be brave.

459
00:43:42,425 --> 00:43:43,568
Thank you, Uncle.

460
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
Suradech.

461
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:54,865
This is something I must do all by myself.

462
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:56,804
I can’t just wait for help like before.

463
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:12,974
What are you doing, though?

464
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,911
I’m reading up on the news on Home.

465
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,472
NO NEED TO CENSOR HIS FACE WHEN WE KNOW THE JERK. #CANCELVIMARNSUKMAN

466
00:44:18,496 --> 00:44:19,776
I have a bad feeling about this.

467
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:21,071
Bad feeling?

468
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:22,623
How so?

469
00:44:23,485 --> 00:44:25,315
This happened three years ago.

470
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:27,708
How come it just came out now?

471
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:31,179
I think someone intentionally leaked it.

472
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:34,278
Mr. Yai.

473
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:36,920
Since we’re done today, I’ll have to excuse myself.

474
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:44,173
You’re right.

475
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:46,109
They seem to know a lot, too.

476
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:50,622
I think there’s something even more fishy going on.

477
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:01,130
I bet Home is here to win you back.

478
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:03,801
Pang.

479
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,245
I’ll get the door.

480
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:23,651
What are you doing here?

481
00:45:30,822 --> 00:45:32,822
If you insist on keeping your mouth shut even now,

482
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:34,247
just go home.

483
00:45:39,094 --> 00:45:40,094
Home.

484
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:41,688
Just say what you’re here to say!

485
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,206
If you’re going to just stand there dumbfounded, then go away!

486
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,230
Peach.

487
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,610
Who are you talking to?

488
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:49,656
Home, who else?

489
00:45:57,164 --> 00:45:58,164
Oh?

490
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,940
Hello?

491
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:07,810
(Hello. Is this Mr. Peach’s number?)

492
00:46:08,297 --> 00:46:09,297
Yes.

493
00:46:09,448 --> 00:46:12,165
(Your number is the last call on this phone.)

494
00:46:14,324 --> 00:46:15,960
Excuse me, but who are you?

495
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:19,336
(I’m a paramedic, and there’s something I need to tell you.)

496
00:46:36,776 --> 00:46:38,527
The patient is in a critical condition.

497
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:41,120
We fear he might not make it till daybreak.

498
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,183
What an embarrassment he is.

499
00:46:43,447 --> 00:46:46,272
Home, you devil. You fiend.

500
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:49,194
I can’t let him die with his reputation in ruins like this.

501
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:51,576
We need to get his soul back into his body.

502
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,576
This camera was in the car.

503
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:54,909
Please take it.

504
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:57,450
The doctor said there’s alcohol in Home’s bloodstream.

505
00:46:57,474 --> 00:46:59,669
They said it was probably drunk driving.

506
00:46:59,937 --> 00:47:01,498
But the young master didn’t touch his drink.

507
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:02,779
It can’t be.
