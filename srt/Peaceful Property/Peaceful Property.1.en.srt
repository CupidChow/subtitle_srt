00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:02,106
Anyone would be surprised if that happened to them.

2
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:08,650
…make it up to you?

3
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,693
How about taking a trip out of town with me next week?

4
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:19,511
Oh, no!

5
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,148
My Gramps just died.

6
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,240
I was just talking to my family about my flight back to Thailand.

7
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,100
I’ve heard that excuse a hundred times before!

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,770
You’re going on a date with another girl?

9
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,890
(BOO! IT’S SOMKID: HOME… GRAMPS JUST KICKED THE BUCKET.)

10
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,170
(CAN YOU COME HOME?)

11
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:46,871
See?

12
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,767
Told you.

13
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,210
This guy is weird as hell.

14
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,580
It wouldn’t be appropriate to gossip, would it?

15
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:53,720
Ugh, like it isn’t worth it.

16
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,010
Just tell me what’s wrong with him.

17
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,788
Peach is just… scared of ghosts.

18
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,465
What?

19
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:01,703
Scared of ghosts?

20
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:03,394
In the middle of the day?

21
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:04,423
Is he right in the head?

22
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,204
I know he’s a bit out of it.

23
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,383
But he’s a really great cook.

24
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,106
I can confirm that.

25
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:15,250
He’s all the weirder for frequenting a temple when he’s afraid of ghosts…

26
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,505
Best?

27
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,500
Sorry.

28
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,607
You’re as easily startled as ever, huh?

29
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,317
I’m sorry.

30
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:49,619
It’s alright.

31
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:52,714
But if Chef Hong sees you like this, you’re dead.

32
00:05:58,205 --> 00:05:59,330
What are you doing here anyway?

33
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:01,964
I came to give offerings to the monks here.

34
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,053
Oh?

35
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,053
Did you make a wish and it came true or something?

36
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,699
Peach, look.

37
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:12,408
I got the sous-chef job at Paula the Hungry.

38
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:13,820
Woah, really?

39
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:14,377
Really.

40
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:15,456
That’s amazing.

41
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:17,207
The head chef there is a legend.

42
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,071
I’m really glad I got it.

43
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,405
The job is fun, and it pays really well.

44
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,570
I can finally afford the down payment for a house.

45
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:26,056
I’ll invite you over sometimes.

46
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,303
Congrats.

47
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:30,423
Thanks.

48
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,463
I’m over the moon, really.

49
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,410
Peach.

50
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,348
Can I ask you something?

51
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,626
Yeah?

52
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:50,708
If you’re doing this…

53
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,604
That means what everyone’s saying is true, doesn’t it?

54
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:56,714
“What everyone’s saying”?

55
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:58,714
What are they saying?

56
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,220
They say you can’t cook anymore because you’re sick.

57
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,811
It–It’s true.

58
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:15,437
Sorry.

59
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,188
- Let’s talk about something else. - It’s okay.

60
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,180

62
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:21,121
Yeah.

63
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:22,554
She’s fine.

64
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,029
But she’s been complaining about work.

65
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,382
She said she’s been losing more and more followers.

Hello.

My name is Kan.

165
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,620
Quick fire question, Mr. Attorney.

166
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,582
Would it be illegal if a boss hits on his employee?

167
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:49,005
According to Article 397,

168
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,610
any person who treats another with insolence or in an offensive way,

169
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:56,620
causing another to undergo disgrace, trouble, or annoyance,

170
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,712
shall be liable to imprisonment for no more than one month.

171
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,345
“Good guy,” you said.

172
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,706
This proves otherwise.

173
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,463
Ms. Kan, if you’re dying to get to know me,

174
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:17,408
you could have just asked.

175
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:19,817
I am simply fulfilling my duty.

176
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,875
I must find out everything about you even without asking.

177
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:26,678
There’s no need to put Ms. Kan to work, sir.

178
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:29,370
I don’t think I’ll inherit anything from Gramps anyway.

179
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:33,574
One more thing, I’m not here for Gramps’ last will.

180
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,875
This matter is being handled by Mr. Somkid.

181
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,730
By Uncle Somkid?

182
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:40,223
Where is he?

183
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,663
Oh, Uncle Kid.

184
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,810
You’re not being very discreet this time.

185
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,802
Oh?

186
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,377
Peek-a-boo!

187
00:13:58,668 --> 00:13:59,982
Oh, Uncle Kid!

188
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,616
Come on here.

189
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,508
Well? Is that discreet enough for ya?

190
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:06,274
You even hire a stunt double now?

191
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:08,019
No, no. He’s not a stunt double.

192
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,804
Besides Kan,

193
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:13,314
Suradech is here to look after you while you’re here in Thailand, Home.

194
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:14,376
Am I right, Suradech?

195
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,093
Does he carry a gun?

196
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:33,851
Lemme check.

197
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,306
Mr. Attorney.

198
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,337
Does it run in the family, sir?

199
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,247
No.

200
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,173
The rest of them are quite normal.

201
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,995
Am I to inherit all of this?

202
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,321
Phorn.

203
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:51,456
What’s wrong with you?

204
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:55,620
Madam is just rehearsing her reaction for when she gets the inheritance, sir.

205
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,269
I take it back.

206
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,068
You’re gathered here for the reading of the last will of the Vimarnsukman family.

207
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:17,019
Attorney Kan will read out the initial details.

208
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,422
The first descendant is Ms. Somphorn,

209
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:30,204
the deceased’s stepdaughter from his first marriage,

210
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,770
who had lived with Mr. Samai since she was three

211
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:35,404
until the moment his first wife died.

212
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,491
Mr. Samai remarried and had two sons,

213
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:42,190
Mr. Somjai and Mr. Somkid.

214
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,312
Mr. Saharat is the only grandson,

215
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:48,322
an heir produced by Mr. Somjai.

216
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:53,279
Mr. Samai had one last request before he died.

217
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,564
(CREMATION CEREMONY)
Mr. Samai had one last request before he died.

218
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:54,860
(CREMATION CEREMONY)

219
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,988
There should be a 100-day mourning period
(CREMATION CEREMONY)

220
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:57,068
(CREMATION CEREMONY)

221
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,650
after the funeral per tradition,
(CREMATION CEREMONY)

222
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,715
before the official cremation ceremony.

223
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:07,902
As for the cremation ceremony, Mr. Samai had asked accordingly:

224
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,970
(SHOW UP IN HEAPS,
PEEPS! DRESS CODE: CARROT ORANGE ONLY!)

225
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:16,853
He had asked that Mr. Saharat oversees this event,

226
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,272
and make sure to have his ashes enshrined at the little house he lived in.

227
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:22,275
You got it, Gramps.

228
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:25,022
I’ll do my best for you.

229
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:28,522
Now we have come to the matter of inheritance.

230
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,810
(INHERITANCE)

231
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:36,309
Mr. Samai’s estate shall be divided between his surviving descendants.

232
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:38,718
First, Mr. Somkid.

233
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,820
He is to receive the wooden house at the back of the mansion,

234
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:46,779
including everything inside the house.

235
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:55,170
Ms. Somphorn is to receive 3% of the family savings.

236
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,220
And the rest of the properties…

237
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,054
I’m getting all those, too?

238
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,139
Oh, Dad—

239
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:04,910
Phorn.

240
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,118
Hear him out.

241
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:12,417
All 12 properties shall go to Mr. Saharat,

242
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:16,915
Mr. Samai’s only grandson.

243
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,653
The rest of the estate shall be equally divided

244
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,650
between all three aforementioned descendants.

245
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:28,845
Why did you put it down?

246
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,805
Was that all?

247
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:30,829
It was, ma’am.

248
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:32,488
Home.

249
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:34,783
Good for you, kiddo.

250
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,690
THE NIGHT BEFORE

251
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:53,973
It’s Pangpang Review Special!

252
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,894
I’m here to review something huge today,

253
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,839
which is a house… A house, guys!

260
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:02,878

(OH, HE’S HAWT.)

264
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,177
I bought this house because I love the big kitchen.

265
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:08,760
It’s a great place for me to hone my cooking skills.

266
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:13,397
You hardly move in here and your fridge is already full?

267
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:15,800
It kinda comes naturally, you know?

268
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,331
We’re chefs, after all, am I right?

269
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,120
Chef, he said.

270
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,289
(OH! CHEF BEST.) / (THEY’RE BOTH *CHEF’S KISS.*)

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:22,318

274
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:25,630
My brother is a chef, too.
(I WANNA BE A FRIDGE.)

275
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:25,760
Sorry?

276
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,337
(PANGPANG ISN’T A FAN. LMAO.)
Sorry?

277

(PANGPANG ISN’T A FAN. LMAO.)

278
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:28,530
I said it’s a great house!
(PANGPANG ISN’T A FAN. LMAO.)

279
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,240
I’ve given them the down payment.

I’ve given them the down payment.

294

Peach, what’s wrong?

295
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:55,804
Best.

296
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:58,205
What’s this?

297
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,808
You knew, didn’t you?

298
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:09,120
You knew I could see ghosts.

299
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,407
Actually…

300
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:17,515
I invited you over

301
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:20,816
because of this.

302
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,650
(BEST, DO NOT OPEN IT!)

303
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,010

(WICKED!)

305
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,530
(NOOOO, THIS IS SCARY!)

306
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:43,315
Home, you jerk!

307
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:46,085
You never cared about your grandfather.

308
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:49,477
You have no rights getting all the inheritance!

309
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,247
Come on now, Aunt Phorn.

310
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,134
You can hardly blame me for that.

311
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:57,447
Plus, you actually aren’t even related to Gramps by blood.

312
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,872
Yet, he left you several millions in cash.

313
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,376
Ain’t that enough for someone who’s already in her old age?

314
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:05,768
Baanchuen!

315
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:06,662
Yes, ma’am!

316
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,001
Here, ma’am!

317
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:10,782
That mouth of yours…

318
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:11,728
Seize him!

319
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:12,357
Yes, ma’am!

320
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,808
You dare speak up against me?

321
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:15,511
Do it, ma’am! Do it!

322
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:18,474
I’ll get you for it!

323
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:20,220
Do it!

324
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,899
Home, you jerk!

325
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:26,392
Let go of me!

326
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:27,807
Phorn.

327
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,742
Calm down. Don’t do this.

328
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:31,628
You’re being immature.

329
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,367
Don’t you realize he’s disrespecting you, too?

330
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,817
I won’t take this lying down!

331
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:37,960
Remember that.

332
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,414
Baanchuen.

333
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,244
Yes?

334
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:40,877
Let’s go.

335
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:41,488
Yes!

336
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,514
You alright, Home?

337
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:51,922
Why don’t you come back to my house for now?

338
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,315
Did it just sink in that you’re rich now?

339
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:17,820
Took a bit of time, huh?

340
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,869
Well, what will you do now?

341
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:29,074
I was planning on staying through the mourning period

342
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:30,336
before heading back to America.

343
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:34,611
But since I have to sell those properties I just inherited…

344
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,915
I guess I’ll have to stay until I sell everything.

345
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:42,105
I’m thinking of buying a house in the US with that money.

346
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:43,610
What do you think, Uncle?

347
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:45,506
Just do what you like.

348
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:47,468
You can do whatever you want with it.

349
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,804
The old man left those properties for you, you know?

350
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:57,908
Are you…

351
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:03,010
really okay getting just this old house?

352
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,010
Aunt Phorn was downright mad about her share.

353
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:07,912
Of course I’m okay.

354
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,102
Don’t worry about me.

355
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:10,777
Focus on yourself.

356
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:13,311
It seems you’re in for some messy business.

357
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,121
I’ll be just fine, Uncle.

358
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:25,540
You found me this gorgeous assistant, after all.

359
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:31,109
I have acquired the deeds to all the properties from Mr. Lawyer.

360
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,911
There’s a property currently being sold.

361
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,848
Would you like to nullify the contract, Mr. Home.

362
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:42,016
And we can lower the prices.

363
00:22:42,031 --> 00:22:44,016
I want to sell them quickly and without hassle.

364
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:47,208
I don’t want you overworking, Kan.

365
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:50,868
I’m sure the lowered prices would attract buyers.

366
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,662
But I doubt they would sell without hassle like you said, Home.

367
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:56,478
Why not?

368
00:22:56,857 --> 00:22:59,217
You haven’t told him about this, Mr. Somkid?

369
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,729

00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:30,868
I thought it would go away if I cleaned it well enough.

377
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:33,936
But…

378
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:35,204
But what?

379
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,610
(HAVE YOU TRIED PAINTING OVER IT?)

380
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:52,509
Oh, that gives me the creeps!

381
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,571
I’ve tried everything.

382
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,217
I even repainted it.

383
00:23:58,078 --> 00:23:59,400
But it won’t go away.

384
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:03,034
I don’t know what else to do.

385
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:06,080

386
00:24:26,894 --> 00:24:27,568
Peach.

387
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,908
Did you see something?

388
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:33,640
Best.

389
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,743
I think you should back down from buying this place.

390
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:50,453
Help!

391
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,450

all your Gramps’ properties are haunted.

00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:41,979

443
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:45,380

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,591
I don’t know what technology you used to make this video,

447
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,041
but spreading that kind of rumor

448
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:08,700
affects the properties I’m about to sell.

449
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:09,807
You have to take responsibility for that.

450
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:11,937
I didn’t do anything.

451
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:13,512
That house really was haunted—

452
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:15,081
Screw your excuse.

453
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:18,225
I know that was only for content.

454
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:19,866
What do you want me to do?

455
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,087
It’s your—

456
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:26,600
your stupid ass who didn’t let the buyer know
the history of the house.

457
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,259
Is this how you wanna do it?

458
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,308

What?

465
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:14,210
Say it again to my face.

466
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:16,890
So you won’t take responsibility for what you did.

467
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,714
What do you want me to do?

468
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,706
You want me to exorcise that ghost or something?

469
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:24,365
As if someone like you can do that.

470
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:26,487
Stay where you are.

471
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:28,016
Don’t do anything.

472
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,602
Just wait for the court order.

473
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:40,785
Like I said!

474
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:42,922
You gotta take responsibility for what you did.

475
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,475
You… haven’t seen the last of me.

476
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,570
I meant what I said!

477
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,377
Just go!

478
00:28:57,251 --> 00:28:57,865
You!

479
00:28:59,082 --> 00:28:59,979
We’ll see about this!

480
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,702
What the hell is going on?

481
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:18,706
Is this really your solution to this problem, Mr. Home?

482
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:54,666
What are you doing?

483
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,856
I told you I’m not buying your house anymore.

484
00:29:57,891 --> 00:29:58,777
Please reconsider.

485
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,582

00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:06,336

488

I can see it.

489
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,616
The ghost.

490
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:15,638
She’s a woman with long hair,

491
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,388
donning a traditional costume.

492
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,444
Her sash covers her body in daffodil yellow.

493
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,730
You dare build this house on top of my grave!

494
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,542
You honestly believe this?

495
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,177
Dead quiet.

496
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:44,748
Are we doing this or not?

497
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,982
Well…

498
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:52,779
Since you’re here, Fan Singsing,

499
00:30:53,097 --> 00:30:55,352
can you exorcise the ghost for us?

500
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,000
Show him, Topknot.

501
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,250
(FAN SINGSING, MULTI-VERSE EXORCIST)

502
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:05,825
All done.

503
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:20,010
Topknot has blessed the confetti, Mother.

504
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:22,002
This is simply a low-ranking ghost.

505
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:23,457
Just blast her away, Mother.

506
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:02,911
What the hell?

507
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,263
That’s some serious theatrics.

508
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:14,558
Peach, we’ll be okay.

509
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:15,771
Just believe me.

510
00:32:15,838 --> 00:32:16,962
It’ll get better soon.

511
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,448
He’s going to sue us, Pang.

512
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:21,321
It’s not like we have money to hire a lawyer.

513
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,008
Well, I’m sure there’s…

514
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:29,503
volunteer lawyers willing to help us.

515
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,174
I’m sorry, Pang.

516
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:43,117
This is all because I’m a loser.

517
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,404
Ever since I started seeing ghosts,

518
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:50,856
I’ve been nothing but a burden to you.

519
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:57,228
All our dreams are just… gone now.

520
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:16,865
Peach.

521
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,303
Even with this whole ghost thing,

522
00:33:26,056 --> 00:33:29,570
I’m still glad you’re my big brother.

523
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:40,391
How can I not? You’re always so nice and kind to everyone.

524
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:47,979
So please don’t hold back on doing whatever you want.

525
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,297
I’ll always be here to support you.

526
00:34:26,318 --> 00:34:26,918
Pang.

527
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,508
Let’s go to Best’s.

528
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:34,770
There’s something I want to try.

529
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:47,075
What’s going on?

530
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:50,152
Mother–Mother is exorcising the ghost.

531
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,008
Mother has exorcised the ghost.

532
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:10,610
The ghost is exorcised.

533
00:35:10,794 --> 00:35:12,521
The evil spirit is gone.

534
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:18,930
Our job here is done so Topknot is going to take Mother home.

535
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:20,592
You are safe now.

536
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,318
They’re clearly scamming us.

537
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,124
Kan, go talk to them.

538
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:37,010
What is this?

539
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,810
You’re just gonna say this place is ghost-free now, is that it?

540
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:42,472
You are right, Mr. Best.

541
00:35:57,499 --> 00:35:58,309
What are you doing here?

542
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,065
But since you already are, take a look.

543
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:04,004
We’ve exorcised the ghost.

544
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,577
Are… Are you sure?

545
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:29,709
Best.

546
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,511
Can I borrow your kitchen?

547
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:44,152
You’ve got some rice in the fridge?

548
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,013
Of course.

549
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,287
Thank you.

550
00:36:57,469 --> 00:36:59,213
You sure this is a good time to be cooking?

551
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:01,367
I’m honestly not.

552
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:03,177
But just trust him.

553
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,645
Peach.

554
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:29,663
Will this work?

555
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:33,874
I don’t know.

556
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,771
I just do what I do at the temple.

557
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:39,974
Why fried rice?

558
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,010
I saw that there was a…

559
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:51,371
a box of uneaten fried rice right next to him.

560
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:54,121
I call bull.

561
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:55,768
It’s way too in detail.

562
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:56,771
What exactly did you even see?

563
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:08,201
I think he was a construction worker.

564
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:11,407
Maybe there was some kind of accident.

565
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:16,269
He probably fell down and got hanged on the wall.

566
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,311
His body looks… thoroughly burned.

567
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:27,357
Home.

568
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,520
If you’re going to sue them,

569
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:31,180
try not to make a big deal out of it.

570
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:32,887
What?

571
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,014
Why not?

572
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:37,484
What they’re saying on the internet isn’t baseless.

573
00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:42,471
There was an electrician who fell to his death in that house.

574
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:44,222
Nobody knows about this

575
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:47,170
because our family made sure it didn’t make headlines.

576
00:38:58,271 --> 00:38:59,435
S–Sir.

577
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,408
I give you this offering.

578
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:05,208
It might not look all that appetizing,

579
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:08,957
but I did my best cooking it.

580
00:39:29,924 --> 00:39:30,567
Sir.

581
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:35,588
This house you helped build…

582
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:44,008
It’s beautiful.

583
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,440
Peach.

584
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:30,275
Is he gone?

585
00:40:31,537 --> 00:40:32,278
Look!

586
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:51,896
(WHAAAA, SICK!)

587
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:53,769
Thus began the journey of the newest exorcist in town…

He’s my brother!

599
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:08,160
Good job!

600
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:09,220
You were amazing, Peach.

601
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,408
The purchase contract with Mr. Best has been finalized, sir.

602
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,106
However, the rest of your properties are still facing similar issues.

603
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:26,705
What are you going to do, Mr. Home?

604
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,570
(#HOTTEST EXORCIST IN TOWN)

605
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:43,087
Kan.

606
00:41:46,063 --> 00:41:47,170
Do you believe in ghosts?

607
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:48,503
No.

608
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:52,777
But it is undeniable that the belief in ghosts affects the writing of laws.

609
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:57,014
It even dictated the moral standards of our country at one point in time.

610
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:58,693
Dang.

611
00:41:59,737 --> 00:42:01,007
Are you a walking Wikipedia?

612
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:02,607
That was some serious answer.

613
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:07,026
You asked because it affects selling your properties in some way, I take it?

614
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:20,607
Gramps, can’t I come home already?

615
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,437
I can’t wait to help you sell those houses.

616
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:25,607
Home.

617
00:42:27,035 --> 00:42:28,517
I insist on this.

618
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:34,505
You have to know first what the true meaning of a home is.

619
00:42:35,983 --> 00:42:39,582
Otherwise, I don’t think you can help me sell any houses worth selling.

620
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:45,210
Look at the mess you’ve left me in, Gramps.

621
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:49,980
Kan.

622
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,210
I’ve made up my mind.

623
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,518
(I bought the house.)

624
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,765
(Thank you.)

625
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,663
(I’m looking forward to seeing you as a chef again.)

626
00:43:30,506 --> 00:43:31,814
How did you get in here?

627
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:33,693
You left your door unlocked, dude.

628
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:35,717
You broke it so how could I have locked it?

629
00:43:38,442 --> 00:43:39,416
Why are you here?

630
00:43:39,672 --> 00:43:40,411
What do you want now?

631
00:43:44,106 --> 00:43:46,533
I want to sell all of my properties

632
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:48,706
and return to America.

633
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:53,832
Why are you telling me?

634
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:58,877
You must want to make some money and buy a nice house.

635
00:44:05,493 --> 00:44:06,817
I’ll be honest with you, though.

636
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,817
I just have a really bad feeling about you, man.

637
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,819
I could say the exact same thing about you, jerk.

638
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,186
But since we both want to make some money…

639
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,718
Why don’t we work together as a team?

640
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:45,678
You gotta do that first job for free, though.

641
00:44:45,945 --> 00:44:47,709
I can never work with such a jerk.

642
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:48,428
Here we are.

Let’s go home.

647
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:54,564
This place just doesn’t feel right.

648
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,807
Those exorcists are scammers.

649
00:44:57,016 --> 00:44:58,122
I gotta do it myself.

Run!
