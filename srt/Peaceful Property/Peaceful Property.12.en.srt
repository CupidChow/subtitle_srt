1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,130
In the end,

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,413
you found me out, huh?

3
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:05,509
Before you take me to the police,

4
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:07,616
will you come to the little house with me?

5
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:10,345
What is this thing Gramps left me?

6
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:14,217
Suradech! Suradech!

7
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:15,238
Suradech!

8
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:16,438
This plate was for Home.

9
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:19,410
Arrest him, officer.

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,922
He’s the cook who poisoned our master’s dinner.

11
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:25,308
What?

12
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:39,192
Come to think of it,

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,567
we’ve been through quite a lot together.

14
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:44,671
You know,

15
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:51,100
there were times when I wondered how we’d even make it through all this.

16
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:54,681
But in the end,

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
we made it.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,862
It’s kind of unbelievable that we’re here.

19
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,605
I’d say…

20
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:17,762
This was all because we ran into each other.

21
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:27,174
There’s a word for that in English:

22
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:28,700
Destiny.

23
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:31,305
Destiny, my ass.

24
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:35,721
In our culture, this is literally what we call karma.

25
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:51,202
By the way, about the true meaning of home your Gramps kept mentioning…

26
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:53,811
Did you finally get your answer?

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,005
We’re immediately taking the patient to the hospital.

28
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:32,635
Suradech…

29
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,425
You suspects aren’t allowed to leave the crime scene.

30
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:39,474
All of you must stay for an interrogation.

31
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,136
What do you mean by “suspects”?

32
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:43,401
We’re witnesses.

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,411
“Suspects” is correct.

34
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,382
The person who cooked tonight’s dinner was you, Mr. Peach.

35
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:55,607
Anyone with internet access can see you have a reason to mean Mr. Home harm.

36
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,637
With a motive like that, it is hardly surprising you poisoned him.

37
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:02,758
It was too bad that Mr. Suradech became your collateral damage.

38
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,770
What are you talking about, old man?

39
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,755
It was Uncle Somkid who poison...

40
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:09,958
More suspicious still would be Ms. Pangpang,

41
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:12,804
who was evidently not on the guest list tonight,

42
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,825
but showed up.

43
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,290
Mr. Yai.

44
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:20,380
Are you intentionally misleading this investigation?

45
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,470
I could ask you similarly.

46
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,300
Are you hiding something from these officers, Ms. Kan?

47
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,916
- Who the hell is actually behind all this? - Peach!

48
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,862
Peach! Calm down!

49
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:31,179
You’re only playing into their hands.

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,440
How could I calm down, Pang?

51
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,904
Home has been gone with his uncle for way too long now.

52
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,619
He’s obviously in danger.

53
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,699
He’s right.

54
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:40,207
Mr. Home’s safety should be our priority.

55
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:45,208
These people must be hiding him somewhere in this mansion.

56
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,757
Close off the perimeter.

57
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:49,453
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

58
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:50,644
Yes.

59
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,205
Worse still, Mr. Home might
already have been murdered.

60
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:56,161
Peach!

61
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:57,832
Peach!

62
00:04:05,774 --> 00:04:07,671
You’re awake, my dear nephew.

63
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,608
I’m just about done getting
everything ready for you.

64
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,672
Why don’t you just relax
and wait right there for a bit?

65
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,908
I’ll tell you when this is ready.

66
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Uncle…

67
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:24,602
Why…

68
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,296
Pardon?

69
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:30,423
Why are you doing this?

70
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:32,158
Oh, my.

71
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,315
Do you actually think I really love you, Home?

72
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:38,583
You think I do just becausel call you my “dear” nephew?

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Since…

74
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,666
Since when?

75
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:48,714
Since always.

76
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:58,118
This wasn’t your fault, to be fair.

77
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:00,807
If you want someone to blame,

78
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,705
blame Somjai, your father.

79
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,813
You see, I…

80
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:11,299
freaking hated him.

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
What…

82
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,647
What does Dad have to do with this?

83
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,708
You really want to know?

84
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:25,805
Fine.

85
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,902
I’ll tell you.

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Somkid.

87
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,355
I’m home.

88
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:37,909
Come and give me a welcome home hug.

89
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,072
Somkid?

90
00:05:44,957 --> 00:05:46,487
Oh, I see.

91
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:48,377
You ain’t fooling your old man.

92
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,414
Somkid?

93
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,928
Peek-a-boo!

94
00:05:58,487 --> 00:05:59,487
Dad?

95
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:00,776
Dad, what’s wrong?

96
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,339
Dad.

97
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:01,965
Dad!

98
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:03,005
Dad!

99
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:04,493
Dad, what’s wrong?

100
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:05,722
Dad.

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,222
- Dad, what’s wrong— - Peek-a-boo!

102
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,106
I’m alright, kiddo.

103
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:16,108
I’m always alright because I’m your old man, right?

104
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:23,109
What did you do today?

105
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:25,265
Did you sneak out to work again?

106
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:27,574
I just wanted to help you.

107
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,570
Oh, my baby boy.

108
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,570
You’re the best, you know that?

109
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:36,961
Let’s see what I got for you today.

110
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:38,327
Look.

111
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,322
A piggy bank.

112
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:45,317
Save all your earnings in this piggy bank

113
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:48,429
and it’s all yours.

114
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,514
All mine?

115
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:52,597
- Yes. - Promise?

116
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:53,828
Of course.

117
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,868
Whoa.

118
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,225
- Jai… - You’re rich.

119
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:02,848
You’re going to be a millionaire one day for sure.

120
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:04,352
Give it back, Jai.

121
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,471
Jai.

122
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,317
Come on. Let’s share!

123
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,505
Give it back!

124
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:09,768
Give it back!

125
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:12,303
Ain’t no way!

126
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,386
Jai, don’t play with your brother like that.

127
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:16,179
Give it back to me, Jai!

128
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:17,721
No way!

129
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,177
Give it back!

130
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:28,416
I was always good,

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,783
waiting for the day he would stop spoiling your dad.

132
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,008
One day,

133
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,580
your Gramps finally rewarded me for being a good son.

134
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,128
Did you steal it again?

135
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:27,300
- Somkid, listen. - Give it back!

136
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Somkid.

137
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:29,749
Somkid, please.

138
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:30,986
Listen to me.

139
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,749
Don’t you see he’s in pain?

140
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,776
Don’t defend him, Dad.

141
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:36,857
He’s still a thief!

142
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,629
Somkid, listen to me.

143
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,130
Will you please hear me out?

144
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:49,502
I took your money.

145
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,564
Why… Why did you take it?

146
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:06,503
Your big brother had to go to the hospital.

147
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,960
I needed to borrow your money.

148
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:13,705
But I will give it back to you a hundredfold.

149
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:19,611
I bought you a new bank.

150
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:22,422
See?

151
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:24,736
I’m really sorry.

152
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,429
When your dad died,

153
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,320
he shifted all his affection to you.

154
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,148
I used to think that

155
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:49,120
when you ran to America after that car accident,

156
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:52,874
I’d be nice to him, gaining his favors,

157
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:57,505
and maybe he’d care about me just a little bit.

158
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:00,970
But no.

159
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:05,974
You took everything that was supposed to be mine.

160
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,801
Why didn’t you just ask me?

161
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,508
Well, did anyone ever bother freaking asking me?

162
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,204
Back then and now.

163
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:24,416
With the inheritance and everything else.

164
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,074
Take your medicine and go to bed, Dad.

165
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:32,943
Don’t stay up.

166
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
It’s bad for your health.

167
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
Hey, Somkid.

168
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:48,983
I’ve decided to leave all the real estate to Home.

169
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,111
I’ll give you the little house.

170
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,503
Are you serious?

171
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,825
Well, not just the house, of course.

172
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:04,305
I’ll give you everything inside that house, too.

173
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,638
Trash, you mean?

174
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,223
Everything inside that house is just trash!

175
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:17,721
You’re leaving me trash, Dad?

176
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:21,580
So this is what I get for being such a good son?

177
00:11:21,868 --> 00:11:24,814
Your useless grandson never does anything.

178
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,909
Why do you want to give him all that?

179
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:28,770
Exactly. He never does anything.

180
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,840
That’s why I’m leaving him the real estate.

181
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,903
Take your pills.

182
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,314
It’s time you follow your Gramps’ footsteps right into hell.

183
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,410
I’ll finally get everything that was supposed to be mine.

184
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:11,074
Yes?

185
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
(Mr. Somkid.)

186
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:16,000
(I have everything under control on my end.)

187
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,841
Everything is going according to plan.

188
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:25,619
The police are busy investigating over here.

189
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:28,320
I’ll just have to deal with the body.

190
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,400
It shouldn’t take longer than 20 minutes.

191
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,773
I left a stone right in front of the house.

192
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:34,773
(Take care of it for me.)

193
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:36,303
Yes, sir.

194
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,465
Playing hide-and-seek with your Uncle, huh?

195
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:11,531
I think not, my dear nephew.

196
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,020
Ugh!

197
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:17,545
I told you Uncle Somkid is a murderer!

198
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:21,715
Why won’t you believe me that he poisoned Home?

199
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:25,820
Both Mr. Somkid and Mr. Home weren’t even at the crime scene.

200
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:27,820
Come on, bro!

201
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,768
I think Attorney Yai is trying to do something.

202
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:49,758
I poisoned him.

203
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,174
What?

204
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:52,029
Peach.

205
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,782
What the hell are you saying?

206
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:57,666
Everyone’s free to go if I confess, right?

207
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,748
I did it all on my own.

208
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,785
None of these people know.

209
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:07,120
Arrest me and let them all go.

210
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:09,533
Mr. Peach.

211
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:12,192
You do know what you’re doing is basically…

212
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:18,951
The suspect has confessed.

213
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:21,128
Thank you for your cooperation.

214
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:24,980
Sergeant, we’re taking him to the precinct for further interrogation.

215
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:27,542
Peach.

216
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:29,057
- Please. - Peach.

217
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:30,431
Peach!

218
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Please, wait.

219
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,515
What the hell is going on?

220
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,505
Mr. Peach sacrifices himself for us.

221
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,362
Mama, that much I know.

222
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:43,927
But with just us girls, what can we do?

223
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,911
I don’t know, either.

224
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:49,114
But I believe you’ll come up with a plan.

225
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,179
Allow me to follow Attorney Yai.

226
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:53,337
Mama.

227
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,712
Mama, what should I do?

228
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,290
Home.

229
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,503
Don’t you know I never lost at this game?

230
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,623
Did you believe you could win?

231
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:34,411
I know all your tricks.

232
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,825
Are you getting rid of the evidence, sir?

233
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,798
No.

234
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:09,937
Don’t deny.

235
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,368
It’s obvious you’re...

236
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:15,520
I am, in fact, forging new evidence.

237
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:25,075
I’m honestly impressed by your naivety and honesty, Ms. Kan.

238
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,570
You must think you’re so smart

239
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:33,465
when you found all those key evidence for all those cases.

240
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:35,554
What are you talking about?

241
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,247
I’m talking about the voice record of Mr. Somkid buying off a police detective

242
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:41,983
when Mr. Home ran Mr. Peach over with his car.

243
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:45,979
Did you think we just left the thumb drive lying around all so conveniently?

244
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,308
Why did you do that?

245
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:56,377
We thought the bad thing Mr. Home did would pitch you against each other.

246
00:16:57,112 --> 00:17:01,111
But we realized the bond you made was way too strong to sever,

247
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:06,903
so I took the extreme measure of following Mr. Somkid’s plans.

248
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:11,128
Home.

249
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,811
I hired Somphorn’s chauffeur to cause that car crash.

250
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:24,035
She’s a greedy bastard and you’re a useless grandson,

251
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,423
both of whom got what they didn't deserve.

252
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,405
If I just set you both up to kill each other,

253
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,890
it would have made headlines everywhere.

254
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:43,026
Did you wonder why there was alcohol in your toxic report?

255
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,377
Clearly you know you didn’t take a single sip of that drink.

256
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,709
Kudos to the power of friendship that you survived that accident.

257
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:05,810
But it got me inspired for this new idea:

258
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:10,608
Frame your best friend for your murder and dismemberment.

259
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,025
I’m sure they’re all on their way to jail right about now.

260
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:18,179
Since you guys love each other so much,

261
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:20,441
I should send you all on your way together.

262
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:27,007
Peek-a-boo.

263
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:28,780
There you are.

264
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:50,208
You’re gonna kill your uncle now, my dear nephew?

265
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,380
Still have some fight in you, I see.

266
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,174
I’m sending your beloved grandson your way, Dad.

267
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,410
It’s still way too early for you children to beat us adults at this game.

268
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:08,905
You should learn to take the winning side sometime.

269
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,770
What?

270
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:17,509
What’s going on?

271
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,032
This place just suddenly feels so strange.

272
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:20,056
It gives me chills.

273
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:22,285
Sir, I think we should hurry up and get out of here.

274
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Right.

275
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,374
It quite pleases me to see you speechless for once, Ms. Great Attorney.

276
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:39,034
I just didn’t think it was right to interrupt a suspect who was confessing.

277
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:45,405
You should learn to take the winning side sometime, Mr. Yai.

278
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:56,651
Oh, no…

279
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,986
Sir… Sir!

280
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,290
Run!

281
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:03,754
Let’s get out of here, sir!

282
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:09,480
Pang?

283
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:10,706
Of course it’s me!

284
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:12,157
Why didn’t you go save Home first?

285
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:13,432
Pull yourself together!

286
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,269
Peach, I’m just a tiny girl.

287
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:17,761
The only person who can save him is you.

288
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:18,872
Got it?

289
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,465
Home, don’t you dare die.

290
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,176
Come on.

291
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,311
Come on.

292
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,401
Damn, you’re really easy to kill, kid.

293
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:45,309
Gramps!

294
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:06,640
Gramps!

295
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,902
Oh, don’t cry.

296
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:12,312
Or if you do, no snot on my shirt, please.

297
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:13,405
I need to look presentable.

298
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,493
What is it now?

299
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:18,014
Who made you cry this time around?

300
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Gramps.

301
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:21,148
Uncle Kid is trying to kill me.

302
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:23,595
He…

303
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:26,063
He…

304
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:27,472
He killed you.

305
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,441
Did you know that?

306
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:31,152
Of course.

307
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:34,906
Gramps.

308
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,254
I need to get back.

309
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,706
I wasn’t the only one in danger. My friends are as well.

310
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:41,305
Come on.

311
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:43,373
You just got here.

312
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,650
Won’t you sit down and chat with your old Gramps?

313
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:47,868
Old people get lonely, don’t you know?

314
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:50,007
Gramps, this ain’t no time for your jokes!

315
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:52,422
Just take it easy and sit back.

316
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,499
I have something important to tell you.

317
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,111
Not now, Gramps!

318
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,778
Now is the worst time for a story ever.

319
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:01,517
But this is the last time we get to talk.

320
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:06,282
Home.

321
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:08,111
I want you to try and understand Somkid,

322
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:12,022
and about everything that happened between me and him.

323
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:17,140
Give it to me!

324
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,515
Where do you think you’re going? Give it to me!

325
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:19,677
Give me your phone!

326
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,688
Smash it all you want.

327
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,939
I already uploaded it online.

328
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:28,302
You really don’t know when to shut up, huh?

329
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,485
Fine.

330
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:30,973
I’ll do it for you!

331
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:37,293
Mr. Suradech?

332
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:38,977
Weren’t you on your way to the hospital?

333
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:40,721
I was about to, but…

334
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:43,967
Mr. Suradech?

335
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:46,488
Suradech?

336
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:47,617
Kan!

337
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:48,754
Are you alright?

338
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,176
Suradech.

339
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,487
- Suradech.
- Are you alright, Kan?

340
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:53,558
I am.

341
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,410
Please go ahead and save Mr. Home.

342
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,225
Peach.

343
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,109
Just go.

344
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,638
I’ll take care of everything here.

345
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:00,651
Go!

346
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:01,674
Okay!

347
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:04,743
Suradech!

348
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:06,665
Mr. Suradech.

349
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:09,970
And that was the whole story.

350
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:16,965
Gramps.

351
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:22,408
Can you tell me again?

352
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,605
Don’t think you can fool me.

353
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:29,573
I know you just want to spend more time with me.

354
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:35,408
You know I’ve done my part here.

355
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:43,906
But I don’t know if this story will end the way I want it to end.

356
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:53,588
Gramps.

357
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,930
Is there really nothing you can help me with?

358
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,939
Home, I’ve been dead for way too long.

359
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:01,402
There’s really nothing I can do.

360
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:03,928
From here on out,

361
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,314
it’s the living people’s business.

362
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:16,829
Will I ever see you again?

363
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:25,317
I’m always with you.

364
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:28,087
Right here.

365
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:36,145
Gramps!

366
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:38,925
Come on!

367
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,928
You might not see me again.

368
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,379
But you’ve still got your family, Home.

369
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,711
Have a safe trip, kiddo.

370
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:50,733
Now go.

371
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:13,463
You’ve still got your family, Home.

372
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,810
No! Home!

373
00:26:44,774 --> 00:26:45,774
Peach.

374
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,284
Uncle Kid!

375
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:12,869
Where the hell did you aim at, idiot?

376
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:24,057
When I was out cold just now,

377
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:27,711
I talked to Gramps.

378
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,322
There was something you never knew.

379
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Peach.

380
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,290
Somkid.

381
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,790
Somkid, son.

382
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,080
I put it back together for you.

383
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:05,672
See?

384
00:28:08,816 --> 00:28:10,075
I’ve got another surprise.

385
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:13,903
You want me to save up money for Somjai, don’t you?

386
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,770
SAVINGS ACCOUNT

387
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,010
MR. SAMAI VIMARNSUKMAN
FOR MR. SOMKID VIMARNSUKMAN

388
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:39,080
It’s your savings account.

389
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,440
Gramps opened it and put all the savings in your name.

390
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,266
He had something he always wanted to tell you.

391
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:00,463
(To him, )

392
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:03,961
(you’re the son he was so proud of.)

393
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:05,303
Please, officer.

394
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:07,017
I just need this one favor.

395
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:10,324
(It may not always be for the right reason, )

396
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:13,558
(but you’ve always done everything for our family.)

397
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,511
When can I come home, Gramps?

398
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:19,216
I can’t wait to go back and help you sell some houses.

399
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:23,562
(The only reason Gramps left
all the real estate to me and Dad

400
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,816
(was because he knew we were useless.)

401
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,405
(He specifically chose the properties that don’t sell well.)

402
00:29:31,914 --> 00:29:33,853
(Because he wanted me to work harder than everyone

403
00:29:33,877 --> 00:29:35,677
(so I learn to appreciate every baht I earn.)

404
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,311
(And this separate inheritance, )

405
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:45,917
(he saved it for his youngest, the son he loved most.)

406
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:01,760
Gramps was still playing hide-and-seek with you.

407
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,808
He was waiting to see when his best son

408
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,909
was going to find what he was hiding.

409
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:23,376
Like you always did.

410
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:34,632
Dad…

411
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,382
Hi, guys.

412
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,688

Well, the past few weeks have felt like a lifetime for me personally.

426
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,639
Let’s recap it with news headlines.

427

Try to catch up, will you?

432
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:33,077
(Shocking news for the real estate world)

433
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,725
(when three people from the Vimarnsukman circle, )

434
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:39,275
(Mr. Somkid, Ms. Somphorn, and their attorney, Mr. Yai, )

435
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,854
(confessed to their crimes.)

436
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:44,662
I didn’t do anything!

437
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,219
You hear me? I didn’t!

438
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:48,468
It was all Somkid!

439
00:32:48,783 --> 00:32:49,512
Let go!

440
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,620
Don’t touch me!

441
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:55,917
(Mr. Somkid stated simply that he had had his closure.)

442
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:03,100
(As for Mr. Saharat, Vimarnsukman’s sole heir, )

443
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:07,010
(he held the cremation ceremony according to his grandfather’s request, )

444
00:33:07,494 --> 00:33:09,425
(which was to be joyful instead of tearful.)

445
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:10,780
Ya-ya-ya.

00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,287

Yu-yu-yu.

Gramps does laundry.

449
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:16,317
Uncle is hairy.

450
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:19,312
We share candy, then brush our teeth.

(Mr. Saharat admitted he hasn’t moved on from this, )

462
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:10,635
(but alas, life goes on.)

463
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:25,472
Rumor has it the team’s PR, Pangpang, is getting rather lonely.

464
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:26,320

(OH NO. THIS GETS SAD.)

482
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:22,487
What’s the matter?

483
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,625
What should I do?

484
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:29,863
With what?

485
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:32,804
With this?

486
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:36,961
If you don’t know where to put it, you can always donate it to charity.

487
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:39,328
Nah.

488
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,906
I’m not talking about the stove.

489
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,302
I’m talking about us…

490
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:47,604
going our own ways.

491
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
I can’t get used to it.

492
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:55,865
Home.

493
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,657
Yeah, I know.

494
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,010
You gotta follow your dreams and whatnot.

495
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:03,700
I have my own dreams to follow, too.

496
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:07,579
I think?

497
00:36:11,263 --> 00:36:14,010
Good luck with your new job as a chef.

498
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,856
I don’t know where to go anymore, though.

499
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:30,520
Well… I kinda bailed on that job in Chiang Mai.

500
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,410
I’ve moved way too many times already.

501
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:40,467
I don’t have it in me to get used to new ghosts.

502
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,817
I bet ghosts speak with a dialect in Chiang Mai so I won’t understand them anyway.

503
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:47,773
So I’m staying in Bangkok.

504
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:56,718
I think… I’m not going back to America as well.

505
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,284
Oh?

506
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:03,804
But I thought your dream was to buy a house there.

507
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:06,925
What would I go back there for...

508
00:37:08,468 --> 00:37:11,211
when my dream is here?

509
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,190
What is this?

510
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,376
- Are you messing with me again? - I’m not.

511
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:24,905
I really meant what I said.

512
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:27,845
Are you out of your mind?

513
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:29,518
Are you saying I’m your dream?

514
00:37:30,321 --> 00:37:31,401
What are you talking about?

515
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,150
I was talking about the new project.

516
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:35,561
Kan, show him.

517
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,308
Come take a look, Ms. Pang.

518
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:43,010
The name’s Pangpang, mama.

519
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
I’m only joking.

520
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:54,293
Oh my God!

521
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,580
For real?

522
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,705
Are you serious about this?

523
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:02,377
I guarantee it’s going to be wowza, awesome, and exclusive!

524
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,159

The Vimarnsukman Ghost-Hunting Company

534
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:23,109
has a new mission and new chapter now.

535
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:29,805
Let’s talk to one of the founders of this establishment, shall we?

536
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:30,280
Get to the bottom of where this idea came from.

we wouldn’t be here stuck in this traffic.

Suradech, how long will this take?

You know,

651
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:42,305
there were times when I wondered how we’d even make it through all this.

652
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:44,863
I’d say…

653
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:47,339
This was all because we ran into each other.

654
00:42:49,718 --> 00:42:52,930
There’s a word for that in English:

655
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:54,468
Destiny.

656
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:56,607

00:42:57,088 --> 00:43:01,004
In our culture, this is literally what we call karma.

Did you finally get your answer?

661
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:41,257

wherever feels like home

663
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:45,573
is home.

00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,520

665
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:54,617
