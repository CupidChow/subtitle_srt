1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I think he’ll definitely come back if you cook for him.

2
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:07,048
People hate Vimarnsukman

3
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:09,982
because of the curse our family carries.

4
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:11,980
I’ll undo our family curse!

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,613
I think Kan also has something to do with the car crash.

6
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:21,697
Maybe Kan has a grudge against your family?

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,417
I’ll finally get revenge for us…

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Dad.

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,706
All you do is work.

10
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:49,688
You should eat more, Dad.

11
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,342
Here.

12
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:54,195
Well, I don’t see anything worth eating around here.

13
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,875
It’s always just some damn pork congee.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,830
Fine.

15
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:01,760
Thanks, dear.

16
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,457
Oh, lady, would you take it easy with that?

17
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,960
I guess your sweet tooth is incurable, is it?

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,515
Appropriate, don’t you think?

19
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:22,977
For the daughter of a candy maker to have a sweet tooth?

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Kan.

21
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,377
I’m sorry.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,640
I’m sorry this is all I know how to do.

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,284
I couldn’t send you to a better school with better friends.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,493
What?

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,440
Come on.

26
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,440
You have the coolest job, Dad.

27
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,440
Every other dad pales in comparison.

28
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,155
No other dads are community leaders

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,724
taking care of hundreds of lives like you do, you know?

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,751
Sweet tooth and a sweet talker, I see.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,955
Guess all that sugar really seeps into you, huh?

32
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,377
Are you Mr. Sing?

33
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,031
This man’s name is Samai Vimarnsukman.

34
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:30,393
- He was one of our country’s biggest real estate moguls.
SAMAI VIMARNSUKMAN IN TOP 5 RICHEST REAL ESTATE MOGULS

35
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:35,262
12 years ago, this man came to our community Khlong Sai Dang

36
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:39,742
to negotiate buying vast lands for a grand project of his dreams.

37
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,040
His grand scheme was to build a brand new avenue

38
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:47,804
on an 11-acre expanse right in the middle of our community.

39
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,675
His promise to us was that once this avenue was built,

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,142
our community could return and set up our businesses here.

41
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:56,728
Which meant that everyone in the community

42
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,430
must relocate to a tiny apartment building

43
00:03:58,462 --> 00:03:59,984
prepared by the Vimarnsukmans in the meantime.

44
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:03,760
SLUM IN THE CITY KHLONG SAI DANG
- Hello, my beloved people of Khlong Sai Dang.

45
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,911
My name is Samai Vimarnsukman.

46
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:08,684
This is my son, Somkid Vimarnsukman.

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,955
In the latest news that shocks the real estate world…

48
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:15,884
Sing, the community leader of Khlong Sai Dang at the time, disagreed.

49
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:18,071
All of you are liars.

50
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:18,977
Get out!

51
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,044
Hear me out!

52
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,831
- Get out! - It’s a promise!

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,746
These rich people are not to be trusted.

54
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,800
If they ever got their claws on our lands,

55
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:31,306
there is just no way they would let us stay.

56
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,173
It’s impossible.

57
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,288
Hey! Hey!

58
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,937
But with his disease-stricken body,

59
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:41,360
Sing was never able to make a change on his own.

60
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:43,493
AVENUE KHLONG SAI DANG WELCOMES MYRIAD OF SHOPPERS

61
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,051
Worse still, once the avenue was built,

62
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:48,269
- only chain stores and luxury brands took up spaces inside.
PROTEST LEADER AGAINST VIMARNSUKMAN FELL ILL

63
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:50,453
Sing’s condition got worse with the situation.

64
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:53,982
SAY NO TO VIMARNSUKMAN
- But we stood our firm and carried on the fire he started.

65
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:57,546
We won’t stop fighting until we win.

#SAVEKHLONGSAIDANG

68
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:07,208
This is a part of the video exposing the Vimarnsukman family

69
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:10,213
from the people of Khlong Sai Dang

70
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:12,586
that is currently going viral online.

71
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:14,251
ONWARDS WITH LAWSUIT AGAINST VIMARNSUKMAN
- We are confident this time

72
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:17,537
that the Vimarnsukman family will go down.

73
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,160
We are confident that we will win.

74
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:20,980
Am I right?

75
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:21,911
Yes!

76
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:26,640
Mr. Direk, or Pok, the current community leader of Khlong Sai Dang,

77
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:28,017
has confirmed that

78
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:33,448
they have the evidence to go on with the lawsuit against Vimarnsukman.

79
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,204
Does this mean that Kan only worked for you

80
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:46,355
just so she could get her revenge?

81
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,955
Now everything makes sense.

82
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:53,751
It explains your family’s stolen document, and…

83
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:56,710
the car crash you were in.

84
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:02,124
I actually don’t remember much from that car crash.

85
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,208
But I can’t bring myself to believe Kan wants to hurt me.

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I think…

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
We need to see Kan.

88
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:13,928
If we go to her,

89
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:16,484
the only ghosts we’ll be seeing today will be our own, brother.

90
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,973
The whole community is hellbent on burying your family alive.

91
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,328
You want to go through a stampede of feet just to see Kan?

92
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,340
I need to talk this out with Kan.

93
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,724
And I want to fix what’s happened with this community.

94
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,666
I bet the family curse Gramps talked about

95
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,471
has something to do with this community.

96
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,822
Fine.

97
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,395
How’d you plan to get in the building?

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Oh!

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,164
They are going to sue Vimarnsukman this evening.

100
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:47,022
They invite reporters and online personalities to their community.

101
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,304
What does that have to do with you?

102
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:51,502
Did you not hear me say “online personalities”?

103
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,377
We’re kinda…

104
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,231
famous like that.

105
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,230
Kan.

106
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:10,168
I have everything ready according to plan.

107
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:15,342
Are you sure the Vimarnsukmans won’t turn the table on us this time around?

108
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,342
With all the news outlets we invited today,

109
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:22,115
there’s just no way Mr. Somkid can buy all of them off.

110
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,155
And we have the original contract that will guarantee our victory in court.

111
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,355
There’s no need to worry, Pok.

112
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,560
I’ll go talk to the reporters.

113
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:35,946
They must be here by now.

114
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,470
Yes.

115
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,351
Dad.

116
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,973
We’ll finally get our revenge on the Vimarnsukmans.

117
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,582
What you’ve always wanted is about to come true.

118
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,017
Kan, dear.

119
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:04,595
Can you come over here and help me with this paper?

120
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,590
Of course.

121
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,915
We invited you all today as witnesses

122
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,768
to what the Vimarnsukman family has taken from us.

123
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,120
They deserve to be exposed.

124
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:24,320
Get out!

125
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,546
Get out!

126
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:27,040
Vimarnsukman, get out!

127
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:28,302
Get out!

128
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:30,826
Stomp them to the ground!

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,982
Get out!

130
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:32,800
Vimarnsukman, get out!

131
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:33,835
Home.

132
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,008
You sure you want to get in there?

133
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:37,271
Hell yeah.

134
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,737
One question, though.

135
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,373
Why do I have to put on this getup?

136
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,453
You’re Mr. Saharat Vimarnsukman.

137
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,577
I was once a victim.

138
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:48,570
I would blend right in with them if I wanted to.

139
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,613
What’s your problem?

140
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:52,200
But I don’t want to wear this.

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,991
It’s itchy and hot.

142
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,558
It’s squeezing my brain so much it hurts.

143
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:57,937
I feel like I’m going to pass out.

144
00:08:57,982 --> 00:09:01,804
Hey, can you save the spoiled rich brat act for later?

145
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:02,800
We need to get going now.

146
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:03,844
Get going where?

147
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Well…

148
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,906
We…

149
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:17,742
We were also exploited by the Vimarnsukman family.

150
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
You were?

151
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,622
Yes, sir.

152
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:28,542
I think you might have seen me and my brother around for a bit.

153
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,137
You must be Peach, the chef who got hit-and-run.

154
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,670
Yes.

155
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,857
Who are these two?

156
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:46,533
Uh, these are…

157
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,026
They are…

158
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:50,986
Witnesses!

159
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:51,537
Right.

160
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:57,057
They were there when my big brother here got hit by that car.

161
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,340
Then why are you acting so suspicious?

162
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,431
We…

163
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:11,680
We just want to join you guys!

164
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,400
Am I right?

165
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,360
What happened to the Vimarnsukmans was hardly enough!

166
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:24,933
Scumbags like them deserve a fate worse than that.

167
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,528
We will take their home!

168
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,190
We will put them on stakes!

169
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,115
Punch their guts!

170
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:33,848
Pull their hair!

171
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,760
Then we will all splay on their treasure!

172
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,573
Very good!

173
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,746
Get in! Come on in!

174
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:43,310
Go on!

175
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:45,226
Right?

176
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:46,968
Go on inside.

177
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,982
That was easy peasy lemon squeezy.

178
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,870
Pang.

179
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,610
I think this is a bit weird.

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,302
Think we don’t know who you are, do you?

183
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Get them!

184
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,324
Let go! Let go!

185
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,995
You knew all along?

186
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,475
Of course.

187
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,800
Kan told me you’d use such a cheap trick.

188
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:56,364
We know you’re Home in disguise!

189
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,380
Not him.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,386
How kind of you to just show up on our doorstep!

191
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:09,306
Sir, hear me out.

192
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:11,300
I didn’t mean to hide my identity.

193
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:16,764
I just came here to see if there’s anything I can help you with.

194
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,480
Like grandfather, like grandson.

195
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:22,240
We all saw your uncle’s interview.

196
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,008
VIMARNSUKMAN TO COUNTERSUE
- Like I said,

197
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:29,360
our family plans to sue whoever is making this fake news.

198
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:32,435
There are so many cases. Do you plan to sue everyone?

199
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,151
Whatever you do,

200
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:39,297
Kan and the rest of us will never forgive you.

201
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:44,711
Somkid.

202
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,764
How could you have let things get so out of hand?

203
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:51,662
What are you going to do with all the reporters outside?

204
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,200
I can handle the reporters just fine.

205
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:57,804
But I need to know the whole truth of this situation.

206
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,751
What?

207
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:01,128
What are you talking about?

208
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:07,031
What actually happened after Dad bought all the lands in Khlong Sai Dang

209
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:08,064
and entrusted the project to you?

210
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,248
I was clearly his favorite daughter.

211
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:13,991
What exactly did you do to make the people in that community so angry?

212
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
Do you realize how big this situation has become?

213
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,946
So let me ask you honestly…

214
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,897
Are you hiding something from me?

215
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,973
Oh, no!

216
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,017
My tummy!

217
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,230
My tummy hurts!

218
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,000
Get me out of here.

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,377
I don’t want to be here.

220
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,884
My tummy!

221
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,715
Sir, will you please hear me out?

222
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:49,710
I’m sure there’s been a misunderstanding.

223
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,946
There was no misunderstanding.

224
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,888
The contract is clear enough.

225
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,457
Contract?

226
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,577
Are you saying there’s a hole in that contract?

227
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,204
We read through it thoroughly!

228
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,964
For our community.

229
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,093
Then what actually happened?

230
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,946
Once we signed that contract,

231
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:19,395
someone forged a fake copy.

232
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,200
The original contract states very clearly

233
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:28,364
that we have full right to return to the avenue.

234
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,786
Where’s the original contract, then?

235
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:35,333
It’s right in our hands.

236
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:36,782
Then…

237
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,968
That means…

238
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,257
You’re right.

239
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:44,586
Your Vimarnsukman family will never win.

240
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,973
Good! We’re all set, then?

241
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,026
What?

242
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:56,355
What do you mean?

243
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,306
You guys will win this fight

244
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,955
while I get to undo my Gramps’ curse.

245
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:03,626
It’s mission complete all around!

246
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,577
We’re all done.

247
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:05,928
Quit it with your nice guy act!

248
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:08,177
Sir, I’m not acting.

249
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,266
I told you I’m really here to help.

250
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:13,688
Like, can you please grab my phone for me?

251
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,244
Hello, Home. What’s up?

252
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,066
Uncle Kid.

253
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:29,580
I know all about the false contract.

254
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,302
Sorry?

255
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,942
You never heard of this before, did you?

256
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,500
What false contract?

257
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,164
The original contract states that

258
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,973
the people in this community could return to the avenue.

259
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:52,311
But someone from our side forged a false contract and changed that.

260
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,164
The original contract is now in these people’s hands.

261
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:00,657
And it checks out with everything they’re protesting for.

262
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,524
We really are in the wrong, Uncle.

263
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,386
There is no need to sue them back.

264
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:11,142
Home.

265
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,666
You know what damage this would do to Vimarnsukman?

266
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,755
I do.

267
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,417
But Gramps never taught us to take advantage of anyone.

268
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,604
Please, Uncle.

269
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:29,466
Let’s do this right.

270
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,488
I get it now.

271
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,026
I’ll handle it from here.

272
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,391
Phorn.

273
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,706
We need to talk.

274
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:01,813
Those idiots!

275
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,626
I have to take care of this myself again.

276
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,368
I’ve helped you.

277
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:17,164
Will you please help me now?

278
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,973
It’s all an act.

279
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:23,520
You think we would soften up just because of this?

280
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,170
Hey.

281
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,217
Somkid is on the news.

282
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,004
Our family has reevaluated the situation,

283
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:37,288
- and decided to back down from countersuing.
VIMARNSUKMAN BACKS DOWN

284
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:42,204
We are willing to negotiate everything with the Khlong Sai Dang community.

285
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,595
As for all previous lawsuits,

286
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,760
we will trust the judges to make the right decisions.

287
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,284
What are they trying to do?

288
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,151
I told you we’re just trying to help.

289
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,955
I have one request in return.

290
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:06,300
Can we please see Kan one more time?

291
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,755
I really need to talk to her.

292
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:26,013
Come in.

293
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,728
Wait here.

294
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,422
Pok is fetching Kan for you.

295
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,150
Don’t touch anything.

296
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,960
We have eyes and ears everywhere.

297
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:39,355
There.

298
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,470
Hey.

299
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,084
Isn’t this Kan and the man on the news, Sing?

300
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,370
You didn’t know he’s her father?

301
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,690
Hey.

302
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:12,693
DAY 1 VIMARNSUKMAN INVASION

303
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:14,124
SAMAI: REAL ESTATE MOGUL

304
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:15,982
SOMKID: DAMAGE CONTROL

305
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:18,497
HOME: ESCAPED CONVICT

306
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,884
So… Kan’s been spying all along?

307
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,235
But I still don’t understand why she’d hold such a grudge on you, Home.

308
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,608
She deserves to do even worse.

309
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:37,546
You don’t know what she’s been through.

310
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,964
Sir, those scumbags lied to me.

311
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,960
They meant to take advantage of us!

312
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:49,960
They forged that contract!

313
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,471
They need to pay.

314
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,890
Dad?

315
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:00,942
Dad!

316
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:01,995
What’s wrong?

317
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,853
Help! Help!

318
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:05,897
Dad.

319
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,550
What happened?

320
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:08,533
He just fell.

321
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:09,057
Sing!

322
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,093
Sing!

323
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,271
Hey, where do you think you’re going?

324
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,713
The bridge is closed for renovation.

325
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:23,470
You can’t go through here.

326
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
We have to.

327
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,173
My dad needs to go to the hospital.

328
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:29,106
Dad!

329
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,382
Dad!

330
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,380
Dad, please hang in there!

331
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:33,417
Dad!

332
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,290
Dad…

333
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:36,862
Let us through!

334
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,186
You need to go around it.

335
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,860
Dad, hang in there.

336
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:43,253
Hang in there.

337
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,604
Why are you doing this!

338
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,275
Why!

339
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:22,000
Is Mr. Sing here?

340
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:33,697
What’s wrong, Home?

341
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,023
You’re not wearing the wig anymore so don’t you blame it.

342
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,582
I don’t know.

343
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,260
Maybe there’s some issues with my ears or something.

344
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,946
Hey, don’t go in there.

345
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Peach.

346
00:21:56,826 --> 00:21:57,857
Peach.

347
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,530
Peach...

348
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Sir.

349
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,800
Mr. Sing is still… alive, isn’t he?

350
00:22:29,066 --> 00:22:31,280
Peach, what’s the matter?

351
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,380
It’s…

352
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:41,964
Home?

353
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,497
What are you doing here?

354
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,857
Get out right now.

355
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,008
Get out of here.

356
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,600
I said get out!

357
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:02,622
Kan...

358
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,053
Get out of here.

359
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:05,275
Go!

360
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:06,462
Kan.

361
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:07,964
Kan. Kan.

362
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,351
Please hear me out.

363
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:10,773
Kan, hear me out.

364
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:12,151
We need to talk.

365
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:13,635
No, we don’t.

366
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:15,191
I heard everything.

367
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:16,897
Go home.

368
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:19,235
I’m not leaving until we clear things up between us.

369
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,230
There’s nothing to clear up.

370
00:23:21,288 --> 00:23:24,480
I only got into your family to get this revenge.

371
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,480
Everything is about to come to an end.

372
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,973
I won’t let it.

373
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Kan.

374
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,822
Are you going to say that

375
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,444
everything that we’ve been through and built together

376
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,386
has been a lie?

377
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,530
Yes.

378
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:02,586
Now go home.

379
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:05,608
There’s no reason for us to see each other ever again.

380
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,560
Throw them out.

381
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:09,991
Kan.

382
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:10,684
Kan.

383
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:12,355
Kan, wait. Kan!

384
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,617
Kan, talk to me!

385
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,564
Kan, please. Kan.

386
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:16,608
Kan!

387
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,000
Let’s set up a tighter watch on the safety box

388
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:22,337
and put more men around the building.

389
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:23,520
Please keep in mind that

390
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:25,520
unless we’re through with this,

391
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,182
we can’t let them back in here.

392
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,217
Of course.

393
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,342
Don’t come back!

394
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,742
What the hell’s wrong with them?

395
00:24:49,786 --> 00:24:51,377
Let’s just go, Home.

396
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:53,084
If Kan doesn’t want to see us anymore,

397
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:54,720
we’d better leave her alone.

398
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:58,020
I think something’s not right.

399
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,751
When we were in her room,

400
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:01,426
didn’t you feel something, too, Pangpang?

401
00:25:01,964 --> 00:25:03,960
Something’s not right, you said?

402
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:06,610
Was it because Peach got goosebumps?

403
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,982
No.

404
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:09,980
I’m talking about Kan.

405
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,370
I have something to tell you guys as well.

406
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,742
This might sound strange,

407
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,497
but when we were in that room,

408
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,702
I saw the ghost of Mr. Sing standing right next to his bed.

409
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:25,857
What?

410
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:27,342
That’s not possible.

411
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:30,364
Mr. Sing is still alive.

412
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:32,595
That’s why I said it was strange.

413
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,320
Pang. Home.

414
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,880
Can we stay a bit longer?

415
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Peach.

416
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,955
You’re just following your intuition, aren’t you?

417
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,493
I don’t want to leave things at loose ends as well.

418
00:25:52,515 --> 00:25:54,231
Let’s do what we can do.

419
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:06,373
PUBLIC PANTRY

420
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,937
Look.

421
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:17,991
Remember their faces.

422
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,635
Do not let them step foot here again.

423
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:21,964
If you see them, get them.

424
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,008
Of course.

425
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,195
Hey, that’s them!

426
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,617
Sure are!

427
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,133
Pangpang and Suradech is back!

428
00:26:32,168 --> 00:26:33,768
Catch us if you ca...

429
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:34,813
Catch them!

430
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:37,040
Go, go!

431
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,915
Mr. Sing.

432
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,297
My name is Peach.

433
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:26,560
Will you please let me know what exactly you want to say to us?

434
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:30,417
If you have anything you’d like to say to Kan,

435
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:32,666
feel free to pass it on.

436
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,982
I’m exhausted.

437
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:09,866
We shook them off, didn’t we, Suradech?

438
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,080
What were you thinking coming back here?

439
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,040
Where are Home and Peach?

440
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:41,573
What do you want to say, Mr. Sing?

441
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,546
Do you want revenge on the Vimarnsukmans?

442
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:22,900
Home, what’s wrong?

443
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,031
I’m okay.

444
00:29:25,075 --> 00:29:26,097
Talk to him.

445
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:33,644
“...lots.”

446
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:40,573
What?

447
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,782
What are you doing here?

448
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,728
Come and take them away.

449
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:56,213
Get out!

450
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,466
Wait, let me talk to him!

451
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,782
Stop moving!

452
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,000
What is wrong with you?

453
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:10,000
Why are you bothering my father?

454
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:11,582
Kan, listen.

455
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:15,182
We sneaked in because Mr. Sing’s ghost has something to say.

456
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,733
My father isn’t dead.

457
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:19,395
He’s still breathing.

458
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:22,488
I don’t get how this works, either.

459
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:23,869
But will you please let me talk to him, Kan?

460
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:24,893
Stop it!

461
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,271
Stop saying Dad’s dead!

462
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,497
Don’t you want to know what he has to say?

463
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,342
Get out!

464
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,022
Kan, please hear me out.

465
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:38,057
No!

466
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,088
Kan.

467
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:42,684
If he had something to say, he would tell you people to leave!

468
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,808
“Make lots of friends, Grumpy Face.”

469
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,128
I heard a man say…

470
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:01,164
Make lots of friends.

471
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,977
“Make lots of friends.”

472
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,928
“Grumpy Face.”

473
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
That’s not true.

474
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,964
Even if it was my dad, he would never say that

475
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
My dad would never say that!

476
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:30,133
Why are you lying?

477
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:31,955
Dad didn’t say that!

478
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,271
It’s not true.

479
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:34,497
You’re lying!

480
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:35,822
You’re lying!

481
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:37,093
You’re lying!

482
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,813
Dad didn’t say that. He didn’t.

483
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:44,204
Why are you freaking lying?

484
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,551
Why?

485
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:54,328
Thief!

486
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,342
Hey, what’s that?

487
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:05,991
What’s going on?

488
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,440
Call the fire department!

489
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,546
Thief!

490
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,022
It’s gotta be someone hired by the Vimarnsukmans.

491
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,737
Did you do this?

492
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:27,773
Did you!

493
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:28,737
No.

494
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Just get him!

495
00:32:31,608 --> 00:32:32,608
Stop!

496
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:36,902
Kan.

497
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,453
Hey, stop it!

498
00:32:38,497 --> 00:32:39,497
Wait.

499
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,450
Wait, guys.

500
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,497
Enough.

501
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:44,017
Please, stop!

502
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,053
Please!

503
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
“Make lots of friends.”

504
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,671
“Grumpy Face.”

505
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:57,995
Stop!

506
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,186
Kan, help him!

507
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:19,608
Dad.

508
00:33:19,786 --> 00:33:20,942
Dad!

509
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,942
Dad!

510
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Stay with me.

511
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:30,710
Please, stay with me.

512
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,320
Home. Home!

513
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,920
Good thing I have just enough time to have breakfast with you today.

514
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,302
I have to be off to work soon, though.

515
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,482
This job is actually taking a toll on me, I just realized.

516
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:16,213
I finally got to work with the Vimarnsukman heir, Home.

517
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:19,724
I got to try one of my colleagues’ food the other day.

518
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:21,013
It was really good.

519
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:36,653
Dad.

520
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,004
Home was in a car crash last night.

521
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,413
You must be happy

522
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,591
to see at least one Vimarnsukman pay for what they did, right?

523
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,097
You can get mad at me for this,

524
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,870
but…

525
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,955
I really couldn’t let him die.

526
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Hello.

527
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,751
There’s been a car accident.

528
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Hold it.

529
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,333
There’s a saying that people with a sweet tooth are grumpy.

530
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:22,622
You’re the living proof of it.

531
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,760
If you know I’m grumpy, you should probably stop messing with me.

532
00:36:25,822 --> 00:36:26,822
Give it to me.

533
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,431
Take it easy on that resting grumpy face, why don’t you?

534
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:35,697
You’re nearly in college and I never see you make one friend, dear.

535
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,884
I don’t need friends.

536
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,466
I have you, Dad.

537
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,591
I’ve got something to show you.

538
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,822
I have heart arrhythmia

539
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
and coronary artery disease.

540
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,955
I don’t know how long I’ll be able to stay here messing with you.

541
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,150
No.

542
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,880
You’ll just have to wait.

543
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:19,964
I’ll go to nursing school or medical school or whatever it is that will help you.

544
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:21,001
- Alright? - Kan.

545
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,453
Be calm and listen to me.

546
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,973
No parents can stay with their kids for the rest of their lives.

547
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,591
You need friends.

548
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:55,786
If you can do that,

549
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,773
I’ll let you have this one.

550
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,373
Promise me this.

551
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,995
You will smile more

552
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,222
and make lots of friends.

553
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:15,582
Live happier.

554
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,297
Alright, Grumpy Face?

555
00:38:58,764 --> 00:38:59,982
Mr. Home…

556
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,955
You can stop.

557
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,040
Well?

558
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,177
Did you get it?

559
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,248
It was quite a hassle to steal, Ms. Somphorn.

560
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,302
Give it to me.

561
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,650
Here.

562
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Thank you.

563
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Put this on.

564
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,217
What is it?

565
00:40:13,262 --> 00:40:15,662
Just put it on if you don’t want to get hurt.

566
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,075
No surprise he’s out cold.

567
00:41:31,137 --> 00:41:34,524
He’s been running around all day without eating anything.

568
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,031
You must be tired, too, Kan.

569
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:38,337
Would you like something to eat?

570
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:45,315
I’ll help.

571
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,075
Let me get that for you.

572
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,284
Hey, Home.

573
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,810
Time for dinner.

574
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,568
Where’s Kan?

575
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:02,226
Over there.

576
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,351
Oh.

577
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,195
Mr. Home.

578
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,586
That night,

579
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,640
when you were in the car crash, I...

580
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:25,982
No need to explain.

581
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,822
I’m starting to remember bits and pieces from that night now.

582
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,690
You called the ambulance.

583
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,675
Thank you.

584
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,955
Ah.

585
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,551
Ah.

586
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:51,040
Ah.

587
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:53,040
Ah.

588
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,986
Hmm, so good.

589
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,315
It’s so good.

590
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,426
Are you not mad at me at all after everything that I’ve done?

591
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:13,360
We’re not gonna hold anything against you when this spoiled brat isn’t.

592
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,613
Don’t worry about the stolen contract, Kan.

593
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:23,120
I’ll get it back for you.

594
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,000
I promised Gramps I’ll save this community.

595
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,146
Oh, right. You don’t know this yet, Kan.

596
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:34,355
When Home’s heart stopped beating,

597
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:35,973
he met his grandfather.

598
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,871
Cool, isn’t it?

599
00:43:38,906 --> 00:43:42,684
Gramps told me to undo some family curse.

600
00:43:47,546 --> 00:43:49,540
You’re laughing like you don’t believe me.

601
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:50,951
No.

602
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,213
I believe you.

603
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,848
One thing I’m curious about, though.

604
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,862
Who stole the contract?

605
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,982
KHLONG SAI DANG PROJECT

606
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,324
What’s wrong, mama?

607
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,804
I’m thinking that maybe the family curse Mr. Home mentioned

608
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,853
has nothing to do with my community.

609
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:41,866
- Home? - Home!

610
00:44:41,902 --> 00:44:42,737
Home!

611
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:43,840
Home! Home!

612
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:44,480
What’s wrong?

613
00:44:44,524 --> 00:44:45,306
Home! Home!

614
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:46,351
Home! Home!

615
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:47,848
Home, wake up!

616
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,040
Home, wake up!

617
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:50,093
Home!
