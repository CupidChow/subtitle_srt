What happened to Girl Power, mama?

183
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:42,914
Legally speaking, each individual has only one “mama,” Ms. Pangpang.

184
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,179
Fine.

185
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:50,382
I’ll tell you.

186
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:58,349
Peach really did work for Chef Hong.

187
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,014
He admired Chef Hong so much

188
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:07,001
that he applied for a job at her restaurant.

189
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:10,777
To be selected as a new chef here,

190
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:14,475
you will be tested on how well you cut vegetables.

191
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:18,811
I’ll evaluate you on your speed and the consistency of the vegetables.

192
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:20,379
Let’s begin.

193
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:40,028
Don’t mind it.

194
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:41,128
Focus on your task.

195
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:41,909
Don’t stop.

196
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,105
Sorry.

197
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:17,306
Chef…

198
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,680
Are you alright?

199
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:22,909
Chef?

200
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,149
Get yourself together.

201
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,903
That’s chitterlings.

202
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,170
Anything can happen in the kitchen.

203
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:49,518
A jumpy thing like you wouldn’t survive as a chef.

204
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,451
So not only are you a scaredy cat, but also a quitter?

205
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:13,808
I didn’t criticize you so you’d give up.

206
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,028
I wanted you to improve.

207
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,722
Your name is Peach, isn’t it?

208
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,001
Yes.

209
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,401
Your vegetables turn out quite pretty when you’re not panicking.

210
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:36,137
If you can keep this up,

211
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:39,202
having a future as a chef isn’t too far out of reach at all.

212
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:47,608
I’ll take both of you into my kitchen.

213
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,407
It’s still too early to celebrate.

214
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:59,905
You have to work on your jumpy tendency while working here.

215
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:04,207
Understood?

216
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:05,900
Yes.

217
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,317
I’ll do my best, Chef.

218
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:11,977
(Chef Hong seemed like an uptight scary lady.)

219
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:15,303
(But she was in fact very soft at heart.)

220
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,008
Best, you got it? Hurry up.

221
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:21,837
Of course, Chef.

222
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,407
Look over here, Chef.

223
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:27,216
(Peach saw her as a role model.)

224
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,407
(He worked hard to improve his skills for months.)

225
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,034
I’m off, bro.

226
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:52,783
Bye, Best.

227
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:08,761
What are you doing?

228
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,604
I don’t mind you practicing your knife work.

229
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,668
But you need to be careful.

230
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,117
Sorry.

231
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,222
Mr. Chai-Un will be dining at our restaurant soon.

232
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:40,779
Do you want to work as my sous-chef that day?

233
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:44,263
Sous-chef?

234
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,217
You want me to assist you?

235
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,915
Well, that’s what it means!

236
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:51,579
Did you not hear me?

237
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:54,903
Well?

238
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:57,505
Yes, I want to, Chef.

239
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,820
Thank you.

240
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:28,303
(Peach’s heart stopped in that accident.)

241
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,207
Are you Mr. Santiphap’s relative?

242
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:44,629
I regret to inform you that the patient didn’t make it.

243
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:48,992
I’m really sorry.

244
00:17:55,514 --> 00:17:59,718
(Peach was gone right when he was about to achieve his dream.)

245
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,924
Doctor, we got his pulse back!

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,570
(MR. SANTIPHAP TANTITAYMITR)

247
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,168
Excuse me, sir.

248
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,226
Do you know what time it is?

249
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:57,730
Oh, you’re awake.

250
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:04,266
Excuse me.

251
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:05,905
What time is it?

252
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:09,410
I couldn’t hear what the uncle on the next bed said.

253
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:11,299
Sorry?

254
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:15,583
The patient on the next bed… died this morning.

255
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:28,782
What?

256
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,426
You saw a ghost?

257
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,328
You don’t have to believe me.

258
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,219
I know it sounds absolutely crazy.

259
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,807
Of course I believe you.

260
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,062
But what will you do now?

261
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,337
I don’t know.

262
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,905
I just know I can’t show up to work tomorrow in this condition.

263
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,906
The opportunity is slipping right through my fingers, Pang.

264
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,054
Peach.

265
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:11,983
Being a chef is your dream, right?

266
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,317
Don’t give up.

267
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:21,582
Just ignore those ghosts.

268
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,708
Don’t let them stand in the way of your dream.

269
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:29,155
Who knows?

270
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,924
Maybe there’s no ghosts at the restaurant.

271
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:33,140
Right?

272
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,711
The food will be served earlier than usual today

273
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,768
since Mr. Chai-Un has irregular digestive enzymes.

274
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,177
He is also severely allergic to legumes.

275
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:08,706
Make sure no ingredients with beans or nuts are added to any of the dishes.

276
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:09,869
Understood?

277
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,909
Yes, Chef!

278
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,302
There’s no ghosts here.

279
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,226
Don’t be afraid.

280
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:18,324
There’s no ghosts—

281
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,934
Peach.

282
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:20,019
Y–Yes, Chef?

283
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,650
What’s happened to your face?

284
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:23,808
You look beat.

285
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,508
I… I tripped and fell.

286
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:29,740
It looks more serious than that.

287
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,626
Be more careful.

288
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:35,674
Come with me.

289
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,108
I want to introduce you to someone.

290
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,019
This is Chef Peach, my sous-chef for today, sir.

291
00:21:51,262 --> 00:21:51,908
Hello.

292
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:54,300
Bless you.

293
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,374
I’ll be in your care, Chef Peach.

294
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,004
Of course.

295
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:01,847
Chef Hong, would you mind preparing another set of food?

296
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,502
On-An happens to tag along with me today.

297
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:07,945
Of course.

298
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:10,681
I will prepare a set of offering for your luk thep doll—

299
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:11,509
Chef Hong!

300
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,908
Don’t listen to her.

301
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,115
Chef Hong, do not call her a doll.

302
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:19,965
This is On-An.

303
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:21,405
She’s my daughter.

304
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,709
Of course.

305
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:29,302
Peach.

306
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:30,712
What’s wrong?

307
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,414
It’s nothing.

308
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,090
Hurry up, everyone.

309
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:56,300
Three minutes left before the first dish is served.

310
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:57,485
Yes, Chef!

311
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,008
Peach, focus!

312
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:11,905
Everyone’s in a rush here.

313
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,976
Yes, Chef.

314
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:14,967
I’m sorry.

315
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:41,302
Heaven.

316
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,705
You have never once disappointed me, Chef Hong.

317
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:47,909
Thank you, sir.

318
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,622
Excuse me, Chef Hong.

319
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:59,306
What did you put in this dish?

320
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,402
The meat is A5 beef imported from Gobe.

321
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:06,514
Sir?

322
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:07,817
Sir!

323
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,002
Did you put any beans in the food?

324
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,520
We informed you beforehand that the master is deadly allergic.

325
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:23,108
Peach.

326
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,103
What oil did you use when you made this?

327
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:32,905
I’m not sure.

328
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,613
Is that the reason why Mr. Peach has such a terrible tremor

329
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,816
that he had to quit being a chef?

330
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,577
No.

331
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:55,604
It was more complicated than that.

Peach just couldn’t work as a chef again.

362

00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:04,968
We tried everything.

366
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:06,642
He went to a doctor.

367
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,320
He even volunteered to cook at a temple to get used to seeing ghosts.

368
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,102
He wears glasses even when his vision is perfect.

369
00:28:14,703 --> 00:28:16,779
None of it has helped.

370
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:19,902
I’m sorry.

371
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:26,173
But I don’t think Peach can help you this time around.

372
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:29,302
Please try to understand him, Home.

373
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,765
Hello, Chef Hong.

374
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,118
My name is Home.

375
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:10,111
I’m friends with Peach.

376
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:14,764
I know you’re still here, Chef.

377
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,314
Can you help Peach so he can be a chef again?

378
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:38,011
Chef, come on!

379
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:40,306
Don’t you feel bad for him?

380
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:42,471
Come on out, Chef.

381
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:43,457
Chef.

382
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:45,472
Chef.

383
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,290
(MR. HUG COOKING GAS)

384
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,506
Oh, Home?

385
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:22,909
Good timing.

386
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:24,214
Hungry?

387
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,207
Nah, I’ll only be here a minute.

388
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:30,518
I’ll go as soon as we’re done talking about our ghost-hunting at the restaurant.

389
00:30:36,237 --> 00:30:37,179
What more is there to talk about?

390
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:39,720
I told you I’m not doing it.

391
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:41,908
You have to.

392
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,782
Did you forget what it says in the contract you willingly signed?

393
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,968
Threatening me with that won’t work.

394
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:53,705
I said I’m not doing it.

395
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,706
You’re really scared outta your mind of Chef Hong’s ghost, aren’t you?

396
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,980
Yeah, I know about you and Chef Hong.

397
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,121
How long are you going to keep running?

398
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:04,102
She’s just one damn ghost.

399
00:31:04,223 --> 00:31:06,385
You’ve faced far scarier ghosts, haven’t you?

400
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,204
You don’t know anything so just shut the hell up!

401
00:31:10,773 --> 00:31:13,506
You’ll have to have killed someone to understand my feelings!

402
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:17,496
Yeah, I don’t know jack about any of this!

403
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,536
All I know is you gotta exorcise her ghost for me

404
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:21,401
because I’ve already sold the place to make a condominium!

405
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,017
And if you refuse this time,

406
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:25,435
you can pack your things and go back to that old rat hole of yours.

407
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,490
(RODDEE TAWEESUK)

408
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,813
I got all the ingredients here.

409
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:53,982
Making a simple stir fried vegetable dish shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes.

410
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:55,980
Once that’s done, you can go home.

411
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,407
I’ll handle the rest.

412
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:09,579
Home.

413
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:13,044
At least let me keep him company.

414
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:14,610
No.

415
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,607
This is something he needs to face alone.

416
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:35,977
Peach!

417
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:47,705
Home.

418
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:50,371
Open the door. I really can’t do this.

419
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,905
- Home! - But you have to do it.

420
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:53,568
Don’t you want to be a better chef?

421
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:55,179
You have to get through this!

422
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:56,931
I really can’t!

423
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:58,970
Don’t you see how much I’m trembling?

424
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:01,180
Your hands aren’t shaking because you see ghosts.

425
00:34:01,402 --> 00:34:03,152
It’s because you still hold on to that guilt towards Chef Hong.

426
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,779
And why wouldn’t I?

427
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,720
I killed her!

428
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,991
How’d you know that?

429
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:11,877
Peach, listen to me.

430
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,948
Maybe Chef Hong didn’t kill herself.

431
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,568
How would you even know?

432
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:25,675
Are you messing with me?

433
00:34:25,757 --> 00:34:26,711
I’m not messing with you.

434
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:28,711
I looked into it.

435
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,668
So you were here to deliver cooking gas for Chef Hong that night?

436
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:37,829
Yes, I was.

437
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,106
And I just couldn’t bring myself to believe she killed herself.

438
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:52,868
Should I change the gas cylinder for you, Chef?

439
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:54,600
I don’t think you’re in any state to be doing it yourself right now.

440
00:34:55,115 --> 00:34:57,462
Come on, I’m Chef Hong.

441
00:34:57,874 --> 00:35:01,811
I’ve changed countless gas cylinders in my career.

442
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:03,811
How have you been, though?

443
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,604
I heard you closed the place down.

444
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:08,008
I did, and it will reopen again.

445
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:12,813
I’ve been having fun testing out new recipes for the new restaurant.

446
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:15,909
You should stop by later sometime to try the food.

447
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:19,469
You seem to be in good spirits.

448
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:21,407
What gives you so much strength, Chef?

449
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,207
My student, of course.

450
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:42,204
I bet Peach is gonna love this recipe.

451
00:35:42,703 --> 00:35:47,902
I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s so impressed he screams, “Ahh!”

452
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,165
Nobody knows for sure if she killed herself.

453
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:18,813
You were supposed to know better than anyone.

454
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,625
You knew her best, didn’t you?

455
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,031
Can I ask you something, Chef?

456
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,770
Why did you choose me as your sous-chef?

457
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,674
Because you’re hopeless.

458
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:39,202
You panic and you’re a coward.

459
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:40,970
Oh?

460
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:48,102
That’s exactly why you work harder than anyone.

461
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,511
You’re more determined than anyone.

462
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,980
Remember this:

463
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:58,216
A good chef doesn’t throw in the towel so easily.

464
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,462
I’m looking forward to seeing you as a full-fledged chef.

465
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:08,407
Yes, Chef.

466
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:10,718
I’ll do my best.

467
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:03,767
Is she gone now?

468
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:08,306
Where’s Pangpang?

469
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,977
She’s probably outside doing her thing.

470
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:14,568
Where’s Kan?

471
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:15,576
She’s not here with you today.

472
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:17,223
She’s on leave.

473
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,139
I called her so much last time she was on leave

474
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,220
that she didn't get her errand done.

475
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,314
Sounds like something you’d do.

476
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:30,509
Well?

477
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,774
When are you tearing this place down for that new condominium?

478
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:36,924
Yeah, that was a total lie.

479
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,924
You wouldn’t agree to come here otherwise, would you?

480
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,013
What?

481
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:43,807
What about your 50-million-baht condominium project?

482
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:45,210
Just forget it.

483
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,672
If Chef Hong wanted this place to be a restaurant,

484
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:50,570
I’d rather sell it to someone who actually wants to keep it a restaurant.

485
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:54,220
Playing saint, aren’t you?

486
00:40:57,675 --> 00:40:58,371
What about you?

487
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,308
What are you going to do now?

488
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:02,377
I’ll probably find a job as a chef again.

489
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:05,000
My hands aren’t shaking anymore, after all.

490
00:41:05,016 --> 00:41:05,702
Boo!

491
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,077
What the hell was that?

492
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:11,980
See? You’re still as jumpy as ever, man.

493
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:14,007
But at least the tremor is gone. Look.

494
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:15,568
See?

495
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:17,506
You’re right.

496
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:23,081
Here.

497
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:24,204
Let me get that.

498
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:41,874
Thanks.

499
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:42,605
Hmm?

500
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:46,217
For dragging me out here to face my fears.

501
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:51,071
If it wasn’t for you, I don’t know how I’d get through it.

502
00:41:56,545 --> 00:41:59,321
Hey, don’t look into my eyes like that.

503
00:41:59,694 --> 00:42:02,690
You’re in danger of falling in love with me, just like Kan did.

504
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,170
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

505
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,728
When did Kan even fall for you?

506
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,174
You’re delusional.

507
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:08,909
I was being serious, you idiot.

508
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,709
I can’t help but wonder what my life would be like

509
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,302
if I didn’t get hit by that car three years ago.

510
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,906
Did you ever find out who the driver was?

511
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:31,487
No.

512
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,530
It was a hit-and-run.

513
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:38,918
I did go to the police, but they never got back to me about it.

514
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:42,317
I even asked to see the security camera footage,

515
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,176
but there was nothing.

516
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,567
It was like the driver paid off the police.

517
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:52,672
You don’t remember their face?

518
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:54,302
How would I?

519
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:56,302
Everything went dark the moment the car hit me.

520
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:01,865
I only remember that it was a yellow sports car.

521
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:05,174
You pressed too hard!

522
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:07,177
I was distracted by you talking to me!

523
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:07,868
Oh?

524
00:43:08,272 --> 00:43:09,121
So it was my fault?

525
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,841
Yeah.

526
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,911
No record of death?

527
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:36,442
I was informed of an accident that killed a man that night.

528
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,582
His body was transported to this hospital.

529
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:41,014
The patient didn’t die,

530
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:43,717
but his heart stopped for a while.

531
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:46,777
Maybe that was where the misunderstanding came from.

532
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:55,450
(POOCHONG : Here’s the video you asked for.)

533
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,183
(POOCHONG : But if you think this would be enough to put Somkid behind bars,)

534
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:00,610
(POOCHONG : you’re dead wrong.)

535
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:05,570
(ATTORNEY KAN : What do you mean?)

536
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:12,210
(POOCHONG : You’ll know when you see it.)

537
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:32,008
Is this your best solution to this problem?

538
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:36,207
What you did will only make things worse.

539
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:38,207
I’m sorry, Dad.

540
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:41,106
But it's the only thing we can do right now.

541
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:19,703
Home.

542
00:45:22,251 --> 00:45:23,868
