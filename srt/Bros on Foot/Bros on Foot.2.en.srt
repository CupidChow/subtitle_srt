(Bros on Foot)

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,260
(The dream team of traveling was formed for the youth.)

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,329
(The four of them set out on the travel project of the youth.)

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,529
It's not that cold.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,699
Hold on. Gosh.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,529
(Expect to see a new side of Ha Jung Woo.)

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,799
I've never seen him like this.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,768
(He's in charge of making them laugh.)

11
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,509
(The happiness generator of Bros on Foot)

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,439
You look so cool right now.

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,678
(Sweet and kind, Mom Ji Hoon)

14
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,409
(He doesn't hesitate to kneel for the youth.)

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,679
(And he can even roll on the ground.)

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,319
(His name changes from Ju Ji Hoon to Ju Joy Hoon.)

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,390
MINHO!

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,890
(Their fierce excitement never seems to subside.)

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,060
Hey!

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,199
(If passion were to take a human form, )

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,070
(MINHO would be it.)

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,170
- Was I supposed to take that exit?
- Right.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,068
(It's okay to make mistakes.)

24
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,568
(Encouraging hugs)

25
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,968
(The indispensable youngest)

26
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,139
(As long as he's with them, )

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,579
(nothing scares him.)

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,749
(We'll do all the heavy lifting.)

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,950
(You can just enjoy your trip.)

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,959
(Complete the Ticket Missions throughout the trip.)

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,419
(When they complete the missions, )

32
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,159
(they get to give plane tickets as presents.)

33
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,829
(The staff suddenly stole the camper van on Day 1.)

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,968
(Did they just get deserted on the streets of New Zealand?)

35
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,429
- They ran away.
- No one is here?

36
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,469
Right.

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,699
Okay. I got it.

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,409
- Hey.
- What? There are bicycles.

39
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,768
(The first Ticket Mission)

40
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,209
(They must bike 44km to win 7 tickets.)

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,810
- This is amazing.
- Gosh.

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,548
Jin Goo, the cows are following us.

43
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:50,749
Hey, cows are following us.

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,989
(They climbed over the mountain and got splashed to win tickets.)

45
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,359
(The Chung-Ang University Bros set up the base camp.)

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,030
(He may struggle as he's new to camping.)

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,969
(An uphill road)

48
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,109
(Their energy is bottoming out.)

49
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,938
(Will they give up here?)

50
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,879
(I got you!)

51
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,408
To send one more person on the trip.

52
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,508
We'll keep riding.

53
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,080
(Will they be able to finish the 44km bicycle course?)

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
(Ha Jung Woo)

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,900
(Ju Ji Hoon)

56
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,360
(MINHO)

57
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,300
(Yeo Jin Goo)

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,129
(Bros on Foot)

59
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,310
We're already at the 30km mark?

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,939
Gosh.

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,710
(They've acquired 3 tickets so far. They only have 10km to go!)

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,620
(MINHO is falling behind little by little.)

63
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,520
He can't catch up.

64
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,590
(Ji Hoon slows down to match MINHO's pace.)

65
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,599
MINHO must be getting tired.

66
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:18,240
(MINHO is struggling to keep up.)

67
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,098
Ji Hoon, I really want to eat chocolate.

68
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,408
- Chocolate?
- Yes.

69
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,879
- Your blood sugar must be low.
- Yes. It's crashing.

70
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,949
If this continues, you might hit a bonk.

71
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,519
(A bonk on a bike refers to the physical state...)

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,579
(where one's energy is depleted and is similar to hypoglycemia.)

73
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,949
I suddenly got hungry.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,789
- You're hungry?
- Yes.

75
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,059
Then...

76
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,060
(Worried)

77
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,418
We got vitamins...

78
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,359
- and sweets earlier.
- Okay.

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,930
Let's stop there and have at least half of that.

80
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,059
You should. Let's say you start to feel hungry.

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,229
But if you keep going,

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,968
you might suddenly collapse like you're having a stomach cramp.

83
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,039
That's what a bonk does to you.

84
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,739
I suddenly want sweets.

85
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,239
Right. You should eat then.

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,569
Or you'll collapse.

87
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,979
You'll go into a hypoglycemic shock.

88
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,209
(He tries to keep going.)

89
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,050
Seriously. Gosh.

90
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,990
I had never tried it before. I wondered if I had overdone it.

91
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,449
It felt like I used up all of my energy.

92
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,158
Hold on. You should rest up.

93
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,258
- Okay. For a bit.
- Okay.

94
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,259
(The staff member stops them.)

95
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,229
- I have this too.
- I'm good. Give it to MINHO.

96
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,500
(MINHO tries to stop the bicycle too.)

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,370
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

98
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,628
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

99
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,068
He might go into hypoglycemic shock.

100
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,269
Let's rest up here.

101
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,370
When you get hungry while riding a bicycle,

102
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,509
it means your blood sugar is dropping.

103
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,939
Okay.

104
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,278
- This?
- I like chocolate.

105
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,479
We'll sit here for a bit.

106
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,578
(They will rest up for a moment.)

107
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,180
Gosh. Thank you.

108
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,120
I rarely eat chocolate, though.

109
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,019
Your blood sugar is low now.

110
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,389
I never had such sweet chocolate after my military service.

111
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,268
(Humming)

112
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,568
(Staying hydrated and eating sweets while riding a bicycle is a must!)

113
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:57,938
(It'll come in handy to pack simple snacks...)

114
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,939
(like chocolate and candy.)

115
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,969
(Passionate MINHO is recharging.)

116
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,268
Should we stop here?

117
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,709
Gosh. We're not giving up.

118
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,579
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

119
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,420
- We should go all the way.
- I knew it. You're SHINee.

120
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,119
- Shall we go?
- Did you finish?

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,148
- Yes.
- Are you already recovered?

122
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,149
Yes. I feel great right now.

123
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,259
I'm back!

124
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,259
- Let's take it slow.
- Let's go.

125
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,290
Okay. Let's go.

126
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,199
Gosh. I recharged with the chocolate.

127
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,060
We got this.

128
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,800
(Fascinated by his quick recharge)

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,469
The wind is coming from the back. Should we go now?

130
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,540
Sounds good.

131
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,268
- You know who you remind me of?
- What?

132
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,540
The guy who records the street view for maps.

133
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,910
You know what I mean?

134
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,338
- I'll get going to record the view.
- Okay. Let's go.

135
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,778
- Let's go!
- Go!

136
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,119
(He can also record the street view for the youth.)

137
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,350
This is no joke!

138
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,350
Let's go.

139
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,220
I'm back!

140
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,559
It's no joke. I'm back.

141
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,620
- You're feeling good, right?
- Gosh. I'm feeling great.

142
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,490
- SHINee is back.
- Yes. SHINee is back.

143
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,300
SHINee is back.

144
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:03,069
SHINee is back! Go!

145
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,509
Good.

146
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,980
(Feeling great)

147
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,549
Gosh. The view is so picturesque.

148
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,610
Yes. It's nice.

149
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,379
Gosh. This is so cool.

150
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,720
It's so cool.

151
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,559
- This is no joke.
- Gosh.

152
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,860
- This is no joke.
- Right.

153
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,759
MINHO, we're going down now.

154
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,160
Nice.

155
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,300
Be careful right here.

156
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,069
- This is great.
- I love it.

157
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,170
Seriously.

158
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,110
This is therapeutic.

159
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,110
We're going down!

160
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,180
(As they enjoy the downhill path, stretched out before them, )

161
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,749
Hey, I see another uphill path.

162
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,088
(they come across another uphill path.)

163
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:57,389
When it gets tough, we can drag our bicycle like this...

164
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,089
- and take a break.
- Right.

165
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,729
(At times, they face rough breezes.)

166
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,328
- I got slapped twice just now.
- Gosh. Seriously.

167
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,359
Bam! I got slapped.

168
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,529
This is some strong wind.

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,969
(But without giving up, )

170
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,008
(they ride it all the way!)

171
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,768
This is like the background image for Windows, right?

172
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,839
- Totally.
- Yes.

173
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,310
I'm so happy, Ji Hoon.

174
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,610
Hey, this is amazing.

175
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,120
Oh, my!

176
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:29,088
I'm making great memories with you.

177
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,220
I'm love this.

178
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,459
When would we have the chance to do this in our lifetime?

179
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,490
(Ji Hoon gets to check off a box on his bucket list.)

180
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,429
- "Welcome to Lake Tekapo." - "Welcome to..."

181
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,669
Nice.

182
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,699
(It means they're almost there.)

183
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,470
It's a downhill path!

184
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,069
It's the lake!

185
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:54,750
This is no joke!

186
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,720
(Lake Tekapo)

187
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,860
- Oh, my.
- This is incredible.

188
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,229
(Their 4-hour ride rewards them with a picturesque view.)

189
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,470
This is a beautiful city.

190
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,569
I'm delighted.

191
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,970
The lake is stunning. Seriously.

192
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,779
- It's so beautiful.
- This is no joke.

193
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,509
- This is no joke.
- Gosh.

194
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,878
We biked 44km. We did it.

195
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,049
We did it.

196
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,120
We finished 44km.

197
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,590
Let's go.

198
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:38,619
(They're so close to the end.)

199
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
Seriously.

200
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,929
I wouldn't have been able to finish without you.

201
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,600
- I did it because you were with me.
- It's nice.

202
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,470
- Because we were together, - Right.

203
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,169
It kept me going.

204
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,399
Here's a saying.

205
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,039
"If you want to arrive quickly, go alone."

206
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,240
"If you want to go far, have a partner." That's the saying.

207
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,769
Seriously.

208
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,039
I'm happy to do this with you.

209
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:01,480
I could only do it because we did it together.

210
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,479
(Checking the GPS)

211
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,149
- Okay. It's that way.
- Okay.

212
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:08,449
(Only 1km remains until the campsite.)

213
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,649
- Turn right.
- Turn right.

214
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,289
Turn right.

215
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,159
Thirty minutes. They should be arriving here by now.

216
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,600
They're here.

217
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,898
They're here.

218
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:30,470
(The two of them finally show up after 4 hours.)

219
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Hi.

220
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,250
(Clicking)

221
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,749
(As he's so excited to see them, the photo is out of focus.)

222
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,089
(They completed the long journey of 44km without giving up.)

223
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,320
- So sexy, baby.
- Gosh.

224
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,759
- I love it, baby.
- Gosh.

225
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,659
Great job, man.

226
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
Yes, man.

227
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,100
Merry Christmas.

228
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,058
- I missed you guys so much.
- Merry Christmas.

229
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,370
- Good job.
- Gosh.

230
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:56,970
Oh, my goodness.

231
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,200
I missed you so much. Seriously.

232
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,740
It must have been so tough.

233
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,210
I wouldn't have been able to finish without Ji Hoon.

234
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,979
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my goodness.

235
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,648
That's a bigger expression than "oh, my."

236
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,720
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my goodness.

237
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,220
That was no joke.

238
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:14,489
(These two are touched more than anyone.)

239
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,620
That was no joke.

240
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,658
That was more difficult than I thought.

241
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,090
- Right.
- It was pretty far.

242
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,490
It was truly amazing.

243
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,359
They rode their bikes to travel 45km and there were a lot of hills...

244
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,029
on the route.

245
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,329
I thought it was incredible that...

246
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,169
they finished without giving up.

247
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,710
From my point of view,

248
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,109
it was like a scene from a movie.

249
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,409
They turned the corner and came down the hill.

250
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:42,110
When they came down, feeling the breeze, they looked so cool.

251
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,979
("I was excited when they cut through the wind.")

252
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,048
I was happy to see them, and I got teary.

253
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:49,850
They gave me a hug, told me I did a good job, and cheered for me.

254
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,059
But why were they waiting there to greet us?

255
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:56,230
After that, we had to drag the bicycle for a long time.

256
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:01,329
They could have just waited in the front of the campsite.

257
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,929
That did cross my mind.

258
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,940
(About 1km remains until their campsite.)

259
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:10,269
(Touched and choked up)

260
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,808
It was a downhill path. If they didn't come,

261
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,079
we would have continued riding down in a good mood.

262
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,850
Then we would have been at the base camp in no time.

263
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,619
We walked more than 1km.

264
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,659
(The campsite)

265
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,089
It's a downhill path, but why are my legs shaking?

266
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,090
- Downhill paths are harder.
- Gosh.

267
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,159
Let's go and roast potatoes.

268
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,569
Jung Woo made charcoal.

269
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,570
- Really?
- Yes.

270
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,740
Great. I love it.

271
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,740
Let's go and roast potatoes.

272
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,509
We just have to turn here and go up a bit. Then there's the campsite.

273
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,508
So this is how it looks.

274
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,018
(Picking up firewood on his way back)

275
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,450
- This is so cool.
- It's no joke.

276
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,490
(Their nest for the day, set up by Jin Goo and Jung Woo)

277
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,190
How nice.

278
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,558
(We arrived at our first lodging.)

279
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,600
- This is no joke.
- It's no joke.

280
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,200
Gosh. It's warm.

281
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,340
Right here.

282
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,138
- You should do it first.
- No.

283
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,039
- You completed the course.
- I want to give you all the credit.

284
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,039
To you, MINHO.

285
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,109
- MINHO.
- Yes.

286
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,979
(They successfully get their first tickets.)

287
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,049
Right here.

288
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,619
- Bravo.
- Getting the tickets was hard.

289
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,749
- No way.
- Sit and rest up.

290
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,888
Okay.

291
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,419
(They get to give this view as a present to 7 young travelers.)

292
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,360
(We hope you will have a colorful trip like a rainbow.)

293
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,398
Let's roast potatoes. I'm hungry.

294
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,429
Seriously.

295
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,298
- Can I roast potatoes?
- Sounds good.

296
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,739
(They prepare their first dinner in New Zealand.)

297
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,899
(Potatoes, 6.99 New Zealand dollars)

298
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,870
- I can roast the sausages too.
- They are right here.

299
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,809
(Sausages, 9.49 New Zealand dollars)

300
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,408
- Let's roast chicken legs.
- Chicken legs.

301
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,750
(Salt, 1.49 New Zealand dollars)

302
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,518
(The meal has good portions of protein, carbs, and fat.)

303
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:01,120
(The older guys have a plan.)

304
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,889
Will this break?

305
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,758
- You have to do it there.
- Okay.

306
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,789
All right.

307
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,690
(They're like a well-oiled machine with perfect teamwork.)

308
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,299
- Be careful.
- Okay.

309
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,730
Okay.

310
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,940
Okay. Be careful.

311
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,298
Okay.

312
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,638
(Kind words and tough action)

313
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,178
(Throwing it on the ground)

314
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,509
Okay.

315
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,379
Those guys...

316
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,950
If you blur out the bottom of the screen,

317
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,250
it's just a violent movie for adults.

318
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,820
That really looks like...

319
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,460
the movie "The Chaser."

320
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:47,969
There you go.

321
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,199
(Scene 1, There's a thudding sound outside the window.)

322
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
I need to break it here.

323
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,539
Will it not work?

324
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,469
(Ha Jung Woo)

325
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,908
(Ju Ji Hoon)

326
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,509
"The Chaser" and "Dark Figure of Crime."

327
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,480
It's stuck in the ground.

328
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,279
It gets stuck.

329
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,450
Everyone, don't get the wrong idea. They're splitting wood.

330
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,789
Okay.

331
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:15,189
You're awesome, as expected.

332
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,590
(Even when they split wood, it looks like a noire movie.)

333
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,299
It's done.

334
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,829
We gave the firewood a good scolding.

335
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,669
(The firewood was severely scolded.)

336
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,769
It's nice and warm.

337
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,869
- It's good.
- It's burning all right.

338
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,579
(They didn't get cooking oil, but they're grilling food well.)

339
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,279
The sizzling sound is great.

340
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,679
Gosh.

341
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,389
It sounds terrific.

342
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,289
Shall I taste the sausage?

343
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,798
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's good.

344
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,500
- Jin Goo, try it.
- Yes, Jung Woo.

345
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,829
It's good.

346
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,899
(Jin Goo tastes it.)

347
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,409
It's a sausage eating show. How is it?

348
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,619
(However...)

349
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,860
We do need cooking oil, though.

350
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,190
(Crumbly)

351
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:23,758
We should have bought cooking oil.

352
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,158
- But the money...
- We had no money.

353
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,829
- We should've brought it from home.
- I know.

354
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,329
- If only we knew what would happen.
- We should have brought it.

355
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,869
We didn't expect they'd ask such a question.

356
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,138
(First variety show, first game)

357
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,009
(The word is Ha Jung Woo.)

358
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,509
(Zoned out)

359
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
Goodness.

360
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,350
If I had known they set such a question,

361
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:44,819
I would have brought everything from home.

362
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,979
(Cutting in anger)

363
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,220
- Right.
- Seriously.

364
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,148
I never imagined this.

365
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,789
(Variety show rookies try to keep the allowance.)

366
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,258
This isn't cooking quickly.

367
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,288
- That's right.
- I know.

368
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,528
- The fire is too weak.
- We have a gas burner.

369
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,529
(A portable burner from the van)

370
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,069
- It's good.
- Yes.

371
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,339
Then let's take out the firewood.

372
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,769
- We'll cook with residual heat.
- This?

373
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,539
This way,

374
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,480
we can cook them thoroughly.

375
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,450
- It's not cooked inside.
- Right.

376
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,879
We need a lid.

377
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,119
- What?
- A lid.

378
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,418
- A lid?
- A lid.

379
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:24,490
(Jin Goo's mission is to find a lid!)

380
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,789
No.

381
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,388
We should cover it with something like this.

382
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,359
Okay.

383
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,559
You're a genius.

384
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
It's good.

385
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,340
I hope it doesn't pop up all of a sudden.

386
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,909
There's nothing to pop.

387
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,408
It's not chicken gizzard.

388
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,079
("It's not chicken gizzard...")

389
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,678
(was what he said.)

390
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,149
I hope it doesn't pop up all of a sudden.

391
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,889
(A popping sound?)

392
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,078
(Ha Jung Woo is a scaredy cat.)

393
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,710
Hearing you say, "I hope it doesn't pop up all of a sudden,"

394
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,979
- I actually...
- Did it surprise you?

395
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,649
I thought that was a possibility.

396
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,149
I was afraid it might pop up.

397
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,489
(Ha Jung Woo is easily frightened.)

398
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,720
No, that's...

399
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,089
(Staring into empty space)

400
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,999
(That's right.)

401
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,798
(Ha Jung Woo is...)

402
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,140
(a scaredy cat.)

403
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,640
(When does this end?)

404
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,038
They're being cooked perfectly.

405
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,308
(The potatoes are fully cooked.)

406
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,749
I think the potatoes are done.

407
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,819
- Are they?
- Yes, the potatoes are done.

408
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,889
(Roasted potatoes are done!)

409
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,960
- Eat the potatoes.
- Let's eat.

410
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,690
- Enjoy.
- Thank you for the food.

411
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,890
It's hot.

412
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,559
(Freshly cooked potatoes are hot.)

413
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,430
- Is it very hot?
- It's hot.

414
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,868
- Thank you for the food.
- Eat your fill.

415
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,599
(Ji Hoon wears gloves.)

416
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,410
Is it okay to eat the potatoes as is?

417
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,108
(Munching)

418
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,180
It's good.

419
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,980
The potato tastes good.

420
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:38,460
(Jung Woo dips it into salt.)

421
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,630
(Smiling)

422
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,529
- It tastes like roasted chestnut.
- Is it good?

423
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,970
The potato has a sweet and salty flavor.

424
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,098
- The potato is good.
- Yes, it is.

425
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,269
The potato itself tastes good.

426
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,009
For the first dinner in New Zealand,

427
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:01,109
we had sausages and potatoes.

428
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,650
I guess the chicken is cooked by now.

429
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,719
(Today's main dish, the roasted drumsticks are done!)

430
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,150
(Sizzling)

431
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,759
Go ahead.

432
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,190
Take one.

433
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,130
I'll take this one.

434
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,599
Yes.

435
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,839
This is really good.

436
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,808
The chicken skin is so crispy.

437
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,880
(Crispy skin and moist meat)

438
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,990
(The frown of truth)

439
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,329
It was really good.

440
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,059
It was what they say, "crispy outside and moist inside."

441
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,430
In a Chinese character idiom?

442
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:07,680
(The younger members are busy eating the drumsticks.)

443
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:14,649
I finished the main dish.

444
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,719
(Their quick first dinner is over.)

445
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,619
- Thank you for your work.
- Bravo. It was a good day.

446
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,959
(After satisfying his hunger, )

447
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,758
It's been a while since I saw the sky in a light purple color.

448
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,099
(they can see the light purple sunset.)

449
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,440
It really is a light purple color.

450
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,679
It's nice.

451
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,750
(Night falls over Tekapo.)

452
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,919
It's really been a while since I saw the stars.

453
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,750
- Can you see the stars?
- You can see them.

454
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,018
(Lake Tekapo is known as the world's best stargazing spot.)

455
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,288
(Photographers from all countries gather here.)

456
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,859
There really are so many of them.

457
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,930
- I can see them well.
- I can see them really well.

458
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,970
- There's Cancer.
- Cancer.

459
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,170
It's amazing.

460
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,108
- Cancer.
- That looks like Scorpio.

461
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,380
Yes, it looks like Scorpio.

462
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,309
I can clearly see the scorpion shape.

463
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:17,880
That star.

464
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:24,519
Now, seven young people in total can travel.

465
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,189
So, now we'll tell you...

466
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,288
the stories of the young people...

467
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,159
for whom you earned travel tickets today.

468
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,369
(Stories of young people recruited on social media)

469
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,470
Hello. I'm Kim Seul Bi, and I live in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province.

470
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,470
I'm sending a story of someone...

471
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,479
who's unbelievably good-hearted.

472
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,839
It's my younger sister.

473
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,078
She resembles me so much that people think we're twins.

474
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:54,549
She's like a sore finger to my family.

475
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,950
Right after my sister graduated from college,

476
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,119
she was busy preparing for the bar exam.

477
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,690
Then my father collapsed due to subarachnoid hemorrhage.

478
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,028
I was working in Seoul,

479
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,500
and my sister was living with me and studying.

480
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,739
Since I couldn't go home due to work,

481
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,699
she took care of my mom, relieved my anxiety,

482
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,740
and became my family's steady rock.

483
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,039
But I think it was then...

484
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,910
that time stopped for my sister.

485
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,348
A month in the intensive care unit...

486
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,289
and three years of recovery and rehabilitation.

487
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,149
During that period, my sister...

488
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,288
looked after my father and also took charge of...

489
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,460
the newspaper branch office he had operated.

490
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,098
The youthful time right after she graduated from college...

491
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,460
passed by like that.

492
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,900
And fortunately,

493
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,469
my father recovered enough that no one can tell he was sick...

494
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,139
if we don't say it.

495
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,210
I'm glad to hear that.

496
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,710
It's true we can't blame anyone for what happened,

497
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,048
and my sweet sister doesn't even think about it.

498
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,818
I'd like to give this miraculous opportunity as a gift.

499
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:03,118
(I'd like to give this miraculous opportunity as a gift.)

500
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,250
She's so sweet.

501
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,430
My sister Kim Dan Bi endured those times in silence.

502
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:11,930
You can do it, Dan Bi!

503
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:15,769
(You can do it, Kim Dan Bi!)

504
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:19,400
I cheer for the new beginning of your youth, as usual.

505
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,969
I forgot. I don't want to pressure you...

506
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,769
that you have to complete the mission.

507
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,808
Getting one ticket is enough for me.

508
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:30,149
So there's no justification for you not to complete the mission.

509
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,818
(There's no justification for you not to complete the mission.)

510
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,349
- It's a story of sisters.
- Yes.

511
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,250
- But today, MINHO and I...
- Yes.

512
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,058
Worked so hard and earned seven tickets.

513
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,588
We thought we could earn 3 or 4 tickets only.

514
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,859
So you can give them two tickets.

515
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,758
It will be nice if they come together.

516
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,828
- That will be so nice.
- Exactly.

517
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:49,130
Yes. I definitely agree.

518
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,798
The older sister Seul Bi,

519
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,699
you delivered your love for your sister so well,

520
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,239
so we'll give you two tickets.

521
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,739
Since we worked hard today...

522
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,108
I was wondering what he was looking at,

523
00:23:58,109 --> 00:23:59,838
- and your camera was there.
- Yes.

524
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,338
He calculated it all.

525
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,778
- It's unbelievable.
- That camera is from his agency.

526
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,719
It's from SM Entertainment.

527
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,219
SM Entertainment sent it.

528
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,389
- SM Entertainment.
- SM Entertainment.

529
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,189
With your sweet-hearted sister,

530
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,788
I hope you have a good trip.

531
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,788
- It's nice.
- Good job.

532
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,229
(Kim Seul Bi and her sister will go on a trip.)

533
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,200
We arrived!

534
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,170
(We cheer for the new youthful life of two sisters.)

535
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,899
(Thank you, sister.)

536
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,639
- Bye!
- Bye!

537
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,209
(The first trip of sisters)

538
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,210
- Jin Goo.
- Yes, it's from Kim Yu Ri.

539
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,549
- It's so nice.
- Yes.

540
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,279
The subtitle is "Friends."

541
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,518
Hello. My name is Kim Yu Ri,

542
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,819
and I turned 20 this year.

543
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,719
The college entrance exam is over at last,

544
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,629
and everyone tells me to enjoy the freedom.

545
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,529
But the reality is different, so I'm writing this letter.

546
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,568
With the Sewol Ferry disaster in 2014,

547
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:59,039
school trips of elementary and middle schools were stopped.

548
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,868
Even the school trip from my high school...

549
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,969
was canceled due to the COVID-19 breakout.

550
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,379
After I turned 20, I was busy with the entrance exam until January...

551
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,079
that I couldn't relax on New Year's Day either.

552
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:14,579
Still, I have lovely friends like a welcome rain in my life.

553
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,519
I've been friends with Eun Hye, Da Hye, and Hyun Ji for seven years.

554
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,719
Since we entered college, we didn't have much money...

555
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,159
and couldn't enjoy a year as we were busy working part-time.

556
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,960
And now we're turning 21 years old.

557
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,328
I want to get away from part-time jobs and studying...

558
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,768
and go on a trip to enjoy friendship and youth with them.

559
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:35,769
You understand how I feel now, right?

560
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,838
We spent our teens in a tiny study room all the time...

561
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,139
and couldn't have fun.

562
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,108
Please help us so that we can have...

563
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,619
a youth trip as a 20-years-old that we won't forget.

564
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,960
I'm not sure if I can say my school days were similar.

565
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,160
But I've been acting since I was a teenager,

566
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,129
so I only went on a retreat when I was in middle school...

567
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,729
and haven't been on a school trip.

568
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,098
- I don't have such a memory...
- Really?

569
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:06,299
In my school days.

570
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,140
But then when I was 20 or 21 years old,

571
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,410
I traveled abroad with my friends.

572
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,008
And it really became...

573
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,278
a memory to last for life...

574
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,479
- It must have been really nice.
- and it was so nice.

575
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,889
Back then, since we turned 20,

576
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,690
we had a drink, and I was so happy.

577
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,829
And we fortunately have four tickets.

578
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,470
Thanks to you guys, we got exactly seven.

579
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,970
Actually, Kim Yu Ri and her friends...

580
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,569
are waiting for the video call.

581
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,140
Please tell them the good news.

582
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,410
Should we say that we failed and we're sorry about it?

583
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,710
- Let's do that.
- Yes.

584
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,150
(Video call connecting)

585
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,348
Hello.

586
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,250
(Because they're in nature, the connection is pretty bad.)

587
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,058
- How cute.
- Hello.

588
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:01,220
Say hi to others too.

589
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:03,660
Hello. I'm Uncle Jung Woo.

590
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,559
(Silent)

591
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,170
I'm sorry.

592
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,098
(Why did it have to...)

593
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,909
(get disconnected when Uncle was talking?)

594
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,779
(Reconnecting with a voice call)

595
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,508
Hello?

596
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,149
- It's connected.
- Hello?

597
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,149
I heard the four of you wanted to go to New Zealand.

598
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,220
- You sent your story.
- Yes.

599
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,420
We failed our mission today.

600
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,529
(Actor Ju acts even though they cannot see him.)

601
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,288
(Their disappointment is transmitted across the globe.)

602
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,829
We're very sorry. Only one person can go.

603
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,630
Pardon?

604
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,769
- Only one person can go.
- It's so cruel.

605
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,338
- Just 1?
- Yes, just 1 person.

606
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,740
Only 1 out of you 4...

607
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,680
can go. Who do you think should go?

608
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,710
The one who sent the story should go.

609
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,479
Of course.

610
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,049
- They're so kind.
- Well,

611
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,920
we managed to cycle 44km and complete the course.

612
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,690
We completed it.

613
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,489
With that, we actually succeeded the mission,

614
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,129
so we can send all four of you to New Zealand.

615
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,329
Oh my goodness.

616
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,630
- What was that?
- They have great reactions.

617
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,368
- We teased you a bit.
- I was so surprised.

618
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,200
Please understand.

619
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,940
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

620
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,709
This is the first trip overseas...

621
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,808
- for two of our friends.
- Really?

622
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,078
Tell them they need to make their passports.

623
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,209
- Passport.
- You need to apply...

624
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,409
for your passport in advance.

625
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,778
It takes longer than you think.

626
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,720
- We'll go apply it now.
- Sure.

627
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:37,189
You need to make your passports.

628
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,289
And if this is your first time on the airplane,

629
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,018
you need to file a report.

630
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,059
Take off your shoes before boarding a plane.

631
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,160
- Take off your shoes.
- Brush your teeth.

632
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,058
- Yes.
- Why brush our teeth?

633
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,430
- Wear formal clothes.
- What are you saying?

634
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,568
- That's a lie.
- You need to do an interview.

635
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:50,568
(It's hard to tell who is 20 years old.)

636
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:54,200
Make a lot of good memories and share it on social media.

637
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,339
- Okay.
- Okay.

638
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,039
And repeat after me. Hashtag.

639
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,839
Repeat after me. Hashtag.

640
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,179
- Hashtag.
- Ticketing.

641
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,578
- Hashtag.
- Ticketing.

642
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:05,250
Yes. That's right.

643
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,979
- What's that?
- On social media...

644
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,048
- What's "hashtag ticketing?" - On social media,

645
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,618
it's used as a tag.

646
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,558
- This is on social media?
- Thank you.

647
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,959
We'll be able to make great memories thanks to you.

648
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,459
- I love it, babies.
- Thank you for your hard work.

649
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,559
This makes my heart feel warm.

650
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,768
I want to send as many people as I can on a trip...

651
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,768
after reading the letters.

652
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:29,109
- It's worth our hard work.
- It's really worth it.

653
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,608
Yu Ri and her four friends.

654
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:31,838
- Yes.
- While we're at it...

655
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,338
Let's book right away.

656
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,578
Then I'll look up tickets...

657
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,519
to Christ Church, New Zealand.

658
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:42,319
- It comes up immediately.
- It comes up right away.

659
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,160
It shows you how cost effective it is as well.

660
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,459
It compares the prices.

661
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,829
Here. "Arrange by cost effectiveness."

662
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,000
"Arrange by the lowest price, the shortest time taken."

663
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,799
- Let's go with cost effectiveness.
- Cost effectiveness is good.

664
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,598
The price is pretty reasonable.

665
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,539
- Is it booked?
- Yes.

666
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,469
- Let's check.
- And...

667
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,608
I'm sure they'll have fun.

668
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,979
Anything is fun at that age.

669
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,440
- They'll have a good time.
- I hope they have fun.

670
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,549
- I envy them.
- I envy them.

671
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,579
We're here to apply for our passports.

672
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,690
It's my first time applying for a passport alone.

673
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,289
I don't know anything.

674
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,359
I'm nervous.

675
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,130
We all managed to apply for our passports.

676
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:27,929
We'll set off to New Zealand now.

677
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,869
(We sent them to New Zealand!)

678
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,739
How about our sleeping arrangements?

679
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,038
That's right.

680
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,769
What should we do?

681
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,369
I'm open to everything.

682
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,608
Two can sleep in the car and two can sleep in the tent.

683
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,339
Sure. Two people in the penthouse,

684
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,048
and two people in the semi basement.

685
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,079
That's it.

686
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,249
Good.

687
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,650
(2nd floor rooftop tent: Spacious but beware if scared of heights)

688
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,789
(1st floor camper van: Warm but cramped)

689
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,058
- You guys decide.
- Yes.

690
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,419
We're fine.

691
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,258
Choose comfortably. We're fine with anything.

692
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:59,660
We'll experience the upper floor first...

693
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,858
- and share the review.
- Good.

694
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,129
You guys must be tired. Get in first.

695
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,240
I'll tidy up this place then go to bed.

696
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,399
You guys... I need to turn off the lights.

697
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,640
It's too bright.

698
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,808
- We can help. Let's do it together.
- No.

699
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:17,348
Especially Ji Hoon and MINHO, you guys cycled for 44km,

700
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:18,750
so I'll tidy up.

701
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,749
Take a rest. It's really fine.

702
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,719
- No.
- Let's tidy up together.

703
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,889
No, don't do it.

704
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,118
- Please don't do anything.
- We can finish quickly.

705
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,258
Why are you being like that?

706
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:28,989
- We can finish quickly.
- Yes, if we do it together.

707
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,990
Goodness.

708
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,559
I was going to do it.

709
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,258
The thought alone is enough.

710
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,900
- Goodness.
- Thank you for your kind words.

711
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:38,940
- Your mattresses.
- I brought them.

712
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,409
Arrange your mattresses. We'll arrange ours.

713
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,140
- Okay.
- That's better.

714
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:45,680
That's right.

715
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:48,979
But this... We need to make the place warm.

716
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,848
Yes. It's cold.

717
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:51,879
Okay.

718
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,919
MINHO, it's laid out on the floor.

719
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,719
- Is it?
- Yes, the flooring is laid out.

720
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,788
(The rooftop has the flooring.)

721
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,890
We can help Ji Hoon and Jung Woo.

722
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,389
We have mattress toppers.

723
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,390
(For the 1st floor, they need to lay out the flooring themselves.)

724
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:02,490
It's no joke.

725
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,490
Goodness.

726
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,630
- Look.
- You open it this way.

727
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,670
You lay it out there.

728
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:13,669
- MINHO, put the clothes away.
- Okay.

729
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,368
I'll hold it for now.

730
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,209
Jin Goo, it'd be great if you could pull it from in front.

731
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,108
- Thank you so much.
- Where should we put our heads?

732
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:22,848
- Put it together.
- I think it's upside down.

733
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,278
- Is that so?
- We can just flip it.

734
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,749
Let's flip it like this.

735
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,848
You're smart.

736
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:28,380
(It's Ji Hoon and Jung Woo's first time camping in a car.)

737
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:30,649
- But this...
- Put it this way.

738
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,389
- I see, like this.
- Yes.

739
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,990
(The 1st floor is ready for sleep too.)

740
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,589
Close this.

741
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,759
Measure that.

742
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,700
- That?
- The cardinal points.

743
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:45,268
- The cardinal points?
- Yes.

744
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:47,640
It's better to face southeast when you sleep.

745
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,568
No.

746
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,338
Did you guys not bring a compass?

747
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,980
Did you prepare it?

748
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,549
That side was east.

749
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,119
- South...
- Jung Woo, southeast is this way.

750
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,379
- Which way?
- This way.

751
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,088
That's the direction we'll be facing.

752
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,490
Do I need to move the car?

753
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,319
Then you and I have...

754
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,119
to hug our knees when we sleep.

755
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:09,490
If it's southeast...

756
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,358
- East...
- We should go this way.

757
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,359
(They give up on the geomancy.)

758
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,798
It's better to put your head here.

759
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,500
- Let's do that.
- Because...

760
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,239
the legs get narrower.

761
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
It doesn't matter.

762
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:23,910
(They discuss where to put their heads seriously.)

763
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:25,538
- Let's go up.
- Go ahead.

764
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:26,608
(Meanwhile, the younger guys...)

765
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:27,640
Be careful.

766
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,380
It's my first time sleeping in something like this.

767
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:33,979
(He smoothly sets up his sleeping bag.)

768
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,048
Okay.

769
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,289
(Complete)

770
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:41,319
I'll try lying down.

771
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,489
It's really soft here.

772
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,690
Really?

773
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,199
It feels nice, Jin Goo.

774
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,670
(He really likes the rooftop on the second floor.)

775
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,470
I'm going to sleep really well.

776
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,068
Is it big enough? Did you try lying down?

777
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,669
Yes, it's really big.

778
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,210
It's big enough for you too.

779
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,980
- It's really big.
- Yes.

780
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:04,410
It's good enough.

781
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,549
It's just like setting up a tent on the ground.

782
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,388
- Really?
- This isn't the end either.

783
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,320
It's not that tight either.

784
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,629
There's this much space left, so you could even...

785
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,259
Even Choi Hong Man can sleep here.

786
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,559
(The upstairs is busy boasting about how big it is.)

787
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,199
- It's really cozy too.
- Right.

788
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,630
Attics are usually nice.

789
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,138
- With you.
- Babies.

790
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,440
(So nice)

791
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,578
- Let's clean up and sleep.
- Okay.

792
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:35,649
- Got it.
- Okay.

793
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,050
- You worked hard today.
- You did too.

794
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,078
(It was only a week ago when they met awkwardly.)

795
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,549
Who's the first one on night duty?

796
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,649
I'll do it.

797
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,050
The first is the best.

798
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,959
Three hours for each guard.

799
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,119
(The four of them got closer over just a period of one day.)

800
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:56,429
(Our first night of the road trip in New Zealand)

801
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,239
- Do you want a pillow?
- I have this.

802
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,039
I have a water bottle.

803
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,538
This is more than enough.

804
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,339
(The older brother checks on the younger ones...)

805
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
(before going to bed.)

806
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:09,550
You worked hard.

807
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,349
- Lights off.
- Okay.

808
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,719
- Good night.
- Sleep well and sweet dreams.

809
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,590
- Have a good dream.
- See you tomorrow.

810
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,230
If you put the hot pack under your feet,

811
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,799
- you can sleep warm.
- Like this?

812
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,499
(He gives Jin Goo a tip on sleeping in sleeping bags.)

813
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,440
You sleep well with warm feet.

814
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,178
It's my first time sleeping in a sleeping bag.

815
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,340
Really?

816
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,150
Sleeping bags have their own beauty.

817
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,219
This is totally...

818
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,050
- amazing.
- It's awesome.

819
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,348
It's so comfortable.

820
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,689
(Jin Goo feels like he's on a school trip which he's never been on.)

821
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,420
- Then let's turn off the lights...
- I'll get it.

822
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,260
Thank you.

823
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:00,130
I'm going to sleep well.

824
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,530
You worked really hard today.

825
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,539
Good night. Sweet dreams.

826
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:10,768
- Let's make some money tomorrow.
- Let's do that.

827
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:13,109
Twenty-six dollars was too little.

828
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,280
I know.

829
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:21,150
(The first night in New Zealand grows deeper.)

830
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,959
(The numerous stars lighting up the night sky...)

831
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,058
(give way to the warm sunlight...)

832
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:36,869
(on the morning at Lake Tekapo.)

833
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,210
(Even the stones are warm here.)

834
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,549
(Are they up yet?)

835
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,320
(I don't know.)

836
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:03,959
(Exact copies)

837
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,570
(Actors representing Chungmuro)

838

(Wiggling)

839
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:26,719
(The youngest Jin Goo is the first to get up.)

840
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:35,360
(Foot sticking out)

841
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,570
(Making noise)

842
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:52,210
(He jumped out with a noise, but he's not entirely awake yet.)

843
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,679
(He rubs his sleepy eyes and raises his head.)

844
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,419
(Camper van)

845
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,820
(The morning scenery at Tekapo...)

846
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,630
(The emerald color lake reflecting the white mountain)

847
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,719
(What is the first thing Jin Goo does in the morning?)

848
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:41,719
(He checks if the other guys are sleeping well.)

849
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,959
(Laughing)

850
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
(That's fascinating.)

851
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,300
(Then he sees a basket.)

852
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,239
(Peeking)

853
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,609
(Something suspicious is inside the basket.)

854
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,909
(It's a suspicious mission.)

855
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:11,348
(I need to go to the bathroom.)

856
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,388
(Did the mission make him want to run away to the bathroom?)

857
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:18,690
(MINHO is next to get up.)

858
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:33,280
(MINHO rubs his eyes too.)

859
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:39,250
(He checks in on the other guys just like Jin Goo.)

860
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:48,920
(MINHO is also on his way to face his fate today.)

861
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:04,170
(He grabs the mission ticket that Jin Goo saw and ran away from.)

862
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,218
(Surprised)

863
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:18,750
(Feeling helpless)

864
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:22,860
(He returns the mission.)

865
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:28,329
(Shaking his head)

866
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,940
(Surprised)

867
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,510
(What's going on?)

868
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,150
(Struggling)

869
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,650
Gosh.

870
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,788
- Hello.
- Good morning.

871
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:00,129
(Even their hairstyles...)

872
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,170
(are the same.)

873
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,969
(The older brother checks the mission basket too.)

874
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,710
(He goes back.)

875
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,449
(He looks serious as he checks the mission ticket.)

876
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,619
(Nodding)

877
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:32,129
(Why is he smiling?)

878
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,059
Anyway, did you guys see that?

879
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,760
- What?
- Right.

880
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,698
- I did.
- Did you?

881
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,400
It was nonsense.

882
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:42,368
So I put it back in.

883
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,139
(I liked it, though.)

884
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,980
I put it back in too because it was ridiculous.

885
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,448
(It made them panic.)

886
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,480
Read it to us.

887
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,779
(Smiling)

888
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,750
If you're a young person who wants to enjoy New Zealand like Jung Woo,

889
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:58,448
(That's me.)

890
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,219
and if you feel down, just walk.

891
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,260
Do you have worries? Start walking.

892
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,159
From an interview of Ha Jung Woo.

893
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,299
(Are you down? Just walk. Are you worried? Start walking.)

894

(Ha Jung Woo, Principal of the Walking School)

895
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:14,199
Kim Nam Gil will join us as a new student.

896
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:16,768
It's Gang Lim and Haewonmaek.

897
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,439
- That's right.
- Yes, in a way...

898
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,380
When our members walk with me, they get anxious...

899
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,150
and scared.

900
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:24,779
(The Unknown Course)

901
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,579
(They have to walk without knowing the destination.)

902
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,649
(Principal of the Walking School)

903
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:34,159
(Today's dream mission is for Ha Jung Woo.)

904
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,789
Just walk.

905
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,058
If you need a ticket, walk a lot.

906
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:40,829
Make Jung Woo, the walker's dream come true.

907
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,928
Koreans are busy taking pictures.

908
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:45,198
The course they skip first when on a trip...

909
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,369
is trekking.

910
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,070
If you walk a total of 120,000 steps until midnight tonight,

911
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,869
you get a dream ticket.

912
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,979
(The Milford Track is the 1 of 3 world-famous trekking courses.)

913
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,808
(Travelers walking the course have made New Zealand popular.)

914
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:59,149
Enjoy the scenery as you walk with your two feet.

915
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,749
(In New Zealand, you can find a lot of courses...)

916
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,219
(that get trekkers all over the world excited.)

917
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,489
(You also get to see the beautiful scenery as you walk.)

918
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,488
(Wherever you walk and run, that becomes a trekking course.)

919
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,698
(Uphills and downhills)

920
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:16,569

(When the younger people start to fall behind)

923
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,280
(Ha Jung Woo, the walker, gets so excited to walk.)

924
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,150
Jung Woo, slow down.

925
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,679
(The more you walk, the more tickets you get.)

926
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,860
You get one ticket for every 10,000 steps.

927
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,388
Instead of starting that...

928
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:45,029
Down here.

929
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,158
You walked 20 already?

930
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,529
The green shoes.

931
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,130
(They're pretty cooperative.)

932
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,738
Nice.

933
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:54,800
(Everyone is walking all of a sudden.)

934
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,968
Okay.

935
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,808
- It's working.
- That's right.

936
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,578
That's 43 steps already.

937
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:02,179
- 34.
- 45.

938
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,650
Good.

939
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,449
You have to be wearing it.

940
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,119
What time is it? It's 9 o'clock.

941
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:14,659
It's 9:20am, so we have 13 hours.

942
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,089
We have to walk half of it in 13 hours.

943
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,230
- Let's go.
- We have to hurry.

944
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,599
I'll find a trekking course nearby.

945
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,000
- Mount John Track.
- Mount John Track?

946
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,570
Mount John Track.

947
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,468
(Mount John Track)

948
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:35,038
It's one of the most scenic tracks.

949
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,210
(One of the most scenic tracks in New Zealand)

950
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,049
(Right behind the camping spot...)

951
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,750
(you can see Mount John.)

952
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,289
(You can see the open view from the mountain top.)

953

(Mount John Track)

954
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,428
(The most famous track near Lake Tekapo, )

955
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,299
(it is popular with tourists as well as local residents.)

956
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,969
(It takes an hour and a half.)

957
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,738
(If you're a young person who wants to see...)

958
00:45:04,739 --> 00:45:07,179
(the emerald Lake Tekapo...)

959
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,340
Mount John Track.

960
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:12,578
- Today's course will be tight.
- Right.

961
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,079
- We have to hurry.
- Yes.

962
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:17,650
Let's start the first session.

963
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,030
It's a hill.

964
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,460
Tekapo Walkway.

965
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,900
It's uphill from the start.

966
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,038
(Caution: The entrance is busy due to construction.)

967
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,499
(The entrance is currently a hill covered with gravel.)

968
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,510
The course leads us up this way.

969
00:45:37,809 --> 00:45:38,940
Like this.

970
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,340
- We chose the wrong course.
- I think so too.

971
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,510
If it's like this from the start...

972
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:47,149
This is not helpful for the construction.

973
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,619
I know, not at all.

974
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:52,150
This is like hiking.

975
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:54,359
It's like hiking.

976
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,559
This is Mount Cheonggye.

977
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:58,928
(Winning the dream ticket is a long and arduous journey.)

978
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,329
Our steps are checked automatically.

979
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,199
- How many do you have?
- I have 2,400.

980
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,969
We should've started earlier.

981
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:08,198
When it gets dark, we'll have a hard time finding places to walk.

982
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,739
It's 11:10am now.

983
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,009
(They start walking quietly to reach 120,000 steps.)

984
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,249
Here it comes.

985
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,879
(They start walking quietly to reach 120,000 steps.)

986
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,119
My wrists are sweating.

987
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,519
(They keep walking and start to think...)

988
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:29,419
Are you guys okay?

989
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,460
(Cameramen, are you okay?)

990
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,899
If we walk 30,000 steps today,

991
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,459
- that means they have to as well.
- Of course.

992
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,468
- Yes.
- Right?

993
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,268
They have to walk backward on top of that.

994
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:39,328
(They pass the gravel road.)

995
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,769
- They have to walk backward. Yes.
- Walk backward?

996
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,739
- The trail is finally soft.
- Okay.

997
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:47,538
- Nice.
- It's so much better.

998
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:51,079
(There is a dirt road after the gravel road.)

999
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,919
- This isn't trekking. It's hiking.
- It's hiking.

1000
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,719
(It's a hiking course that's disguised as trekking.)

1001
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,389
- I was thinking of bringing poles.
- I see.

1002
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:03,589
You have to be prepared.

1003
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,690
- Right.
- Yes.

1004
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,499
You have to prepare in advance.

1005
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,868
(They keep going up while he thinks of the poles he left in Korea.)

1006
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,899
My gosh.

1007
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,198
(With the sunlight shining on them, )

1008
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,339
This is crazy.

1009
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,139
(they keep going uphill.)

1010
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,868
I'm starting to feel the sweat coming.

1011
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,010
I'm already sweating.

1012
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,780
I'm just walking...

1013
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,150
with my mental and physical strength.

1014
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,980
(They each walked 2,587 and 2,605 steps.)

1015
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,419
(As they walk using their willpower...)

1016
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,250
This reminds me of the hill from yesterday.

1017
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,289
(When they were cycling uphill, )

1018
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:44,869
(he thought it would be better to walk.)

1019
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,238
(You never know what'll happen tomorrow.)

1020
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,340
My gosh.

1021
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:50,968
This is crazy.

1022
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,439
(The current location of the members)

1023
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,209
Should we rest for a bit?

1024
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,408
Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

1025
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,280
(Steps: 12,057)

1026
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:02,218
(They rest at the halfway point.)

1027
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:05,518
(The bike bros have already accumulated a lot of fatigue.)

1028
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,659
We hiked quite a bit.

1029
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,589
The cameramen look so tired.

1030
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,889
Their faces are red.

1031
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,098
Look at all this sweat. Oh, my gosh.

1032
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:16,500
(Drenched in sweat)

1033
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,969
- This isn't trekking.
- Like Maebong on Mount Cheonggye.

1034
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:21,599
Are you sure it's not Oknyeobong?

1035
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:24,768
- Shall we go? Let's go.
- Let's go.

1036
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,780
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.

1037
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,609
(How much they have left)

1038
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,480
Didn't they say we get tickets for every 10,000 steps extra?

1039
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,880
Jin Goo, you can do it.

1040
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,590
Jin Goo, do you hike often?

1041
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,928
Not usually. I just like looking at mountains from afar.

1042
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:45,730
Really? You don't hike?

1043
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,230
(The Chung-Ang University Bros are walking slightly faster.)

1044
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:55,840
They look like a father and son. Right?

1045
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:58,908
The father and son look pretty close.

1046
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:02,738
(Along with the father and son, )

1047
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:07,150
(they start walking uphill again.)

1048
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,819
(Panting)

1049
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,348
(Grunting)

1050
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,860
(Are they coming?)

1051
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:21,360
I'm tired.

1052
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,630
It feels like yesterday was a dream.

1053
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,239
- I keep panting.
- Yes.

1054
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,840
What show are we on? Is this "Steel Troops?"

1055
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:34,739
- This is like "Steel Troops." - Gosh.

1056
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,110
What was the subtitle of this show?

1057
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,150
Was it "You'll die from exhaustion?"

1058
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,320
When I heard that, I expected it to be tough.

1059
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:45,618
(Panting)

1060
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,288
(Panting)

1061
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:49,888
- "You'll still be breathing." Yes.
- So on the verge of death.

1062
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:51,429
(It turned out to be, "You'll still be breathing.")

1063
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,158
The director sat down.

1064
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,558
The director is sitting down.

1065
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,170
(There is a person who is barely breathing.)

1066
00:49:58,599 --> 00:49:59,629
I give up.

1067
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,839
(Bros on Foot)

1068
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,038
(I'll suffer, so you can travel.)

1069
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,409
(The director falls behind.)

1070
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:06,169
The cameramen are...

1071
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,280
(The cameramen are worn out.)

1072
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:09,848
(New Zealand)

1073
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:11,109
(Country code: 64)

1074
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,650
The audio director gave up.

1075
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,349
- Is he done?
- He's done.

1076
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,018
There are four members, but all you hear is panting.

1077
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,419
(Panting)

1078
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,519
Seriously.

1079
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,159
(How much did we walk?)

1080
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,800
We'll probably make it to 1,000m. Since we're at 900 right now.

1081
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,059
- You're right.
- Yes.

1082
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,529
- An altitude of 1,000m.
- Yes.

1083
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,230
(Jung Woo and Jin Goo have vanished from their sight.)

1084
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:36,738
(Father Ha checks his pedometer...)

1085
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:40,579
(and starts to walk faster.)

1086
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,518
(The reason why they're rushing...)

1087
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:49,280
I should walk as much as I can.

1088
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:53,218
It was an opportunity for me to overcome...

1089
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,888
the humiliation, the criticisms, the hurt from the helmet incident,

1090
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,789
and my trauma from yesterday.

1091
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:01,629
For me and Jung Woo, apart from the 120,000 steps,

1092
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,698
we were prepared to contribute as much...

1093
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:07,000
as Ji Hoon and MINHO did yesterday.

1094
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,369
That means I needed to walk 50,000 steps before dinner.

1095
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:14,509
(The big picture of the Chung-Ang University Bros:)

1096
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,709
(walking 50,000 personal steps)

1097
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,750
This wasn't the end. We need to keep walking.

1098
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,780
- I think that's the end.
- Yes.

1099
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,379
A little more.

1100
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,389
(To erase the humiliation, Power walking mode on)

1101
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:28,189
(The Bike Bros can take it easy.)

1102
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,320
They must be taking a break.

1103
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,059
Is that so?

1104
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,859
(They each walked 4,805 and 4,821 steps.)

1105
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,900
We made it.

1106
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,739
(The trees that blocked their vision slowly start to thin out.)

1107
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,369
We're almost there.

1108
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,448
(The campsite)

1109
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:55,719
There's a trail over there.

1110
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,948
(The vast plains spread...)

1111
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,719
(behind the wooded mountain.)

1112
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,860
(Exclaiming)

1113
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:32,150
(At the end of the open field, there is a stairway to the sky.)

1114
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,959
There's a place called Koko Head in Hawaii.

1115
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,260
- Yes.
- Well...

1116
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,760
That place is similar to here.

1117
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:49,198
(While the Chung-Ang University Bros become close to reaching the sky, )

1118
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,509
(the tired Bike Bros are still wandering about the mountain.)

1119
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,570
My gosh.

1120
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,179
This is crazy.

1121
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,650
Even when I filmed "Jirisan," I never walked this much.

1122
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,420
Even when I filmed "Jirisan,"

1123
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,150
I didn't walk this much.

1124
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:09,419
(They approach the last hill.)

1125
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,828
It's already so tough.

1126
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:12,929
This is intense.

1127
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,329
My gosh, there's another one.

1128
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,969
- The trail is flatter this way.
- Yes.

1129
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:22,339
Going up that way is a shortcut.

1130
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,369
- Let's take the shortcut.
- Yes, the shortcut.

1131
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,409
- It's a shortcut, but it's uphill.
- Yes. Let's catch up to them.

1132
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,578
(The slope feels like it's 90 degrees.)

1133
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:32,750
- We got this.
- Yes.

1134
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,789
- We're basically crawling now.
- Yes.

1135
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:47,099
- It's not like we're guerrillas.
- I know, right?

1136
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:48,359
(Sluggish)

1137
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,500
This...

1138
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,538
- We made it.
- This is probably it.

1139
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:55,800
- The top of Mount Hwangmae.
- Mount...

1140
00:53:56,969 --> 00:53:58,939
No one would know even if you said this was Mount Hwangmae.

1141
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,440
(Both his legs and tongue become wobbly.)

1142
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:01,780
Are we almost there?

1143
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,579
Why did we...

1144
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,980
take the shortcut when it wasn't even a sweet temptation?

1145
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:10,519
- We were possessed for a second.
- Yes.

1146
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:14,189
- I walked that way involuntarily.
- Right.

1147
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,219
(They overcome the cliff disguised as a shortcut.)

1148
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,030
I'm so out of it.

1149
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,460
(Panting)

1150
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:22,598
(They're exhausted, but they look up.)

1151
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:23,699
Is this the end?

1152
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:26,300
- Gosh, the view is amazing.
- Oh, my gosh.

1153
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:28,570
This is such a nice view.

1154
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:31,169
We cycled while looking...

1155
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,539
- at that mountain yesterday.
- Right.

1156
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,510
- That one right there.
- Yes.

1157
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,139
- On the right.
- Yes.

1158
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:37,480
This is amazing.

1159
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,348
This is kind of like Olympic Park, isn't it?

1160
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:44,590
(He becomes relaxed enough to joke, as he sees the summit.)

1161
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,989
(Meanwhile, the Chung-Ang University Bros near the top of the stairway.)

1162
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,928
They took another route.

1163
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:57,030
(They spot the Bike Bros.)

1164
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,969
What? They went all the way over there?

1165
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,570
- Gosh, they're fast.
- I know, right?

1166
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,368
So there was a trail that way too.

1167
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:06,139
(In a hurry, the Chung-Ang University Bros don't wait.)

1168
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,039
Amazing.

1169
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,650
Gosh.

1170
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,518
(The drone goes to greet them instead of Jung Woo and Jin Goo.)

1171
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,359
- They walked up these stairs.
- You're right.

1172
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,559
(The drone goes to greet them instead of Jung Woo and Jin Goo.)

1173
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,559
- How did they get up there so fast?
- I know, right?

1174
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,760
It's a stairway to paradise.

1175
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,569
Gosh.

1176
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,710
Seriously.

1177
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:38,840
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

1178
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,679
(The Chung-Ang University Bros have reached the top.)

1179
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,948
Gosh.

1180
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,019
Seriously.

1181
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:55,019
- Gosh.
- This is amazing.

1182
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,559
Gosh, this is amazing.

1183
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,599
Gosh.

1184
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:14,138
(The magnificent scenery is enough...)

1185
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:17,780
(to wash away all the exhaustion from hiking.)

1186
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,489
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

1187
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:52,550
(The majesty of nature makes one's restless heart become solemn.)

1188
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,719
That's why it's 360 degrees.

1189
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,530
It was just marvelous.

1190
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:09,659
Just looking at the scenery made me emotional and solemn.

1191
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,769
I was sitting, looking at the scenery, and it was so beautiful.

1192
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,179
Then this thought came to mind.

1193
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,710
"When was the last time..."

1194
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:30,219
"I just sat quietly and stared at something?"

1195
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,730
If young people were to visit,

1196
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,099
it was a moment that I wanted to recommend.

1197
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,900
Even so, we only walked 5,000 steps coming up here.

1198
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,110
(They face another magnificent view.)

1199
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,110
We're so high up.

1200
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,710
This is crazy.

1201
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,179
(There is a man standing there.)

1202
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,059
Gosh.

1203
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:14,960
You can do it.

1204
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,429
Five, four, three, two, one.

1205
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,639
(Bros on Foot)

1206
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,489
You're awake.

1207
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,038
Someone boiled the water.

1208
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,948
- I did, just now.
- Oh, right now?

1209
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:04,980
Amazing.

1210
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,679
I woke up in the middle of the night because I was thirsty.

1211
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:12,250
But the water was so cold.

1212
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,760
Oh, you boiled it? Good job.

1213
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:17,489
- Why did you say you did it?
- I boiled it again.

1214
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,730
So I basically did it.

1215
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,730
It was lukewarm, so I made it hot again.

1216
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,329
- Hi.
- Good morning.

1217
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:29,170
- It's even prettier in the morning.
- Right.

1218
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,039
This has no pockets.

1219
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,250
Here.
