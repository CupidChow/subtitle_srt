[BL]

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,840
A world where boys fall in love with each other easily.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,950
However, there is something else that's fallen quite often.

20
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,370
That is... a human.

21
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,610
When we encounter a situation like this,

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,900
about 90% of the men in this world

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,420
will take him to their home.

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,430
What if he was a robber pretending to be sick?

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,290
And in the end, it gets them involved in crime...

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,120
Well, not really. They fall in love.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,410
So, in order for boys to avoid falling in love in this world,

28
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,790
I need to do the exact opposite.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,260
You might think I'm cold-hearted, but don't worry.

30
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,450
This is actually not a rare situation in this world.

31
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,700
I hope someone nice will pick you up.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,620
I see someone like that about three times a month.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,890
Since I've never heard of a person dying suspiciously outside,

34
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,320
even if I don't pick him up here now, someone else will.

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,860
Are you okay? Hey, are you okay?

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,920
- Can you hear me? Hello?
- See?

37
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,900
He will pick up that guy.

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,550
What?

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,160
Bro?

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,960
What?

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,010
Someone's passed out here and you are walking away?

42
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,820
Ah... But he's just a drunk...

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,870
Even so, we can't leave him here.

44
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,950
But if we don't leave him, it will develop into a B in L situation.

45
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,150
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,910
- Are you okay? Hello?
- Listen.

47
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,190
You are already in the midst of a complicated love square with boys loving each other.

48
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,260
What if that guy joined there and made it a pentagon?

49
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,730
Hello? Is this the police?

50
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,590
Oh, right. The police.

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,060
Why didn't I think of that?

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,240
Well, hey.

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,290
Your...

54
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,860
What?

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,160
Your friend, the Rose Prince.

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,430
Rose Prince?

57
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm Tojo.

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,860
Ayato has been taking good care of me in many ways.

59
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,030
Ah, you mean Tojo?

60
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,920
He knew exactly who I was talking about.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,260
Did he see the roses, too?

62
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,630
He's the one who confessed his love to you, right?

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,620
Ah... yeah.

64
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,300
What happened then?

65
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,540
What happened...?

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,500
You... No way.

VS My Little Brother's Friend Part 2

69
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,620
- Here.
- Thanks.

70
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,700
So? Did something happen with him?

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
What do you mean?

72
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,350
- Hey.
- Yeah?

73
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,790
Actually, yesterday...

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,630
Goodbye.

75
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,490
Oh, Ayato.

76
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,630
I want to stop by the jeans shop near the station on the way.

77
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,230
That's fine. The new place?

78
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,600
Yeah.

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
Hey, Tojo.

80
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,420
Are you free

81
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,650
next Sunday?

82
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,120
I thought we could go shopping for the supplies for the school festival.

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,140
Sorry. I've already made a plan with Ayato to go out on that day.

84
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,760
What?

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,720
I suppose many of you have guessed it by now.

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,530
I've never made a plan with him like that.

87
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,530
Let's go some other time with the other members of our team.

88
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,020
Tojo looks into the person's eyes when he is lying.

89
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,790
He does the opposite of what people usually do.

90
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,830
- Let's go, Ayato.
- Oh, sure.

91
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,090
Don't you feel bad for lying to her?

92
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,920
It's more cruel to get her hopes up.

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,320
As always, you are so confident.

94
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,330
That's not true.

95
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,460
He's probably not aware of that habit of his himself.

96
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,700
Only I know it.

97
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,100
His unconscious gesture makes people trust him,

98
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,990
and that's why he's popular.

99
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,390
But how was he then?

100
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,560
Tojo, well...

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,330
Yes? What is it?

102
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,230
When he confessed to me.

103
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,960
Ah, you know...

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,260
Are you trying to talk about that?

105
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,300
That I said I had liked you since junior high?

106
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,070
Ah, yeah.

107
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,200
It was a joke, right? You were making fun of me.

108
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,270
Yeah. It was a joke.

109
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,290
You can forget it.

110
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,760
Then, it wasn't a joke. He does like you.

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,300
You think so, too?

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,370
No... Ayato is the main character in this BL world.

113
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,570
It’s the Rose Prince he's dealing with.

114
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,940
And his name is Tojo.

115
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,570
It's not a mediocre name like Saito, Yamada, or Suzuki.

116
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,370
Saito, Yamada, Suzuki, I'm sorry.

117
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,810
But my little brother...

118
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,730
There is nothing I, your big brother,

119
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,730
can do anymore.

120
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,710
Why are you crying?

121
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,580
I'm sorry,

122
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,260
but we have to follow different paths.

123
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,660
Why?

124
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,320
Farewell, my brother

125
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,520
Bro...

126
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,220
Oh, man. He's overreacting.

127
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,780
Tojo is not that into me...

128
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,390
- That's right.
- We can move this...

129
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,130
Oh, hold on.

130
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,970
I had something on my hair?

131
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,760
Thanks.

132
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,390
Okay! It was great.

133
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,630
Go home safely, everyone.

134
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,110
Okay.

135
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,320
Hey, Tojo. If you have time today, let's go to the CD shop...

136
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,590
Sorry. I have to go today.

137
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,540
Okay? Are you all right?

138
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,180
Let's go.

139
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,800
7:00? We don't have much time then.

140
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
- We have to hurry, then.
- Really?

141
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,350
Oh, no.

142
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,660
We have to hurry.

143
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,310
I'm hungry.

144
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,640
Here.

145
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,810
- Where is Ayato?
- He says he doesn't have an appetite.

146
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,880
- I'm so excited about today.
- Yeah, me too.

147
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,510
What time does the store close?

148
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,420
I think at 7:00.

149
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,800
7:00?

150
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,550
We have to hurry, then.

151
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,840
- We have to hurry?
- Do we?

152
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,000
We have to hurry.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,200
- Yeah, right. Let's go.
- Let's hurry.

154
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,280
Ouch!

155
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,730
Are you not getting anything?

156
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,800
No...

157
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,710
What about you?

158
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,670
I'm getting water.

159
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,370
Here.

160
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,650
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

161
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,470
Just take it.

162
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,710
Thank you.

163
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,550
Hey, Ayato. If you have time today, we can go to the CD shop we couldn't go to yesterday...

164
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,070
I can't.

165
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,180
What?

166
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,020
I lied.

167
