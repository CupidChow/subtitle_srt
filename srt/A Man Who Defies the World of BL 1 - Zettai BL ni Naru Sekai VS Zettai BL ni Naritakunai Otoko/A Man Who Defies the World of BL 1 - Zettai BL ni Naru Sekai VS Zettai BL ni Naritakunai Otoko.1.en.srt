00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,570
My heart fluttered.

163
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,940
Fluttered... What does this mean?

164
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,860
Fluttered?

165
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,420
Well, are you hurt?

166
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,060
Ah, no. I'm all right.

167
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,450
Best wishes.

168
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,350
Now, I hear that you find the person you are dating 50% better than he actually is at the beginning of the relationship.

169
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,760
It's quite common.

170
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,140
It can also happen in this world of BL manga.

171
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,160
Hey, what did you get?

172
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,970
I bought a grilled meat bento.

173
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,260
I saw you were eating earlier.

174
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,340
How much do you eat?

175
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,100
Shut up! I'm going through a growth spurt.

176
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,390
Hey. Be careful.

177
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,950
Ah, sorry.

178
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,470
His hip was so slim.

179
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,610
Too thin.

180
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,410
Is he eating well?

181
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,110
When I look closely,

182
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,910
he's beautiful with those long eyelashes.

183
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,760
Like this, when it comes to the person they are in love with,

184
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,390
they tend to have the impression

185
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,540
that he is overly thin or beautiful.

186
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,730
You don't have chopsticks! What are you going to do?

187
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,450
How are you going to eat it?

188
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,910
His neck is thin.

189
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,430
What is he doing revealing it so defenselessly?

190
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,370
People usually show their necks.

191
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,430
What does he mean defenseless?

192
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,740
But, one day...

193
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,380
Wow...

194
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,700
What?

195
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,490
You are too skinny.

196
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,610
- I'm average.
- No. You look like a chicken carcass.

197
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,070
You should work out a little.

198
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,020
Could this be...

199
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,280
What?

200
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,870
What are you saying?

201
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,570
We are brothers. Don't look at me weirdly.

202
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,410
What are you talking about?

203
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,810
Hey.

204
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,670
You are thin but well built.

205
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,780
And you are revealing your body defenselessly.

206
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,810
Of course I am, because I'm taking a bath.

207
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,310
Be extra careful.

208
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,610
This is advice from your big brother.

209
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,330
What?

210
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,370
Right. You have to be extra careful.

211
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,590
Otherwise, this could happen.

212
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,690
Wow. Meat, meat. This bento is full of meat.

213
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,030
I was worried if you were eating well.

214
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,410
Thank you for the food.

215
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,380
It's good. It's too delicious.

216
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,070
Is it? Eat up.

217
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,160
Oh. Does this mean, if I go out with you,

218
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,530
I can eat such delicious food every day?

219
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,630
I do like cooking.

220
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,680
Well...

221
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,540
You completely grabbed my heart through my stomach.

222
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,040
Well...

223
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,300
You grabbed my heart

224
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,570
with your smile.

225
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,770
Eat your lunch.

226
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,180
Yeah.

227
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,050
They are deeply in the world of BL.

228
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,880
Be careful everyone, so this won't happen to you, too.

229
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,870
The world that turns everyone into BL versus

230
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,440
the man who defies to become a BL.

[A Man Who Defies the World of BL]

232
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,990
That's all for today's lecture.

233
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,510
Good work, everyone.

234
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,740
To be clear, this "hoo" is

235
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,130
not coming out because I'm glad the tiresome class is over.

236
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,180
It's from the relief that I ended another day

237
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,080
without getting involved with BL.

238
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,720
But...

239
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,300
Hey, hey. Hey!

240
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,330
What are you doing today? Do you want to go out for a drink with us?

241
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,340
Right. The class is over, but the day is not over yet.

242
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,980
College students have drinking parties.

243
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,540
In order to avoid becoming a BL in this world of BL manga...

244
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,680
Sorry. I have plans today.

245
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,230
Oh, right. You have a plan. Okay.

246
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,470
I turn it down without a question...

247
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,480
Well, that's absolutely a wrong move.

248
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,670
I'm going.

249
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,510
What? What about your plan?

250
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,880
I've finished it.

251
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,640
What?

252
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,330
Well, let's go then.

253
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,480
- Yeah.
- Great. Let's go.

254
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,120
Why is it a wrong move?

255
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,900
Turning down an invitation to a drinking party

256
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,940
is what a loner does.

257
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,150
A unique character as a loner

258
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,340
can easily be the main character.

259
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,540
To keep being part of a mob,

260
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,430
it's safe to accept this kind of invitation.

261
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,130
Hey, are you free today?

262
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,870
Do you want to go for a drink?

263
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,600
No. I'm sorry, but

264
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,330
I'm not interested in drinking parties.

265
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,040
There it is. A loner.

266
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,640
Are you the main character?

267
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,060
There you go. A hidden hot guy. Definitely the main character.

Akihito, eat as much as you want.

271
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,220
Here. Do you want this? Excuse me, can we have more sauce?

272
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,860
The main character at a drinking party is...

273
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,470
- So good!
- Delicious!

274

Natsumi...

275
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,570
Why did you leave me, Natsumi?

276
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,850
For instance, someone like him who recently got dumped by his girlfriend.

277
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,500
Hey, stop weeping over it already.

278
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,520
Forget about Natsumi,

279
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,290
and enjoy drinking now.

280
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,770
Or someone like him who is stupidly cheerful.

281
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,460
Or someone like him who stands out because he's so gloomy.

282
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,390
It's hard. Extremely hard.

283
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,000
So, you came after all.

284
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,930
You are not a loner.

285
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,780
What are you doing? Eat.

286
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,340
- You have so much food on your plate.
- Thanks.

- Eat and forget.
- Hey, Akihito...

288
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,590
While we are drinking, it would be better to avoid interacting with these people

289
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,970
and just try not to stand out.

290
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,760
I'll take that. Two more, please.

291
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,840
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

292
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,210
But the problem comes at the end of the party.

- Kaji.
- Drink some water.

294
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,860
- Kaji, wake up.
- Here's water.

295
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,890
He's not waking up at all. What do we do?

296
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,640
It's because you kept giving him drinks.

297
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,910
What? I didn't.

298
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,330
Right. The drinking party in this world

299
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,570
always leaves one of them too drunk to go home alone.

300
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,650
- Kaji.
- Where does he live?

301
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,730
Ah... Where was it?

302
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,820
I don't know him enough to know that.

303
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,220
Right?

304
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,190
- Why did he come here, to begin with?
- I know, right?

305
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,790
When this happens, it won't do me any harm

306
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,630
even if I just ignore it. But...

307
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,080
to be sure, I should make the first move to get away from it.

308
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,310
I'm going to pour water on you, Kaji.

309
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,710
No. Don't do it.

310
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,840
- What?
- Please don't.
- Is he awake?

311
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,290
- Sakita.
- What?

312
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,760
Are you awake?

313
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,150
You should take him home.

314
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,520
What? Me?

315
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,790
Well, I'm the one who invited him, but...

316
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,220
Hey, Kaji.

317
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,870
Kaji, can you get up?

318
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,920
Thank you for your sacrifice.

319

Yeah. See you.

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,000
- Thanks.
- Help me, you guys.

322

Bye!

It's raining and dark. You are cold, aren't you?

Thank you for bringing that.

Don't say it.

We got together with the same members after the exam.

You didn't do well?

363
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,420
I think I did well this time.

- It was really delicious. It was fun, too.
- Yeah.

The rice was really good, too.

Aren't you drinking too much?

No.

- This is good.

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,300
