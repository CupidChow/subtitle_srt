would steal every girl's heart in this room.

166
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,100
I know I should be worried, but

167
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,370
this is the world of BL, after all.

168
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,810
Plus, his good looks qualify him to be the main character.

169
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,490
There are more possibilities of him hooking up with a man rather than a woman.

170
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,050
That means, he's not my rival.

171
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,960
Is something wrong?

172
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,120
I'm going to get more juice.

173
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,390
Does anyone need a refill?

174
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,740
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

175
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,620
- Can you sit beside me?
- I want to sit with him.

176
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,730
- Sit over here.
- Hi, there.

177
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,300
Come this way.

178
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,390
I'm safe today as long as I'm not alone

179
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,510
with the marguerite-guy.

180
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,430
Are you all right there? Let me help you carry those.

181
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,120
I'm not so safe after all.

182
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,250
Thanks.

183
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,900
Are you having fun at the party today?

184
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,350
Well... sure.

185
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,710
I've noticed...

186
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,150
that you seemed down, so I was worried.

187
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,500
Oh, did I?

188
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,400
Yeah.

189
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,030
He seemed to be annoyed by the girls

190
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,970
who only care for his good looks.

191
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,520
It's only my assumption, but a hot guy in the BL world usually feels that way about girls.

192
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,690
He insisted, so I couldn't decline his invitation today.

193
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,020
I found myself not able to have fun, either.

194
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,690
Either?

195
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:39,040
I can kinda guess what is he going to suggest next.

196
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,650
Listen.

197
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,040
If you don't mind,

198
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,130
can we get out of here?

199
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,000
Sorry to hear that. I'm having so much fun here.

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,020
Or I should say, I'm having a blast.

I love a matchmaking party! It's awesome! Woo-hoo!

I love girls! Woo—

203

I can never come back to this place again.

204
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,280
I see.

205
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,390
Good luck then.

206

About ten minutes later...

209
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,470
Actually, I don't really like attending matchmaking parties.

210
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,720
Me, either.

211
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,080
We seem to have similar tastes.

212

They would be fulfilling the roles as the main characters

213

214

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,260
Sure.

218
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
That's right. It's untold love.

Back then, I'd failed to foresee

I'm leaving, too.

224
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,370
So you have a boyfriend?

225
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,270
- I know you do, too.
- What?

226
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,630
- I just told a clerk we'll be staying two more hours.
- For real?

227
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,960
It was a mistake.

228
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,290
- What a waste.
- I shouldn't have come.

229
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,810
- Do you really want to stay here for two hours?
- Should we leave?

No!

It would be best to leave right away.

[A Man Who Defies the World of BL]

BL manga does exist in the world of BL.

239
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,090
The fangirls of BL manga are called "rotten girls."

There are also "rotten boys" who love BL manga.

While I read BL manga for my research,

246
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,660
I, who plays an insignificant role of the mob, could be labeled as a "rotten boy."

247
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,530
And it could bump me up to becoming the main role.

Wow! I didn't know you like BL manga.

249

So unexpected for you to have such a hobby.

you would be into those.

Well, I mean...

Say something; otherwise, he will think of me as a "rotten boy."

258
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,850
Say "I was surfing the internet to kill time,"

"I tapped the page accidentally." Should I lie to him?

I wonder why he talked to me in the first place.

The reason was beyond my imagination.

285

That was close. I was about to be exposed.

that there are many "rotten" BL stories around him.

That's right. Ask him out for a movie date.

I really enjoyed the movie. Did you watch it, too?

What?

298

I really liked it, when I watched it for the first time.

So, I'm going to watch it again with my friend.

- Yeah.

302

He has seen it. What a bummer.

303
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,410
It's hard to ask him out on a date.

I'm off. My class is about to start.

How disappointing.

306
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,560
I guess what happens in manga doesn't happen in real life.

307
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,820
I wish I lived in the world of BL manga.

308

No need to wish for. You do live in the world of BL manga.

Great. Do you want to watch the movie with me?

What? I thought you were going to watch it with your friend.

317

Yeah, but I want to watch it with you, too.

I like scary stuff.

321
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,290
- That's surprising. Scary movies?
- Yes! I can get an idea for my new manga.

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,280
Thanks.

329
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,110
This was the world of BL after all.

330
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,130
It's a BL paradise.

331
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,560
Yes, this is the world of BL manga all right.

332
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,590
But it's not even close to being a paradise.

333
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,750
Oops, I shouldn't spill the beans.

334
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,280
I'm out now. Bye-bye.

335
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,530
The world where boys are bound to fall for boys versus

336
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,020
a man who refuses to fall for a boy.

337
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,290
