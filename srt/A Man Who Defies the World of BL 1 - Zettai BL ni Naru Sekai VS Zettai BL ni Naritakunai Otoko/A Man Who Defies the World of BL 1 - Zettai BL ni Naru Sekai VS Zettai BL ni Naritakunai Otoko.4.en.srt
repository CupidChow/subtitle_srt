- Excuse me. Can I get a refill?
- Sure.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,150
I'm so exhausted.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,230
I did my best.

21
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,260
In a world where boys fall in love with boys,

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,710
I tried my hardest to resist it.

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,850
Here is your drink.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,040
However,

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,820
people around me constantly try to drag me into a BL situation.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,960
Why is that?

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,900
Is it because this is the world of BL?

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,320
Does that mean I don't have a choice?

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,720
Damn it.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,050

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,050
I had too much to drink.

36
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,870
Oh, no.

37
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,740
I shouldn't faint in a place like this.

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,460
If I do that,

39
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm pretty sure that a handsome guy will pick me up.

40
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,880
A cat?

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,170
No!

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
Oh, no. I'm going to...

43
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,330
I'm so proud of myself.

44
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,790
Despite the fact I was so drunk,

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,760
I returned home safe and sound.

46
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,010
I knew I would be fine.

47
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,750
In the world where boys fall for other boys,

48
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,750
I will never fall for a guy...

49

Are you all right?

50
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,530
Are you all right? Are you all right?

51

- I'm off.
- Have a good day.

52

Hey, last night...

53
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,910
Oh, right.

54
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,490
Someone carried you home on his back last night.

55
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,560
What were you thinking? You're such an idiot.

56
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,100
What?

57
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,800
Who was it?

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,610
I don't know. He refused to tell me his name.

59
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,970
Is that right?

63
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,220

Let me see.

You got it on your face.

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,030
What? Where is it?

67
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,000
Stay still. Let me get it for you.

68
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,480
Wait, Ayato. It's too early for a deep kiss.

69
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,030
I vaguely remember about last night.

70
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,190
But there is one thing that I'm certain of...

71
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,630
The back...

72
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,620
was very warm

73
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,680
and soft.

74
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,180
There was a hint of citrus scent.

75
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,410
Who was the guy with citrus scent?

76
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't have the slightest intention of falling in love with the man.

77
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,670
It's against my principle for an upright person like myself

78
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,480
not to thank him

79
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,610
for his help.

80
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,650
The citrus scent...

81
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
Hello.

Well, thanks.

85
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,780
I mean... last night,

86
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,530
did you help me out?

87
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,270
No need to thank me.

88
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,440
Because you were the one who helped me first.

89
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,800
Did I?

90
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,820
It was about a month ago...

91
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,280
when my boyfriend dumped me,

92
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,820
and my lovely hamster, Hamuhiko passed away.

93
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,660
I was in a state of a mental mess.

94
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,310
Oh, it's too small.

95
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,970
Why is that?

96
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,190
How did that happen?

97
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,300
Have you changed the resize setting?

98
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,790
As I thought, it was set to minimize the image.

99
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,920
Now...

100
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,080
you can print in actual size.

101
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,640
Good to go.

102
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,230
I remember that now.

103
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,410
Maybe it was a trifling matter to you.

104
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,680
But seeing your kindness when I was disheartened,

105
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,680
it made me really happy.

106
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,130
After that, I started to have an interest in you.

107
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,180
I was curious about you, so I couldn't keep my eyes off of you.

108
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,870
That's when I noticed there were many good qualities in you.

109
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,770
You're soft-hearted and caring,

110

but a little clumsy.

111

You care about cats.

Oh, no. I'm in trouble.

113

It's a red flag. It's the biggest crisis ever!

114
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,590
Don't worry. I know you're not into me.

you gave me chocolates on Valentine's Day.

Cute? What am I thinking?

170
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,590
Going out for a drink alone with him,

171
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,530
is the same as a date.

172
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,100
Kikuchi.

173
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,580
What is it?

174
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,370
- Um...
- Don't worry.

175
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,540
I will never submit myself to the world of BL.

176
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,550
Not going to happen. Never.

177
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,420
What's wrong?

178
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,740
- I...
- Don't.

179
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,010
No. Don't you dare say it.

180
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,760
You can't!

181
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,290
What is it?

182
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,550
I like you.

183
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,700
♫ Just like bubble love ♫

184
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,760
♫ Just like bubble love ♫

185
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,500
♫ In a conventional situation ♫

186
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,570
He has fallen finally.

187
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,720
What's going on? Have I fallen?

188
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,430
The story will continue in the second season.

189
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,890
I hope there will be a second season.

190
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,000
♫ The feeling of love isn’t enough ♫

191
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,910
♫ Don't leave me. I’m falling into your traps ♫

192
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,690
♫ Tell me how to resist you ♫

193
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,980
♫ Just like bubble love ♫

194
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,780
♫ Is it true this time? ♫

195
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,130
♫ Just like bubble love ♫

196
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,150
♫ It’s our famous scene ♫

197
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,770
♫ Since you’re so nice to me, ♫

198
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,090
♫ can we be happy together? ♫

199
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,490
♫ Just like bubble love ♫

200
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,130
♫ A bubble-like doubt ♫

201
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,600
♫ Just like bubble love ♫

202
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,630
♫ It bounces off and disappears ♫

203
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,280
♫ The drops of you still remain in my hand which I thought ♫

204
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,560
♫ I’ve grasped you as a whole ♫

205
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,480
♫ Just like bubble love ♫

206
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,360
Thank you for watching!
