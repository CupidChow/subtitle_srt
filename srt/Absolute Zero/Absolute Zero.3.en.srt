I think I might be lost.

-Then can you teach me?

52
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,370
Soon might like this

53
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,800
but it seemed like he didn't want to go.

54
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,330

No.

56
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,710

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,060
Who? Soon?

60
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,230
Right.

61
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,000
A little bit.

62
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,650

63
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,430
it seems like

64
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,430
you don't know him at all, right?

65
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,010
Then,

66
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,710
do you think

67
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,950
we will fall in love with

71
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,210
Nothing.

72
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,470
Oh.

73
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,610

75

These two are hiding something from us.

76
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,409
You don't know? I knew it a long time ago.

77
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,650

78
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,250

79
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,440
Mangkorn, look at him.

80
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
We aren't hiding any secrets from you.

81
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Nothing.

82
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,150
Really?

83
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,060
-What are you smiling?
-What? Can't I smile?

84
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,710
You as well.

85
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,120
The machine needs to be preheated after it is turned on, and there are two types of coffee beans in our store.

86

Connect this one to this side.

87

-This one goes over here.
-Okay.

88

Choose first…

89
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,500
Okay, then...

90
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,570
-Is it OK?
-Yes.

91
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,340
Fighting.

92
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,010
That's great.

93
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,450
Ms. Nan, it is done.

94
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,370
Let me try the first cup of coffee you made.

95
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,500
Very good.

96
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,130
That's nice.

97
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,230
It's actually very good.

98
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,230
It's salable.

99
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,230
-Thank you.
-You passed the test.

100
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,230
I just scraped a pass.

101
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,950
-Why did you say that? It indeed tastes really good.
-Thank you.

102
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,220
If you don't believe me, you can make him one cup when Ongsa comes back.

103
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,690
Okay.

104
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,430
But Ongsa doesn't like coffee very much.

105
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,530
Well,

106
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,550
Ongsa told me you were looking for a job.

107
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,860
Right.

108
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,170
How about working for me?

109
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,630
Hey, right.

110
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,320
Ms. Nan. No. I can't ask you for that.

111
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,490
-I've already troubled you a lot.
-Wait a minute.

112
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,340
Troubled me?

113
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,970
Every day you help me do this and that.

114
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,520
I should be the one who owes you a favor.

115
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,610
But if you don't want to work with me, that's fine.

116
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,240
-You can tell me.
-Ms. Nan, that's not the case.

117
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,430
I want to work with you.

118
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
You want to?

119
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
That means you agreed, right?

120
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,180
Yes.

121
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,660
-Then we have a deal.
-Okay.

122
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,240
-It's settled.
-Thank you.

123
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,490
Welcome on board.

124
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,550
Thanks.

125
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,290
I feel relaxed with you helping me. Thank you.

126
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,960

127
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
-Hello, Mr. Barista.
-Hello.

128
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,500
-I'm back.
-Hello.

129
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,280
Hey, I gotta show off.

130
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,000
I taught Suansoon how to make coffee today.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,890
Oh, he succeeded the first time he tried. It was perfect.

132
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,530
It tastes much better than the first cup of coffee you made.

133
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,170
Are you planning to steal my job?

134
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,640
Yes.

135
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,080
And Ms. Nan has offered me a job here.

136
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,080
Yes.

137
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,620
Then you have to make a cup for me.

138
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,910
If I don't think it's okay,

139
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,230
you can't work here.

140
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,820
Okay, senior.

141
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,340
If you have any questions, just ask me.

142
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,340
Okay, junior?

143
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,010
Here.

144
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,120
You have to wear an apron.

145
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,120
I forgot.

146
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,250
Tight or not?

147
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,680
Alright.

148
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,070
Is it okay?

149
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,440
Are you two working or not?

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm here.

151
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
There's someone else here.

152
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,940
It's tied as tightly as a snake's bite.

153
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,430
Here.

154
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,690
-Did you make this?
-Yeah.

155
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,810
Just so-so.

156
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,810
In this case, I won't make you coffee next time.

157
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,060
Oh, I was kidding.

158
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,290
I was kidding too.

159
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,330
Why...

160
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,620
Why didn't you get changed before playing football?

161
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,220
Otherwise, your school uniform will be dirty.

162
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,460
Do all adults like to nag so much?

163
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,460
My mother is like this too.

164
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,160
Isn't it because you always do things that trigger nagging?

165
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,580
Is it?

166
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,760
Ah.

167
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,900
Are you sleepy?

168
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,240
No.

169
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,410
Aren't you sleeping?

170
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,190
But I'm not sleepy.

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,500
It's very comfortable here.

172
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Just let me lean on you like this for a while.

173
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,730
Just for a while, okay?

174
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,140
Okay.

175
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,610
-Soon.
-Yes?

176
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,130
Do you like watching movies?

177
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,940
Yes.

178
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,170
I

179
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,010
once heard

180
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,890
if you want to know someone,

181
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,460
you need to go see the movie that person likes

182
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,500
or listen to the songs that person likes,

183
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,400
and read the books that person likes.

184
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,520
Then what?

185
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,930
It's just that

186
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,290
I want to know more about you.

187
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,510
Then let's start with watching movies.

188
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,050
I

189
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,570
like Interstellar.

190
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,820
Well...

191
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,680
I mean I like My Girl.

192
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,970
-It was My Girl that you just said?
-Yes.

193
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,560
Well,

194
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,800
what I wanted to say is that I prefer watching My Girl.

195
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,270
But

196
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,060
I've already watched My Girl.

197
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,070
That means...

198
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,270
I already know you.

199
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,320
Actually, it has been a long time since I watched it last time.

200
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Do you want to watch it again with me?

201
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,040
Of course.

202
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,100
Okay.

203
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,440
If so, when the TV in the bedroom gets repaired,

204
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,760
we can watch it together.

205
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,950
I'll repair it right away after the store closes.

206
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,950
We can watch it tonight.

207
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,740
You don't have to do this.

208
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
No, otherwise it will be too late.

209
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,970
hello.

210
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,970
-What's wrong?
-It's time to eat.

211
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,970
-Okay.
-Then come in.

212
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,970
Come in.

213
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,930
What's for dinner?

214
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,020
Delicious.

215
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,800
Thanks.

216
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,890
How do you know Ongsa likes this dish?

217
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,099
Well,

218
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,300
Ms. Nan, who makes better coffee, me or Soon?

219
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,140
Definitely Soon.

220
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
You don't care about my feelings at all?

221
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,500
How do you want me to

222
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,060
reply to that question?

223
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,390
I taught both of you.

224
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,960
In fact, no matter what I say, I have the correct answer.

225
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,579
Because I taught you both. I taught you well, so the coffee you two make is good.

226
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,300
Well, at the beginning,

227
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,100
-I probably didn't think much about it.
-Wait, wait.

228
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,050
Just tell me if you have thought about it.

229
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,050
You asked just because you didn't think much about it.

230
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,050
Have you ever thought about it?

231
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,050
-Have you thought about it?
-I have thought about it.

232
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,050
Soon listened carefully when I was teaching him.

233
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,530
He didn't talk back to me and ask questions like you did.

234
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,090
[V.C.D Grandpa D.V.D]

235
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,730
Please help yourself.

236
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,770
-Hello.
-Hello.

237
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,770
-I'm here to return this.
-Okay.

238
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,390
Oh, we have a lot of new movies coming in recently.

239
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,550
OK.

240
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,690
Isn't there anyone else in the store today?

241
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,550
My daughter went to visit our relatives.

242
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,340
She'll probably be back in several days.

243
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,340
Feel free to look around.

244
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,120
[My Girl]

245
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,910
I don't have a membership card.

246
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,620
It's okay.

247
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,230
You should always take good care of your health.

248
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,100
What?

249
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Do I look like someone with a short life expectancy?

250
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,970
Do you mean that something bad will happen to you in the future?

251
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,660
Maybe.

252
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,890
I have to go.

253
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,310
-Soon, you are back.
-Yeah.

254
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,270
How about it?

255
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,910
It should be able to work now.

256
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,780
Yeah!

257
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,250
Awesome.

258
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Of course.

259
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,820
Wow.

260
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,890
-This is My Girl.
-Yes.

261
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,610
I rented it. Do you want to watch it together?

262
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,120
Let's watch it together.

263
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,890
Come.

264
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,110
-Welcome.
-I'll take care of it.

265
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,100
You can work on question 13.

266
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,100
Okay.

267
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,480
Hello.

268
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,540
Ongsa, I ask you seriously.

269
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Don't you want to know

270
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,540
who Suansoon is?

271
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,890
Yes, I do.

272
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,060
Then

273
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
why don't you ask him directly?

274
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,660
If he wants to tell me,

275
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,100
he will tell me.

276
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,430
Oh.

277
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,860
-So, you are letting things be?
-Yeah.

278
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,300
Whatever.

279
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,660
Hello.

280
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,580
-Oh, it's you.
-Hello everyone.

281
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,400
Hello.

282
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,180
You haven't been here for a long time.

283
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,930
I happened to have something to do around here, so I stopped by to take a look.

284
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,450
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

285
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,130
Where is that naughty boy?

286
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,680
He is in the warehouse because I asked him to check things.

287
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,910
I'll ask him to come over.

288
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,430
Ongsa.

289
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,320
Ongsa, your parents are here.

290
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Coming.

291
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,270
-He said he was coming but he wasn't moving at all.
-That's what he is like.

292
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,270
Do you want to buy this?

293
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,620
This is a new arrival.

294
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,020
Did you make it yourself?

295
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
I bought it to sell it.

296
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,510
It looked great, so I put it up for sale.

297
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,640
I put it here for guests to eat, but it's almost gone.

298
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:37,820
If you want to show your support, you can buy some drinks.

299
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,500
Ongsa.

300
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,910
Coming.

301
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,780
Don't embarrass me. I said very nice things about you.

302
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,780
Okay.

303
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,730
-There is no latte art. When he brought it over just now, it was all mixed up.
-Yes, I saw it.

304
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,300
Where is the latte art? I can only see a blurred pattern.

305
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,140
You haven't been home much lately.

306
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,650
I'm about to enter college, so I've been working hard to study, Mom.

307
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,560
Did I hear it wrong?

308
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Can I trust you?

309
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Half-half.

310
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,100
Half of the time, he is really diligent in reviewing.

311
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
But the other half of the time,

312
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
he's very attached to his tutor.

313
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Really?

314
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
He even has a tutor?

315
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,960
-Where's the tutor?
-Oh.

316
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I saw him just now.

317
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
But Soon seemed to be in a hurry for some reason.

318
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
The person who is tutoring him was just there.

319
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
You didn't notice him, I guess.

320
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,520
Who is he?

321
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,420
Just my tutor.

322
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Does he live here?

323
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,460
-Yes
-Really?

324
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,530
No wonder you don't go back home.

325
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,330
He comes to the store every now and then. I thought it was because he was diligent.

326
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,060
No.

327
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,910
If you want to do it well,

328
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,570
just study hard and don't be naughty.

329
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,530
Dad, I got it.

330
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,530
-Don't worry.
-Really?

331
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,970
How can I not worry? I only have one son. That's you.

332
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,970
And you're so naughty.

333
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,260
I'm not naughty, Mom.

334
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,380
Who says you're not naughty?

335
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,700
-Who says you're not naughty?
