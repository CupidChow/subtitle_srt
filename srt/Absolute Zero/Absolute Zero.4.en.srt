00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,900
Why are you talking about this suddenly?

173
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,860
Just in case.

174
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,530
I should make a plan in advance.

175
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,530
Dad, what's wrong?

176
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,740
Well...

177
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Who should I give them to?

178
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,850
I'll tell you when it's almost time.

179
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,240
Then you shouldn't have told me just now. I'm worried, you know?

180
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,620
Forget it. Go and continue to put everything in order.

181
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,620
Goodness.

182
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,540
I don't know what you were talking about.

183
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,680
What's wrong?

184
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,250
Nothing.

185
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,860
I just want to hold you.

186
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,560
Are you sure?

187
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:49,950
Hm.

188
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,820
Your heart is beating so fast.

189
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,440
Are you shy?

190
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,060
It feels like

191
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,980
a butterfly is flying in my belly. (It's a pun. It means anxiety.)

192
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,640
I heard

193
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,140
if a butterfly flies to you,

194
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,020
it means love is coming.

195
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,280
Looks like it's true.

196
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,190
It's flying around in my belly.

197
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,460
Your heart is still beating so fast.

198
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,840
A little.

199
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,560
Here?

200
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,600
Yes.

201
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,630
Go in.

202
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,230
Oh, this.

203
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,760
Okay.

204
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,140
Have we met before, young man?

205
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,690
No.

206
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,540
You want to rent it using the name of Ongsa, right?

207
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:24,970
Yes.

208
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,740
Wait a minute.

209
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,740
I'm gonna go outside to wait.

210
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,020
Are you sure this place is suitable for living?

211
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,800
Yes.

212
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,740
There's no TV.

213
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,900
Should I go get the radio in the shop?
Then you won't be bored.

214
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,390
It's okay.

215
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,050
It belongs to Ms. Nan, right?

216
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,270
This place is okay to me.

217
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,640
Ms. Nan doesn't need it.

218
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,200
This place is really okay to me.

219
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,370
Can I come to visit you?

220
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
Why do you want to come?

221
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,520
We can meet in the shop.

222
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,660
Well, that's not enough.

223
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,190
Go study hard.

224
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,280
I've always been serious. I've never talked nonsense.

225
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,340
Why do you like to talk back?

226
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,040
-I've never talked back.
-You are.

227
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,010
You are talking back.

228
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,340
Sort of.

229
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,540
I'm okay with this place.

230
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,280
Are you sure?

231
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,690
How did it go?

232
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,920
-Hm.
-How about the house?

233
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,380
It's good.

234
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,040
Really?

235
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,410
Ongsa said there's nothing in the room.

236
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,720
You need to buy everything after you move into the new house, right?

237
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,380
It's not that bad, Ms. Nan.

238
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,290
Ongsa overstated it.

239
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,780
If there is anything I can help with,

240
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,150
just let me know.

241
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,560
You're welcome.

242
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,040
Thank you, Ms. Nan.

243
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,720
Please come in.

244
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,850
Two of you?

245
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,260
This... This is the beverage menu. And this is the dessert menu.

246
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
The meat menu.

247
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,840
Hello.

248
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,400
I just moved in. I live next door to you.

249
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,820
So I came to say hello.

250
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,740
What are you reading?

251
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,740
I think you got the wrong number.

252
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,990
He probably didn't hear me.

253
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,730
Ah?

254
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,470
Oh.

255
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,960
-I'm back.
-Oh.

256
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,540
Aren't you going to sleep in the shop tonight?

257
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,730
Just let me come home.

258
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,660
I miss my mom's cooking so much.

259
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,460
Oh, really?

260
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,760
Isn't it because that boy is not in the shop?

261
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,060
Mom, how do you know?

262
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,600
-Right?
-Mom.

263
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
I'm right, right?

264
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,100
Right? You look dispirited.

265
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm not dispirited.

266
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,020
Then why don't you invite him over for dinner?

267
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,800
He probably doesn't want to come.

268
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,340
Isn't Dad back yet?

269
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,850
Not yet.

270
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,850
I think he'll be back soon.

271
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,920
Son, go take a shower first. Then come downstairs for dinner together.

272
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,120
Okay.

273
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,390
I don't think I can go with you.

274
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,610
It's bad.

275
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,680
Because you're thinking about someone else, not me.

276
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,650
How do you know this place?

277
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,670
Someone took me here.

278
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,380
It's his favorite restaurant.

279
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,490
Later,

280
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,130
answer these 2 questions.

281
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,250
If you can finish them, I'll let you go home.

282
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,210
Okay.

283
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,410
Goodness...

284
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,190
What's wrong?

285
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,230
Mr. Soon, coffee.

286
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,450
Thank you.

287
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,080
What are you looking at?

288
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,340
This is my legal right.

289
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,800
I can look at whatever I want.

290
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,860
But your so-called whatever you want is my face.

291
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,100
Well... I want to look at your face.

292
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,370
Nonsense.

293
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,430
In the future,

294
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,560
will you miss my coffee?

295
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,240
Actually...

296
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,120
you just moved out.

297
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,500
But...

298
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,360
why do I think

299
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,840
we're about to be parted?

300
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,980
Ongsa.

301
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,760
Hm?

302
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,780
No matter what happens,

303
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,010
please grow up.

304
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,500
For what?

305
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,460
Just...

306
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,360
for everyone who loves you.

307
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,800
Including you?

308
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,650
Oh.

309
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,750
I thought...

310
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
there are clothes hanging here.

311
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,450
Suansoon.

312
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,880
Na.

313
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,530
Why are you here alone?

314
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,230
Oh. I need to go to the club today.

315
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,390
The teacher is not there, so I came out first.

316
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,910
I'm going to buy ice cream to eat and wait for them.

317
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,600
Do you want to join me?

318
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,030
Let's go.

319
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,680
Let's go.

320
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,140
Don't you like watching movies in the cinema?

321
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,610
Hm?

322
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,540
Ongsa said you won't go to movies with him.

323
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,970
Oh.

324
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,180
Or don't you like romance movies?

325
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,940
It's not a romance movie.

326
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,700
Have you watched it?

327
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,270
Na.

328
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,490
Do you believe going back in time?

329
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,830
No.

330
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,890
What about you?

331
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,160
I believe it.

332
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,090
I knew it.

333
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,890
Why?

334
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,860
Do I look like someone who thinks too much?

335
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,810
I don't know.

336
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,710
I think...

337
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,960
it seems you are not living in the present.

338
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,210
But in this universe, anything could happen.

339
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,200
You said you don't believe it, right?

340
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,730
I just don't.

341
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,730
Unless someone can prove it.

342
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,570
