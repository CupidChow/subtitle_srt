1
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,054
-Ye-bin.
-Yes.

2
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,185
-Take Ye-bin upstairs.
-Okay.

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,146
See you again, Grandmother.

4
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,648
All right, go on.

5
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,446
Let's go.

6
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,414
It's nice to meet you.

7
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,459
Thank you very much for making time
to meet with me.

8
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,085
I'm Laura Jung.

9
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,797
My gosh,

10
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,840
we've met before,

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,758
haven't we?

12
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,845
Have we?

13
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,555
We met at Seoul Hotel that day,

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:38,932
in front of the elevator.

15
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,185
Oh, right. I remember you.

16
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,436
Oh, right.

17
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,773
That woman you were with that day.

18
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,067
How do you know her?

19
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,276
Why do you ask?

20
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,445
She looks so much like Jennifer.

21
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,448
Didn't Coach Kim Ju-yeong
say you were mistaken?

22
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,408
Coach Kim Ju-yeong?

23
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,410
You mean, Ye-seo's coordinator?

24
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,995
Gosh,

25
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,289
she's Ye-seo's coordinator?

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,920
Jennifer Kim was famous in Fairfax.

27
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,632
Doesn't she have a daughter?

28
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,217
Her name is K.

29
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,471
I don't know anything
about her personal life.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,181
I don't even need to know.

31
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,141
Hang on.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,351
I'll show you something.

33
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,605
There it is.

34
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,775
Have a look.

35
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,360
It's her, right?

36
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:40,034
SUSPECT ARRESTED FOR MURDERING HUSBAND
AND STAGING IT AS AN ACCIDENT

37
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,039
It's her, isn't it?

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,167
My goodness.

39
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,544
I can't believe Jennifer
is Ye-seo's coach.

40
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,087
Let me see.

41
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,428
I can see why you mistook her
for this woman, but it's not her.

42
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,263
It's not her?

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,223
You actually think this makes sense?

44
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,267
How could you mistake her for this woman?

45
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,685
Think about it.

46
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,854
A person's reputation
isn't built overnight.

47
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,148
How could such a despicable person be...

48
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,482
Exactly.

49
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,651
She's known as
the best admissions coordinator

50
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,403
in the country
due to her proven track record.

51
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,613
I'm sure it's her.

52
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,156
Her daughter was a genius

53
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,910
who got into George Washington University
at the age of nine.

54
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,205
People found out
that she homeschooled her daughter,

55
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,791
and she even went on TV shows
as a mom who raised a genius.

56
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,294
Anyway, she was very famous.

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,255
But soon after that,
her husband died in a car accident

58
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,049
and her daughter became an imbecile.

59
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,636
A woman like her working
as an admissions coordinator in Korea?

60
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,639
It's plausible, don't you think?

61
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,146
Since you're so convinced
that this woman is Ye-seo's coordinator,

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,607
I suppose I can forget
about the favor you asked of me.

63
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,360
-Pardon?
-She makes sure

64
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,654
that all of her students
get into SNU's med school,

65
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,198
so it's not like you can
just go ahead and hire her.

66
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,533
You have to be chosen by her.

67
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,663
And you must go through a thorough
screening process in order to be chosen.

68
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,876
She agreed to meet you
because I practically begged her,

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,962
saying that you're
my mother-in-law's acquaintance.

70
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,299
But you believe
that she's this despicable criminal,

71
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,426
so I guess you don't need to meet her now.

72
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,722
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,933
I must've been mistaken.

74
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,227
Some people look so similar to each other

75
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,104
that we call them doppelgängers.

76
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,606
-Please give me a chance--
-Mother.

77
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,818
Coach Kim hired someone
who used to design questions

78
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,320
for the college entrance exam
as Ye-seo's new Korean instructor.

79
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,614
You have nothing to worry about now.

80
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,413
Jun-sang will be home soon.
May I leave first?

81
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,580
Yes, of course.

82
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,005
What should I do now?

83
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,654
JENNIFER KIM

84
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,827
SUSPECT ARRESTED FOR MURDERING HUSBAND

85
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,167
MURDER SUSPECT CONFIRMED
TO BE JENNIFER KIM,

86
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,210
WHO TAMPERED WITH CAR BRAKES
TO STAGE IT AS AN ACCIDENT

87
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,178
That woman, Kim Ju-yeong, is dangerous.

88
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,430
She's really dangerous.

89
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,895
U-JU'S MOM

90
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,989
I'll cut to the chase.

91
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,241
Why do you think

92
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,535
Coach Kim is dangerous?

93
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,415
When I went to meet Dr. Park,

94
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,501
I also met his friend.

95
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,505
She coached his son too

96
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,340
but medical school wasn't for him,

97
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,009
so he took repeated leaves of absence.

98
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,344
But eventually,

99
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,138
he ended up taking his own life
in his third year.

100
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,683
Apparently, he had a lot of trouble
with his dad, who ran a hospital.

101
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,227
But Coach Kim

102
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,853
was the last person

103
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,648
he exchanged texts with before he died.

104
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,360
I heard he told her
that he couldn't stand medical school

105
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,531
and asked her to dissuade his dad,
who wanted him to inherit the hospital.

106
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,200
Do you know

107
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,452
what her answer was?

108
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,667
"What will you do
if you give up on medical school?"

109
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,004
Everyone is dying
to get into medical school.

110
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,589
But he got in
and said he couldn't take it.

111
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,718
She was probably thinking from his
parents' point of view when she said that.

112
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,638
He said he'd rather die than
to go to medical school.

113
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,223
He wanted to live,

114
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,891
and he begged for help.

115
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,394
That's why he asked her
to persuade his father,

116
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,646
but she basically told him
that he had no other option.

117
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,773
As if graduating from medical school
was everything,

118
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,776
and as if his life would be worthless
otherwise.

119
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,779
I bet she kept on pressuring him.

120
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,242
Have you wondered...

121
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,412
what she might be doing to provoke Ye-seo?

122
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,874
Have you thought of that?

123
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,962
For someone
who is mentally fragile like her,

124
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,048
nothing's more effective than having
a competitor right before her eyes.

125
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,930
What's even more frightening

126
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,141
is the fact that she brought up

127
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,394
Yeon-du, a student who died
20 years ago during my teacher training,

128
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,854
in order to approach me.

129
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,648
Can you imagine how thoroughly
she looked into my life

130
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,109
for her to know about Yeon-du
and how I felt about the incident?

131
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,738
She looked into her background?

132
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,740
Does that mean

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,408
she also knows about Hye-na?

134
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,827
Why do you think she had to approach me

135
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,289
by lying to me like that?

136
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,755
You can...

137
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,508
guess why, right?

138
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,389
I'll be fine since I'll never
have to see her again.

139
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,600
But I'm seriously worried...

140
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,937
about you and Ye-seo.

141
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,523
Why?

142
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,984
Are you scared
I might turn out like Myeong-ju?

143
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,199
There's no need for your useless worrying.

144
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,036
I'm sure Yeong-jae's mother also
trusted her, just like you do right now.

145
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,663
I told you not to worry.

146
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,400
Coach Kim definitely told me

147
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,777
that she'll look into Hye-na's background.

148
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,156
Did she find something...

149
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,994
Wouldn't it be wise for you to keep
the ticking bomb close by

150
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,370
while you get rid of the detonator?

151
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,331
Did she tell me
to let Hye-na live at our place,

152
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,584
knowing that Hye-na
is my husband's daughter?

153
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,169
I said you should have Hye-na
move into your place.

154
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,879
Have Hye-na move into your place.

155
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,722
COACH KIM

156
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,693
Se-ri

157
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,446
has been pretending
to be a Harvard student,

158
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,198
so Harvard sued her.

159
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,908
She's been sneaking into lectures

160
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,452
and using their cafeteria as well.

161
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,288
She's been living in the dorms
as if she's a Harvard student.

162
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,458
She was afraid she'd get caught.
That's why she fled to Korea.

163
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,542
PROFESSOR MICHAEL'S LECTURE

164
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,336
This can't be true.

165
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,464
There must've been a mix-up.

166
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,135
SEON-HYE

167
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,891
Seon-hye.

168
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,353
Se-ri didn't lie.
She really is a student at Harvard.

169
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,271
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

170
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,067
Harvard is going to publish
an article about her

171
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,860
in their school newspaper soon.

172
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,156
She sneaked into lectures for 12 months,

173
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,367
and the dormitory
costs 172 dollars a night.

174
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,161
So they want us to compensate
a total of 62,000 dollars.

175
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,163
What are we going to do about Se-ri?

176
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,583
How in the world did she end up like this?

177
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,086
Goodness.

178
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,589
If your husband finds out,
that will be the end for all of us.

179
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,925
What are we going to do, Seung-hye?

180
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,135
What do we do, Seung-hye?

181
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,554
Seung-hye,

182
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,390
are you listening to me?

183
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
What are you doing?

184
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,230
Why are you in here?

185
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,523
Well,

186
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,318
I just felt like taking a look
at Se-ri's social media page.

187
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,908
I understand. I check it frequently too.

188
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,831
I even made a social media account
because of Se-ri.

189
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,503
What do you think?

190
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,880
They say that children
are a parent's work of art.

191
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,174
Can she be any more perfect than this?

192
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,220
Honey, don't you wire Se-ri's tuition fee

193
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,098
straight to Harvard's bank account?

194
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,016
Why would I do that?

195
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,312
I wired the entire tuition fee
to Se-ri's account when she got accepted.

196
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,275
Se-ri pays the tuition fee herself
and uses the rest as pocket money.

197
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,028
Let's see.

198
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,905
There has to be at least
one or two Korean Americans

199
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,324
working for the United States government.

200
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,193
Se-ri.

201
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,152
Se-ri.

202
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,071
Se-ri!

203
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,325
Se-ri!

204
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,204
-What's wrong with you?
-What is it?

205
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,705
-Who is she?
-I don't know.

206
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,625
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,924
Dad, I got accepted to Harvard.

208
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,383
What? You got accepted?

209
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,345
Good job, darling.

210
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,097
My amazing daughter!

211
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,600
Congratulations, Seung-hye.

212
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,185
-You must be so happy.
-You shouldn't have.

213
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,269
I brought you one too.

214
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,648
Gosh, this really wasn't necessary.

215
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,073
SE-RI

216
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,284
Where are you?

217
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,953
Why did you call so many times?

218
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,287
Is something up, Mom?

219
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,372
Your aunt...

220
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,335
I'm at...

221
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,170
Itaewon right now.

222
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,714
I was wondering
if you wanted to go home together.

223
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,052
Mom, I'm sorry. It's been so long
since I met my friends.

224
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,096
-I'll go home a little later.
-Se-ri...

225
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,279
-Hey, guys!
-Get over here.

226
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,990
-We were waiting for you.
-Come on.

227
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,283
-That's your drink.
-Drink up.

228
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,160
-Drink up, drink up
-Drink up, drink up

229
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,356
LITERATURE FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

230
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,757
Have you wondered what she
might be doing to provoke Ye-seo?

231
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,176
Have you thought of that?

232
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,476
-Wait a second.
-Okay.

233
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,228
Hurry up. Hurry.

234
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,190
Let me see. Gosh, open your eyes.
I said, open your eyes.

235
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:28,153
Gosh, you really need to grow up.

236
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,072
-Does this scare you that much?
-Yes.

237
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,573
How do you even perform surgery?

238
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,574
Let's try again.

239
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,076
-Okay.
-Here.

240
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,287
Open your eyes. Open them. My goodness.

241
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,831
My gosh, you do it yourself.

242
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,000
Gosh, come on.

243
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,293
I can't even open my eyes
because they're so dry.

244
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,837
You drive me nuts.

245
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,589
You don't even know that your son

246
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,174
ran away from home yesterday, do you?

247
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,427
What? Our son ran away from home?

248
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,346
-I'm so sick of you. Gosh.
-Wait.

249
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,307
Where is he? Where's my precious son?

250
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,393
He's sleeping.

251
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,146
I told him he could cut down
on his classes,

252
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,023
and he said he wants
to drop the morning classes.

253
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,442
He's sound asleep.

254
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,321
That's why I told you
not to push him too much.

255
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,115
How stressed must he have been
to run away?

256
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,950
What? Don't push him too much?

257
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,745
Then how is he going
to get into a science high school?

258
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,663
If he doesn't get accepted,
you'll blame me.

259
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,998
So stop acting like you don't care.

260
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,583
Gosh, I don't even want to look at you.

261
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,501
Jin Jin, where are you going? Jin...

262
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,171
Gosh, how am I going to do this?

263
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,256
My goodness. Gosh.

264
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,776
-Woo Su-han!
-Su-han!

265
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,991
How could he be so brave?

266
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,368
Ms. Jin?

267
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,120
Are you okay?

268
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,164
Let's look for him together.

269
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,921
Honey!

270
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,382
Am I crazy? What's wrong with me?

271
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,804
I'm off duty and want to sleep.
So don't wake me.

272
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,097
Sleep all you want.

273
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,725
I should...

274
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,394
thank him, shouldn't I?

275
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,989
You must've been so worried.

276
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,783
How's Su-han?

277
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,788
He's just fine, thanks to Dr. Hwang.

278
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,291
The situation could have gotten so bad
if it hadn't been for him.

279
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,880
The fool just ran right into the street.

280
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,384
Dr. Hwang rushed up like Usain Bolt,

281
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,345
grabbed Su-han, and rolled over.

282
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,264
He looked so cool and...

283
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,598
I mean, I was so grateful.

284
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,896
Here.

285
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,941
-You shouldn't have.
-Take it.

286
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:14,778
Thank you.

287
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,321
It's nothing.

288
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,865
He told me

289
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,492
that U-ju ran away from home once too.

290
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,452
That was such a comfort to me.

291
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,374
For a year after I married my husband,

292
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,043
U-ju and I fought every day.

293
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,420
How did you

294
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,922
manage to raise him so well?

295
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,843
What's the secret to his good grades?

296
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,638
-The secret?
-Goodness.

297
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,851
I promised my son I'd cut down
on his lessons at the academy,

298
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,604
but I regretted it
as soon as I woke up this morning.

299
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,608
Just looking at him sleeping in instead
of going to his classes made me furious.

300
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,277
The anger was rising up inside me.

301
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,197
I can't decide whether I should
leave him be or not.

302
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,077
If it's that hard on Su-han,
why not keep him at home?

303
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,913
I'd love to do that.

304
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,873
If he could still get decent grades.

305
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:10,918
Why don't you...

306
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,753
tell me...

307
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,007
how U-ju does so well in school?

308
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,970
There's nothing exactly
that I can call a secret.

309
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,940
Now, teach us how to solve
what I wrote on the board.

310
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,192
How am I supposed to teach this?

311
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,736
You learned this yesterday.
It's factorization.

312
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,031
What are we doing? I was asleep.

313
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,117
This is the secret to U-ju's good grades.

314
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,788
If you can teach what you have learned,
that means you know it perfectly.

315
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,498
Really?

316
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,543
Son. Pretend that
Mom and Dad are your students.

317
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,630
Sir, I don't understand
how to solve that problem.

318
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,006
Please teach me.

319
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,467
-Me too.
-Good.

320
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,552
Darn it.

321
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,684
Let's say that a minus b is x.

322
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,437
Then it becomes x² minus 5x plus 6.

323
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,438
Right.

324
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,942
I don't understand, sir.

325
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,694
Are you serious?

326
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,862
You don't know that? That's really easy.

327
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,907
Shut your mouth.

328
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,117
I don't understand.

329
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,079
Sir, could you please slow down?

330
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,040
Explain it very slowly, please.

331
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,464
A...

332
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,844
minus b...

333
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,557
is a common factor.

334
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,520
So let's call it x.

335
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,730
Woo Su-han!

336
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,607
You rhino.

337
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,234
"Rhino"?

338
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,571
"A rhino runs in the Serengeti."

339
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,490
-Do you want to get hit by a rhino?
-Please don't.

340
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,034
I'll just...

341
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,014
SUSPECT ARRESTED FOR MURDERING
HUSBAND AND STAGING IT AS AN ACCIDENT

342
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,871
I know that it's a personal matter,

343
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,291
but I think this requires an explanation.

344
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,674
If you had read this article,

345
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,346
then you would have also read that
I was released due to lack of evidence.

346
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,848
What more do you want to know?

347
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,936
If you were in my shoes,

348
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,605
would you just stop
after looking up the article?

349
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:23,693
You even denied to Laura Jung
that you are Jennifer Kim.

350
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,203
Do you have any other plans
this afternoon?

351
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,851
Mom, what's wrong?

352
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,145
What's this?

353
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,481
Your room's a mess.

354
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,526
Didn't I tell you to clean it up?

355
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,780
You're old enough now.
Why are you still such a mess?

356
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:52,991
Mom.

357
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,826
How long must I clean up after you for?

358
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,536
How long...

359
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,625
How long must I clean up after you for?

360
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,629
What's all this noise?

361
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,964
Se-ri, are you okay?

362
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,467
-Gi-jun, get the first-aid kit.
-Okay. I'll be right back.

363
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,886
Are you crazy?

364
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,596
Look at her face!

365
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,182
I told you to clean your room.

366
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,435
I've told you over and over again.

367
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,979
I got home at 5 a.m. last night.

368
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,232
Then I fell asleep.
I didn't have time to clean.

369
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,777
I met my friends for the first time
in ages to let off some steam.

370
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,904
Is that such a terrible thing?

371
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,157
I spent every single minute of my life
studying at Harvard!

372
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,327
Yes, of course, we know that. We do.

373
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,580
I know very well how hard you studied.

374
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,748
Let it go.

375
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,959
Mom, are you sick?

376
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,211
You look really pale.

377
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,715
You did this to her
just because she didn't clean her room?

378
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,968
What's wrong with you?

379
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,387
You rushed out in the middle
of the night yesterday

380
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,097
and put sugar in the pollack soup today.

381
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,058
What on earth is the matter with you?

382
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,353
-Dad, the first-aid kit.
-Okay.

383
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,404
Look at me, Se-ri.

384
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,077
-It stings.
-Bear with me. Are you okay?

385
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,537
-Just relax.
-It hurts.

386
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,289
Just hang in there for a bit.

387
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,542
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

388
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,964
I hope my pretty daughter
isn't left with a scarred face.

389
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,959
That's my daughter, Katherine.

390
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,590
She scored 2,200 on the SAT
at the age of 8

391
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,509
and got into George Washington University
at the age of nine.

392
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,846
Even experts that specialize in prodigies

393
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:24,559
said that K's IQ couldn't be measured
because it was above 200.

394
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,397
What mother would intentionally
damage the brake line in her car

395
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,026
to make her genius daughter
end up like that?

396
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,740
Considering these factors,
I was released due to lack of evidence,

397
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,451
but people still suspected me
of staging the accident...

398
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,456
because my husband and I
were about to get a divorce.

399
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,417
I lost my husband like that,

400
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,129
and even my genius daughter
ended up in a coma.

401
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,799
But no one offered me any consolation.

402
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,509
Rather, they called me a murderer,

403
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,220
even though I had been cleared
of all charges.

404
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,224
-But why--
-I guess...

405
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,644
I bragged about
my genius daughter too much.

406
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,072
Almost a decade has passed,

407
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,539
but it still pains me to see K.

408
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,624
If the accident had never taken place...

409
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,252
Then by now, she'd be...

410
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,678
Thankfully, coaching outstanding students

411
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,472
helped me heal my wounds.

412
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,649
Do you now understand why coaching Ye-seo

413
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,777
is so important to me?

414
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,740
I'm sorry.

415
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,200
I didn't know you had
such painful memories.

416
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,702
Thank you...

417
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,455
for understanding.

418
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,261
She's been through
such a painful experience.

419
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,973
There's no way she told me to take Hye-na
in knowing that she's Jun-sang's daughter.

420
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,892
She couldn't have.

421
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,436
Why would she do such a spiteful thing?

422
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,939
I'm sure Yeong-jae's mother

423
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,358
also trusted her just like you.

424
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,543
Coach Kim.

425
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,714
Have you looked into Hye-na by any chance?

426
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,468
Why? Is there a problem?

427
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,513
No, it's just that she's extremely clever.

428
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,682
I was curious about
what kind of environment she grew up in.

429
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,686
She excels in school
even without any parental support.

430
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,730
I wonder if she was born
with superb genes.

431
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,108
I've also wondered the same thing.

432
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,113
I can look into it for you
if you want to find out.

433
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,491
No, it's okay. I don't want
to cause you trouble.

434
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,539
How's Hye-na doing by the way?

435
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,626
Like I said, she's very clever.

436
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,711
I'm glad I took your advice.

437
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,297
I'm happy to hear that.

438
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,066
Ma'am, will you be okay?
Ye-seo's mom must have figured out--

439
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,987
Bring Ye-seo to the meditation room
every day after class from now on.

440
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,948
Pardon? Every day?

441
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,249
Why do you make me
repeat myself every single time?

442
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,836
Don't you understand Korean?

443
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,589
Yes, ma'am.

444
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,391
How's Hye-na doing by the way?

445
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,519
Like I said, she's very clever.

446
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,605
I'm glad I took your advice.

447
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,982
I'm happy to hear that.

448
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,464
I asked you to redecorate my room.

449
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,257
Did you forget?

450
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,099
Should I just ask Ye-seo...

451
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,644
to switch rooms with me?

452
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,191
I'm just saying,
you shouldn't ignore my requests.

453
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,443
Please get it done tomorrow.

454
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,655
From the wallpaper
to the curtains and the sheets,

455
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,865
I want the best quality for everything.

456
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,910
I told you that no one can find out
until Ye-seo gets into SNU.

457
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,787
You want me to redecorate your room

458
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,914
just because you want me to,
even though it looks fine?

459
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,009
Then

460
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,136
get me a credit card.

461
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,722
I deserve to use one. Don't you think?

462
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,639
No, you don't.

463
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,683
You're still a minor.

464
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,861
All right.

465
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,612
Then I'll just sleep...

466
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,198
in Ye-bin's room tonight.

467
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,826
I told you that you can't.

468
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,327
Hye-na!

469
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,336
Ye-bin, I got your mom's permission.

470
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,172
She said I can sleep in your room

471
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,923
whenever I want.

472
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,008
Seriously?

473
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,217
Nice!

474
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,886
Then let's go to my room, Hye-na.

475
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,960
The person who loves you the most
in the entire world

476
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,796
is you.

477
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,134
Think only about your goal
and your success.

478
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,136
Just think about the moment

479
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,932
you'll receive your acceptance letter
from SNU's med school.

480
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,909
Reject and ignore everything
that gets in your way,

481
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,412
even if it's your mom.

482
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,881
You're standing
in pitch-black darkness now.

483
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,470
If you take just one false step,
you'll fall off a steep cliff.

484
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,856
You only have one guide on this journey.

485
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,984
I, Coach Kim Ju-yeong,
will ensure your safe passage

486
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,819
to SNU's med school.

487
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,335
Only then will you be able
to escape this darkness

488
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,879
and enjoy perfect success.

489
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,123
KIM HYE-NA

490
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,584
Hey, Hye-na.

491
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,215
Who said you could use my bathroom?

492
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,967
Why you...

493
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,011
Ye-bin, are you okay? Are you hurt?

494
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,055
Do you own the bathroom
on the second floor?

495
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,015
Go to the basement
if you don't want to share it.

496
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,600
-Did you rent the bathroom?
-Hey.

497
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,559
Ye-bin,

498
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,269
don't be so mean to Ye-seo.

499
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,604
I'm okay.

500
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,898
You should go back to sleep.

501
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,358
I'll go downstairs.

502
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,985
-Gosh.
-Go to sleep.

503
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,628
Hey, get over yourself.

504
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,465
Do you think you've become Ye-bin's sister
just because Ye-bin keeps relying on you?

505
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,636
You'll end up getting kicked out
once I get into university.

506
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,057
I'll get kicked out?

507
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,101
-Me?
-Yes.

508
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,270
Coach Kim Ju-yeong told me

509
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,313
that you're just a tool for my studies.

510
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,566
A tool for your studies?

511
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,527
Who's Kim Ju-yeong?

512
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,362
What? Kim Ju-yeong?

513
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,823
Have you gone mad?

514
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,117
How dare you call her
by her name like that?

515
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,620
I'm warning you.

516
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,622
Don't act out.

517
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,375
Or else, I'll crush
that smug face of yours.

518
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,544
What did you say?

519
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,379
Say that again.

520
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,630
Ye-seo.

521
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,134
Why would you say that to your friend?

522
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,468
You shouldn't talk that way.

523
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,887
You should be nice to her.

524
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,062
Is Kim Ju-yeong

525
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,189
Ye-seo's exam coordinator?

526
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,525
You don't need to know.

527
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,988
Ye-seo, I'm going in.

528
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,243
Did you not meet Kim Ju-yeong?

529
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,786
Who's that?

530
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,250
Kim Ju-yeong...

531
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,086
is using me as a tool?

532
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,885
What did you say?

533
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,511
My gosh.

534
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,389
Are you a doctor, Nurse Kim?

535
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,850
I prescribed that medicine
because it was necessary.

536
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,395
Well, the patient thinks
it's too expensive, so he refused to--

537
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,147
He said the medicine is too expensive?

538
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,067
If I care about whether or not
their insurance covers the medication,

539
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,985
when will the patient recover
and get discharged?

540
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,321
And does the hospital look like
a hotel to you?

541
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,157
How many times must I tell you
to reduce the hospitalization period?

542
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,327
We need to empty the beds
in order to take in new patients.

543
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,206
Look for a sanitarium
for the patient in room 505.

544
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,791
Understood?

545
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,793
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

546
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,175
He's so obsessed with money.

547
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,885
Does he think of patients
as a source of money?

548
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,220
If only people knew.

549
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,346
My gosh.

550
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,306
Don't say a word.

551
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,351
It's thanks to him that you get
a regular paycheck every month.

552
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,602
Gosh.

553
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,190
Chief Hwang.

554
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,317
Why did you follow me in here?

555
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,820
-I said I'll see you in my office.
-We're in trouble.

556
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,364
What is it? Is it an emergency?

557
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,825
I just heard this from the orthopedics.

558
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,701
Dr. Kang is going to become

559
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,745
the planning manager soon.

560
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,706
And the first thing he's going to do
is make changes to our center.

561
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,542
I heard you'll be replaced too.

562
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,419
I want you to check
Lee U-bin's MRI results.

563
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,629
What? But...

564
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,096
Jun-sang is going to become
the planning manager?

565
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,974
If a guy like him takes that position,

566
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,185
he'll start running the hospital
like a business.

567
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,733
So he wants to fire me.

568
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,365
Hello.

569
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,417
Chief Hwang.

570
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,879
It isn't time for consultations yet.

571
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,306
ARE HOSPITALS A PLACE TO EARN MONEY

572
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,141
OR A PLACE TO TREAT ILLNESSES?

573
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,901
IF WE NEGLECT THE REALITY OF HOSPITALS

574
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,860
Gosh.

575
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,654
He acted out without knowing
whom he's fighting against.

576
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,990
This is exactly why they say

577
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,783
"A cornered stone
meets the mason's chisel."

578
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,206
Does that mean it'll be game over
once Professor Cha

579
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,417
meets the thousand-year-old tortoise
and talks things out?

580
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,171
What are you talking about?
This is just the beginning.

581
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,590
"Well begun is half done."

582
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,549
Dr. Kang.

583
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,802
You've made it this far.

584
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,181
Congratulations, Planning Manager.

585
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,895
Planning Manager, my foot.

586
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,816
Let's go.

587
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,121
Honey, can you get me
a suit for a funeral?

588
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,165
Hurry. Come on.

589
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,343
Dr. Kang.

590
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,096
Mr. Baek just passed away.

591
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,140
Already?

592
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:45,229
But you didn't even get
to meet Director Choi yet.

593
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,480
Don't worry about that.

594
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,275
I'll send you a couple of things
he needs to know.

595
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,444
That will be enough

596
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,281
for him to start a conversation
with Hyeok-jae.

597
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,324
I'll see you at the funeral.

598
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,454
-I'll be late tonight.
-Here.

599
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,204
We need to talk.

600
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,460
-Let's talk later.
-Your aunt called.

601
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,132
Harvard wants her
to compensate 62,000 dollars.

602
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,509
Am I...

603
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,929
supposed to believe that?

604
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,807
I'm asking if I need to pay for that.

605
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,604
How could you do something like that?

606
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,439
Is that how I raised you?

607
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,442
How could you fool your parents like this?

608
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,658
So what are you going to do?

609
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,663
-What?
-You found out that I lied.

610
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,707
So what are you going to do now?
What's your plan?

611
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,216
Are you serious right now?

612
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,386
You should be begging for forgiveness.

613
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,055
What's my plan?

614
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,143
I'm sorry. I know what I did was wrong.

615
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,729
And I know you feel miserable right now.

616
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,023
But do you think
I feel comfortable about this?

617
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,234
It's killing me as well.
I feel miserable too.

618
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,695
Once Dad finds out, he might kill me.

619
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,655
No.

620
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,948
I dread going back.

621
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,617
But he might send me back there,
where word has spread already.

622
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,576
No.

623
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,496
He might hold a funeral
saying his daughter is dead

624
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,998
and lock me up
in a mental hospital somewhere.

625
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,876
Those are the kind of things
I imagined as I came back home.

626
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,677
Why did you lie if you knew
how severely he'd react?

627
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,889
And this isn't just a lie.
How could you commit such a fraud?

628
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,891
Because you guys were always
so obsessed about Harvard!

629
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,771
You guys didn't love me.

630
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,650
You just loved the fact
that your daughter was a Harvard student.

631
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,914
Mom.

632
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,126
-Mom.
-Se-ri.

633
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,086
Mom, please relax.

634
00:45:58,839 --> 00:45:59,965
Mom.

635
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,184
Se-ri!

636
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,269
Let go.

637
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,770
It's not true, is it?

638
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,315
This is a misunderstanding, right?

639
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,775
Didn't you hear everything?

640
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,069
So it's true?

641
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,448
Then is everything
on your social media a lie too?

642
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,158
Was it all an act?

643
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,744
Answer me!

644
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,039
How could you fool us like this
by pretending to be a Harvard student?

645
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,457
Where's your pride?

646
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,126
How could you?
How could you do such a thing?

647
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,464
Are you ashamed?

648
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,090
I'm so sorry.

649
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,010
Se-ri.

650
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,387
What's wrong with you?

651
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,765
Why are you acting like a stranger?

652
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,227
Aren't you my sister?

653
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,146
Aren't you Cha Se-ri?

654
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,900
What are you going to do?

655
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,694
You must have a plan if you came home
expecting to get caught.

656
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,863
If Dad finds out, he'll...

657
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,074
This is insane.

658
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,909
What will you do?

659
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,494
What will you do?

660
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,538
Stay out of this. I'll deal with it.

661
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,044
Where are you going?

662
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,757
Hey!

663
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,843
Cha Se-ri!

664
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,385
-Hello.
-Hello.

665
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,221
My darling daughter is home.

666
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,932
Did you have a long day?

667
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,185
Go on ahead. I'll be right behind you.

668
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,396
Goodbye, Mr. Jo.

669
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,443
I'll get going then.

670
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,736
Mr. Jo.

671
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,071
Could you spare me some time?

672
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,406
Five minutes will do.

673
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:31,992
That day...

674
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,203
The day I saw K,

675
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,583
wasn't there something
you wanted to say to me?

676
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,544
No, there wasn't.

677
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,298
That's odd.
I definitely thought there was.

678
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,636
You looked like you wanted
to say something to me.

679
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,057
-You're mistaken.
-Was it...

680
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,517
something about Hye-na?

681
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,646
Not at all.

682
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,773
I must get going.

683
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,194
If there's anything you want
to say to me, call me any time.

684
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,750
PARADISE OF REST
FUNERAL HALL

685
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,003
Professor Cha.

686
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,630
The traffic was terrible.

687
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,423
Is Hyeok-jae here already?

688
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,092
Yes, he's here.

689
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,427
Director Choi has been waiting too.

690
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,935
Bring him in as soon as he memorizes this.

691
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,853
I'll keep Hyeok-jae with me.

692
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,105
You go upstairs then.

693
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,277
Director Choi.

694
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,447
-Read this.
-Thanks.

695
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,284
Professor Cha said
he'll keep Mr. Kim with him.

696
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,577
Memorize this and go in.

697
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,829
Okay.

698
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:07,129
My eyesight gets worse every year.

699
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,590
Can you read it out loud for me?

700
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,552
How bad is his handwriting?

701
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,017
Come on.

702
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,690
He was born in 1941.

703
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,362
I was born in 1972, so...

704
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,573
-his age is...
-Forget that.

705
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,451
What comes after "history teacher"?

706
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,954
The writing's so small
that I can barely read it.

707
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,710
-His hobbies.
-Yes, his hobbies.

708
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,088
Tem... Tempole?

709
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,048
Tamper, tampering.

710
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,383
Tempering?

711
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,096
You mean "temple." My goodness.

712
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,599
Didn't you say you came first
in the college entrance exam?

713
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,019
We didn't study Chinese characters
back in my day.

714
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,646
It wasn't part of the exam.

715
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,820
He can't read it himself either.

716
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,200
Professor Cha, that scumbag.

717
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,621
MY CONDOLENCES
FROM CONGRESSMAN KIM HYEOK-JAE

718
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,747
Let's go inside.

719
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,004
Oh, my.

720
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,672
Professor Cha.

721
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,717
Gosh. Excuse me for a bit.

722
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,428
We meet here.

723
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,555
-Dr. Kang, why are you here?
-Hello.

724
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,098
I came to offer my respects.

725
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,185
Meet the director of my hospital.

726
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,562
I mentioned him to you a few times.

727
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,772
Professor Cha?

728
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,610
CONGRESS

729
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,868
You must have visited
a lot of temples in your time then.

730
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,245
Of course, I did.

731
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,706
I traveled to all sorts of places
with Mr. Baek.

732
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,626
Dr. Kang, you came with us too.

733
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,586
Where was that?

734
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:15,340
Mr. Baek's favorite temple.

735
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,849
Oh, that place.

736
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:25,851
It was...

737
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,103
It was...

738
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,441
His favorite temple was in Macheon.

739
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,610
It's called Shin...

740
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,326
Shinhyeok Temple.

741
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,704
That was his favorite place.

742
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,544
Yes, that's right. He loved that place.

743
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,129
He especially...

744
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,466
loved Silleuksa in Yeoju.

745
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,346
Oh, that's right. Silleuksa!

746
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,683
We visited that place very often.

747
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,228
Let me pour you a drink, Mr. Kim.

748
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,858
Silleuksa has a lovely view.

749
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,652
It's the only temple by a river.

750
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,411
What is it? Is something the matter?

751
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,622
That scumbag.

752
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,708
I asked for a favor.

753
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,752
And he gets all arrogant.

754
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,713
Why would he do that when we have Korean?

755
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,424
He just loves an opportunity to show off.

756
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,427
What does he know
about fractures or lacerations?

757
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,849
Se-ri said she studied

758
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,727
at the Widener Library
for four days and nights.

759
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,271
Surely that's not a lie too?

760
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:56,858
No way.

761
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,196
I guess Se-ri's
not a Harvard student after all.

762
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,492
It closes at 5 p.m. on Saturdays.

763
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,411
It's not open at all on Sundays.

764
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,538
What did you just say?

765
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:11,998
Se-ri

766
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,750
is not a Harvard student?

767
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,001
Se-ri?

768
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,674
I just saw Se-ri and Seo-jun
arguing on the street.

769
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,344
"How could you fool us like this
by pretending to be a Harvard student?"

770
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,680
Seo-jun sounded really angry.

771
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,015
That quiet boy, Seo-jun, got angry?

772
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,351
That can't be.
Are you sure you didn't mishear him?

773
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,396
Give me that.

774
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:39,859
Se-ri said she studied at the Widener
Library for four days and nights.

775
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,529
I looked it up and the library

776
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,447
isn't open 24 hours.

777
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,659
I guess it was all a lie.

778
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:03,883
Gosh!

779
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,599
Wonderful!

780
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,914
That stupid idiot.

781
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,710
He came first in the national exam
when he can't even read "Silleuksa"?

782
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,963
What a load of crap!

783
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,652
Gosh, you poor man.

784
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,572
Don't use the ax ever again.

785
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,532
He'll come if he wants to.

786
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,169
I see someone over there.

787
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,915
KIM JU-YEONG, MAJORED IN MATH
AT SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

788
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,501
WHY IS KIM JU-YEONG DOING THIS?

789
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,302
U-ju.

790
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,720
Gosh, you read my mind.

791
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,018
Mom, I'll take it easy today.

792
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,605
It looks like I should hang out
with Gi-jun and Seo-jun.

793
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,315
You need to hang out with them?

794
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,983
Did something happen?

795
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,195
They seem to be in a bad mood.

796
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,531
Having a friend by your side
helps you feel better, you know.

797
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,241
Look at you.

798
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,910
How thoughtful.

799
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,204
Go have fun with them

800
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,498
until Seo-jun and Gi-jun get sick of you.

801
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,750
Yes, ma'am.

802
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,544
-See you.
-Bye.

803
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,264
Yes, Dr. Park.

804
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,768
Yeong-jae came?

805
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,664
My dad told me about you.

806
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,544
There's something I must tell you.

807
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,257
She gave you Ga-eul's number?

808
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,133
Coach Kim herself?

809
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:17,804
At first,

810
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,181
I thought it was a gift
for getting into SNU.

811
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,225
But in hindsight,

812
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,103
I think that was the trigger.

813
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,815
I wrote in my diary every day
and told myself I'd get my revenge,

814
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:31,025
but when I got accepted,

815
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,820
I felt like maybe
that wasn't necessary anymore.

816
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,408
Why did that woman...

817
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,077
do such a thing?

818
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,831
Just think about the moment you'll receive

819
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,749
your acceptance letter
from SNU's med school.

820
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,795
You'll throw the acceptance letter at her
and finally end your misery.

821
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,505
Just focus on that moment.

822
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,806
That woman kicked Ga-eul out.

823
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:06,436
You must not forgive anyone
who meddles in your life

824
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,229
and destroys your happiness.

825
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,865
Even if it's your mom.

826
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,083
How could she...

827
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,628
That woman, Kim Ju-yeong,

828
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,089
is really dangerous.

829
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,259
She takes control of the kids' minds
and manipulates them as she wishes.

830
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,102
My father told me
that you wanted to write a book

831
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,605
about my experience.

832
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,902
Please write it.

833
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:58,988
Write my story.

834
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,218
No way.

835
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:21,761
Are you serious?

836
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,971
-For real?
-Yes.

837
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,348
Seriously?

838
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,141
That was all fake?

839
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,018
Hye-na heard everything.

840
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,186
Seo-jun was like,

841
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:33,231
"How could you fool us like this
by pretending to be a Harvard student?"

842
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,983
He went on like that and yelled at Se-ri.

843
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,318
Right?

844
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,112
Are you happy?

845
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,030
I told you not to tell anyone.

846
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,199
My gosh, this is huge news.

847
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:46,828
I heard Professor Cha
went to a funeral with Dr. Kang.

848
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,540
Then Professor Cha
probably doesn't know about it yet.

849
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,378
If he knew, she'd be dead meat by now.

850
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,380
You know how egotistical and proud he is.

851
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,632
Jin Jin, this is serious.

852
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,801
-I should tell him.
-Are you crazy?

853
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,887
Don't make the situation worse.
Don't say anything, okay?

854
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,390
He's the only one who doesn't know.
Do you think this is right?

855
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,727
I should tell him.
As a fellow parent, that is.

856
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:13,187
Gosh, you just don't know
when to keep quiet.

857
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,690
Do you think he'll thank you
if you tell him?

858
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,942
Oh, right.

859
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,322
Anyway,

860
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,700
she always acted so elegant and classy,

861
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,453
and yet she was stabbed in the back
by her own daughter.

862
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,246
I feel bad for that woman.

863
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,625
Is it good?

864
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,170
Eat as much as you want.

865
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,299
She gave him Ga-eul's number?

866
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,552
When she fully knew about everything
his mom went through because of Ga-eul?

867
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,929
She even told him how Ga-eul was doing.

868
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,724
She told him that Ga-eul's mom
passed away from an illness

869
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,184
after she was kicked out empty-handed

870
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,561
and that she was struggling
to make ends meet in Sinan.

871
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,230
She stirred up Yeong-jae's feelings.

872
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,318
Yeong-jae said that he questioned
whether it was necessary

873
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,446
for him to run away from home
after getting accepted to SNU.

874
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,449
But hearing about Ga-eul
having such a hard time...

875
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,368
became the trigger for him.

876
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,623
Do you still think
I'm worrying over nothing?

877
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,073
You looked into Hye-na's background,
didn't you?

878
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,878
You need to tell me the truth now.

879
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,209
I CALLED YOU BECAUSE
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU

880
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,669
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER

881
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,095
So she knew about this...

882
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,265
and still strongly suggested...

883
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,809
that I let Hye-na move into my place?

884
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,065
Ms. Kim is waiting for you.

885
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,653
She asked me to bring you to her.

886
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,300
From now on,
I want you to leave my daughter alone.

887
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,344
I exist for you.

888
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:16,430
What does her past have to do
with me going to university?

889
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,266
Se-ri never got into Harvard.

890
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,811
I gave up all my dreams for them.

891
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,771
My life feels like an empty shell.

892
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,856
This is the only method I can think of.

893
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,149
That's why I'm asking you a favor.

894
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,111
I need to separate Ye-seo
from that woman, no matter what.

895
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,320
You'll be punished by the gods.

896
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,864
I'll put an end to your evil deeds,
so just wait and see.

897
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,157
Have you been to Seonjae Island?

898
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,159
You should've just said,
"Dad, I'm your daughter."

899
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,245
I guess you don't want to
walk out of here in one piece.

900
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,663
If you want to kill me,

901
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,249
go ahead and try.

902
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,628
