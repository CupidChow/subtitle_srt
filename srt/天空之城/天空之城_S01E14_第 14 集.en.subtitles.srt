1
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,800
You need to tell me the truth now.

2
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,785
I CALLED YOU BECAUSE
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU

3
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,078
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER

4
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,290
So she knew about this

5
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,293
and still strongly suggested

6
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,962
that I let Hye-na move into my place?

7
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,925
Ms. Kim is waiting for you.

8
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,428
She asked me to bring you to her.

9
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,684
I heard you asked Mr. Jo about Hye-na.

10
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,272
I told him to show it to you
as I figured it'd be better to be honest,

11
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,232
since you suspect me anyway.

12
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,360
I was torn after I looked into Hye-na,

13
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,445
and that's why I decided to advise you

14
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,115
to keep the ticking bomb close by

15
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,117
while you get rid of the detonator.

16
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,413
I thought your love and care

17
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,250
might be able to tame Hye-na's resentment.

18
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,586
That's what I was hoping for.

19
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,257
It must have been unpleasant for you
to find out that I knew about it, but--

20
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,633
"Unpleasant"?

21
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,678
However,

22
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,139
I was only thinking about Ye-seo

23
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,808
getting accepted to SNU.

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,228
Do you think it will be safer
if Hye-na lives elsewhere?

25
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,398
Then Ye-seo would have found out first.

26
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,651
So what?

27
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,447
You made the suggestion so that
Ye-seo wouldn't find out first?

28
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,824
You expected me to embrace her with love?

29
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,912
I'll rip your jaw open.

30
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,583
You're fired.

31
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,336
From now on,
I want you to leave my daughter alone.

32
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,422
Don't confuse me with Lee Myeong-ju.

33
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,675
She let you take advantage of her,
but I won't.

34
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,388
How dare you

35
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,308
give Yeong-jae
Ga-eul's contact information?

36
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,361
Were you deliberately trying
to destroy that family or what?

37
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,529
You're responsible for Myeong-ju's death

38
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,406
and for Yeong-jae ending up like that!

39
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,133
That's not true at all.

40
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,513
Ms. Lee Myeong-ju's greed
was what killed her.

41
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,190
She couldn't tolerate her son

42
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,945
being with a lowly girl like Ga-eul
when he got accepted to SNU.

43
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,572
-Her arrogance--
-Shut it.

44
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,450
He said he'd give up school
and cut all ties with his parents.

45
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,244
What parent wouldn't be devastated?

46
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,913
You call that arrogance?

47
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,045
She just had to pay his tuition fees
and request a leave of absence.

48
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,632
She should've waited for him,
no matter how long it took.

49
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,676
No.

50
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,137
They should've given up their greed

51
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,974
and prepared themselves to accept
whatever Yeong-jae wanted to choose.

52
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,937
Isn't that what parents
are supposed to do?

53
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,070
"What parents are supposed to do?"

54
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,702
Did you say coaching outstanding students

55
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,997
helped you heal your wounds?

56
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,501
And in order to make me believe you,

57
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,463
you even used that poor daughter of yours.

58
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,132
And you call yourself a parent?

59
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,766
This is why you suffered such misfortune.

60
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,810
It's because you're no good yourself.

61
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,180
Please prepare a lot of
speech and writing questions for Korean.

62
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,766
And for English, please prepare
more reading questions than...

63
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,325
From now on, Ye-seo must become
the top student no matter what.

64
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,995
Make sure she gets a perfect score
on every single subject.

65
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,623
I will not tolerate a single mistake.

66
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,128
Do whatever you can
to make her get perfect scores.

67
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,548
She needs to be the top student.

68
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,676
Do you understand?

69
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,303
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

70
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,817
She was suspected
of murdering her husband?

71
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,821
What's all this, Mom?

72
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,865
I'm so sorry.

73
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,121
Gosh, I should've looked into her
more thoroughly.

74
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,918
I only found out about this recently too.

75
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,212
Is it true?

76
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,964
Did she really kill her husband?

77
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,927
She got released due to lack of evidence,

78
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,387
but among all the Koreans
living in Fairfax back then,

79
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,933
there were rumors saying it's highly
likely that she killed her husband.

80
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,684
The rumors wouldn't have spread
for no reason.

81
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,604
Ye-seo.

82
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,356
Let us

83
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,025
end things with Coach Kim.

84
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,653
How can we trust someone like her?

85
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,197
I really can't put you in her hands.

86
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,910
So what's your plan?

87
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,995
Didn't you always tell me
that we need to be cool-headed

88
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,580
in situations like this?

89
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,583
Yes. I came to a decision
after thinking about it rationally.

90
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,965
I personally think that you can get into
SNU's med school without Coach Kim.

91
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,093
I'll try to find a teacher

92
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,179
who is good-natured and very competent--

93
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,181
You already tried once, but you failed.

94
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,685
That's because it was
right before midterms.

95
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,270
But you're on your break now.

96
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,106
You're saying I can trust you, right?

97
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,899
Yes, of course. You can trust me.

98
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,943
Don't worry.

99
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,919
HOW WE TURN INTO MONSTERS

100
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,673
Hey, Su-im!

101
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,174
Su-im!

102
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,928
-Did you hear the news?
-What news?

103
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,555
I guess you haven't heard yet.

104
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,515
Something shocking happened.

105
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,350
You see, Se-ri...

106
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,979
Come closer.

107
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,982
She lied about
getting accepted to Harvard.

108
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,151
And Seung-hye's lying sick
in bed right now because of that.

109
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,408
What? Where are you going?

110
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,703
She must be really upset right now,
so I'm going to go see her.

111
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,371
You're going to go to her house?

112
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,874
Seung-hye won't let you in
considering how she is.

113
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,125
Exactly.

114
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,794
Knowing her personality,
she won't even be able to go outside.

115
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,379
So we should at least visit her instead.

116
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,214
We can't just sit back and watch.

117
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,759
Then I'll go with...

118
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,761
Wait. Hey, wait.

119
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,098
Wait for me.

120
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,503
I called Seo-jun and asked him
to open the door.

121
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,755
Don't worry about your mom
and go upstairs.

122
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,382
Thanks for the coffee.

123
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,592
Bye.

124
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,434
Have you been eating properly?

125
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,146
You need to eat.

126
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,273
"A loaf of bread is better
than the song of many birds."

127
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,609
No.

128
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,778
"Before climbing a mountain..."

129
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,905
That's not the right one either.

130
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,324
"You need to get on the tiger's back..."

131
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,953
Anyway, I'm trying to tell you
that you need to eat to gain strength,

132
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,872
and you need your strength
to deal with this situation.

133
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,005
I really don't get it.

134
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,259
Even though I graduated
with a doctor's degree,

135
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,095
I thought it was more important
to focus on raising my kids.

136
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,057
So I gave up all my dreams for them.

137
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,020
My life feels like an empty shell.

138
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,566
It just feels so futile.

139
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,497
It's all my fault.

140
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,209
I shouldn't have sent her
to the States in the first place.

141
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,379
I was so busy raising the twins.

142
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,382
So when my sister offered
to take care of Se-ri in the States,

143
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,969
I felt somewhat relieved.

144
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,016
I sent my 13-year-old daughter abroad,

145
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,187
and I was happy
that she was getting good grades.

146
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,774
I'm the one to blame.

147
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,281
How is that your fault?

148
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,451
I'm struggling with raising just one son.

149
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:11,123
Plus, didn't you say that Se-ri was
the one who wanted to study in the States?

150
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,543
Since my husband is so obsessed
with our kids' studies,

151
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,755
I really did my best to make sure

152
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,133
that the kids didn't step out of line.

153
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,512
But how could she lie
about something like that?

154
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,935
How could my own daughter
commit such a fraud?

155
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,647
I'd rather...

156
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,109
just die and disappear.

157
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,625
Gosh, Seung-hye. My goodness.

158
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,212
It's so hard to raise children.

159
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,302
Let's drink.

160
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,852
You still have great dreams
even though you're over 60.

161
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,437
I respect you so much, sir.

162
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,607
What a grand compliment.

163
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,945
Age doesn't matter when it comes
to achieving one's dreams.

164
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,783
Of course. Just like there's no set age
in achieving one's dreams,

165
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,161
there's also no age limit
stopping you from doing so.

166
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,501
This is why I always say this to my kids.

167
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,336
"If you want to become an eagle,

168
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,549
you must fly with the eagles."

169
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,219
That's a great saying.

170
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,180
And after repeatedly teaching them that,

171
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,434
my daughter says she's best friends
with Barack Obama's daughter.

172
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,312
What? With Barack Obama's daughter?

173
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,731
My daughter goes to Harvard.

174
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,193
Apparently, she does volunteer work
with Malia Obama.

175
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,157
You've succeeded
in raising a great daughter.

176
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,577
People do say that if you raise
your kids well,

177
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,038
you've really succeeded in life.

178
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,001
Nowadays, I really feel
that those words are true.

179
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,298
How about a drink to celebrate?

180
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,883
He never agreed once.

181
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,511
That narrow-minded fool.

182
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,472
I'll pour you a drink.

183
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,390
Sure.

184
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,353
Friends with Obama's daughter?

185
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,992
Excuse me, Ms. Kim?

186
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,833
Min-joon's mother asked
about getting ready for the MMIs.

187
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,711
Tell her we'll start next week.

188
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,547
Get Ye-seo ready, too.

189
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,344
Ye-seo's mother sent
an account number for a refund--

190
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,054
Get Ye-seo ready, too.

191
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,059
Ms. Kim.

192
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,354
Ye-seo didn't even come to class today.

193
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,195
Do you think I didn't anticipate

194
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,739
what her mother will do?

195
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,493
Would I have told you to show her
the texts without a plan?

196
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,851
This is so good.

197
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,395
It tastes even more delicious
because I'm eating it with you.

198
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,772
-Shall we come here often?
-Yes.

199
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,067
Use me all you want until
you get into SNU's med school.

200
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,654
You can complain about
your stuck-up parents.

201
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,781
Is there a boy you like?

202
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,036
You can tell me about him, too.

203
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,665
I exist for you.

204
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,292
For you, Ye-seo.

205
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,316
Where are you going so early?

206
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,360
Don't look for tutors.
It's a waste of time.

207
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,321
Where are you going?

208
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,324
I asked Mr. Jo to pick me up.

209
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,410
Are you crazy? I said no.

210
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,829
Isn't getting released
due to lack of evidence good enough?

211
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,168
Why can't she coach me?

212
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,046
It's not like she killed
or deceived anyone.

213
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,382
Mr. Jo, don't come.

214
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,967
Ye-seo won't be going.

215
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,596
Do you have the right to
condemn Coach Kim?

216
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,351
-What?
-You lied about who you are until now.

217
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,395
You deceived your kids.
Do you have the right to condemn her?

218
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,106
I'm not talking about rights.

219
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,317
How can I let her turn you into Yeong-jae?

220
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,402
You're talking about him again.

221
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,072
This is about me and my life!

222
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,246
Whether I go to university or not
isn't your business anymore.

223
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,958
Ye-seo.

224
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,087
Ye-seo.

225
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,090
Trust me, just this once.

226
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,885
I'm right this time,
even if other people say otherwise.

227
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,971
Why are you doing this?

228
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,390
The old you would've said it's no big deal

229
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,433
because she was let off.

230
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,812
What does her past have to do
with me going to university?

231
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,314
I wouldn't be like this without a reason.

232
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,485
I just can't tell you everything,

233
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,947
but Coach Kim's really dangerous.

234
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,199
What's wrong with you?

235
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,578
I don't care about her past.

236
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,122
I just want to get into med school

237
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,082
and have a successful life.

238
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,293
That's the only reason I need her.

239
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,170
Ye-seo.

240
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,883
I want you to be successful.
I want it more than anyone else.

241
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,385
I have a good reason for this.

242
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,469
Please.

243
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,891
The one

244
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,394
who wishes the most
for my success isn't you.

245
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,398
It's me.

246
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,067
Stay out of this.

247
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,487
I'm just going to get angrier
if you keep trying to ruin stuff.

248
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,713
Do you call this a meal?

249
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,506
Mom's sick.

250
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,009
So we prepared dinner.

251
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,346
-Are you sick?
-Honey.

252
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,765
-Actually--
-Mom.

253
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,601
You haven't eaten in days.

254
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,228
You should eat.

255
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,746
When will Se-ri be back?

256
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,499
She hasn't called
since she left for her trip.

257
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,917
She won't even pick up her phone.

258
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,628
She's probably busy
hanging out with her friends.

259
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,214
She hasn't been to Jeju Island in a while.

260
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,387
Tell her to come back
before the New Year ceremony.

261
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,764
It'd be nice for her to meet the chairman
while she's here.

262
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,683
Oh, right.

263
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:20,028
Why don't you two attend the ceremony
wearing Harvard jackets with your sister?

264
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,741
When Ye-seo got into
Shin A High School as the top student,

265
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,326
she wore her uniform.

266
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,953
Why can't we do that?

267
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,913
We're a Harvard family.

268
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,424
It's from Se-ri.

269
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,437
Dad.

270
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,606
I just couldn't say this to your face.

271
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,109
I never got into Harvard.

272
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,112
I've been lying to you.

273
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,614
Ever since high school,

274
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,492
I just couldn't keep up
with the American kids.

275
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,954
I couldn't handle
the mountain of homework,

276
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,957
so I once copied something
off the internet.

277
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,960
I didn't think that would become
a problem later on.

278
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,088
If you do something like that even once,

279
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,549
you can't get accepted
to any Ivy League schools.

280
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,386
I lied because I was scared
of disappointing you.

281
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,931
I'm sorry.

282
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,780
Se-ri...

283
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,704
never got into Harvard.

284
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,438
When will you be back, Se-ri?

285
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,149
A few days on Jeju Island is enough.

286
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,567
Come home today.

287
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,903
Let's talk face-to-face.

288
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,657
Okay.

289
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,456
Honey.

290
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,836
Did you know?

291
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,714
I was

292
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,633
going to tell you today.

293
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,212
Seon-hye, it's me.

294
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,172
About Se-ri...

295
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,175
What happened?

296
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,512
Sixty-two thousand dollars?

297
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,058
Any other legal issues?

298
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,852
That's a relief.

299
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,190
Please send me the bill from Harvard.

300
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,400
I'll send them the full amount today.

301
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,528
Okay, thank you.

302
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,287
Yes, I'm dead serious.

303
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,791
Don't you guys know that Malia Obama
got into my school last year?

304
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,001
She and I volunteer together
for the homeless.

305
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,799
My daughter goes to Harvard.

306
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:55,095
Apparently, she does volunteer work
with Malia Obama.

307
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,767
Wait, did Dr. Kang know about it?

308
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,688
Honey.

309
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,773
Honey!

310
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,320
Do other residents in the Castle
know about Se-ri?

311
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,656
U-ju's mom

312
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,867
and Su-han's mom know, so...

313
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,499
So everyone knows?

314
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,720
Se-ri.

315
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,352
Se-ri, I thought you were on Jeju Island.

316
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,062
Are you crazy?
You should've come home later.

317
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,106
You just texted Dad.
What are you going to do?

318
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,233
I figured it'd be better
to just get it over with.

319
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,443
Where's Dad?

320
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,495
I'm sorry, Dad.

321
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,455
Obama?

322
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,249
You did what with Obama's daughter?

323
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,751
Honey.

324
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,795
Let's sit down and talk first.

325
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,339
Have a seat, okay?

326
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,469
Se-ri, come in and have a seat.

327
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,803
Stop right there.

328
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,022
-Honey, please...
-Not a word.

329
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,406
You stay out of this.

330
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,205
All of you, stay out of this.

331
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,804
How dare you fool me?

332
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,681
You utterly humiliated your father...

333
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,777
What on earth were you thinking?

334
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,741
I didn't intend on lying to you
from the start.

335
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,785
I just didn't want to disappoint you.

336
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,995
-I wanted to make you happy.
-"Happy"?

337
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,669
Are you kidding me?

338
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,629
"Happy"?

339
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,552
What would you have done
if I had told you the truth?

340
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,680
You always told me that I must
get to the top of the pyramid--

341
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,432
Even so, how could you lie to me?

342
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,810
You pretended to be
a Harvard student for 12 months.

343
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,438
That's a crime.

344
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,482
They could press charges for fraud
and obstruction of business!

345
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,817
Yes, I know it's a crime!

346
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,864
Do you know how hard I've tried

347
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,951
to live the kind of life
that you wanted me to live?

348
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,460
I was so scared of being caught.
Do you know how pathetic I felt?

349
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,838
But I put up with it all

350
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,425
because it was making you happy
even though I was miserable.

351
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,971
You complete and utter fool!

352
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,765
How could you say such a thing?

353
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,311
What parent would be happy
about their children lying to them?

354
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,397
You weren't satisfied
with just the person I was.

355
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,901
It's not like I wanted to lie to you.

356
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,320
Do you think I wanted to fool you?

357
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,991
Your voice changed instantly
whenever I told you I got a B.

358
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,995
You made me think I had to get good
grades to be considered your child!

359
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,017
Now that I've been found out,
I actually feel relieved.

360
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,812
I wonder why I lived like such an idiot.

361
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,774
I no longer want to try being
the daughter you want me to be.

362
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,156
What did you say?

363
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,538
I don't want to live my life
according to your plan.

364
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,082
The top of the pyramid?

365
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,627
Who are you to demand we get there
when you couldn't even do it?

366
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,559
I worked hard to earn money
to send you to the US, and what?

367
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,605
I only expected you to study.
You couldn't even do that and lied to me.

368
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,030
I can't believe an idiot like you
is my daughter.

369
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,908
Does financially supporting your child
make you a parent?

370
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,161
How can you call yourself a parent
when you raised me just to brag about me?

371
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,836
How can you talk like that?

372
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,510
-Dad!
-Dad, stop!

373
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,053
-Dad.
-Let go.

374
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,847
-Let go of me.
-Dad, please.

375
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,473
-I said, let go!
-Dad!

376
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,979
-Darn it!
-Enough!

377
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,702
Don't you dare
lay a finger on my daughter.

378
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,797
Se-ri.

379
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,716
Let's go.

380
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,426
Let's get out of here.

381
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,597
What?

382
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,476
-Don't you dare. Stop right there!
-Dad, please.

383
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,478
-I said, stop!
-Wait, Dad.

384
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,855
-Stop right there!
-Dad, just a moment.

385
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,608
Stop! Stop right there!

386
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,029
-Dad!
-How could you!

387
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,197
Dad!

388
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,537
We have a problem, Dr. Kang.
In Daehan Daily, Dr. Hwang...

389
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:41,042
"A university hospital is a place
for treatment, research, and education.

390
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,921
Despite that, some doctors
prioritize their track record

391
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,548
over research and education.

392
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,138
A doctor who has performed
fraudulent medical activities

393
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,099
is trying to obtain
a crucial position within..."

394
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,267
He's referring to me, isn't he?

395
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,687
He's trying to stop me from becoming
the planning manager.

396
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,522
He's thinking of dragging you
down with him.

397
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,858
He's jeopardizing his own career
as well as yours.

398
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,778
This jerk is totally
picking a fight with me.

399
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,073
The loser from Moojin Medical School...

400
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:16,744
How dare he try to pick a fight with me?

401
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,287
Dr. Kang.

402
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,541
By the way,
what if the thousand-year-old tortoise

403
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,626
uses that as an excuse to change his mind?

404
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,421
Change his mind?

405
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,839
Think about it.

406
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,551
Do you think Dr. Hwang could have
done that without a backup plan?

407
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,054
A backup plan?

408
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,184
"Crude medical commercialism"?

409
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,769
That's not fair at all.

410
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,855
As long as I'm the president
of this hospital,

411
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,524
that will never happen.

412
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,610
Dr. Hwang must have based his column

413
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,155
on some thoughtless doctors
in the industry.

414
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:56,909
Mr. Congressman, I sincerely
thank you for your concern.

415
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,245
I beg your pardon?

416
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,082
Yes.

417
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,543
Okay, then. Goodbye.

418
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,006
What an ungrateful punk.

419
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,341
Who does he think he is
to write something like this?

420
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,302
Do you know how much I spend every year

421
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,012
to promote our hospital?

422
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,391
What are you going to do now?

423
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,684
What can I do?

424
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,062
If I fire him just because
I don't like what he wrote,

425
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,314
it'll only end up backfiring on me.

426
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,735
I'll also have to delay
the personnel appointment for now.

427
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:32,862
For now?

428
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,537
Tell Dr. Hwang to come to my office.

429
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,711
-What?
-Exactly...

430
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,131
-how long are you thinking about?
-Just wait a couple more months.

431
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,258
You'll get appointed when the time comes.

432
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,761
This could cause huge trouble
for me too, you know.

433
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,222
You're so tactless.

434
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,328
-Hello.
-Hello.

435
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,392
What's the matter with you?

436
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,395
This is a public place, you know.

437
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,647
You really should know your place.

438
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,606
What?

439
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:54,110
"Fraudulent medical activities"?

440
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,488
I only fulfilled my obligation
as a doctor.

441
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,783
I also have an obligation
to step up and restrain

442
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,410
inappropriate medical practices.

443
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,083
Did you not take the Hippocratic Oath?

444
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,961
"My colleagues will be my brothers."
Don't you know that part?

445
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,797
"My colleagues will be my brothers"?

446
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,301
If you were my brother,
you'd already be dead.

447
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,262
What did you say?

448
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,348
You little...

449
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,851
-Hello...
-Hello...

450
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,898
Get in.

451
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,441
Yes,

452
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,610
get in.

453
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,112
Hello.

454
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,617
Have you eaten?

455
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,993
-Yes.
-Yes.

456
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,662
This is the only method I can think of.

457
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,414
I want to fire Coach Kim,

458
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,293
but Ye-seo trusts her way too much

459
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,422
even though I showed her
the Fairfax article.

460
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,508
The Fairfax article?

461
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,385
To be honest,

462
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,762
Kim Ju-yeong...

463
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,229
I didn't know about that.

464
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,816
But even so,

465
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,986
that gives her no right
to ruin her students.

466
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,153
It's not just her students.

467
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,948
She even ruins their entire family.

468
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,659
That's why I'm asking you a favor.

469
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,121
I need to separate Ye-seo
from that woman, no matter what.

470
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,458
Okay.

471
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,003
I'll try talking to U-ju.

472
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,339
Thanks.

473
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,721
I can't...

474
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,348
I can't believe you just thanked me.

475
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,695
Come in.

476
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,329
I'm here to recharge you.

477
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,207
How did you know I was out of batteries?

478
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,293
You're such a joker.

479
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,673
-Drink up, my prince.
-Okay.

480
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,679
Here.

481
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,561
Have you given it some thought?

482
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,773
About taking private lessons with Ye-seo.

483
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,111
Studying by myself
can get difficult at times,

484
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,197
so it was quite a tempting offer.

485
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,493
But I don't feel comfortable
taking lessons with just Ye-seo.

486
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,662
But I wouldn't mind it if Hye-na joins us.

487
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,124
Hye-na?

488
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,758
Mom.

489
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,178
Can I go to Seonjae Island
with Hye-na this weekend?

490
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,640
-What? Go where?
-Seonjae Island?

491
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,143
Yes. Apparently, Hye-na's mom
used to love that place.

492
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,770
Can I go?

493
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,230
Mr. Kang,

494
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,357
have you been to Seonjae Island?

495
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,610
No,

496
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,736
I haven't.

497
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,951
We could go fishing in Seonjae Island
and catch baby blowfish--

498
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,578
Let's be quiet when we're eating, okay?

499
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,463
Can I go, Mom?

500
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,424
No.

501
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,342
You can't go there by yourselves.

502
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,261
Why can't we go, Mom?

503
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,304
We can catch baby blowfish and--

504
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,931
I said, let's be quiet.

505
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,145
Gosh.

506
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,122
Mom, you're so stupid.

507
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,042
He doesn't even remember
that it's your birthday today,

508
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,380
and he doesn't even remember
the memories you have together.

509
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,757
Why did you bother...

510
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,095
Why did you bother missing
someone like him all your life?

511
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,235
How dare you use Ye-bin
to talk about your mom?

512
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,821
You should've just said,
"Dad, I'm your daughter."

513
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,075
My husband already has two daughters.

514
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,580
Ye-seo, who's extremely smart,
and Ye-bin, whom he loves dearly.

515
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,792
If I tell him who you really are

516
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,253
and decide to leave
with Ye-seo and Ye-bin,

517
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,547
who do you think he'll choose?

518
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,342
Do you think he'll welcome you

519
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,886
and decide to live with you instead?

520
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,096
He didn't even know you existed.

521
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,269
I'm putting up with this because
I don't want you to ruin my family.

522
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,104
And you dared to provoke me?

523
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,817
If you provoke me one more time,

524
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,277
I will...

525
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,953
Do you think...

526
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,706
I made a deal with you because I was
scared of a little rat like you?

527
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,041
I'm sorry.

528
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,751
U-ju said

529
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,296
he'll only do it if Hye-na joins them.

530
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,839
He wants Hye-na to join?

531
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,596
No, I'll try to convince Ye-seo.

532
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,431
Okay, bye.

533
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,142
Ye-seo.

534
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,145
You don't even have class today.
Where are you going?

535
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,771
To the library.

536
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,773
Can we talk?

537
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,737
It'll only take ten minutes.

538
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,239
You can get a massage while we talk.

539
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,075
It'll help with your concentration
and memory, and it'll also

540
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,577
relieve your fatigue. How nice is that?

541
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,163
-Just ten minutes, okay?
-Okay.

542
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,209
SEARCHING BODY TYPE

543
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,550
Ye-seo.

544
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,180
I know you really trust Coach Kim, but--

545
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,890
If you're going to talk about her,
I'm leaving.

546
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,475
No,

547
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,477
it's not that.

548
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,356
How about studying with U-ju?

549
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,526
He gets good grades
and has a nice personality.

550
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,862
He's a really decent kid, right?

551
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,364
I think

552
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,824
you will benefit a lot
if you two study together.

553
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,409
The rivalry will be helpful.

554
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,953
What do you think?

555
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,874
Maybe.

556
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,088
Will it be just me and U-ju then?

557
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,761
You can start in a group of three
and then it can just be the two of you.

558
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,013
It will be awkward if it's just
the two of you from the start.

559
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,640
Three?

560
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,100
Who's the other one?

561
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,771
Who else would it be?

562
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,190
You're the top three students
in your year.

563
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,192
Kim Hye-na? No.

564
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:27,850
What is it?

565
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,810
Is something wrong?

566
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,687
Why do you like me?

567
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,939
I'm a nobody.

568
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,529
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

569
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,699
I know you like me.

570
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,707
How did you know?

571
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,419
How could I not when it's so obvious?

572
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,547
How...

573
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,799
do you feel about me?

574
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,187
Am I

575
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,105
just a friend...

576
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,757
Oh, I heard you and U-ju
are going to study together.

577
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,676
Too bad, though.

578
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,179
U-ju doesn't want to do it
if it will be just you two.

579
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,640
He said he'll do it if I join the group.

580
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,767
What do you say?

581
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,644
Who are you to join us?

582
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,729
Who do you think you are?

583
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,482
Why can't I join?

584
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,943
U-ju and I are Sky Castle residents.

585
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,696
You and I are from different places.

586
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,030
We have different genes.

587
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,073
Genes?

588
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,161
Your mom's Kwak Mi-hyang.

589
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,080
I heard about it, too.

590
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,541
That her parents sold stuff
like pig hearts.

591
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,459
Who are you to talk about genes?

592
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,836
How dare you?

593
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,630
Do you think I don't know?

594
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,759
You're the daughter of a single mom
and you don't even know who your dad is.

595
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,765
A single mom?

596
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,393
Watch your tongue.

597
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,729
I have a dad, too.

598
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,482
Hey. Are you out of your mind?

599
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,736
Who do you think you are
to slap me in the face?

600
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,364
Your dad is my dad.

601
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,076
The Kang Jun-sang who gave you
those great genes is my dad, too!

602
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:39,499
Mom. She's lost her mind. She's a psycho.

603
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,084
She says Dad's her dad.

604
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,473
I had no choice.

605
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,809
She's just so rude.

606
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,520
She made me hit the roof.

607
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,273
Do what you can

608
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,609
to clean up the mess.

609
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,403
It's spilled milk.

610
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,955
Mom.

611
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,500
What was all that?

612
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,253
What is she talking about?

613
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,965
Calm down. I'll explain.

614
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,219
Explain? What's there to explain?

615
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,930
How can that bitch be Dad's daughter?

616
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,266
Do you want Ye-bin to find out, too?

617
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,233
Se-ri.

618
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,986
Mom. You look so pretty!

619
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,947
You look better than me.

620
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,573
Why do you look so embarrassed?

621
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,660
Keep your chin up and your hair back.

622
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,869
That's nice and pretty.

623
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,288
Now pull this down and open this up.

624
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,499
Se-ri, you shouldn't do that.

625
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,793
Why not? Come on.

626
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:08,004
Mom, you look amazingly sexy.

627
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,589
Just a moment.

628
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,261
Ta-da.

629
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,854
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

630
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,815
Let's go, Mom.

631
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,576
Se-ri, have a fishcake.

632
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,828
You missed this.

633
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,122
Mom.

634
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,168
Don't worry about anything
and just have fun with me today.

635
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:50,172
We've never hung out together
even though we're mother and daughter.

636
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,135
When will you go home?

637
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,306
When your dad's anger subsides.

638
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,893
I don't think it will. Ever.

639
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,688
It will. You're his daughter.

640
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:11,818
He might be upset now,
but he'll slowly realize that we are...

641
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,655
more responsible for this than you are.

642
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,242
Mom,

643
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,827
I'm sorry.

644
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,000
Your fishcake must have gotten cold.

645
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,837
Fishcakes taste best when they're hot.

646
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,172
Here.

647
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,323
My own daughter

648
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,868
stabbed me in the back.

649
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,671
No way.

650
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,299
You're telling me to believe that?

651
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,260
That Kim Hye-na is Dad's daughter?

652
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,346
The most annoying girl in the world
who I absolutely loathe?

653
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,433
That we share the same blood?

654
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,982
I only found out about it recently too.

655
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,152
Your dad doesn't even know
that he has another daughter.

656
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,404
He had her by mistake with a woman

657
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,948
he dated for a short while
when he was young.

658
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,743
"Mistake"? How could he make
such a stupid mistake?

659
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,953
How could that horrid girl and I
be blood-related?

660
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,831
How could we have the same dad?

661
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,749
Ye-seo,

662
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,460
has your dad ever failed
to fulfill his duty as your father?

663
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,172
I'm the one who should be angry, not you.

664
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,007
That obnoxious girl
is right before my eyes.

665
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,759
How can I not be angry?

666
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,931
I thought there was nothing wrong with
Dad. Who knew our family was such a mess?

667
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,437
Nothing will change, Ye-seo.

668
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,357
You...

669
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,859
and Ye-bin are his only daughters.

670
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,987
I'll take care of this.

671
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,323
I'll sort it all out,
so don't worry about anything.

672
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,368
As if.

673
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,995
You've been walking
on eggshells around her.

674
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,123
You've been letting her walk around
as if she owns this house.

675
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,209
How will you sort it out?

676
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,088
I don't need anything.

677
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,758
I don't need you or Dad.

678
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,391
Ye-seo!

679
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,020
Ye-seo.

680
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,358
Ye-seo.

681
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,444
Ye-seo.

682
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,114
Let go.

683
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,241
I hate you. I hate all of you!

684
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,912
-Taxi!
-Ye-seo. Wait!

685
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,999
Wait. Ye-seo.

686
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,216
Record the entire interview practice

687
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:06,845
so that Min-joon can monitor himself
and learn from it.

688
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,054
Yes, ma'am.

689
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,448
Coach Kim.

690
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,952
What's wrong, Ye-seo?

691
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,497
Kim Hye-na...

692
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,168
Hye-na is...

693
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,401
It's okay, Ye-seo.

694
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,237
It's all right.

695
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,021
MY PRINCESS

696
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,606
MR. JO

697
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,611
YE-SEO IS WITH MS. KIM RIGHT NOW

698
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,647
You broke your promise.

699
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,899
Did you expect me to do nothing
when she insulted my mom?

700
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,776
You used that as an excuse
to say it because you

701
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:27,777
have nothing to lose.

702
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,156
You're well aware.
I really have nothing to lose.

703
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,408
Shall I post it on my social media?

704
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,202
What?

705
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,745
Ms. Han,

706
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,539
isn't that your biggest fear?

707
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,084
I bet you're scared of word spreading
around Sky Castle.

708
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,548
You.

709
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,425
Do you think I'm a joke?

710
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,469
You'll post it on your social media?

711
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,388
Sure. You're going down with me, then.

712
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,850
My family will just have to deal
with the humiliation,

713
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,894
but once people find out that you got paid

714
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,395
to do Do-hoon's assignments for him,

715
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:03,605
you'll be expelled.

716
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,983
If the parents get together and protest,

717
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,818
you may get arrested
for obstruction of business.

718
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,613
You won't even be able
to live a decent life,

719
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,199
let alone go to university.

720
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,910
Shall we see

721
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,204
if you're right?

722
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,545
I guess you don't want to
walk out of here in one piece.

723
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,507
If you want to kill me,

724
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,218
go ahead and try.

725
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,639
All right.

726
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,413
Honey,

727
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,457
are you still on bad terms
with Ye-seo's mom?

728
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,294
We'll probably be on bad terms
for the rest of our lives.

729
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:11,297
She grabbed my beautiful hair

730
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,093
and poured syrup on my flawless skin
but still hasn't apologized.

731
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,636
Isn't she utterly shameless?

732
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,889
Is that why you've been hanging out
with U-ju's mom?

733
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:24,018
We should side with Kang Jun-sang,
not Hwang Chi-yeong.

734
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,770
Ye-seo's mom is your ally.

735
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,522
Whatever. Ally or enemy,

736
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,731
I can't stand her.

737
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,441
I just don't like Kwak Mi-hyang.

738
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,485
Do you even know what Dr. Hwang did?

739
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,822
He wrote a column about
how our hospital only thinks about profit.

740
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,866
He's caused an uproar at the hospital.
He basically dropped a bomb on us.

741
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:39,867
Gosh,

742
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,744
-are you serious?
-Yes.

743
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,164
I am grateful that he saved Su-han,
but he's out of line.

744
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,792
Why does he even work there
if he's going to show off like that?

745
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,586
He should just move to Africa

746
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,754
or go volunteer in small towns
where there are no hospitals.

747
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,840
Africa?

748
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,843
Such a decent man
shouldn't leave Sky Castle.

749
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,762
He's heightened the class
of this place even further.

750
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,643
He's kind and handsome.
He even has a nice voice.

751
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,145
On top of that...

752
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,857
Jin Jin,

753
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,067
by any chance...

754
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,820
What?

755
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,072
Why are you talking nonsense
first thing in the morning?

756
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:27,957
You were pretty to begin with,
but you look even better these days.

757
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,045
You have a good eye.

758
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,381
You'll be late. Hurry.

759
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:48,144
Ye-seo, if you don't want breakfast,
at least drink this before you go.

760
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,605
I said I don't want anything!

761
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,194
You brat.

762
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,279
What did you just do?

763
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,323
How annoying.

764
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,158
You all disgust me.

765
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,327
What did you just say?

766
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,496
You rude brat, how dare you.

767
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,165
Honey, she's sensitive
because the new semester just began.

768
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,375
Try to understand.

769
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,002
She thinks she can be disrespectful
because we humor her!

770
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,837
I never asked you to.

771
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:18,841
That little...

772
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,635
She thinks she's the queen of this place.

773
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,137
What have you been teaching her?

774
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,559
That rude girl.

775
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,738
U-JU'S MOM

776
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,740
I was just worried.

777
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,993
Does Kim Ju-yeong still coach Ye-seo?

778
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,332
I really don't know what to do.

779
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,169
I feel like I'm falling deeper and deeper.

780
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,843
Kim Ju-yeong

781
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,886
doesn't even answer my calls now.

782
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,143
But Ye-seo...

783
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,855
Ye-seo has been staying strong.

784
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,403
I think it's because of that woman,
so I can't even do anything.

785
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,865
What do you mean?

786
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,242
What?

787
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,288
No, it's nothing.

788
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,966
Does Ye-seo rely more on Kim Ju-yeong

789
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,218
than she does on you?

790
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,063
Can you tell me

791
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,566
where I can find her?

792
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,187
I know you're not glad to see me.

793
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,148
But we have something
to talk about, don't we?

794
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,530
I wondered why you had to lie

795
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,990
by bringing up Yeon-du.

796
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,369
It obviously means you didn't want
Yeong-jae's story to be published.

797
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,162
And that's because you know

798
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,834
that you're also partly responsible
for what happened to Yeong-jae.

799
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:00,878
Responsible?

800
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,258
I just didn't want people to condemn me.

801
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,096
They hired me so that they could fulfill
their greed through their children.

802
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,140
If things work out, they take the credit.

803
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:17,228
If things don't, they blame me.
That's what all parents do.

804
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,024
You use their greed to make money,

805
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,193
and they treat you like a royal.

806
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:26,028
So you at least shouldn't have

807
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,406
ruined their kids
and destroyed their family.

808
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,532
Ms. Lee.

809
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,620
I'm not the one ruining the kids
and destroying their family.

810
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,205
It's the parents.

811
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,585
I also want to know

812
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,629
why they're so obsessed with
sending their kids to med school.

813
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,256
If their kids get accepted,

814
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,508
are they guaranteed happiness and success?

815
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,886
I'm the one who wants to ask you

816
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,762
why you're doing this.

817
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:54,557
First, it was Jung-min,
who committed suicide in his third year.

818
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,725
Then it was Yeong-jae.

819
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,893
And now, it's Ye-seo.

820
01:04:56,976 --> 01:05:00,062
Why are you deliberately
ruining your students' lives?

821
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:07,945
"Deliberately ruining"?

822
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,071
Is it because...

823
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,785
you couldn't bear that your daughter
became dumb overnight

824
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,080
when people praised you
as a mother who raised a genius--

825
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:19,457
Are you trying to say...

826
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,713
that I'm consoling myself

827
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:29,300
by ruining the lives
of all those smart kids?

828
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,601
Do you think such misfortunes
wouldn't have occurred

829
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,478
if another exam coordinator
was in charge of them?

830
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,521
The kids would've been unhappy

831
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,649
even if they were coached
by another exam coordinator,

832
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,068
as long as their parents stayed the same.

833
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,500
Ms. Lee.

834
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,837
Stop nitpicking at me,
and go ask Ye-seo's mother

835
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,256
why she's pushing Ye-seo so hard

836
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,550
to make her get accepted
to SNU's med school.

837
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:21,602
I never forced Ye-seo to come to me.

838
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,105
She comes of her own accord.

839
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,234
I'm not the one who made her like that.

840
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,279
It was her mother.

841
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,102
Did you say that to Jung-min's
mother and Yeong-jae's mother as well?

842
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:07,857
Did you tell them that it's their fault?

843
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,697
You'll be punished by the gods.

844
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,783
I'll put an end to your evil deeds,

845
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,077
so just wait and see.

846
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,771
-Dad, I'm sorry.
-Cha Seo-jun.

847
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,648
Cha Gi-jun.

848
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,238
Did you solve all the questions?

849
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,697
Come to the study room.

850
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:40,658
Honey,

851
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,202
-you should stop--
-She's...

852
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,538
not my daughter.

853
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:52,545
Get her out of my sight.

854
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:22,825
EXPECTATIONS RUIN YOUR CHILDREN

855
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,915
"SO CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT YU-JEONG
AND YOUR OTHER FRIENDS?"

856
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,716
I SQUEEZED HER HAND.
I WAS SCARED THAT SHE MIGHT FIND OUT...

857
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,741
PARK SU-CHANG, LEE MYEONG-JU

858
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:04,909
PARK YEONG-JAE

859
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,368
KIM JU-YEONG OR JENNIFER KIM

860
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:59,713
PLANNING MANAGER
KANG JUN-SANG

861
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:36,166
SOPHOMORE, EXPECTED QUESTIONS FOR FINALS

862
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:01,191
SECOND SEMESTER FINALS

863
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,645
You know, right?

864
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,357
Coming in second is very impressive, too.

865
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:43,650
I couldn't even get level one this time.

866
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,029
This isn't a fair competition.

867
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,158
I can't accept this.

868
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,102
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

869
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:21,397
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

870
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,275
-Happy birthday, dear U-ju
-Happy birthday, dear U-ju

871
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,362
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

872
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:30,781
Happy birthday.

873
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,950
-Hey, let's clink our glasses.
-All right.

874
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:34,535
-Okay.
-Cheers.

875
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:37,663
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

876
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,039
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

877
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,792
Okay, U-ju. Bottoms up!

878
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:05,649
What if she really posts it
on the website?

879
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,445
I'll be too embarrassed
to even go to school.

880
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,573
Coach Kim.

881
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,743
I really...

882
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:21,707
want to kill Kim Hye-na.

883
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:56,593
Dad.

884
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:59,513
One of my friends is having
a nervous breakdown these days.

885
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:00,430
Why is that?

886
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,808
She found out that her dad
has another daughter around her age.

887
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,893
-Ye-seo.
-Her dad

888
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,645
had no idea she existed.

889
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,397
What would you do if that were you, Dad?

890
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,024
He never should've caused such a nuisance.

891
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,112
She's still his child.
How could you call her a nuisance?

892
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:18,991
Think about that child.

893
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,326
What did she do wrong?

894
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,413
