1
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,757
Let's pray together.

2
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,218
The Lord who is alive and eternal.

3
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,679
We all come from him

4
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,432
and go back to him eventually.

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,853
For the Lord is righteous,
we sinful humans cannot face him.

6
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,731
For our bodies will rot,
our souls cannot face him.

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,234
However, he saved us with his love
proven through the cross

8
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,654
and promised us resurrection
and eternal life.

9
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,283
As Jesus Christ rose from the dead

10
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,786
with the triumphant sound of horns,

11
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,331
his glory will be with you forever.

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,502
In the name of Jesus Christ.

13
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,879
-Amen.
-Amen.

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,848
Oh. Hey, Yeong-jae.

15
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,202
Su-chang, get up.

16
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,881
Yeong-jae.

17
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,949
Mom...

18
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,746
Mom...

19
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,235
One, two, three.

20
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,118
Why did she do it?

21
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,663
I can't understand why.

22
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,082
She had no reason to do such a thing.

23
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,252
Maybe she was suffering from depression.

24
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,419
Myeong-ju?

25
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,380
She was so happy, though.

26
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,549
Let's be honest.
All three of us were jealous of her.

27
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,593
Was she terminally ill or something?

28
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,805
No. Even if she had stage-four cancer,

29
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,848
she would never have left
Yeong-jae behind like that.

30
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,559
Seo-jin, you were closest to her
out of all of us.

31
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,187
Didn't you notice anything
strange about her lately?

32
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,400
Well, I don't know.

33
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,861
Can I still say
that I was a close friend of hers?

34
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,989
I really don't understand.

35
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,408
We were going to have brunch together.

36
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,495
I feel so bad for Yeong-jae.

37
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,580
He seemed completely shocked and dazed.

38
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,833
He could never have imagined it.

39
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,711
And he was traveling.
The news must've shocked him terribly.

40
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,133
By the way, why did Professor Park
move out in such a rush?

41
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,554
Su-chang.

42
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
Su-chang.

43
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,309
Hey,

44
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,435
Jun-sang.

45
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,519
Is it true?

46
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,980
I heard you resigned. Is it really true?

47
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,609
Su-chang!

48
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,612
Gosh.

49
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,452
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,871
I know I should stay to help you
become the planning manager.

51
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,581
That is not important right now.

52
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,708
I'm off.

53
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,669
Come to your senses, please.

54
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,088
You're going to give up
on your family and career?

55
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,715
What about Yeong-jae?

56
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,092
You said you want to
hand everything down to him.

57
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,683
Seriously?

58
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,518
He actually resigned?

59
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,772
I totally understand
that he's in utter shock now,

60
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,857
but he always wanted to be the director.

61
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,068
He was the head of Neurosurgery
and the planning manager.

62
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,944
He would've become the next director.

63
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,946
Gosh, that's too bad.

64
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,115
Then what will happen to Ye-seo's dad?

65
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,659
You said he can only be promoted
with Professor Park's support.

66
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,536
He's doomed now.

67
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,122
With Professor Park gone,
he wouldn't be promoted.

68
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,665
The hospital director

69
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,376
can appoint whoever he likes
for that position.

70
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,213
Do you actually think that
thousand-year-old tortoise will pick him?

71
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,881
-Hello!
-Hello!

72
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:22,799
Hello.

73
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,189
What just happened? Did he hang up on me?

74
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,650
He has terrible manners.

75
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,903
-Hello.
-All right.

76
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,994
"All right"?

77
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,080
He quit his job?

78
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,249
What about Yeong-jae, then?

79
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,500
That's what I'm saying.

80
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,087
They moved right after the funeral,
and he even quit his job.

81
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,505
Isn't it strange?

82
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,716
Come to think of it,

83
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,261
the fact that Myeong-ju
came back early was also strange.

84
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,762
Yes, you're right.

85
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,181
She went on the cruise
after Yeong-jae got into university,

86
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,724
but came back early saying she was tired.

87
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,560
Who'd give up their precious
vacation like that?

88
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,145
Exactly.

89
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,524
Ma'am, Professor Park's family
didn't return our pot.

90
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,608
Our pot?

91
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,693
Which one?

92
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,283
I made some kimchi stew with ribs.

93
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,661
We crave kimchi stew the most
when we're traveling abroad.

94
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,498
-You didn't have to.
-I just wanted to thank you.

95
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,501
Coach Kim said she will coach Ye-seo.

96
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,504
All four of us were there,
including Professor Cha's wife,

97
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,256
and I was so anxious.

98
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,177
Anyway, I have nothing
to worry about now, thanks to you.

99
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,138
Myeong-ju, I already put in
chopped green onions,

100
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,599
so just heat it up
when Professor Park gets home later.

101
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,766
I found it.

102
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,852
How many times do I have to tell you?

103
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,980
Mom, please.

104
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,149
You stepping in
won't resolve any problems.

105
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,665
MEDICINE
NEULSARANG PHARMACY

106
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,669
December 19?

107
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,379
The 19th...

108
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,673
What are you talking about? The 19th?

109
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,593
Follow me.

110
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,763
Why? What's wrong?

111
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,893
Myeong-ju left for England
on December 18, you know.

112
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,270
I got an invitation that night,
so I clearly remember the date.

113
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,563
So what?

114
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,484
The date on the bag containing
her medicine was December 19.

115
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,944
Oh, my goodness.

116
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,862
Does that mean she never left
for the cruise?

117
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,948
Judging from the date,
I'm certain that she didn't go.

118
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,407
But why didn't she?

119
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,867
And why did she act like she did?

120
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,661
She even got us the figurines as gifts.

121
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,371
I know. It's really odd.

122
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,706
And she said she found something.

123
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,961
She said her mother stepping in
won't resolve any problems?

124
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,214
Did Professor Park cheat on Myeong-ju?

125
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,215
No way.

126
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,592
Myeong-ju wouldn't have gone on that trip
if she had a hunch

127
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,843
about him cheating on her.

128
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,137
She would've done everything
she could to find evidence.

129
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,014
But still, she wouldn't have
committed suicide.

130
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,600
She's not someone who'd just die
and leave Yeong-jae behind.

131
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,893
Then what could it be?

132
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,603
Why in the world did she do that?

133
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,233
You want me to live for Yeong-jae?

134
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,735
You want me to live for that punk?

135
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,740
If you're suffering this much,
imagine how hard it must be for him.

136
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,784
You need to stay strong.

137
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,328
I should've taken him out
of the family register back then.

138
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,080
That's what I should've done.

139
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,042
Then I wouldn't have had
to go through this mess.

140
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,087
What? What are you talking about?

141
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,755
He's not even human.

142
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm telling you, he's not human!

143
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,387
He was brazen enough to show up

144
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,056
even after killing his own mom.

145
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,726
He killed her?

146
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,354
Are you saying your wife died
because of Yeong-jae?

147
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,398
But he's such a nice kid.

148
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,567
You think he's nice?

149
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,530
Oh, right.

150
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,908
If a kid gets good grades,
they're considered nice.

151
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,369
You're nice if you get good grades.

152
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,543
I'm going to go now.

153
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,964
No, wait. Gosh, be careful.

154
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,925
My gosh, wait. Excuse me,
can you call a chauffeur?

155
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,971
Su-chang, are you okay?
Come on, get a grip.

156
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,390
You need to come to your senses. Get up.

157
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,857
Su-chang, what's wrong?

158
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,876
She looked so happy as if she had
the entire world in her hands.

159
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,338
Come on outside.

160
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,090
Mom, I need to finish the workbook.

161
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,716
Dad told me to have
everything done by today.

162
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,675
It's okay.

163
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,762
You shouldn't study on a day like this.

164
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,641
-It looks amazing.
-It looks like a different world.

165
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,018
See? Doesn't it look like
the kingdom in Frozen?

166
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,771
Princess Elsa must've cast a spell, Mom.

167
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,149
"Princess Elsa must've cast a spell, Mom."

168
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,526
Hey, I'm your older brother.

169
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,070
I can't believe you said that.
Just go inside and study.

170
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,239
-What? Mom, help.
-Get over here.

171
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,075
Mom, he keeps making fun of me.

172
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,078
Gi-jun, stop making fun
of your older brother.

173
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,081
"Princess Elsa must've cast a spell."

174
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,332
Mom, I didn't say it like that.

175
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't believe
you're making fun of me, too.

176
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,502
Did she cast a spell?

177
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,087
-You better stop.
-Come and get me.

178
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,047
-Are you still obsessed with Elsa?
-My gosh.

179
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,882
Gosh, it's not like that.

180
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,011
Elsa cast a magic spell.

181
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,763
I'm going to kill you once I catch you.

182
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,071
Throw it away.

183
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,244
No good will come from keeping
a dead person's stuff in our house.

184
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,457
She made such a fuss over him.

185
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,792
Getting accepted didn't mean
everything would be fine.

186
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,462
There's no way Yeong-jae will turn
out well now that his mom's dead.

187
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,630
His road to success is no longer valid.

188
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,595
You already knew, didn't you?

189
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,638
What?

190
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,558
I'm talking about Yeong-jae and his mom.

191
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,852
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,770
Was everything okay between them?

193
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,149
You should know something
since you always spent time with her.

194
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,153
He gets good grades,
he's polite, and he's nice.

195
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,863
On top of that, he's the kind of son

196
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,032
that would believe
anything his mom ever told him.

197
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,451
So why would there be a problem
between them?

198
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,167
Did you hear something?

199
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,835
Did they have a problem?

200
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,673
Never mind. Just forget it.

201
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,282
Here are the profiles of all the teachers.

202
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,201
I added their graduation certificates,

203
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,161
career certificates,
and copies of their ID cards.

204
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,831
This teacher is the best teacher
in Daechi-dong, Mom.

205
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,125
All the teachers seem very competent.

206
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,295
The teachers in charge
of her school grades

207
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,173
either graduated Shin A High School
or used to work there.

208
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,468
Do you think I might get perfect
scores for three whole years?

209
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,595
As long as you don't make any mistakes.

210
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,472
Where will the lessons be taking place?

211
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,016
It'll either take place at my office
or at the teachers' homes.

212
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,852
Of course, Mr. Jo will always
come here to pick Ye-seo up.

213
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,399
You just need to take care
of Ye-seo's health.

214
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,736
Here's a list of dishes that are good
for high school students.

215
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,614
My goodness, you prepared this as well?

216
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,450
Thank you so much, Coach Kim.

217
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,369
May I take a look at Ye-seo's room?

218
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,839
The location of her desk is great.
She won't face away from the door.

219
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,049
I heard that facing away from the door

220
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,927
can make you feel nervous
and lose your concentration.

221
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,971
You also did a good job of placing

222
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,931
the main desk and the secondary desk
toward the north.

223
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,391
There shouldn't be too much sunlight.

224
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,768
That way, it'll help her concentrate
better when she studies.

225
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,316
Ye-seo, do you study here often?

226
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,069
Yes, I go in there if I can't seem to
concentrate outside.

227
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,446
It feels like a private study room.

228
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,531
That's good.

229
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,951
Ms. Han, please place
a school desk inside this room.

230
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,121
She should study in a similar environment
to where she takes her tests.

231
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:18,000
And please hang a stopwatch on the wall
where it can easily be seen.

232
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,336
She needs to check how long it takes
for her to answer questions.

233
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,213
I want you to maintain the humidity
at 20 to 23 percent.

234
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,593
You'll have to change this desk lamp.

235
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,553
Using blue light at around 8,000K

236
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,513
for subjects like math and science,

237
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,016
white light at around 4,000K
for subjects that need memorizing,

238
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,185
and red light at around 2,200K

239
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,228
for creative subjects like music and art

240
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,356
would be the most effective
while studying.

241
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,942
You must get rid of the glass cover
on top of the desk right away.

242
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,944
The cold glass cover might lower
her body temperature.

243
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,197
Then she'll waste energy
raising her body temperature again.

244
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,449
Get rid of everything on the wall
that's unnecessary

245
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,534
and hang one of Mondrian's paintings.

246
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,744
It'll enhance her concentration

247
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,455
and it'll also help stimulate
brain activity.

248
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,337
I feel so reassured to have you
by our side.

249
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,297
Thank you so much.

250
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,053
I'll be meeting you once every week

251
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,514
to give you an overall report
on how she's doing.

252
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,351
Did you also do this with Yeong-jae's...

253
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,064
Did you hear what happened
to Yeong-jae's mom?

254
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,858
My relationship with my clients
ends as soon as they get accepted.

255
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,819
The same will happen with Ye-seo.

256
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,323
Then I guess you wouldn't know.

257
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,909
You should eat.

258
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,835
PARK YEONG-JAE

259
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,878
DECLINE

260
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,632
Have you talked to U-ju's mother?

261
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,718
I called and even left her a text,

262
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,302
but she still hasn't
gotten back to me yet.

263
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,056
The top student's mother called,
but she didn't answer?

264
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,851
Maybe she's a lot stricter
with her kid's education.

265
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,146
I guess she doesn't even feel
the need to share information.

266
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,149
I really want to know
what kind of person she is.

267
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,820
I have big news!

268
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,615
We know you have a big mouth.
What's all the fuss about?

269
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,328
Director Choi scouted someone
to replace Professor Park.

270
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,373
What? I thought we were going
to do an open recruitment.

271
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,624
Exactly. That's what I thought.

272
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,169
What's more important is that
he'll be hired as a full professor

273
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,379
and will get to live in Sky Castle.

274
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,007
Who is he?

275
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,843
Is he a Johns Hopkins University
graduate or something?

276
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,680
He's a Moojin Medical School
graduate. Moojin University.

277
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,557
Moojin University?

278
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,184
Have you heard of that school?

279
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,311
I don't think so.

280
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,607
It's a medical school located
in the suburbs.

281
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,816
What's more surprising

282
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,236
is that he has no connections
with Director Choi whatsoever.

283
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,654
He's totally clean.

284
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,492
Why would he hire someone like him?

285
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,204
Because he favors him.
He hired him because he favors him.

286
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,663
It's totally absurd.

287
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,249
There are so many professors
who are dying to live at Sky Castle.

288
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,503
He favors him enough to hire him
even if he's not from a good school?

289
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,297
What's so important about
which school he graduated?

290
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,509
A doctor should truly care
about his or her patients,

291
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,636
be responsible,
and have great surgical skills.

292
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,805
Those kinds of things
are probably more important.

293
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,142
These days, profit is considered
more important than lives...

294
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,019
My goodness.

295
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,773
This teacup brand
is 260 years old, isn't it?

296
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,651
Seo-jin is a maniac
for luxury brand items,

297
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:31,902
just like me.

298
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,737
I'm not a maniac.

299
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,864
They used to belong to my mom.
She gave them to me.

300
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,243
Your mom really has amazing taste.

301
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,288
My mom thinks the best kind of porcelain
are the ones that don't break.

302
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,457
I'd love to meet your mom one day.

303
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,501
Does she have plans to visit Korea?

304
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,087
She might visit
if my brother decides to come back.

305
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,297
She loves her son way too much.

306
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,424
Does your brother

307
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,343
live in Sydney, too?

308
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,346
He's a dentist.

309
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,517
Ye-seo isn't the top student only
because she takes after her dad.

310
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,104
Her grandfather used to be the president
of a mortgage bank in Sydney,

311
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,022
her uncle is a dentist,

312
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,984
and her mom got a bachelor's degree
in education from Sydney University.

313
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,695
Such selfish genes.

314
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,558
-I can't believe it.
-U-ju.

315
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,809
Are we really in Korea?

316
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,605
We get to live in luxury
thanks to your dad.

317
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,025
You're the one who gets to live in luxury.

318
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,235
My school is far from here.

319
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,738
You little brat.

320
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,615
Did you just talk back to me?

321
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,950
Okay, I surrender.

322
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,660
I find this part the funniest.

323
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,495
The ruling class

324
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,583
had to share their kids,
wives, and assets.

325
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,420
Which one of us do you think
would stand to lose the most?

326
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,797
Will you stop talking nonsense?

327
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,966
We need to write a book report.

328
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,968
Darn it.

329
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,597
I didn't even do this in school.

330
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,563
Hey.

331
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,523
They're moving into Yeong-jae's old house.

332
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,280
Isn't that the doctor
the hospital director hired?

333
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,366
I wonder if they know

334
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,243
someone living there died.

335
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,535
It's not a nice topic.

336
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,954
Don't even mention it.

337
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,873
I wouldn't like it even if it were free.

338
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,500
-Stop it.
-Okay, fine.

339
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,043
I wouldn't say it to their face.

340
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,880
Gosh, did they own a flower shop?

341
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,924
Why do they have so many potted plants?

342
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,973
Coffee, honey?

343
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,064
You're working too hard.

344
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,617
You got everything organized already.

345
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,953
Yes. I just need my plants.

346
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,873
He takes after his mom.
He likes plants as much as you do.

347
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,334
It provides oxygen and reduces fine dust.

348
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,752
It's hitting two birds with one stone.

349
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,089
Your dad doesn't get
why it's so good. Right?

350
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,632
Oh, right.

351
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,969
I found this in this room.

352
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,929
It must be the previous owner's.

353
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,726
We're almost done.

354
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,146
Take these potted plants upstairs.

355
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,565
-All these?
-Yes.

356
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,775
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

357
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,737
-Hurry up.
-We're almost done.

358
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,865
What's for lunch today?

359
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,576
Shall we order in?

360
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,911
Jajangmyeon is a moving day
tradition. What do you say, son?

361
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,288
Sounds good.

362
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,998
Perfect.

363
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't know this neighborhood, so...

364
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,336
-Hello.
-Hello.

365
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,471
NEUROSURGERY
PARK SU-CHANG

366
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,347
NEUROSURGERY
HWANG CHI-YEONG

367
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,105
He's not even human.

368
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,232
I'm telling you, he's not human!

369
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,983
He was brazen enough to show up

370
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,069
even after killing his own mom.

371
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,874
Nice to meet you.

372
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,335
I'm Hwang Chi-yeong.

373
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,504
HWANG CHI-YEONG

374
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,599
I'm Kang Jun-sang, Orthopedics Department.

375
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,188
It's my first day here.
I hope we can get along.

376
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,107
Please, excuse my intrusion.

377
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,775
This was my senior's office.

378
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,735
No, it's fine.

379
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,405
You can visit whenever you want.

380
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,830
All right, then.

381
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,670
Let me introduce
Professor Hwang Chi-yeong.

382
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,593
Nice to meet you all.

383
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,928
I'm Hwang Chi-yeong,
working in neurosurgery.

384
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,806
I studied at Moojin Medical School

385
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,642
where I also completed my residency.

386
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,561
Moojin Medical School?

387
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,104
-What school?
-Is it a cyber university?

388
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,401
I'll do my best.
I hope we can all get along.

389
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,486
PROFESSOR HWANG CHI-YEONG
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

390
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,948
All right, then.

391
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,160
I met Professor Hwang eight years ago

392
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,665
by pure coincidence while
I was trekking in the Himalayas.

393
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,127
A porter had fallen down a hill
and hurt his back.

394
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,963
Professor Hwang treated him with care
as if he were his own family,

395
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,217
and I was immensely impressed and touched.

396
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:14,429
I found out later that he's
a great doctor who, for ten years,

397
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,974
had been providing medical care
in Kathmandu and Marpha.

398
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,062
You picked him for his kind nursing?

399
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,607
He's also an expert
in spine surgery who received

400
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,193
the Best Paper Award

401
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,570
from the Minimally Invasive
Spine Surgery Society.

402
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:35,158
I believe our future
Spine and Joint Center

403
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,577
really needs talent like his,

404
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,247
-so I invited him here.
-"Really needs"?

405
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,340
Does anyone have any questions?

406
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,808
Ask freely if you do. Go on.

407
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,142
Go ahead.

408
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,521
Stop looking left.

409
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,940
Professor. The director's looking at you.

410
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,900
-What?
-The director.

411
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,611
Yes?

412
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,904
Do you mean

413
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,155
me?

414
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,115
Yes.

415
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,408
Professor Woo.

416
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,909
Any questions?

417
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,371
For the thousand-year-old tortoise.

418
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,421
What should I do?

419
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,091
I totally got on his bad side, didn't I?

420
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,510
He holds grudges for ages.

421
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,595
What should I do? I can't lose my job.

422
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,555
Jun-sang.

423
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,766
He hates our department already.

424
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,852
What if...

425
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,856
He won't make Hwang Chi-yeong
chief of the Spine Center, will he?

426
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,150
Do you think he's stupid?

427
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,027
Would he do something that risky?

428
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,989
-I guess not.
-That new doctor has pride.

429
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:00,035
He revealed that he studied
at Moojin Medical School.

430
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,246
He seems to be skilled, too.

431
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,957
I mean, he won the Best Paper Award.

432
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,841
There are many doctors who write amazing
papers but have terrible operation skills.

433
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:22,182
Why do you think the tortoise
is putting up a smoke screen?

434
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,975
We'll find out

435
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,561
in due time.

436
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,614
Hello.

437
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,367
We just moved in down the street.

438
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,368
Oh, hello.

439
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,662
Here's some rice cake.

440
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,126
-I hope we get along.
-Thanks.

441
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,302
By any chance,

442
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,722
are you Mi-hyang?

443
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,977
Kwak Mi-hyang! It's you, isn't it?

444
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,148
It's me, Su-im. Lee Su-im.

445
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,192
Lee Su-im from Eden Orphanage.

446
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,944
Don't you remember me?

447
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,989
I think you mistook me for someone else.
My name is Han Seo-jin.

448
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,157
My gosh,

449
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,492
I'm sorry.

450
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,702
You look so much like my childhood friend.

451
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,789
Who's here?

452
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,335
Oh, you must be our new neighbor.

453
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,089
-Yes, hello. I'm Lee Su-im.
-Hello.

454
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,633
Here, it's nice to meet you.

455
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,927
-Oh.
-Take it.

456
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,223
It's nice to meet you.

457
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,518
I haven't received rice cakes
from a new neighbor in a long time.

458
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,769
Thank you very much.

459
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,980
I live over there.
My name is Noh Seung-hye.

460
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,440
I see.

461
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,942
When all of you are free,

462
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,319
would you like to come over
to my place for lunch?

463
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,947
-Pardon me?
-I'm not a good cook,

464
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,991
so I can't really throw
a proper housewarming party,

465
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,786
but I thought it would be nice
to introduce myself over a meal.

466
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,664
Tomorrow would work for me
if you're all free.

467
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,166
That'd be great.

468
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,334
All right, I'll be there too.

469
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,172
I won't be able to join you.
I have plans for tomorrow.

470
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,048
Seo-jin, you have to be there.

471
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,259
I have to go meet other moms
from Ye-bin's class.

472
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,055
That's fine. Just the people
who have time can come over.

473
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:30,059
Then please come to my place
by noon tomorrow.

474
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,519
-All right.
-Okay.

475
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:32,937
Bye, then.

476
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,230
-Bye.
-Bye.

477
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,154
Oh, my goodness.

478
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,573
Did you see the grime
under her fingernails?

479
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,200
She must have touched this.

480
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,120
That doesn't mean she's unclean.

481
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,956
It's just dirt you get on your hands
by touching plants and soil often.

482
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,584
She was only being kind.

483
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,128
You shouldn't react like that.

484
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,717
"You shouldn't react like that."

485
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,012
She seems so stuck up
at times, don't you think?

486
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,779
Mi-hyang!

487
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,492
Mi-hyang!

488
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,250
Mi-hyang!

489
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,128
You brat, your father is talking
to you. Are you deaf or what?

490
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,508
Take this ox blood to that witch,
your mother.

491
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,972
What are you looking at?

492
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,157
-Let me see.
-Oh, that girl...

493
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,951
Isn't she Mi-hyang?

494
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,578
-It is her.
-No, it's not her.

495
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,079
-It's her.
-It is Mi-hyang.

496
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,455
Look, it is her.

497
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,291
-Oh, you're right.
-See?

498
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,002
-My gosh, look at her.
-Hey, what's on her shoes?

499
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,504
-What is she holding?
-I think it's blood.

500
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,033
Right.

501
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,535
You are Han Seo-jin now.

502
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,204
Not Kwak Mi-hyang,
the daughter of the drunkard

503
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,373
who used to sell tripe, ox blood,
and bones at the market.

504
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,125
You are Han Seo-jin now.

505
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,461
Your husband is an orthopedic surgeon,

506
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,588
and your daughter
is the top student at her school.

507
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,800
Any woman in the world would envy you.

508
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,637
You are Han Seo-jin.

509
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,764
My gosh.

510
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,223
What? Are you jealous?

511
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,726
Wow, they did so much
editing on Ye-seo's photo.

512
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,853
Gosh, you have sharp eyes.

513
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,480
That show-off
obviously had to get it edited.

514
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,815
1ST PLACE, KANG YE-SEO
2ND PLACE, KIM HYE-NA

515
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,694
Why isn't that show-off
coming here anymore?

516
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,821
Does she go to a different academy?

517
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,990
Why are you asking me? Ask her yourself.

518
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,159
Ye-seo has a coach now, you know.

519
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,039
A coach? Doesn't your mom
take care of everything for her?

520
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,962
It must be a special coach.

521
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,006
That idiot told you, so don't say
that I spilled the beans.

522
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,926
It'll get really annoying
if that show-off loses it.

523
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,180
Wait up, Ye-bin.

524
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,394
Winning a gold medal in the Olympiad
will guarantee entry

525
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,728
into a science high school, right?

526
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,564
A silver medal might be possible
if he studies very hard,

527
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,274
but a gold medal is almost impossible.

528
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,318
Also, make sure Su-han's grades are good.

529
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,112
This is driving me crazy.

530
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,990
Why does my husband have to send
Su-han to a science high school?

531
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,492
Isn't a private school better
if he is to go to a medical school?

532
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,578
He obviously wants all the best
for his one and only son.

533
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,497
He's so greedy.

534
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,417
At least he's honest about his greed.

535
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,377
He's better than my husband
who always criticizes me

536
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,004
even though he's actually the greedy one.

537
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,130
That is true.

538
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,632
Oh, gosh.

539
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:33,970
Hey,

540
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,930
you said you have plans for tomorrow.

541
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,933
Are you secretly going somewhere
to obtain valuable information?

542
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,768
No, it's nothing like that.

543
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,899
Seo-jin, isn't that woman
really something?

544
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,943
Who gives out rice cakes like that?
She has no class.

545
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,862
It was just in a plastic bag,
without even a plate.

546
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,196
I can just tell what she's like.

547
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,115
Yes, it was a bit tacky.

548
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,617
Anyway, when I meet her tomorrow,

549
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,453
I'll find out
what kind of family she's from

550
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,247
and see whether she qualifies
to join our community.

551
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,583
-What?
-Seung-hye's dad

552
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,085
is the Army Chief of Staff,
and your dad is the president of a bank.

553
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,963
My dad owns buildings in Gangnam.
If I tell her that, she'll talk as well.

554
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,590
If she's from a good family, that is.

555
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,179
Gosh, what's taking them so long?

556
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,389
Are they eating tteokbokki again?

557
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,434
-Seo-jin, I'll go check.
-Okay.

558
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,644
Those little brats.

559
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,548
CALL

560
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,225
My plans got canceled,
so I thought I should join you.

561
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,104
That's great. Please, come in.

562
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,189
Come on in.

563
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,819
Hey, Seo-jin.

564
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,612
You said you had plans.

565
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,989
They got canceled.
It's fortunate for us, right?

566
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,659
I figured we should celebrate
our first gathering.

567
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,121
Since we're having lunch together,
this will be better than soju.

568
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,164
Thank you.

569
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,379
I must say, this place looks nice
with all the plants.

570
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,047
They make the house feel lively,
don't they?

571
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,135
I guess she used to be a landscaper.

572
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,178
Her garden looks amazing, too.

573
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,017
Isn't he handsome?

574
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,145
He's a doctor, but he looks like an actor.

575
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,939
Her son is good-looking, too.

576
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,612
My gosh, did you grow
these vegetables yourself?

577
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,906
Yes, of course.

578
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,616
They're totally organic.

579
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,828
Would you like to take some home?

580
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,330
-Would that be okay?
-Of course.

581
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,423
Right, I also made ox blood soup.
Would you like some?

582
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,551
My father used to love

583
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,303
ox blood soup.

584
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,138
I should have some. It's been so long.

585
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,308
-What about you two?
-I'll pass.

586
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,475
Same here.

587
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,269
I make

588
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,646
a very tasty ox blood soup.

589
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,357
My whole family loves it.

590
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,735
I guess you don't like fancy dishes.

591
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,196
While other families ate beef bone soup,

592
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,199
we always ate ox blood soup.

593
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,617
By the way,

594
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,660
how did you and your husband meet?

595
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,746
We grew up together in an orphanage.

596
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,415
An orphanage?

597
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,708
What?

598
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,046
There's a slaughterhouse in the town
where I'm from.

599
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,756
I got the ox blood
from a market near there,

600
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,341
so it's very fresh.

601
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,720
-Thanks for the food.
-Enjoy.

602
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,389
Oh, right.

603
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm sorry about yesterday.

604
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:12,355
I had a neighborhood friend
named Kwak Mi-hyang,

605
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,607
but I lost touch with her
after we graduated high school.

606
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,693
What a tacky name.

607
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,657
It's nice to meet you all.

608
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,662
-This wine is so delicious.
-Yes.

609
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,622
The aroma of the wine

610
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,916
gets covered up by the scent
of the flowers.

611
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,669
How do you grow flowers so well?

612
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,087
They're all so beautiful.

613
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,716
My mother really loved flowers and plants.

614
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,802
I grew up watching her grow them.

615
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,345
Your mother?

616
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,181
Didn't you say you grew up
in an orphanage?

617
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,644
My parents ran an orphanage.

618
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,646
Until around the time
I entered elementary school,

619
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,773
I didn't even know
that they were my real parents.

620
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,191
My gosh.

621
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,278
That means the orphans were
treated like their own children.

622
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,240
Both of my parents passed away last year,
and my son, U-ju,

623
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,451
said that they must be resting
in paradise now.

624
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,954
U-ju?

625
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,125
The boy that got accepted
to Shin A High School as the top student?

626
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,170
How did you know?

627
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,215
My goodness, this is unbelievable.

628
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,717
What a coincidence.

629
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,386
Seo-jin kept texting and calling you.

630
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,305
She's Ye-seo's mom.

631
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,515
Don't you remember?

632
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,811
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,106
I normally block all the calls
from other students' mothers.

634
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,858
-You block them?
-Why?

635
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,155
I find myself getting anxious
if I spend too much time with them.

636
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,657
And they make me feel as if
I should make U-ju study more.

637
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,660
When U-ju was in middle school,

638
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,246
I let him take private math lessons
because he wanted to.

639
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,123
But I never made him do anything else.

640
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,670
I get convinced really easily,

641
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,881
so I figured it'd be best
not to meet anyone.

642
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,343
She's unbelievably naive.

643
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,763
-Pardon?
-Are you going to stay here?

644
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,599
No, I should go. I need to pick up Su-han.

645
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,601
-Thank you for lunch.
-Thank you.

646
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,685
But...

647
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,524
Gosh, I don't know what to say.

648
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,361
I'm glad to meet you,

649
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,279
but I'm worried about you as well.

650
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,743
Her son got accepted as the top student
without getting any private lessons?

651
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,913
And how could she be rude enough
to say she blocked your texts?

652
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,331
Exactly.

653
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,500
She invited us
and tried to serve ox blood soup.

654
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,294
She's looking down on everyone
who pays for their kids' private lessons.

655
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,046
There's nothing we can say
about that, though.

656
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,758
Her son still managed to
get accepted as the top student.

657
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,884
Wait.

658
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,388
Hey, wait. You forgot this.

659
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,850
I packed you some lettuce and butterbur.

660
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,019
Thank you. I'll enjoy them.

661
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,774
By the way, I think the person
who used to live here left this behind.

662
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,776
-That's mine.
-Pardon?

663
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,444
I lent this to the previous owner.

664
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,291
What?

665
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,044
He never got any private lessons
other than for math?

666
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,097
U-ju may have been successful
in studying all by himself.

667
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,641
But someone climbing a mountain alone
cannot have

668
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,853
the same results as someone who climbs
the mountain with the help

669
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,397
of a professional guide and cook.

670
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,275
You know what Ye-seo got
for her scholastic assessment test, right?

671
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,693
She got a level one for every subject,

672
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,404
but U-ju got a level two for math
and general social studies.

673
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,573
Level two?

674
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,158
My gosh, how did you know?

675
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,868
In order to manage Ye-seo's grades,

676
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,496
I need to know
her competitors' grades as well.

677
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,290
Ms. Han,

678
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,459
you must have faith in me.

679
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,920
That means you must not be nervous
regardless of whatever happens

680
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,964
and that you must

681
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,050
expect only the best results
from your daughter.

682
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,430
Okay, Coach Kim. I have faith in you.

683
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,015
Let me tell you this once more.

684
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,934
You need to let me take care
of Ye-seo's grades.

685
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,519
All you have to do

686
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,647
is take good care of her health.

687
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,778
Ye-seo, it's time to go
to your private lesson.

688
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,454
I'm tired.

689
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,331
You must be tired.

690
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,959
Here, drink this. Drink the whole thing.

691
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,384
By the way,

692
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,136
remember the boy named U-ju?

693
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,596
He moved into Yeong-jae's old house.

694
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,306
Does that mean his dad's also a doctor?

695
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,516
He's a neurosurgeon.

696
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,017
He's a replacement for Yeong-jae's dad.

697
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,854
By the way, Mom. I texted Yeong-jae.

698
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,564
-You texted Yeong-jae?
-The thing is,

699
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,275
Mr. Jo told me that Yeong-jae
was really good at taking notes.

700
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,360
And that made me curious.

701
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,320
So I texted him and asked
if I could see his notes.

702
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,614
But it turns out,
his phone was turned off,

703
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,908
and he even got rid of
all his social media accounts.

704
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,661
Imagine how shocked he must've been.

705
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,497
He might not want to talk to anyone
who knows about the incident.

706
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,958
It's so annoying.

707
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,584
Rumors must've spread everywhere.

708
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,002
Do you know what Hye-na said to me?

709
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,796
"What's the use of living
in a fancy neighborhood

710
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,130
when people end up dying there?"

711
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:31,924
Kim Hye-na?

712
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,052
Oh, the kid that lives
with her single mother?

713
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,804
She's only saying that
because she's jealous.

714
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,847
She's saying that out of jealousy,
so don't mind her.

715
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,351
You just need to keep doing
what you're doing now.

716
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,978
Then I'll get accepted
to SNU Medical School.

717
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,398
I'm going to get accepted
and take Grandma down a peg.

718
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,817
My gosh, don't say stuff like that.

719
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,777
I know you like hearing it.

720
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,904
What are you talking about?

721
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,700
Su-han's dad?

722
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,618
What's gotten into him?

723
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,454
I guess he feels pressured now
that Su-han's entering middle school.

724
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,456
He says he feels the need
to make some effort.

725
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,084
My gosh, that's great.

726
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,919
You should compliment him.

727
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,547
Not a lot of dads are willing to go
pick up their kids late at night.

728
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,965
You should get going.

729
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,884
Can you text me before you arrive?

730
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,554
Ye-bin always complains,
saying I favor Ye-seo over her.

731
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,139
Okay.

732
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,822
Should I watch a movie? It's been so long.

733
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,581
Where did they all go?

734
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,832
Did she delete them?

735
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,713
JUNE 10: I WANT TO DIE.
THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST KILLED ME.

736
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,923
What's this?

737
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,720
JUNE 13: GA-EUL IS THE ONLY
DECENT PERSON IN SKY CASTLE.

738
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,515
JUNE 17: I SEARCHED FOR WAYS
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

739
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,892
HOW DO I MAKE THEM SUFFER?

740
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,644
I wonder why my mom gave birth to me.

741
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,271
She shouldn't have had me
if she was going to curse at me.

742
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,775
She said I'm a failure
for not winning an award at KMO.

743
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,070
Why did I have to be born
into such a terrible family?

744
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,822
All they ever talk about
is getting perfect scores.

745
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,325
I wonder if they'll feel relieved
if I die.

746
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,202
I really just want to cut myself

747
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,663
with a knife.

748
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,833
I'm going to get out of this house
no matter what.

749
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,877
Let's study hard until then.

750
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,922
Let's study. Let's get it done.
Let's give them what they want.

751
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,006
That way,

752
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,676
I'll be able to get my revenge.

753
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,469
What?

754
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,347
Revenge?

755
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,265
They say they love me,

756
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,851
but they should be honest and say
they need something to brag about.

757
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,020
Three generations of doctors?

758
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,689
They treat Ga-eul like a pest
because she's not well-educated.

759
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,358
How can Dad still call himself a doctor?

760
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,777
I feel terrible that I have parents...

761
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,782
like them.

762
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,581
Are you inside, honey?

763
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,504
What happened?

764
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,381
Why didn't you go on the trip?

765
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,550
You always said you wanted
to go on a cruise tour.

766
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,843
How can you call yourself a dad?

767
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,303
It's been ten days
since our son went on a trip,

768
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,097
but you haven't even called him once.

769
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,932
Did something happen to him?

770
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,977
"Did something happen to him?"

771
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,104
That's all you have to say?

772
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,232
I called you.

773
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,109
I paid a huge amount
of money for that cruise tour.

774
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,319
-So why would you--
-Your son, Park Yeong-jae,

775
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,532
says he's going to cut ties with us.

776
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,326
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

777
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,327
Look.

778
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,996
Take a look at this!

779
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,082
You should see
what our son's been thinking

780
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,209
all these years.

781
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,315
I raised him with so much care.

782
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,443
He was the sole purpose of my life.

783
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,778
But how could he...

784
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,323
I don't want to live in hell anymore.

785
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,451
My life as your son

786
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,995
was a living hell for me.

787
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,856
MAY 10: THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MY FEELINGS.

788
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,076
Yeong-jae!

789
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,370
Park Yeong-jae!

790
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,837
Park Yeong-jae!

791
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,839
Where are you, you punk?

792
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,431
You know where he is, don't you?

793
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,976
I know you met him. Tell me.

794
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,185
It's all your fault.

795
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,146
If you hadn't beaten him up--

796
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,109
You were always the one
nagging at me to get him to study.

797
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,029
You're blaming me again.

798
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,824
It's always my fault.

799
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,201
I'm responsible for all
the bad stuff, aren't I?

800
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,870
You're the one that hired Ga-eul
in the first place.

801
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,040
Who do you think is responsible
for the sick nonsense that happened?

802
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,542
I guess he takes after his dad!

803
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,127
All you ever did was cheat on me!

804
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,172
You're his mom.

805
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,467
You should've known
what was going through his head.

806
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,386
He doesn't even deserve to be my son!

807
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,140
I'll just kill him
and pay the price for it.

808
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,478
Mr. Park.

809
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:22,149
Get your men to find someone for me.

810
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,483
Yes.

811
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,193
I said yes!

812
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,113
You can beat him half to death, so just...

813
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,786
He says he'll take revenge.

814
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,122
He wants revenge.

815
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,377
You want me to do nothing
about that son of a bitch?

816
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,462
Yes!

817
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,049
Leave him alone.

818
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,800
Then he'll come back.

819
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,637
We'll never find him
if he goes into hiding.

820
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,766
I can't give up on him.

821
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,188
I can't give up on my son.

822
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,109
I thought it would all work out.

823
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,570
That morning...

824
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,407
I had no idea that was our last goodbye.

825
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,410
I'm leaving for my trip today, too.

826
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,163
I won't see you for two months.
You weren't going to say goodbye?

827
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,290
Well, I thought you were asleep.

828
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,709
He hugged me tightly

829
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,212
for some reason.

830
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,632
He did as he was told all the time,

831
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,468
but he was never really affectionate.
But that day...

832
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,640
I thought he'd loosened up
because he'd gotten into college.

833
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,934
-I thought that...
-Make sure you call me.

834
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,978
everything would be okay.

835
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,189
I can't reach him.

836
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,108
He left this morning
saying he's going to Europe

837
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,776
but there's no reservation under his name.

838
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,362
He even turned off his phone.
Where could he be?

839
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,490
Please find him for me. Please.

840
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,672
The last signal from his phone
before it was turned off

841
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:10,674
was picked up in Sinan, Jeollanam-do.

842
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,342
Sinan?

843
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,719
Sinan?

844
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,139
Ga-eul?

845
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,057
Ga-eul?

846
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,854
Find out Lee Ga-eul's address.

847
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,449
Lee Ga-eul currently lives
in Amtae-myeon, Sinan.

848
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,452
Ga-eul, that bitch.

849
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,328
She's done it this time.

850
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,427
MOHWAJEONG

851
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,194
-Why not?
-Don't.

852
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,781
Don't.

853
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,949
I said, don't.

854
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,626
You witch.

855
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,835
You tramp.

856
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,296
I'm going to tear you apart!

857
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,465
-Stop! Don't do this!
-You bitch!

858
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,884
You seduced him
when he was in middle school

859
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,136
-and now--
-I said, stop!

860
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,056
We took you and your mother in
when you were homeless

861
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,725
and this is how you pay us back for
feeding, clothing and educating you?

862
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,227
Did they eat for free?

863
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,896
Her mom did the washing
and cleaning since I was three!

864
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,981
Do you know how much trouble you caused?

865
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,400
How dare you lust after my son?

866
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,371
Why did you hit her?

867
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,249
What gives you the right to do that?

868
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,084
-Yeong-jae.
-Since I was seven,

869
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,587
I've studied every single day
without a day off.

870
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,131
Even if I got sick, hurt, or passed out,

871
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,717
you forced me to take classes until 2 a.m.

872
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,887
You said I didn't deserve to eat
if I didn't get the best grades.

873
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,474
Didn't you tell me to get out
and die if my grades dropped?

874
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,017
It was a living hell for me!

875
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,312
I couldn't have survived
if it weren't for Ga-eul.

876
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,568
You got into SNU
because you studied that hard.

877
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,778
Do you think I wanted to
push you like that?

878
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,781
-I did it so you'd succeed--
-So I'd succeed?

879
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,951
You did that for my sake?

880
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,124
I guess you haven't read it.

881
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,168
I left it unlocked so you would.

882
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,422
-You unlocked what?
-Go home and read it.

883
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,258
I wrote it all down
on the tablet PC in my desk drawer.

884
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:03,138
No. We're done talking.
You're coming home with me.

885
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,890
I got into SNU Medical School for you!

886
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,600
That was your dream.

887
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,979
I'm going to live my own life now.

888
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,440
The life I want to live.

889
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,027
So what are you saying?

890
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,363
You're going to live in
the middle of nowhere with her?

891
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,324
Is this what you want?

892
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,700
I'm going to think about

893
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,703
how I'll live and what I'll do
from now on.

894
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,122
What's clear is...

895
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,419
You and Dad wanted me
to go to medical school.

896
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,254
That's not what I wanted.

897
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,590
What's even clearer

898
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,053
is that I don't want to be
your son anymore.

899
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,099
What?

900
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,560
What did you say?

901
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,482
Hey.

902
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,237
Are you saying

903
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:05,116
you'll cut ties with your family?
You really mean that?

904
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,202
That's why I stayed for 19 years.

905
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,371
Whether you disciplined me
or reared me like cattle,

906
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,872
you did look after me.

907
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,165
But...

908
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,418
I don't want to live in hell anymore.

909
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,838
My life as your son

910
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,633
was a living hell for me.

911
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,597
Leave.

912
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,683
Leave

913
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,977
and don't ever come here again.

914
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,374
Yeong-jae.

915
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,048
Yeong-jae.

916
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:09,014
I didn't know he remembered
that I grew up in Sinan.

917
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,933
If he wants to leave, I won't stop him.

918
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,227
So don't worry.

919
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,067
Yeong-jae...

920
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,237
Where is he?

921
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,000
Yeong-jae.

922
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,211
Yeong-jae.

923
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:41,963
Yeong-jae.

924
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,467
Yeong-jae.

925
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,514
Yeong-jae!

926
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,558
Yeong-jae!

927
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,102
Yeong-jae.

928
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,187
Yeong-jae.

929
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,355
Yeong-jae.

930
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,482
Yeong-jae.

931
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:02,942
Yeong-jae.

932
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,027
Yeong-jae.

933
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:05,987
Yeong-jae...

934
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:14,704
Over here.

935
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,128
Yeong-jae...

936
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,632
Yeong-jae.

937
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,301
Yeong-jae.

938
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,971
Yeong-jae.

939
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,474
Yeong-jae.

940
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,270
Yeong-jae...

941
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,647
Yeong-jae...

942
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,950
Everything's ruined.

943
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,536
Both you and I

944
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,081
have wasted our lives.

945
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,316
Hello?

946
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,235
Yeong-jae...

947
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,654
Please let me speak to my son,
Park Yeong-jae.

948
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,990
Put Yeong-jae on the phone.
He must be with that bitch, Ga-eul.

949
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,743
They both quit.

950
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,037
They left the island yesterday evening.

951
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,622
They left?

952
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,874
To where? Where did they go?

953
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,709
How would I know?

954
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,753
What does this crazy woman want
at this hour?

955
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,306
I don't want to live in hell anymore.

956
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,017
My life as your son

957
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,354
was a living hell for me.

958
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,940
LOVE ONE ANOTHER. AS I HAVE LOVED YOU,

959
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,526
SO YOU MUST LOVE ONE ANOTHER.
JOHN 13:34

960
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,436
AUGUST 29: YOU SHOULD'VE JUST KILLED ME.

961
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,246
Ms. Han.

962
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,082
What brings you here at this hour?

963
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:16,000
Mr. Jo, we did our best for our client.

964
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,376
We're college admission experts.

965
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,420
It's not our job
to teach or guide students.

966
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,798
We mustn't delude ourselves
into thinking that we are teachers.

967
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,883
I have to get the highest grade, Mom.

968
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,761
You trust me, right? I wouldn't fire
Coach Kim for no reason.

969
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,721
You don't know why the family
that used to live

970
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,139
at your place moved out, right?

971
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,726
Can you tell me about the people
who used to live at my place?

972
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:37,355
The moms here are very competitive
when it comes to education.

973
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,315
Is this what the kids really want?

974
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,441
I don't understand a thing.

975
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,276
Stop nagging.

976
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,196
Do you get what you've stirred up here?

977
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,950
