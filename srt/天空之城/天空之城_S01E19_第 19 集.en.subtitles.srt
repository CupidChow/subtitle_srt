1
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,517
It contains Shin A High School's
midterm exam papers.

2
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,899
Once again,

3
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,528
Ye-seo will get perfect scores
in all subjects.

4
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,122
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL MIDTERM EXAM PAPERS

5
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:25,084
UNAUTHORIZED OPENING OF THIS ENVELOPE
WILL LEAD TO CRIMINAL CHARGES

6
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,471
Who is involved at Shin A High School?

7
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,640
Who's helping us?

8
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,769
My daughter's future depends on this.

9
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,479
I need to know who else is involved.

10
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,191
You know that nothing good
will come out of keeping it from me.

11
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,244
The one person who wouldn't be afraid

12
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,831
of getting fired
among all faculty members.

13
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,126
Who do you think it is?

14
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,050
It must be the school board
chairman's nephew, Mr. Oh.

15
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
I see.

16
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,267
I'll get going, then.

17
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,270
Please pick up Ye-seo starting tomorrow.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,563
No problem, Ms. Han.

19
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,670
This will make sure

20
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,131
she can get into SNU's med school
without any issues.

21
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,799
Without any problems.

22
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,345
Please.

23
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,683
Please help my son, my U-ju.

24
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,312
I beg of you. I'm on my knees pleading.

25
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,398
Please. Please save U-ju.

26
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,400
Save my son.

27
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,819
I was really nasty to her.

28
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,446
I guess

29
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,075
I'm being punished for being
such a bad son.

30
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,579
We just have to get through
this one semester.

31
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,915
Even if I need to repent
or beg for forgiveness,

32
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,334
it can wait until Ye-seo gets accepted

33
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,085
to SNU's med school.

34
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,329
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL MIDTERM EXAM PAPERS

35
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,748
Everything will get better.

36
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,167
Time solves everything.

37
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,670
Everything will get better with time.

38
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,259
It is a pity that she had
to die at such a young age.

39
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,512
He didn't even recognize his own daughter

40
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,597
for an entire year
when she was right there all along.

41
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,934
So it's only natural that someone as kind

42
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,478
as Jun-sang would want to let go
of everything including his job.

43
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,733
You need to stand strong
at times like this.

44
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,070
Don't get emotional

45
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,240
and only focus on Ye-seo's future.

46
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,160
Once Ye-seo gets into SNU's med school,

47
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,788
I'm sure Jun-sang
will eventually come around.

48
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,417
Okay, Mother.

49
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,420
Yes,

50
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,380
she's right.

51
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,759
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL
SENIOR MIDTERM EXAM PAPERS

52
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,054
Think about U-ju's life.

53
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,931
Do you think Ye-seo will be able

54
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,350
to live happily after ruining U-ju's life
if she manages

55
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,394
to get into SNU's med school?

56
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,484
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,697
If you and Ye-seo disclose

58
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,742
the exam paper leak yourselves
and beg for forgiveness,

59
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,285
Ye-seo won't be criticized

60
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,288
even if her name gets exposed
all over the Internet.

61
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,540
She won't get criticized?

62
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,253
What does he know?
All he ever did was study.

63
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,173
He was always successful
in everything he did thanks to his mom.

64
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,387
Did you guys hear the news?

65
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,183
Ye-seo's mother's real name
is apparently Kwak Mi-hyang.

66
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,605
I mean, she even hid her identity
from everyone.

67
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,274
So she's more than capable
of fabricating Ye-seo's grades.

68
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,442
Do you think Ye-seo...

69
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,361
started stealing exam papers
ever since she was a freshman?

70
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,531
Of course. I'm pretty sure
this wasn't the only time.

71
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,534
But she must have some conscience
seeing that she came clean.

72
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,119
What are you talking about?

73
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,497
She only came clean
because she knew she'd get caught.

74
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,083
Do you think a nasty person like her
would have any conscience?

75
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,002
There's no way.

76
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,253
She's right.

77
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,463
It's just like the saying,

78
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,423
"The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree."

79
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,258
Ye-seo got full marks by cheating,

80
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,178
but do you remember
how much of a show-off she was?

81
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,181
-Seriously.
-She's a bad seed.

82
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,059
Anyway, Ye-seo's future is all ruined now.

83
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,685
This will haunt her
for the rest of her life.

84
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,978
She deserves that.

85
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,314
She shouldn't be allowed
to take on an important role in society.

86
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,192
Unethical people like her
don't deserve a second chance.

87
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,237
I'm going to expose what she did
until the end of time.

88
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,739
I'm going to make sure
her life gets ruined.

89
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,451
Why should that happen to Ye-seo?

90
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,538
She's studied so hard
ever since she was four years old.

91
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,289
Why would I ruin that?

92
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,749
She did nothing wrong.

93
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,803
Where in the world are you?

94
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,972
Come home immediately!

95
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,849
Professor Cha.

96
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,188
As for this case, the assault
caused an obstruction of business.

97
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,774
Then will it get absorbed
into his crime of obstruction of business?

98
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,986
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,904
Obstruction of business and assault

100
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,323
have different characteristics,
benefit and protection of the law.

101
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,118
Besides, this wasn't even a minor assault.
So how would it fall under that?

102
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,537
Did you not study the absorption law?

103
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,247
You should know better as a sophomore.

104
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,292
How is it possible that you don't
even know something so basic?

105
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,641
That is all for today.

106
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,823
HUSBAND

107
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,368
CONSENSUAL DIVORCE INTENTION CONFIRMATION

108
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,875
Don't hang up,
and listen to what I have to say.

109
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,922
Where are you?

110
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,133
The midterms are just around the corner.
Where are they now? They're seniors...

111
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,229
I'm really not going to forgive you
if you hang up again.

112
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,608
You're not at our apartment.

113
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,485
And you're not even
at your mother's house. Where...

114
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,992
Mom, just don't pick up.

115
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,369
Or turn it off.

116
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,538
He will get so angry
that he might end up getting sick.

117
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,706
I need to leave a way
to communicate with him.

118
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,874
Communicate?

119
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,001
By sending divorce papers
to him every day?

120
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,338
I'm sending them again
because I know he'll just rip them apart.

121
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,216
And I'm answering his calls to see

122
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,302
if your dad's willing
to accept my conditions.

123
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,598
Do you think he'll accept them?

124
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,601
He will never accept
and he won't let you divorce him either.

125
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,438
I'll have to make him
choose between the two.

126
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,566
If I lose this fight,

127
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,901
you and your brothers
will end up fighting him.

128
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,322
And that will destroy your relationship
with your dad for good.

129
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,366
And that's why

130
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,410
I should take care of it
before that happens.

131
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,537
But Mom...

132
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,582
If Dad doesn't give up until the very end,

133
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,542
are you really going to divorce him?

134
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,920
Yes, I will.

135
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,424
I'm willing to go that far
to protect you guys.

136
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,350
TO CHA MIN-HYEOK

137
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,520
FROM NOH SEUNG-HYE

138
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,369
Yes?

139
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm warning you.
If you hang up one more time...

140
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,856
Are you worried that Ye-seo's mom
might change her mind?

141
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,860
Women who have children
are the most selfish people on earth.

142
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,695
That also makes them

143
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,198
the easiest people to control.

144
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,955
Jung-min's mother, Yeong-jae's mother,
and Ye-seo's mother.

145
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,290
Those women...

146
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,711
use their kids to fulfill their greed.

147
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,506
They can act all high and noble,

148
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,133
but to me, they're nothing.

149
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,597
Is everything going well with Min-joon?

150
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,890
Yes.

151
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,896
Ye-seo...

152
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,525
wouldn't have found out anything
if it weren't for Hye-na.

153
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,821
But Hye-na ended up

154
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,240
becoming the bomb.

155
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,218
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL MIDTERM EXAM PAPERS

156
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,007
U-JU'S MOM

157
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,689
Who's here?

158
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,984
It's U-ju's mother. What should I do?

159
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,821
You can let her in.

160
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,656
Please bring us some tea as well.

161
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,087
Mi-hyang.

162
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,342
We used to be in the same class...

163
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,386
when we were high school sophomores.

164
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,555
And that year on my birthday,

165
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,392
you came over to my house,
and we watched a movie together.

166
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,103
Do you remember what it was?

167
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,191
Dead Poets Society.

168
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,694
That day, we made a promise.

169
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,572
Just like what Mr. Keating said,

170
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,158
we promised we won't let
society's standards control us.

171
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,452
To be free...

172
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,163
and dignified.

173
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,082
Are we...

174
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,211
living as we promised?

175
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,008
Are we being dignified?

176
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,060
You know...

177
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,938
that my U-ju's not guilty.

178
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,191
That it was Kim Ju-yeong
who killed Hye-na.

179
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,371
You feel tortured too, right?

180
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,999
Do you think...

181
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,961
the pain will end
when Ye-seo gets into SNU?

182
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:41,380
Not at all.

183
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,382
That's when it'll begin.

184
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,217
All she wants...

185
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,012
is to ruin you and Ye-seo.

186
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,057
Think about it.

187
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,226
Jung-min and Yeong-jae.

188
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,022
They were both destroyed
as soon as they got accepted to SNU.

189
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,941
That woman wants

190
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,320
to ruin kids
and tear apart their families.

191
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,575
You know that. You can guess that much.

192
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,830
The pain that she's responsible
for ruining her genius daughter's life.

193
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,792
She's dragging you
right into the same misery.

194
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,923
The door to that hell will open
once Ye-seo gets accepted.

195
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,799
There's no getting out then.

196
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,927
Please.

197
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,015
I'm sorry. Please leave.

198
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,809
End it before it's too late.

199
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,104
Ending it now...

200
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,190
will save you,

201
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,318
Ye-seo,

202
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,321
as well as U-ju.

203
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,932
-Did you skip your lesson?
-Yes.

204
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,894
-What are you saying?
-Why should I go?

205
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,357
-What?
-Why bother to study?

206
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,818
I can just get full marks
by stealing exam papers.

207
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,113
-Ye-bin.
-You are

208
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,864
worse than Ye-seo.

209
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,825
I'm so disappointed.

210
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,058
My goodness.

211
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,893
Oh, dear, Su-im!

212
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,021
Su-im, what's wrong? Are you sick?

213
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,484
I'm not.

214
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,153
I'm fine.

215
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,697
I was on my way to see you.

216
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,908
To give you the signed petition.

217
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,204
Really?

218
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,914
Hang on.

219
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,541
Get on my back.

220
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,752
No, no. I'm okay.

221
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,378
Then lean on me.

222
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,216
Oh, dear.

223
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,259
Thank you.

224
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,348
Su-im.

225
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,392
About Seo-jin.

226
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,063
She knows something, doesn't she?

227
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,235
Do you think she knows

228
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,278
who really killed Hye-na?

229
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,989
The truth is,

230
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,367
I think so too.

231
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,993
You think so too? Right?

232
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,662
I knew it.

233
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,039
Your husband glared at her for a reason.

234
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,415
Then,

235
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,001
she knows who did it,
and yet she's keeping quiet?

236
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,504
Knowing what innocent U-ju
is going through?

237
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,093
She must feel terrible that she's not...

238
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,638
able to speak up.

239
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:00,889
But

240
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,933
why is she keeping quiet?

241
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,311
If she knows the culprit,
she should say so and get U-ju out.

242
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,480
Why is she keeping her mouth shut?

243
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,898
Why?

244
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,902
She's a mom herself.

245
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,195
U-ju's a senior.

246
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,990
That smart boy is held in a cell.

247
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,118
This is so infuriating.

248
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,412
Why is she keeping quiet?

249
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,290
I wonder myself.

250
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,959
For Ye-seo,
it's just university admission.

251
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,211
For my U-ju,

252
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,090
his life can be completely ruined.

253
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,634
I really...

254
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,598
-I feel so resentful.
-Hang on.

255
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,809
Ye-seo's university admission is at stake?

256
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,690
Could it be Ye-seo's coordinator?

257
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,278
So you are saying

258
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,155
that Ye-seo's coordinator

259
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,948
killed Hye-na?

260
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,995
And Dr. Kang's wife knows that
and is keeping

261
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,705
her mouth shut. Is that it?

262
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,624
She needs Ye-seo to get into SNU,

263
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,292
and that's just one semester away.

264
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,793
If her coordinator goes to prison,

265
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,420
she'll be ruined.

266
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,256
That's why she's keeping her mouth shut.

267
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,510
No way.

268
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,263
Would you do that?

269
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,473
Are you crazy?

270
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,934
How could I entrust a murderer
with my precious son?

271
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,185
Of course.

272
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,146
Even if she wants her kid
to get into SNU's med school,

273
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,608
would she coddle a murderer
when innocent U-ju's in a cell?

274
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,401
This won't do.

275
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,655
I'll take Mi-hyang by the hair
and drag her to the police.

276
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,031
This is just...

277
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,824
Darling.

278
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,831
Mom.

279
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,541
What?

280
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,338
Can I join you for just one minute?

281
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,799
You came here to lie beside your mom?

282
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,759
Get under the covers.

283
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,135
But...

284
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,470
-Come here.
-You're all grown up.

285
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,763
Hey!

286
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,432
You cheeky little thing.

287
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,810
You take after me in this way too.

288
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,690
I cared for no one but my mom
until I was 20.

289
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,569
My sweet little baby.

290
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,446
My good boy.

291
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,243
When he's a high school senior,

292
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,911
will I lose my mind too?

293
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,706
-Lose your mind?
-Like Ye-seo's mom.

294
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,125
She did tell a huge lie,

295
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,835
but she's shrewd and smart.

296
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,504
She was my role model.

297
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,131
Does that make sense now?

298
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,969
She's gone crazy.

299
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,821
Why should I go?

300
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,489
Why bother to study?

301
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,742
I can just get full marks
by stealing exam papers.

302
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,246
You feel tortured too, right?

303
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:12,998
Do you think

304
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,625
the pain will end
when Ye-seo gets into SNU?

305
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,712
Not at all. That's when it'll begin.

306
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,422
All she wants...

307
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,632
is to ruin you and Ye-seo.

308
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,264
Even if the same kind of tragedy
befalls your family,

309
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,184
will you accept it?

310
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,731
I'm asking if you are willing
to put up with everything.

311
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,778
I'm suggesting an alternative, Ms. Han.

312
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,613
Have Hye-na move into your place.

313
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,576
What if Ye-seo also...

314
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,880
When their parents were at their happiest,

315
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,882
they crushed it in one go.

316
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,426
Because that is true revenge.

317
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,745
Ye-seo.

318
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,497
My gosh.

319
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,333
What happened?

320
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,586
Gosh!

321
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,016
Ye-seo, are you okay? Are you hurt?

322
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,310
Mom.

323
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,730
Yes, what happened?

324
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,068
I heard warm milk helps you fall asleep.

325
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,613
You've been up until now?

326
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,407
It's 3 a.m.

327
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,704
I know that I should sleep,

328
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,333
but I can't because the sound
of my heartbeat is too loud.

329
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,253
I feel like my eardrums
are about to explode.

330
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,798
What should I do, Mom?

331
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,634
What if I can't sleep
for the rest of my life?

332
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,513
Gosh...

333
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,433
I'm afraid I might die at this rate.

334
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,312
My gosh, Ye-seo.

335
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,012
Ye-seo.

336
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,974
Can we talk for a minute?

337
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,704
You see,

338
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,082
I thought hard about it all night.

339
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,711
I want you...

340
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,006
to eat and sleep well.

341
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,092
Nothing's more important
than you having peace of mind.

342
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,096
Mom.

343
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,808
U-ju...

344
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,443
Right?

345
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,404
We shouldn't leave him like that, right?

346
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,077
And the fact that
Coach Kim killed Hye-na...

347
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,414
shouldn't be kept a secret anymore.

348
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,091
Ye-seo.

349
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,513
In order to expose the truth
about what happened,

350
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,019
we'll have no choice but
to also disclose the exam paper leak.

351
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,774
If that happens, people might deny

352
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,068
all your hard work over the years.

353
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,320
Some may

354
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,990
suspect that's how you've been able to get
such good grades in all these years.

355
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,660
No matter how many times
you say it's not true,

356
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,871
they may not believe you.

357
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,880
My beautiful daughter.

358
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,759
Will you be able to endure it?

359
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,940
Don't worry, Mom.

360
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,944
I'll prove to them all
what I can do on my own.

361
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,534
If the truth is revealed,

362
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,788
you'll either be expelled
or encouraged to leave school.

363
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,249
If that happens,

364
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,710
you'll have to give up
on the special admission category...

365
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,632
as well as taking
the entrance exam this year.

366
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,679
It's all my fault.

367
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,765
My greed got you in this mess.

368
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,353
If I had never insisted
on hiring an admission coordinator...

369
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,607
I'm really sorry, Ye-seo.

370
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,317
It's all my fault.

371
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,946
No, Mom. It's all my fault.

372
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,408
When you said we should fire Coach Kim,

373
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,119
I should've listened to you.

374
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:14,002
Gosh, my daughter. I love you, Ye-seo.

375
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,255
Ye-seo, I love you.

376
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,176
I love you so much,
my dear daughter, Ye-seo.

377
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,386
Ye-seo.

378
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,224
I love you too, Mom.

379
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,270
I know.

380
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,440
I love you so much, my daughter.

381
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,836

4 CO-RECIPIENTS OF NOBEL PRIZE

385
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,099
A KAIST PROFESSOR, SONG HEE-JU

386
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,814
It's because of Song Hee-ju, isn't it?

387
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,858
You got upset because she became
the youngest professor.

388
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,736
So you're using K
to overcome your own insecurities!

389
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,094
Ms. Kim,

390
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,971
are you all right?

391
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,184
Someone from my university

392
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,854
received the Fields Medal.

393
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,108
I was the top student in my department.

394
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,277
The Fields Medal?

395
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,779
You mean, the Nobel Prize of Mathematics?

396
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,864
If I had...

397
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,866
lived like Hee-ju,

398
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,159
would I still have been treated like that?

399
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,371
Shut up.

400
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,470
Ms. Kim.

401
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,891
May I be frank with you?

402
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,355
It's not like doing that
to Jung-min, Yeong-jae, and Ye-seo...

403
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,234
will make you feel better.

404
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,864
What did you just say?

405
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,074
I'm sorry.

406
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,915
Jung-min's, Yeong-jae's
and Ye-seo's families...

407
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,877
all wanted them to become
third-generation doctors.

408
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,045
Why?

409
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,339
Why is it that
only they can have everything

410
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,758
from power to wealth for generations?

411
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,220
They paid me a fortune to get their kids

412
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,807
into SNU's med school no matter what,
even if I had to use illegal means.

413
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,808
Why?

414
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,895
Why?

415
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,397
Why?

416
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,442
Why must I...

417
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,613
further solidify their castles?

418
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,744
Even when my daughter, K,

419
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,955
and I are in this mess?

420

HANG IN THERE, U-JU!

423
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,456
EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.
DON'T BE SCARED, AND DON'T CRY.

424
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,558
I'm sorry, U-ju.

425
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,645
I'm just really, really sorry.

426
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,648
I wish you nothing but happiness.

427
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,586
Ye-seo, what are you doing?

428
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,921
Ye-seo, where are you going?

429
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,423
I'm skipping class.

Dad, the stars are shining.

00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,043
That's where Little Prince lives, right?

439
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,296
It's planet B612.

440
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,463
Let me see.

441
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,342
Yes, you're right. K, look carefully.

442
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,928
Can you also see Baobab trees and roses?

443
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,430
Yes, I can see them.

444
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,225
Dad, I also want to plant something I like

445
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,477
on planet B612

446
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,771
-just like Little Prince did.
-Really?

447
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,024
What do you want to plant there?

448
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,612
Yellow. That's my favorite color.

449
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,364
So I want to plant the color yellow there.

450
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,325
That's incredible.

451
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,870
Honey.

452
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,215
You did a good thing, honey.

453
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,842
Ye-seo called...

454
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,803
and told me

455
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,221
to come and see you.

456
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,474
It's okay.

457
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,311
Our daughter...

458
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,981
will do well.

459
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,778
You did well.

460
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,279
Good job.

461
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,295
I'm sorry.

462
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,133
You went through so much until now.

463
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,301
I'll also

464
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,886
become...

465
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,892
a better dad too.

466
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,396
Honey.

467
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:42,458
Let's go in.

468
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,545
This is Kim Ju-yeong's office, right?

469
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,922
-Get out of the way.
-Wait.

470
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,216
-You can't come in here.
-Go straight to her office!

471
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,842
-Detective Park, come here.
-Yes, sir.

472
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,302
-What's going on?
-Get a move on.

473
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,889
We'll be taking every single thing
that's in here.

474
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,890
Pack everything.

475
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,017
I'm Detective Choi Dong-seok
from Gangnam Police Station.

476
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,644
Where's Kim Ju-yeong?

477
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,063
Make sure you take everything
that's in her office.

478
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,065
-Detective Ko, get inside.
-Yes, sir.

479
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,160
Ms. Kim, the cops are carrying out
a seize and search in your office.

480
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,704
-What?
-Ms. Han must have

481
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,872
reported you to the cops.

482
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,290
You should turn off your phone.

483
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,251
I'll take you somewhere safe.

484
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,314
Mr. Jo, stop the car.

485
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,825
Ms. Kim.

486
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,244
Wire severance pay to all the teachers.

487
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,371
To yourself as well.

488
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,041
That is your last task.

489
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,377
Ms. Kim.

490
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,435
Ms. Kim.

491
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,981
Thanks for everything.

492
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,527
Ms. Kim.

493
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,949
Get in.

494
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,909
I'll take you back.

495
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,755
Tae-jun.

496
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,883
Go on your way.

497
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,303
You'll be an accomplice to a murder
if you're caught.

498
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,140
I don't want to bear

499
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,684
the guilt of ruining your life.

500
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,687
Please don't feel guilty.

501
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,106
I chose this life.

502
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,153
If it hadn't been for you,

503
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,447
I'd still be high on drugs,

504
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,325
wandering Fairfax at night.

505
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,389
PETITION

506
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,437
Yes. I'll come to your office right now

507
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,230
with the signed petition.

508
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,023
Yes.

509
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,485
Did you find
the guest house's security guard?

510
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,655
I see.

511
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,033
Okay. See you soon.

512
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,079
They still didn't find him?

513
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,965
I feel like hiring someone

514
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,968
to beat Ye-seo's coordinator to a pulp.

515
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,721
To make her confess at least.

516
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,019
I know in my heart who's guilty,

517
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,689
but not being able to do anything
makes me feel...

518
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,193
It's just so infuriating.

519
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,421
Hey, Mi-hyang.

520
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:44,259
I was just at the police station.

521
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,512
I told them everything.

522
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,722
That Kim Ju-yeong killed Hye-na,

523
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,391
and that U-ju's innocent.

524
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,313
I handed over all the evidence that I had.

525
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,361
Oh, my god.

526
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,738
Thank god.

527
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,704
Why? What is it?

528
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,708
Thank you.

529
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,127
Thank you so much.

530
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,631
I knew that one day...

531
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,218
you would tell the truth.

532
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,597
Yes, of course.

533
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,641
Let's talk later.

534
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,229
Thank you so much.

535
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,653
Honey.

536
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,992
Honey.

537
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,285
Seo-jin...

538
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,246
went and talked to the police
about everything.

539
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,291
Our U-ju...

540
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,711
will be released.

541
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,392
Thank you. Thank you so much.

542
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,219
MIDTERM EXAM
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL

543
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:17,222
Will you at least tell us
what this is about?

544
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,599
I don't know who told you and what,

545
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,351
but I did nothing wrong!

546
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,644
You're under arrest.

547
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,604
-You have the right to an attorney,
-The rest of you

548
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,273
-can go back to work.
-and to remain silent.

549
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,274
What are you doing?

550
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,401
-You can defend yourself at the station.
-Be quiet.

551
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,737
-I did nothing wrong!
-Tell us that later.

552
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,113
-Listen!
-Check the garbage can.

553
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,865
This doesn't make sense!

554
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,908
Say something, will you?

555
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,494
-I didn't do anything wrong!
-Keep quiet and walk.

556
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,748
Wait and see what happens
when everything comes out.

557
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,873
K.

558
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,850
Mom...

559
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,605
Mom!

560
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,441
Mom!

561
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,777
Mom, I was studying.

562
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,446
I was studying.

563
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,114
Aren't I a good girl?

564
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,782
I'm a good girl, right?

565
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,703
My daughter.

566
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,122
You're a good girl.

567
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,845
Are you trying to kill her?

568
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,555
You're killing her!

569
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,848
Stop it immediately.

570
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,808
She's struggling to adjust!

571
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,104
Leave her alone. You stay out of it!

572
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,483
You stressed her out so much
that she developed a panic disorder!

573
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,818
Competing against a bunch of white kids
who are ten years older

574
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,320
than her must be so stressful for her!

575
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,030
She needs to adjust!

576
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,240
She just has to get through this.

577
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,784
It's been all over TV and newspapers

578
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,661
that she's the youngest person
to get into college.

579
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,620
You want us to stop now?

580
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,288
I can't stop now. Never.

581
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,458
If we stop now,
everything will go down the drain.

582
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,835
What are you thinking?

583
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,088
-Why are you doing this?
-You stay out of this.

584
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,006
Stay out of it, please!

585
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:21,925
Please...

586
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,593
Please mind your own business!

587
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,971
It's because

588
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,181
of Song Hee-ju, isn't it?

589
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,643
You got upset because she became
the youngest professor.

590
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,521
So you're using K
to overcome your own insecurities!

591
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,444
Think however you want.

592
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,488
I can't watch K suffer like this.

593
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,408
I want a divorce right away.
Let's get a divorce!

594
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,867
All right.

595
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,828
Fine.

596
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,705
Let's get a divorce.

597
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,958
But I can never let you
take K away from me.

598
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,086
She's my daughter. She is my child!

599
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,474
Mom.

600
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,977
Don't cry, Mom.

601
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,855
Mom, don't cry.

602
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,191
I'll study. I'm going to study.

603
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,570
I'll study!

604
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,905
I'll study.

605
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,719
Mom.

606
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,142
Mom, don't cry!

607
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,024
If X is...

608
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,870
I'll study. I'm studying.

609
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,125
Stop, that's enough.
You don't have to study, K.

610
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,712
Stop. You don't have to do this.

611
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:32,138
Please don't cry, Mom...

612
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,018
Mom.

613
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,856
Mom, are you...

614
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,734
also having a hard time?

615
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,779
I will...

616
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,449
do better.

617
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,631
I'm...

618
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,134
I'm sorry.

619
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,971
I'm sorry.

620
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,601
I'm sorry. I have you here with me...

621
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,321
It's curry!

622
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,700
Hey, K.

623
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,618
K, no. K!

624
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,579
No, don't.

625
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,706
Don't eat it. No, K.

626
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,251
K! I told you not to eat it!

627
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,134
U-ju.

628
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:17,595
U-ju!

629
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,472
-U-ju.
-Mom.

630
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,577
It must have been so hard.

631
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,162
You got through it.

632
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,212
Dad.

633
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:08,896
Dad.

634
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,614
Dad.

635
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,992
Yes.

636
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,721
-Honey.
-Yes.

637
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,014
I heard U-ju is home now.

638
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,642
Really?

639
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,562
I can go alone.

640
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,732
It's all my fault anyway.
You don't have to come.

641
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,443
No.

642
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,153
Let's go together.

643
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,115
I'm also responsible.

644
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,509
-That was a great meal.
-You should eat more.

645
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,928
You must eat well
and recover your health first.

646
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,263
I made a huge pot of this.

647
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,183
-Have a little more, okay?
-Yes, you should eat more.

648
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,019
Mom, I'm full.

649
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,230
I ate well even in there.

650
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,565
Did you? I'm glad you did.

651
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,318
I told you to try to bulk up.

652
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,028
Do you have some muscles now?

653
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:42,907
Take a look.

654
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,991
Don't they look rock-hard?

655
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,284
Can I touch them?

656
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,120
My gosh, they really are.

657
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,789
Don't do that. What's with you?

658
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,254
Honey.

659
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,842
All right. Don't worry. Just let them in.

660
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,974
Who is it, Dad?

661
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,810
Ye-seo's mom and dad.

662
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,312
They heard you're back
and wanted to come by.

663
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,154
Son, just do whatever feels right for you.

664
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,613
Do what your heart tells you.

665
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:23,948
You shouldn't...

666
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,744
force yourself to forgive them.

667
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,209
Come on in.

668
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,628
Welcome, Dr. Kang.

669
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:40,715
Where's U-ju?

670
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,760
Come in first. I'll go bring him.

671
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,958
Have a seat.

672
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,002
Please sit.

673
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,177
I'm sorry, U-ju.

674
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,348
It's all my fault.

675
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,476
I know I did something
that can't be forgiven.

676
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,730
I knew what you were going through,

677
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,733
and still couldn't say anything...

678
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,444
because of Ye-seo.

679
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,826
Because of the exam papers
that woman, Kim Ju-yeong, stole,

680
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:51,953
Ye-seo...

681
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,998
was able to get full marks on the exam.

682
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,127
Hye-na found out

683
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,004
about the exam paper leak,

684
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,844
so Kim Ju-yeong...

685
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,765
killed Hye-na.

686
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,314
Both Ye-seo and I

687
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,150
had no idea that she had stolen

688
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:24,944
the exam papers.

689
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,738
Even though I knew
you weren't the culprit,

690
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:30,157
disclosing the truth...

691
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,745
meant that Ye-seo might end up
with zero marks and get expelled,

692
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,164
so I...

693
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,792
I should've known better.
I must have lost my mind.

694
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:42,962
U-ju.

695
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,382
We're really sorry.

696
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:49,760
What we did

697
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,512
can't be forgiven.

698
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,057
To the two of you as well...

699
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,771
We sincerely apologize.

700
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,942
We're...

701
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:08,446
We're so sorry.

702
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,453
U-ju, I'm...

703
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,456
I'm sorry.

704
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,045
Do I have to forgive you?

705
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,469
Why should I forgive you?

706
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,975
Even when I was devastated
by being falsely accused and locked up,

707
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,940
I stayed strong thinking about
what had happened to Hye-na.

708
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,110
And she died
because of an exam paper leak?

709
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,825
This isn't a fair competition.

710
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,328
I can't accept this.

711
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,963
That's why she said it was unfair.

712
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,840
Because she knew
about the exam paper leak.

713
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,928
Why did she have to die
for not succumbing to unfairness?

714
01:06:18,015 --> 01:06:19,100
I think Hye-na...

715
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:23,229
tried to use it to threaten
Kim Ju-yeong to make sure

716
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:24,939
Ye-seo doesn't get into SNU's med school.

717
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:26,857
I don't care what she used
or if she threatened her.

718
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,113
Hye-na died because of an exam
that was unfair.

719
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,330
Why did she have to die? Why?

720
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,097
Ms. Han.

721
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,184
Have you apologized to Hye-na?

722
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,482
Did you beg her for forgiveness?

723
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,728
Guys! U-ju got released!

724
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,438
-Seriously?
-Yes!

725
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,405
Gosh, you.

726
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,199
How did he get out?

727
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:02,953
What's wrong?

728
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,957
Meet me in front of the school gate
after class.

729
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,000
Darn it.

730
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,269
Cha Seo-jun, Cha Gi-jun!

731
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:37,696
Come with me.

732
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,497
Come on!

733
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,753
This gukbap restaurant
has been around for 60 years.

734
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,883
Back when I was studying for the bar exam,

735
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,844
a bowl of this was enough
to get me through a week.

736
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,471
I could study all night after eating this.

737
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,435
Isn't it good?

738
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,650
Eat up, will you?

739
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,833
Yes, this place is...

740
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,544
Oh, I forgot to put in some pepper.

741
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,048
Is it because I haven't had it
in a long time?

742
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,092
Why is this exceptionally good today?

743
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,511
All right, there.

744
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,825
My gosh, that was such a good meal.

745
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,247
I've been living on instant noodles,
so this was...

746
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,544
Why aren't you boys eating?

747
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,503
Well,

748
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:18,422
we had a heavy lunch.

749
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,798
What is this about?

750
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:25,721
You two are in your senior year.

751
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,769
I'm really sorry that I can't provide you

752
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,396
with an ideal environment for you to study

753
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,191
due to the problems
between your mom and me.

754
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:41,195
However,

755
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,532
how could you act up as well
just because your mom's being like that?

756
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,117
You just go with your mom like that?

757
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,828
I was fuming initially,

758
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,790
but I'll let it slide
since you two are in your senior year.

759
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,084
Move back in immediately.

760
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,253
Your mom will follow you guys
if you two move back in.

761
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:00,339
Dad.

762
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,549
We're really sorry,

763
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,718
but we're not moving back in.

764
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:13,727
Right.

765
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:17,439
I can't accept all
of your mom's conditions,

766
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,650
but I will do my best nonetheless.

767
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:22,236
I'll try to be less nosy
so that you won't be stressed out,

768
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:24,697
and I'll do my best not to nag you boys.

769
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,323
Like he said, we're not moving back in.

770
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:27,908
Shall I say it again?

771
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,495
We can't live with you, Dad.

772
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:33,122
We don't want to live with you.

773
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,419
Seo-jun.

774
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,048
Dad, I'm really sorry. But...

775
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,591
We're happy,

776
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,970
and we like living without you.

777
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:56,895
Mom's here. Let's go.

778
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:58,856
Enjoy your meal.

779
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:00,899
Take care.

780
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,043
Yesterday,

781
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,961
your mom and I

782
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,214
attended a student
disciplinary committee meeting.

783
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,635
Neither you nor your mom knew

784
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,263
the exam papers were leaked.

785
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:35,601
Your grades for the second semester
of your junior year will be zero

786
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,312
and you'll drop out of school.

787
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,025
Dad said

788
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,569
we should let you decide.

789
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:49,281
You weren't expelled,
so you can transfer to another school.

790
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,742
Then at least you'll be able
to graduate from high school.

791
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,956
I'll be at a huge disadvantage
if I get zero for a whole semester anyway.

792
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:02,336
Everyone will doubt my grades
for the other three semesters.

793
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,549
I'll just take...

794
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:09,676
the GED and

795
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,512
get into university next year.

796
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:18,394
Okay. It's best to get in
on your own hard work.

797
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:22,189
Let's not

798
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,899
rush things.

799
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,109
We'll do it slowly

800
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,652
and properly.

801
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:29,947
Okay?

802
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,247
Who could that be?

803
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,546
-Mother.
-What's this about?

804
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,589
Ye-seo dropped out of school?

805
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,383
She dropped out?

806
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:52,302
Come inside. I'll explain everything.

807
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:54,346
You lied about your background, degree,

808
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:55,681
and name.

809
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:59,351
Then you even lied to me that
you'd produce a third-generation doctor.

810
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,229
-Mother.
-You said you'd do it.

811
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:05,983
I'd given up already,
and you came and challenged me.

812
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,819
Didn't you say you could do it
if I gave you the money?

813
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,530
I wanted to give you
your third-generation doctor.

814
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,032
I wanted it just as much as you did.

815
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,243
But I was afraid it would ruin Ye-seo.

816
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,244
Why would it ruin her?

817
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,454
Why?

818
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:22,458
I told you Jun-sang will come around
if Ye-seo gets into SNU's med school.

819
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,585
-You ruined that?
-Mom.

820
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,129
Will you please stop it?

821
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:29,173
At least you should've kept a clear mind.

822
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,383
Getting Ye-seo into SNU's med school

823
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,260
was all I asked for.

824
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,054
That was the deal between you and me.

825
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,431
You couldn't even do that...

826
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,225
and turned your kid into this mess!

827
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,021
Didn't you hear what Jun-sang said?

828
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,315
He came first in the national exam

829
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:48,233
and entered the med school top
of his year,

830
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,777
but he told you his life
is nothing but an empty shell.

831
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,821
He said your life is a failure.

832
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,073
I was afraid I'd hear that too.

833
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,494
I stopped because I didn't want
my child's life to be an empty shell.

834
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,788
A third-generation doctor.

835
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,791
What good is it for?

836
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:07,836
What?

837
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,507
You fools.

838
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,510
Don't you know that?

839
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:16,678
You must go to med school.

840
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,556
You must get into
SNU's med school like your dad.

841
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,099
So I'm asking you why.

842
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,894
Why on earth is it a must?

843
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,854
I'm not like you.

844
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,314
We're of different looks and age.

845
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:29,816
Why should I think like you?

846
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:36,323
If you wanted it that much,
you should've gone to med school yourself.

847
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,329
I'll decide whether or not

848
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:43,747
I go to SNU's med school.

849
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,333
You have no say in the matter.

850
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:54,800
Mom.

851
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,051
Mom.

852
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,815
-Hwang U-ju!
-Hwang U-ju!

853
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,857
Hey!

854
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:12,943
Stop.

855
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,571
Are you okay?

856
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:16,697
-Hello.
-Hello.

857
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,948
Hey.

858
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:20,242
-You're back.
-It's so nice to see you.

859
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:22,160
-I'm okay.
-Let's see you.

860
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,996
-Let me see.
-I'm fine.

861
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,209
I'm so relieved.

862
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:31,128
I was so pleased when I heard the news.

863
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:33,839
Thank you.

864
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,133
It's thanks to your concern.

865
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,135
You managed so well.

866
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,600
-Don't.
-Be careful.

867
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,699
-Hey.
-It's fine.

868
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:27,726
I'm sorry.

869
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,695
Your parents came to apologize.

870
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:43,950
I was rude to them out of anger.

871
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,245
But I got out because they came forward.

872
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:51,792
You gave up...

873
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,836
something of yours to help me.

874
01:17:58,215 --> 01:17:59,216
Thank you.

875
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:07,808
I should've spoken up sooner.

876
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,230
You had a few tough months because of me.

877
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,614
Still, I've done some thinking
and realized a lot during that time.

878
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:26,576
Before, I just sat and studied
without thinking about anything else.

879
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:31,164
I thought life would work out
if I just did well in school.

880
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,418
Who I really am,

881
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:36,878
and how I should live.

882
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,214
I should think about those.

883
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,385
We only get one shot at life.

884
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:46,513
I can't let myself be spun around
like laundry in a washing machine.

885
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,103
I heard that...

886
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,731
you're dropping out.

887
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:00,610
You're strong. You'll do fine.

888
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,844
Like he said, we're not moving back in.

889
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,345
Shall I say it again?

890
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,183
We can't live with you, Dad.

891
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:32,684
We're happy,

892
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,104
and we like living without you.

893
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,647
Dad, you heard that, right?

894
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,692
You're the failure, not me.

895
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,110
I pity you the most, Dad.

896
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,946
You're a total failure.
You're at rock bottom. An epic failure.

897
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,728
Were you really going to destroy

898
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,690
Ye-seo and me?

899
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:06,403
Ms. Han.

900
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:11,449
Will you not regret this?

901
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:24,129
I'm asking if you're sure
you won't regret this,

902
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,171
Ms. Han.

903
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,226
I don't know

904
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,896
what drove you to ruin
all your students' families,

905
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,107
but did you really have to kill Hye-na?

906
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,066
Do you think...

907
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,154
you had nothing to do with her death?

908
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,562
Mom, Hye-na's acting strange.

909
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:25,440
She can't seem to wake up,
and she keeps saying weird things.

910
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:31,112
Mom.

911
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:33,782
Mom.

912
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,243
Mom.

913
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:40,789
Mom.

914
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:42,374
Mom.

915
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:49,631
Mom.

916
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:56,471
