1
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,756
Who do you think you are?

2
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,426
Who are you to stir up so much trouble?

3
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,261
You said you're against private education.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,347
Then why are you meddling in
what we do and causing trouble?

5
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,183
You keep talking down to me.

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,435
Should I do the same?

7
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,313
Fine, I will.

8
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,648
And let me give you a piece of advice.

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,358
Raise your daughter well.

10
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,819
What are you going to do
with that rude and selfish child?

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,615
How dare you... Shall I rip your jaw open?

12
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,619
Unbelievable?

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,163
How dare you... Shall I rip your jaw open?

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,543
Did you laugh?

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,587
Did you just laugh?

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,047
You...

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,132
It's you, isn't it?

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,096
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,681
What do you mean, "It's you"?

20
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,935
Forget it.

21
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,686
Let's drop it.

22
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,355
Drop it?

23
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,066
You talk badly about my daughter,
and you want to drop it now?

24
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,276
You're right.

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,570
I shouldn't judge other people's children.

26
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,280
I should've been more thoughtful.

27
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,657
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,330
It was you, wasn't it?
You spread the rumor, didn't you?

29
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:45,915
No, I didn't.

30
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,500
Why would I do that?

31
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,711
Then how did they find out?
You were the only one who knew.

32
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,629
So what if they know?

33
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,340
What's so bad about the fact
that your dad sells tripe and ox blood?

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,467
What did you just say?

35
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,553
Does that embarrass you?

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,722
Are you embarrassed of your dad?

37
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,517
You're unbelievable.

38
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,395
Unbelievable?

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,565
How dare you... Shall I rip your jaw open?

40
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,278
She's Han Seo-jin?

41
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,034
She hasn't changed at all.

42
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,082
You...

43
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,668
It's you, isn't it?

44
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,755
She's figured it out.

45
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,090
She knows who I am.

46
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,219
What should I do now?
What if the word gets out?

47
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,138
What if rumors spread around Sky Castle?

48
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,183
No, what if Ye-seo and Ye-bin find out?

49
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,564
U-JU'S MOM

50
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,856
Can we talk?

51
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,651
You're right.

52
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,153
I'm Kwak Mi-hyang.

53
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:45,743
My husband and in-laws know
that I'm Kwak Mi-hyang.

54
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,620
But

55
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,914
the people living here in Sky Castle

56
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,332
and my kids

57
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,251
only know me as Han Seo-jin.

58
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,464
Please do me a favor

59
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,217
and don't tell anyone else.

60
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,512
You haven't changed.

61
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,973
You haven't changed at all.

62
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,600
Yes, this is how I live.

63
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,855
The fact that I was the daughter

64
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,232
of a drunkard who sold tripe and ox blood

65
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,651
is an embarrassment to me.

66
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,362
Embarrassment?

67
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,576
You once spread rumors
about me, didn't you?

68
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,911
My gosh.

69
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,997
Do you seriously still think that was me?

70
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,874
I told you it wasn't me.

71
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,459
Back then, I just let it slide.

72
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,214
But if you do it again,

73
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,842
I won't just sit and watch.

74
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:52,310
I don't care if you're Kwak Mi-hyang
or Han Seo-jin.

75
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,146
And to be frank,
I really couldn't care less whether

76
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,731
you're the daughter of some drunkard

77
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,901
or the wife of a doctor
that works at a university hospital.

78
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,611
It's your life.

79
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,821
Why would I judge
and comment on your life?

80
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,910
Okay, thanks.

81
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,913
It seems like fate
that we met again like this.

82
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,416
So let's not end up cutting ties, okay?

83
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,879
Thanks for the tea. I'll be off now.

84
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,604
Ms. Han, the dry cleaner
will be visiting today.

85
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,272
Is there anything you need dry-cleaned?

86
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,358
Right, just a second.

87
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,557
That old tortoise

88
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,518
really needs to stop
messing around with me.

89
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,353
Honey.

90
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,731
Honey, where did you get this photo?

91
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,277
I found Yeong-jae's family photo
in your pocket.

92
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,028
I found it in Su-chang's office.

93
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,533
If he was here, I wouldn't
be getting mistreated like this.

94
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,619
Do you still keep in touch with him?

95
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,831
I wish. His cell phone's turned off.

96
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,417
I heard Yeong-jae didn't even enroll.

97
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,921
Was Yeong-jae really
the cause of all that?

98
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,717
Do you know something?

99
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,511
Because of Yeong-jae, that punk...

100
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,891
I don't know anything.

101
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,975
But I heard Su-chang saying

102
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,019
he should've taken Yeong-jae
out of the family registry.

103
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,356
What's the matter?

104
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,151
Do you know something that I don't?

105
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,655
Me? Know something? What would I know?

106
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,548
Mom suddenly barged into my room at 1 a.m.

107
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,430
Don't even think
about sleeping from now on.

108
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,265
You must be out of your mind.

109
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,100
How can you sleep
after coming in second place?

110
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,811
Plus, you came in second place
in your class, not your entire year.

111
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,772
How can you even sleep after that?

112
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,983
Are you just going to stand there?
Go and study!

113
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,511
Let me make one thing clear to you.

114
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,888
Sorting out family problems
isn't my responsibility.

115
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,808
That family's misfortune
was caused by their own actions.

116
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,143
As an admission expert,
I'm not responsible for any of it.

117
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,646
Fine, let's say
there was an issue with her.

118
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,147
Yeong-jae and Ye-seo aren't the same

119
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,483
just like how you and Myeong-ju
aren't the same.

120
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,486
Am I Yeong-jae?
Do you think I'm the same as Yeong-jae?

121
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,695
I know he's totally ruined,

122
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,697
but how can you think
I'll turn out like him?

123
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,659
That's right,

124
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,203
Yeong-jae and Ye-seo aren't the same.

125
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,872
Yeong-jae's family ended up that way
because of Ga-eul.

126
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,667
No. It was because of their own problems.

127
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,543
KANG YE-SEO'S MOTHER

128
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,295
The person you have reached
is not available.

129
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,796
You will be directed to voicemail.

130
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,882
I'm sorry, Coach Kim.

131
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,605
I was too rash last time.

132
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,483
I'd like to apologize to you in person.

133
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,318
Can you spare me some time?

134
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,997
We all hated the book club meetings

135
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,832
but didn't dare say so.

136
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,335
But this and that happened,

137
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,712
and the idea of a vote came up.

138
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,422
You're going to vote?

139
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,134
Yes. On whether or not
to continue the book club.

140
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,260
Ye-bin.

141
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,765
You said you're going hiking tomorrow.

142
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,017
I can always hike some other day.

143
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,895
I guess I should attend, too.

144
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,941
Are you out of your mind?

145
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,153
What would Professor Cha think if someone
who never attends shows up to vote?

146
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,866
Why should I even care what he thinks?

147
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,454
Do you know how important reading is
for entering university?

148
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,915
All you ever talk about is university.

149
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:58,045
I bet you have no clue that Professor Cha
uses those meetings just to show off.

150
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,172
So what if he shows off?

151
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,259
Even if you vote against it,
the book club won't disband.

152
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,636
So don't waste your time,
and just go hiking.

153
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,012
Okay?

154
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,016
Ye-seo.

155
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,393
Ye-seo.

156
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,897
She's a staunch follower of the club.

157
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,400
Why did the idea of voting come up?

158
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,237
It was because of the woman who moved in.

159
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,906
She's totally awesome.

160
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,409
-The woman who moved in?
-Yes.

161
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,621
Hwang Chi-yeong's wife?

162
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,082
Why?

163
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,168
You've caused huge trouble.

164
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,381
You said you wanted
to get along with them.

165
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,383
I really did want to get along,

166
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,886
but for the kids' sake,
I just couldn't hold back.

167
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,762
Well done, Mom.

168
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,598
Do you know what Seo-jun said?

169
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,932
Seo-jun?

170
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,143
Professor Cha's older son?

171
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,770
He called the book club "hell."

172
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,316
He said that he won't be able to escape,
no matter what happens.

173
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,736
You opened the gates of that hell.

174
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,363
My gosh.

175
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,282
It was that bad?

176
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,036
Now that you opened the gates,
you must get the kids out.

177
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,203
So,

178
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,623
do you stand a chance?

179
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,791
Out of us 12,

180
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,711
only Ye-bin, U-ju,
and that woman will vote no.

181
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,297
Professor Cha's smart enough to know that.

182
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,134
He brought up the idea about the vote
to make her an outcast.

183
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,220
-That feels nice.
-Does it?

184
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,015
Yes. Jin Jin, go lower.

185
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,516
Lower? Here?

186
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,936
-Here?
-Yes, there.

187
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,230
Do you think

188
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,775
it'll be just those three?

189
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,153
Of course. Professor Cha's whole family
will vote to continue the club.

190
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,988
Seo-jin and Ye-seo...

191
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,118
You aren't thinking of voting
against the club, are you?

192
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,205
What do you take me for?

193
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:01,293
I'm utterly busy, but I take part
to ensure Su-han is motivated to read.

194
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,337
Right.

195
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,924
You're the only dad
who attends all the meetings.

196
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,550
I'm so proud of you.

197
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,763
This side, too.

198
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,598
Oh gosh, you stink.

199
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,311
Your back? Oh, no.

200
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,563
Oh, dear. Is your back okay?

201
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,190
-Jin Jin...
-Does it hurt?

202
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,442
What should I do?

203
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,279
Yes, yes, yes. Yes?

204
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,031
No, no.

205
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,242
Nine to three.

206
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,873
Eight to four?

207
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,044
Anyhow, there can't be
more than three noes.

208
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,963
I have a reputation to keep.

209
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:06,984
VOTE ON WHETHER TO CONTINUE
SKY CASTLE'S BOOK CLUB, OMPHALOS

210
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,112
It's time, so let's begin the vote.

211
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,867
Those who believe
Omphalos should continue,

212
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,201
circle "yes,"

213
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:20,456
and if you don't, please circle "no."

214
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,924
All right, let's begin...

215
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,338
He's such a show-off.

216
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,965
Is he a chairman or what?

217
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,596
What's that stupid doctor doing here?

218
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,477
Nine to four.

219
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,361
YES

220
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,822
NO

221
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,115
YES

222
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,537
YES, NO

223
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,545
Hurry up.

224
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,313
No.

225
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,066
No.

226
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,862
YES: FOUR
NO: FOUR

227
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,912
No.

228
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,665
No.

229
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,377
No.

230
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,504
-No.
-No.

231
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,423
-No.
-No.

232
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,716
No.

233
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,185
No.

234
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,478
VOTE ON WHETHER TO CONTINUE
SKY CASTLE'S BOOK CLUB, OMPHALOS

235
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,607
YES: FOUR
NO: NINE

236
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,613
Four votes?

237
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,740
How are there only four?

238
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,867
Professor Cha, Seo-jin, me,

239
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,243
Ye-seo.

240
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,204
And everyone else...

241
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,837
How could this be?

242
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,633
I announce that Omphalos...

243
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,931
is now officially disbanded.

244
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,319
Why don't we

245
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,698
applaud Professor Cha
for all his hard work?

246
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,071
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

247
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,743
That was awesome. Totally awesome.

248
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,246
Nine to four. It was a landslide victory.

249
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,539
We owe it to you.

250
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,873
I agree.

251
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,417
You all

252
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,460
heard that, right?

253
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,878
Mom,

254
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,588
that's self-appreciation.

255
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,384
Hey, didn't you hear what Ye-seo said?

256
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,556
"I realized that self-appreciation
isn't bad at all."

257
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,184
"The power of self-appreciation
in which you believe you're good!"

258
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,521
What are you talking about?

259
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,606
Ye-bin, that's mean.

260
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,108
She's your sister.

261
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,236
Kang Ye-seo...

262
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,616
I mean, my sister said it
during our book club meeting.

263
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,328
I bet she's crying her eyes out right now.

264
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,455
I do feel bad for Ye-seo.

265
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,040
She loved the book club so much.

266
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,083
Her mom must be pretty upset as well.

267
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,626
I know, right?

268
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,962
Knowing her personality...

269
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,007
Gosh, I feel so angry right now.

270
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,218
Seo-jin, will you let that woman
get away with this?

271
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,554
Are you just going to leave her be?

272
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,891
Why aren't you saying anything
to her? This is so unlike you.

273
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,935
Are you going to let the club
disband like this?

274
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,689
The book club
has been our pride, you know.

275
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,484
Then what about Ye-seo?
What will you do about her?

276
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,194
You fired that coach, too.

277
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,446
If the book club disbands,
she'll be livid.

278
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,448
You don't care, do you?

279
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,043
She fired the coach?

280
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,772
How could Dad do such a thing?

281
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,484
I loved the book club so much.
How could he ruin everything?

282
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,529
What's the point of doing my best?

283
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,657
What's the point
when Dad just ruins everything?

284
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,122
Your dad isn't exactly fond
of Professor Cha, you know.

285
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,916
Because he can't trust the instructor...

286
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,876
What should I do now, Mom?

287
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,587
Even the book club is gone.

288
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,674
What am I supposed to do now?

289
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,969
Don't you worry.
I contacted Coach Kim again.

290
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,555
Really? So you'll hire her back?

291
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,765
When can it start?
When can she start again?

292
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,478
Soon, I guess. She'll call me.

293
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,063
Gosh, when can she start again?

294
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,732
I need to get sample questions
from her as soon as possible.

295
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,401
Okay, I heard you.

296
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,945
I'll make sure she can start again
tomorrow. Are we good now?

297
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,575
-Mom...
-Gosh.

298
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,203
My dear daughter, I'm really sorry.

299
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,375
You and Yeong-jae
are totally different, right?

300
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,711
Of course, we're different.

301
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,089
I'll never turn out like Yeong-jae.

302
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,259
I'm telling you.
Nothing bad will happen, Mom.

303
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,387
Yes, of course. Nothing bad will happen.

304
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,028
COACH KIM JU-YEONG

305
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,833
MR. JO

306
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,297
Mr. Jo, how have you been?

307
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:11,509
I'm called you because I can't
get a hold of Coach Kim.

308
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,054
I tried calling her yesterday as well.

309
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,264
Oh, ma'am.

310
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,227
She's actually been
contacting another student.

311
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,062
Another student?

312
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,064
Then what about Ye-seo?

313
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,692
I heard that you're getting a full refund.

314
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,363
No, I don't want a refund at all.

315
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,157
Gosh, she has to coach Ye-seo.

316
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,493
Please let Coach Kim know.

317
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,121
Ye-seo thinks that the coaching
will resume tomorrow.

318
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,249
Please help us out, Mr. Jo.

319
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,966
All right, ma'am. I'll see what I can do.

320
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,930
Are you there?

321
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,811
Please take out the dasik mold.

322
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,021
We have soybean flour, right?

323
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,356
You want to make dasik?

324
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,359
Yes, there should be some leftover
pine pollen in the freezer as well.

325
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,778
Oh, please prepare
persimmons and walnuts, too.

326
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,904
All right.

327
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,823
Oh, boy.

328
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,575
Seo-jun,

329
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,536
we're dead meat now.

330
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,829
What should we do?

331
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,665
Even Mom voted no.

332
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,126
Our old man will totally lose it.

333
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,921
Gosh, I really don't
want to see him being harsh on Mom.

334
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,261
Come to the study room in ten minutes.

335
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,014
What's this about? We're not even
supposed to study together today.

336
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,932
Hey, get up.

337
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,226
We'll get in huge trouble
if we get any questions wrong today.

338
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,980
Darn it! I'm not going to go!

339
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,357
Hey, come on.

340
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,109
-Let's go.
-I don't want to go!

341
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,278
-Hurry up.
-Gosh, seriously.

342
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,989
Let go of me! Damn it.

343
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,786
A prestigious high school
in Gangnam used that question

344
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,580
in their midterm exam last year.

345
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,167
It's a difficult question,
and it was worth ten points.

346
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,960
You must solve it within four minutes.

347
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,754
All right,

348
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,339
begin.

349
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,920
Three minutes.

350
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,440
Three minutes and thirty seconds.

351
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,175
Three minutes and fifty-five seconds.

352
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,206
What about Seo-jun?

353
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,203
I told you

354
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,205
that your grandfather

355
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,124
only graduated elementary school

356
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,376
and owned a small laundry business.

357
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,004
Despite such an environment,

358
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,049
I dreamed of becoming a president.

359
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,680
Your grandfather, who washed
other people's clothes all his life,

360
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,682
lived right here,

361
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,644
at the very bottom of the pyramid.

362
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,691
But I managed to pass the bar exam
with the highest score

363
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,443
and became a prosecutor.

364
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,278
And that's how...

365
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,199
I've climbed the social ladder
up to this point.

366
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,409
A Chief Public Prosecutor,

367
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,413
a Deputy Prosecutor General,
and then a Chief Prosecutor General.

368
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,249
A congressman,

369
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,543
a party leader,

370
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,794
and...

371
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:55,395
I wanted to keep climbing the ladder
to the very top,

372
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,772
but my dream got ruined

373
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,358
while helping my father-in-law.

374
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,864
And that's why

375
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,283
I changed my goal.

376
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,994
It doesn't have to be me.

377
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,204
My son...

378
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,582
will get to the top.

379
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,793
My goal now is to make sure my son
gets to the very top.

380
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,883
You don't think I can do it?

381
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,885
I've already

382
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,513
laid the groundwork.

383
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,891
If you

384
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,351
just

385
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,729
try a little bit harder,

386
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,566
you'll be able to climb
to the top smoothly.

387
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,113
Can you do that,

388
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,531
my son?

389
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,080
-Can you do it or not?
-I...

390
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,541
-I can do it.
-Louder!

391
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,918
I can do it.

392
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,345
Of course.

393
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,848
Of course, you can do it.

394
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,745
It's for the kids.

395
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,206
When they're stressed,

396
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,376
they need to eat colored vegetables.

397
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,588
They're not the only ones
who are stressed.

398
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:46,965
What about me?

399
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,551
I finally understand
how the hare must've felt

400
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,387
when it lost the race to the tortoise.

401
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:56,140
How does it feel to humiliate your
own husband? Does it feel nice?

402
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,768
You're the one who suggested the vote.

403
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,937
Yes, voting's nice.

404
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,063
It really is.

405
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,024
So did you think of it
as an opportunity...

406
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,360
to stab me in the back?

407
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,696
Let's be honest. There were a lot
of problems with the book club.

408
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,072
Everything U-ju's mother said

409
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,824
was right.

410
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,367
Everything she said was right?

411
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,994
Are you serious?

412
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,705
Who did all that volunteer work
for two years

413
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,456
so the kids could build good characters?

414
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,709
Yes, I'm sure that was one reason
for doing it.

415
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:29,007
But you wanted to show off
your knowledge in liberal arts.

416
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,426
Sky Castle is filled with people
from decent backgrounds,

417
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,637
so you needed that to compensate
for your sense of inferiority.

418
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,435
-My sense of inferiority?
-All the other kids' dads

419
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,353
were sons of doctors.

420
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,398
But your dad owned a laundry business,
and you're ashamed of that.

421
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,357
Am I...

422
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,484
wrong?

423
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,573
Don't ever pressure
Seo-jun and Gi-jun again.

424
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,868
They're not tools that can
fix your inferiority complex.

425
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,704
And they're not sandbags
you can use to vent out your anger.

426
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,331
Don't you know

427
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,170
how my dream got ruined?

428
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,130
Do you seriously think
it was because of my dad?

429
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,549
Cha Min-hyeok.

430
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,428
You always blame my dad
whenever you get the chance.

431
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,474
But you're the one who desperately wanted
a congressman as your father-in-law.

432
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,477
That was the easiest way for you
to reach the top of the pyramid.

433
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:27,398
Your greed is what got you
overly involved in the election.

434
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,983
So stop blaming my dad.

435
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,448
Are you...

436
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,992
done talking?

437
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,661
Yes.

438
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,664
I'm done.

439
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,694
Ye-seo's mother...

440
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,865
fired Ye-seo's coach.

441
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,454
If you really want to put our kids
on top of the social pyramid,

442
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,582
you should hire a professional coach
rather than trying...

443
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,753
to coach them yourself.

444
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,436
Ye-seo's mother fired Ye-seo's coach?

445
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,108
JUNAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

446
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,705
It's your first surgery here, isn't it?

447
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,748
Oh, hello. You're here.

448
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,002
You got assigned to do surgery on a
famous idol star as soon as you got here.

449
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,337
You'll become famous at this rate.

450
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,715
Too much attention gets me nervous.

451
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,843
I noticed that you look great
on TV, though.

452
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,055
I don't really enjoy being on TV either,

453
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,350
but I just do it for the hospital.

454
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,437
-I mean, who would actually want--
-I'll go inside now.

455
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,822
Gosh, that punk.
I wasn't even done talking.

456
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,450
-Hello.
-Hello.

457
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,289
Is everything ready?

458
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,999
Yes, everything's perfect.

459
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,500
Are you serious?

460
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,628
Have you gone mad?

461
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,421
Is it the room next to ours?

462
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,007
I think it's Dr. Hwang's operating room.

463
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,517
-Go and check what's up.
-Yes, sir.

464
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,855
Do you realize what you've done?

465
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,774
I'm sorry.

466
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,528
What happened?

467
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,906
This is driving me crazy.

468
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,075
What is it?

469
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,369
What happened?

470
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,621
-My gosh, seriously.
-Why? What's wrong?

471
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,333
Dr. Kang.

472
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,587
What's the fuss about?

473
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,924
An intern got confused about
preparations for a spine surgery patient.

474
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,425
He shaved...

475
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,929
He shaved all her hair off.

476
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,975
He shaved the hair off of an idol star?

477
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,518
Yes.

478
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,604
He made an idol star bald.

479
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,031
Dr. Woo Yang-u knows a lot of
people working for news channels.

480
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,075
Should I ask him to get this reported?

481
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,996
Suction.

482
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,497
-Suction.
-Suction.

483
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,541
My gosh, seriously.

484
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,501
What are you going to do now?

485
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,627
Please, calm down...

486
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,422
I told you to be extra careful.

487
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,966
Why did you shave her head?
She's not getting brain surgery!

488
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,802
You guys are doctors, not hairdressers.

489
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,096
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

490
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,474
An intern that stayed up all night
accidentally mistook the patient

491
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,642
for another patient.

492
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,812
I'd like to sincerely apologize.

493
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,124
This is so annoying.

494
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,793
You can tell it's fake.

495
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,172
We're sorry.

496
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,716
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

497
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,596
We're so sorry.

498
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,766
Isn't it a medical accident?

499
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,769
Hey, what's the name of that intern?

500
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,520
How adorable of him.

501
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,774
He stayed up all night in the ER
last night because he was on duty.

502
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:23,194
But still, how could he not
recognize Chan-mi of AOA?

503
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,404
He must've been really sleepy.

504
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,323
Apparently, he had been awake
for 36 hours.

505
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:31,035
Back in my day, we had to stay up
for 48 hours, but we were fine.

506
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,579
But what's funny is that she
didn't say anything to him

507
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,539
when he was shaving her head.

508
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,457
Exactly.

509
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,542
Idol stars must also have
a hectic schedule.

510
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,336
She didn't know anything
because she was asleep.

511
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,716
So you're saying the sleepy intern
shaved the head of a sleeping woman?

512
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,969
At least that's how the story goes.

513
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,099
My goodness.

514
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,142
Hello, sir.

515
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,769
-Hello.
-Hello.

516
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,853
Come sit down.

517
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,194
I used all my connections including

518
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,987
my friends and family,

519
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,657
and I spread the news
to entertainment reporters.

520
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,325
The moment they release the articles,

521
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,621
Chan-mi's fans will start
throwing eggs at Dr. Hwang.

522
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,123
They're going to throw eggs?

523
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,166
That's it?

524
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:24,088
Of course, that's the least
he should be worried about.

525
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,632
The 1,000-year-old tortoise...

526
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,052
will get extremely angry and throw a fit.

527
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,847
Hwang Chi-yeong will get
utterly humiliated.

528
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,515
I can't believe he said
it'll be much better

529
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,350
than an orthopedic surgery
where the surgeon uses

530
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,561
a magnifying glass
and drills screws into the bones.

531
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,478
My gosh.

532
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,981
How dare he look down on orthopedics?

533
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:46,652
My gosh, who in the world
said something so nonsensical?

534
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,362
Who do you think?

535
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,033
THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD TORTOISE

536
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,123
Hello?

537
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,959
Yes, come in.

538
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,679
Did you want to see me?

539
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,891
Dr. Kang, please take a seat.

540
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
Okay.

541
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,774
Dr. Kang, you also heard

542
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,110
about how the intern shaved off
the idol star's head, right?

543
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:29,778
Pardon?

544
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,409
Yes. I heard about that, too.

545
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,372
Fortunately, Dr. Hwang met her family,

546
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,126
explained the situation,
and apologized to them.

547
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,254
Some idiot who had no thought
in their brain

548
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,216
went and just told the press all about it.

549
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,135
That scumbag.

550
00:41:55,012 --> 00:42:00,184
Our PR team had a horrible day
trying to clean up the mess.

551
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,896
I'm asking you a favor, just in case.

552
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,189
You were right next door.

553
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,817
Make sure that the staff
who were there keep quiet.

554
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,321
Yes, sir.

555
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,740
I'll make sure they don't say anything.

556
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:15,908
You can go, then.

557
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,623
Yes, sir.

558
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,010
Where were we?

559
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,221
Rather than keeping people quiet,

560
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,723
I think the bigger problem is that
despite the new law

561
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,226
restricting doctors from working

562
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,271
more than 80 hours a week,
it's not being followed.

563
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,522
This incident

564
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,942
was a medical accident that happened
because the intern

565
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,944
hadn't been able to sleep for 36 hours.

566
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,239
The new law?

567
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,576
If we're to follow that law,

568
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,121
the fellows and residents
will have to do the interns' jobs.

569
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,956
What about their salaries, then?

570
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,925
What's going on?

571
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,011
It's an utter mess.

572
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,760
-Please give this to her.
-But...

573
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,012
Give it to her for me. Thank you.

574
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,847
Thanks.

575
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,699
I graduated from Namseok High School

576
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,452
and got my bachelor's, master's,
and doctorate degree

577
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,537
in law at Seoul National University.

578
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,999
I'm here to swear on my background

579
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,043
and integrity as a scholar.

580
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,961
If you were to...

581
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,759
coach my children,

582
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,345
I will not interfere with their education.

583
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,557
That was not an easy decision for me.

584
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:49,144
That's how much I trust and respect you.

585
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,570
If a professional expert like you
were to coach my kids,

586
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:03,826
I'm more than ready to support your
coaching and follow your instructions.

587
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,582
Please say yes.

588
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,340
I understand what you've said.
I'll contact you later.

589
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,390
Then I will be waiting
for a positive answer.

590
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,417
Ye-seo's mother made this herself.

591
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,294
For you.

592
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,578
Coach Kim, I was too rash last time.

593
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,455
Like you said,

594
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,833
The tragedy that happened to
Yeong-jae's mom was a family issue.

595
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,420
I should've thought more carefully.
I apologize.

596
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,672
Please forgive me.

597
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,176
Would you please coach Ye-seo again?

598
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,382
How did it go?
Will she coach Ye-seo again?

599
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,634
I did the best I could.

600
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,554
If she still refuses,
then it can't be helped.

601
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,183
You're so relaxed.
You're confident, aren't you?

602
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,894
What a relief.

603
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,981
I was worried she'd keep refusing.

604
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,609
You know how tutors have
this weird sense of pride.

605
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,278
It depends on the person.

606
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,196
Not all tutors are like that.

607
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,991
Seo-jin, once Ye-seo gets into university,

608
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,410
you have to let her coach
Su-han next, okay?

609
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,911
I told you.

610
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:56,331
She has to like you and Su-han first.

611
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,541
I know that.

612
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,668
I'm just asking you
to put in a good word for me.

613
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:03,130
It's you of all people,
so of course, I would do my best.

614
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,048
Thanks a lot.

615
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,009
You know you're my role model, don't you?

616
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,345
How about you buy me a cappuccino then?

617
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,639
Oh, dear, how foolish of me.

618
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,851
A cappuccino is coming.

619
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,570
You're doing an interview?

620
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,157
Yes. I'm thinking of writing
a novel for teenagers.

621
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,951
You're too old to read children's books.

622
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,412
Then you should interview me.

623
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,663
Why Ye-bin?

624
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,333
You don't know about Daechi-dong.

625
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,836
Ye-bin knows the area well.
Besides, she's offered to help.

626
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,130
Her schedule's packed,

627
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,382
so I'm meeting her
during her dinner break.

628
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:51,386
It won't take long,
so I'll pick you up while I'm out.

629
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,972
I'm going to stay late and study today.

630
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,601
Don't worry about me,
and just head home after the interview.

631
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,021
Okay. See you at home.

632
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,319
Who says I won't pay?

633
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,238
Did I ever not pay
the hospital bill in the past three years?

634
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,533
I'll wire the money
by the end of this week.

635
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,411
So make sure to change
my mom's dressing twice a day.

636
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:20,457
If the bedsores get any worse,
I'll make sure you pay for it.

637
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,445
Let's end the lesson here.

638
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,157
You have 30 minutes to eat dinner.
Don't be late.

639
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,450
Dismissed.

640
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,830
-Wait for me.
-Come on, let's go eat.

641
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,377
Su-han, are you coming?

642
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,504
Ms. Lee's coming to see us.

643
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,548
That's why we have to finish
in ten minutes.

644
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,724
You said you'd be my minion.

645
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,017
Yes, but this is a bit...

646
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,018
You idiot.

647
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,854
Running away from home isn't for everyone.

648
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,480
You need to have guts.

649
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,652
I'll do it, Ye-bin.

650
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,612
I said I'll do it.

651
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,163
-Sorry.
-We're sorry.

652
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,686
Wait...

653
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,648
Excuse me.

654
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,414
We did it!

655
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,587
Hey, we should hide them.

656
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,609
Hey, come on!

657
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,902
-Hurry.
-Guys.

658
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,870
One, two, three.

659
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,636
Wow!

660
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,895
Welcome, Coach Kim.

661
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,775
This way, please.

662
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,994
She will call me.

663
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,331
Trust me and wait just a little longer.

664
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,249
I can't. I can't wait any longer!

665
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,585
Ye-seo, stop doing this, okay?

666
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,462
You've been calling me nonstop.

667
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,966
I told you I met Mr. Jo yesterday.

668
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,844
It's only been a day.

669
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,597
-Wait until the end of the day--
-Call her again right now!

670
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,057
My goodness.

671
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,476
My gosh, Mr. Jo!

672
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,648
I was actually just about to call you.

673
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,108
Ye-seo keeps hounding me.

674
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,610
Here...

675
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,071
You didn't have to return it so quickly...

676
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,870
Coach Kim would like
your bank account information.

677
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,832
Where is she now?
I'd like to talk to her in person.

678
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,334
She's actually...

679
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,545
at Seo-jun and Gi-jun's place now.

680
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,798
Pardon?

681
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:40,735
You even made a soundproof room.

682
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:45,782
Concentration is key
to academic success, you know.

683
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:49,035
I soundproofed this room so that
even the sound of thunder won't be heard.

684
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,083
-Mr. Cha.
-Yes.

685
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,835
This isn't education.

686
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,753
You've been rearing them like animals.

687
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,798
I beg your pardon?

688
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,427
Did it not occur to you that this room
could make your sons feel intimidated?

689
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,472
Feeling intimidated can significantly
dampen brain cell activity.

690
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,768
One's ability to reason, apply,
understand,

691
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,230
and think creatively is enhanced
in a free environment.

692
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,862
Did you expect your sons to get
better grades in this environment?

693
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,701
But since this room
is already soundproofed...

694
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,787
Ms. Noh.

695
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,415
Maybe you should learn to play the drums.

696
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,109
I'd really like

697
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,530
for you to coach my sons.

698
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,448
Please, Coach Kim.

699
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,537
You'll hear from me
by the end of tomorrow, ma'am.

700
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,124
Okay, get back safely.

701
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,337
Coach Kim.

702
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,466
I thought our discussion
was over, Ms. Han.

703
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,634
Please spare me a moment.
Five minutes would do.

704
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,886
No, just one minute.

705
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,681
-Mr. Jo, escort her out.
-Yes, ma'am.

706
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,641
Gosh, please. Coach Kim.

707
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,935
Just a second, please.

708
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,104
-Ms. Han.
-Coach Kim!

709
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,653
What do you think you're doing?

710
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,579
Wait outside.

711
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,008
I sincerely apologize.

712
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,970
I must've lost my mind
after reading Yeong-jae's diary.

713
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:40,308
We were like one big family
for almost 20 years, so I...

714
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,355
I thought what his mom went through
could happen to me as well, so I...

715
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,651
I must've lost my mind for a little while.

716
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,404
Coach Kim, I beg you.

717
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,074
My daughter, Ye-seo...

718
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,785
Please take her back.

719
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,496
I have to make sure

720
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:03,665
she gets into SNU's med school.

721
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,875
I must make sure she becomes a doctor.

722
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,381
Coach Kim.

723
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,552
I beg you. Please coach Ye-seo again.

724
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,389
Please, Coach Kim.

725
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,739
So?

726
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,866
Were you going to make my daughter

727
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,910
turn out like Yeong-jae at all costs?

728
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,704
You asked me

729
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,331
if I was going to make Ye-seo turn out

730
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,167
like Yeong-jae at all costs.

731
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,254
I'm sorry.

732
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:54,882
You also asked me if I was planning
to see you end up like Myeong-ju.

733
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,968
Were you going to see me
end up like Myeong-ju?

734
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,761
I'm really sorry. I was...

735
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,681
You're not a coach. You're guilty
of solicitation to commit murder.

736
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,851
You accused me
of soliciting to commit murder.

737
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,992
So even if something like that happens,

738
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,245
will you put up with it?

739
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:27,957
Even if

740
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,251
the same kind of tragedy
befalls your family,

741
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,172
will you accept it?

742
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:41,095
I'm asking if you are willing
to put up with everything.

743
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,809
Yes,

744
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,269
I will.

745
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,272
I certainly will.
I'll put up with everything.

746
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,412
Starting this evening,
Mr. Jo will pick Ye-seo up every day.

747
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,709
She'll be home later than usual
for a while.

748
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,212
She has to catch up
on the classes she has missed.

749
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,218
Thank you, Coach Kim.

750
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,932
Start with what you can do.

751
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,185
What I can do?

752
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,395
You have to protect your kids

753
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,980
because you're their mom.

754
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,483
We both want our kids
to get better grades.

755
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,109
It's just that our methods are different.

756
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,445
They're not different.
Your method is wrong.

757
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,198
Ye-seo likes U-ju? Are you sure?

758
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,326
She's not interested
in knowing why I shoplifted.

759
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,204
She doesn't even care.

760
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,333
It's just a game she'll grow out of
once she gets into university.

761
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,918
Do you really have to go that far?

762
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,419
I can do worse things

763
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,422
to make sure my daughters
can at least live a life like mine.

764
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,008
