00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,888
DNA PATERNITY TESTING

2
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,581
KANG JUN-SANG, KIM HYE-NA

3
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,003
PROBABILITY OF PARENTAGE

4
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,133
She moved in knowing this.

5
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,179
She knows that Jun-sang is her father.

6
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,974
This fancy room

7
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,602
could've been my mom's.

8
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,248
My mom

9
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,960
never even wore a necklace
costing 10,000 won.

10
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,016
I'm sorry.

11
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,602
I shouldn't have come in here
without your permission.

12
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,354
I was just so curious.

13
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,399
I wanted to have a quick peek,
but everything looked so pretty.

14
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,610
I shouldn't have come in.

15
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,196
I must have lost my mind.

16
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,656
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,745
Get out.

18
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,810
What? Are you crazy?

19
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,646
What's crazy about
suggesting we eat with Hye-na?

20
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,067
Dad, do you know
how mean Ye-seo is to Hye-na?

21
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,280
I told you to be nice to her.

22
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,865
It'd be great if you girls got along.

23
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,126
We should have Hye-na eat with us here.

24
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,879
Ye-seo thinks she can be mean to her

25
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,132
because you discriminate against her.

26
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,135
She's not our family.

27
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,471
If she can eat with us,
she'll demand a room next to the girls'.

28
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,807
Don't jump to conclusions like that.

29
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,727
That courteous girl would never do that.

30
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,147
You don't even know her well.
How could you say that?

31
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,316
Goodness,

32
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,442
what's with you?

33
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm sorry.

34
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,575
Let's eat.

35
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,746
You're so cranky.

36
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,583
She's trying her best to survive
in this world all alone.

37
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,002
Can't you try to be nice to her?

38
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,407
She put our family photo face down.

39
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,576
You're Kim Eun-hye, right?

40
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,119
What do you want from me now?

41
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,746
Don't ever call me again.

42
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,707
Right, it was that day.

43
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,293
The day Ye-seo
was appointed as school president.

44
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,087
Kim Eun-hye must have wanted

45
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,797
to ask Jun-sang to look after Hye-na.

46
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,632
Hold on.

47
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:23,841
But I heard

48
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,803
that Hye-na's mom died
when she withdrew from the election.

49
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,721
Then who made that call?

50
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,392
Was it Hye-na?

51
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,563
She's holding a grudge.

52
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,108
She's holding a grudge, and...

53
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,557
What do you want? What are you planning?

54
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,434
You obviously know he's your dad.

55
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,477
Why did you move into our place?

56
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,646
Do you really not know?

57
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,690
I want to destroy everything.

58
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,317
I'll take everything
you and Ye-seo have been enjoying!

59
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,819
You evil bitch.

60
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,531
Get out. Get out at once.

61
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,366
Get out!

62
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
Ms. Han.

63
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
Ms. Han?

64
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,089
It's gotten quite cold.

65
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,842
Please change Hye-na's blanket
to a thicker one.

66
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,357
My goodness.

67
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,817
If you went to the same high school,
that means you already knew

68
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,277
that she was Kwak Mi-hyang.

69
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,488
How did you manage to
keep it to yourself all this time?

70
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,615
You're really incredible.

71
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,783
Jin-hui.

72
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,661
Let's stop talking about that.

73
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,290
By the way, you must feel so upset.

74
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,708
Even I felt disappointed

75
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,710
when I heard that you gave up
on writing the novel.

76
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,382
To be honest, I never planned on
being so against it.

77
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,260
But Mi-hyang kept pestering me about it.

78
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,012
So I had no choice
but to step up and point it out.

79
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,891
I was too thoughtless.

80
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,435
I should've thought

81
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,105
about how Dr. Park
and Yeong-jae might feel.

82
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,816
By the way, how did you manage
to meet Dr. Park?

83
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,277
Coach Kim helped me.

84
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,904
She escorted me all the way there.

85
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,615
But now that things turned out this way,

86
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,784
I don't know how I'm going to face her.

87
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,411
Coach Kim helped you?

88
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,706
She's not an easy person to meet.

89
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,208
Back when I wanted to ask her
to coach my kids,

90
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,419
I couldn't even talk to her,
let alone meet her.

91
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,297
She's right. Even people
who are rich and famous

92
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,841
need to get on their knees
and beg to meet her.

93
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,426
Apparently, she's like a royal.

94
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,219
Really?

95
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,888
She graduated from SNU. Maybe it's because
she's an exam coordinator,

96
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,557
but I heard she has a huge sense of pride.

97
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,393
To be honest, the parents might
treat her like a royal

98
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,769
before their kids get accepted.

99
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,688
But once they get accepted,

100
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,148
she'll be worthless to people like us.

101
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,357
Wait a minute.

102
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,195
Coach Kim graduated from SNU?

103
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,196
You didn't know?

104
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,325
She should at least be an SNU graduate
to coach kids from rich families like us.

105
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,410
But...

106
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
why do you ask?

107
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,831
No,

108
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,124
it's nothing.

109
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,376
I don't think it's nothing.

110
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,544
How can that young kid be so brazen?

111
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,213
What am I going to do
with that daring girl?

112
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,090
I can't kick her out,

113
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,509
but I can't tell my husband either.

114
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,010
If...

115
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,054
Ye-seo finds out...

116
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,766
No, that can't happen.

117
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,562
Ms. Han.

118
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,025
I already cleaned earlier.

119
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,527
What?

120
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,572
I thought I cleaned spotlessly,
but did you not like it?

121
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,120
No, it's not that. Okay, then.

122
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,969
Pull yourself together, Han Seo-jin.

123
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,555
You need to think properly.

124
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,099
No one

125
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,393
can find out about this

126
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,769
until Ye-seo

127
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,816
gets accepted to SNU.

128
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,543
I'm sorry, but how do you know Yeon-du?

129
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,630
I was her private tutor
until that accident.

130
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,342
Until the accident...

131
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,928
It wasn't even school break back then.

132
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,890
-Honey.
-My goodness, you startled me.

133
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,101
When did you come home?

134
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,269
Just now.

135
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,563
What were you thinking about so deeply?

136
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,152
Honey, if you were

137
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,529
a student at SNU,

138
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,740
would you go all the way to Daejeon
to give tutoring lessons?

139
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,825
And during a school semester?

140
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,913
What kind of question is that?

141
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,624
Why would an SNU student do that?

142
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,752
There'd be a lot of students in Seoul
who wish to be tutored by an SNU student.

143
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,213
I know, right?

144
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,050
The thing is, Coach Kim told me

145
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,220
that she used to be
Yeon-du's private tutor.

146
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,472
But it turns out that she went to SNU.

147
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,353
Don't make unnecessary presumptions,
and just think of it simply.

148
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,772
From Seoul all the way to Daejeon?

149
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,734
I'm not quite sure about that.
It just makes no sense.

150
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,736
LEE SU-IM

151
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,969
How do you know Yeon-du?

152
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,972
I was her private tutor
until that accident.

153
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,816
Could she

154
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,985
have lied to me?

155
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,460
I want to discuss something
about Yeong-jae's story.

156
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,088
I know you're busy, but can we meet?

157
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,871
I just don't think

158
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,874
it's right to give up the novel.

159
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,045
For Yeon-du's sake, giving up like this...

160
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,343
Yeong-jae's father
strongly opposes the idea.

161
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,513
Are you okay with that?

162
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,353
It was the same with Yeon-du.

163
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,021
Her parents

164
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,607
didn't want me to care about her.

165
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,238
As you know,

166
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,158
Yeon-du didn't get along with her parents.

167
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,578
Why do you think

168
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,040
she took drugs to take her own life?

169
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,640
Yeon-du

170
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,100
was hit by a car.

171
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:56,111
If I'd fought through
her parents' objections...

172
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,035
Maybe I could've saved her.

173
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,873
That idea made me think

174
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,584
I shouldn't give up.

175
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,884
Yeon-du and Yeong-jae are different cases.

176
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:23,931
What do you mean?

177
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,976
What if Yeong-jae ends up like Yeon-du?

178
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,103
Yeong-jae is a strong kid.

179
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,981
He's not at all the weak type to make

180
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,400
a drastic decision like Yeon-du did.

181
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,571
I'll help if you insist
on writing the novel,

182
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,075
but you might have to think hard about

183
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,868
whether it's the best for Yeong-jae.

184
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,918
If that's what you say,

185
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,254
I should think about it some more.

186
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,382
Thank you.

187
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,261
You're welcome.

188
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,304
I'll be off, then.

189
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,006
-You're really going to go?
-I told you.

190
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,507
That woman

191
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,426
doesn't even know how Yeon-du died.

192
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,262
She used a dead girl to approach me.

193
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,265
I can't let it go.

194
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,310
Honey, you said...

195
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,688
you wouldn't write the novel.

196
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,150
Yes, her lies are disgusting,

197
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,361
but can't you just think
it was simply because

198
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,406
she didn't want you to write
about Yeong-jae and let it go?

199
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,615
How...

200
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,370
How could she make up such lies
about Yeon-du?

201
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,040
The fact that she knew her name

202
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,208
means she ran a background check on me.

203
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,252
Just to stop me from writing a novel?

204
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,004
Does that make sense to you?

205
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,507
Seo-jin would've told her
the residents here

206
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,469
signed a petition to stop me
from writing the novel.

207
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,138
But seeing how she still
got involved and lied to me,

208
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,432
there must be a reason
she must stop me from writing

209
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,059
about Yeong-jae.

210
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,562
Honey.

211
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,023
I don't like

212
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,402
how you're getting involved with her.

213
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,074
Don't worry.

214
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,118
Your wife's a fourth-degree
black belt in Taekwondo.

215
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,384
Don't you get it?

216
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,429
When I said that such a misfortune
should never happen again,

217
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,722
I was saying it to you.

218
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,225
You ruined my son

219
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,310
and killed my wife.

220
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,689
I was right about her.

221
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,900
That woman

222
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,112
was at the center of that tragedy.

223
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,169
Do you eat at all?

224
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,798
You should.

225
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,985
I'm not saying I'll write the novel.

226
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,028
As I said,

227
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,948
that woman seems so dangerous.

228
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,534
She still coaches students.

229
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,827
I came back here

230
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,580
because I just can't turn a blind eye.

231
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,457
I even aimed a gun at her to scare her.

232
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,838
She's really fearsome.

233
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,800
What on earth

234
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,344
did she do to Yeong-jae?

235
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,732
That guy over there.

236
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,110
He's the friend

237
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,571
I told you about last time.

238
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,948
The one who also lost a kid.

239
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,951
His son got into SNU's med school, too.

240
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,288
He took his own life
after his pre-med courses.

241
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,751
What? Why?

242
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,461
I found out recently,

243
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,214
but to get his son into med school,

244
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,967
he also hired Coach Kim.

245
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,971
Kim Ju-yeong?

246
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,478
Why do you think she lied to you

247
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,022
to stop you from writing your novel?

248
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,737
I just said that with the hope
that you'll get your answer.

249
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,492
Are you saying

250
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,496
your friend's son took his life
because of Kim Ju-yeong?

251
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,957
We can't be sure about that,

252
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,292
but who knows?

253
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,506
She told him that the moment when
his parents would be the happiest

254
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,884
is the time to crush their hopes.

255
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,305
The woman urged my son
that it was the way to get revenge.

256
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,517
What wouldn't she do?

257
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,328
Why can't I even eat in comfort
in my own home?

258
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,622
No. How many times must I say no?

259
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,417
I don't want to eat with Kim Hye-na.

260
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,463
Your dad said we should all eat together.

261
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,675
Are you really my mom?

262
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,760
Why don't you see how I feel?

263
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,556
Are you the mom who used to
get me before I even talked?

264
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,435
Of course, I get you.

265
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,352
No.

266
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,562
I don't think you do.

267
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,647
You wouldn't do this
if you know how I feel.

268
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,319
I let her move in because you said it.

269
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,778
You agreed.

270
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,031
I only agreed
because Coach Kim told me to.

271
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,451
If it weren't for her, I wouldn't
have put up with Hye-na like this.

272
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,792
I can barely tolerate this.
How could you do this to me?

273
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,254
Do you even know how much she upsets me?

274
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,873
U-JU'S MOM

275
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,834
The person you are trying to reach
is not available.

276
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,780
What's so urgent?

277
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,031
I'll just

278
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,825
cut to the chase.

279
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,202
That woman, Kim Ju-yeong,

280
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,578
is dangerous.

281
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,789
She's really dangerous.

282
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,629
Didn't you apologize for misjudging her?

283
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,714
Now you're saying she's dangerous?

284
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,175
I just met with

285
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,636
Dr. Park Su-chang.

286
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,888
His friend's son

287
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,725
was also coached by her
and got into SNU's med school,

288
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,936
but he took his own life
after his pre-med courses.

289
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,688
So?

290
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,065
The person he last spoke to
on the phone before he died

291
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,608
was Kim Ju-yeong.

292
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,652
It was that woman.

293
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,115
So, are you saying
she encouraged him to kill himself?

294
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,871
I told you that she and I
had a connection.

295
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,166
But I found out it was all a lie.

296
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,460
Just to stop me from writing the novel,

297
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,837
she used a dead girl to lie to me.

298
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,882
There must be a reason why she did that.

299
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,552
That boy took his own life,
and Yeong-jae is in a mess.

300
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,889
Do you think all of it
is a mere coincidence?

301
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,562
-Maybe Kim Ju-yeong--
-Gosh.

302
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,189
Enough, shut it.

303
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,984
She's leaving.
Please get the door for her.

304
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,790
Wake up and focus. Now.

305
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,085
When can I stop doing this?

306
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,880
It's already past midnight.

307
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,633
I told you to solve
all the linear equations by today!

308
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,760
There's this much left.
How can I finish all this?

309
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,136
Shut it and just do it.

310
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,016
Ye-bin isn't better than you
in any aspect.

311
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,810
Your dad is a doctor,

312
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,187
and I come from an esteemed family,
unlike her mom.

313
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,605
I'm also smarter...

314
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,273
I mean, we're on par.

315
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,735
Do you have no pride?

316
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,904
Doesn't it bother you
that Ye-bin beat you?

317
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,614
We're two different people.

318
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,241
Gosh, this brat.

319
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,620
Aren't you going to sleep, Jin Jin?
It's getting late.

320
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,455
-Dad.
-Yes.

321
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,082
Honey, you stay out of this.

322
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,585
You hounded me about his bad grades,
saying he takes after me.

323
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,796
You just want me to look like
a bad mom, don't you?

324
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,506
You brat. Study hard!

325
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,801
-I'm going to bed, Jin Jin.
-Go.

326
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,054
Hurry up and solve them all.

327
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,099
I said you must get into
the intensive class before Ye-bin does.

328
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,392
Didn't I say that?

329
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,983
My gosh, are you serious?

330
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,360
Yes, I'm dead serious.

331
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,947
Don't you guys know that Malia Obama
got into my school last year?

332
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,116
She and I volunteer together
for the homeless.

333
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,326
So my daughter...

334
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,913
Cha Min-hyeok's daughter is friends
with Barack Obama's daughter?

335
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,876
My goal is to become a high-ranking
official in the US government.

336
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,627
How can I let such an opportunity slip by?

337
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,337
They say that the people you hang out with

338
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,256
determine whether or not
you can achieve your goal.

339
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,677
Of course. You sure are my daughter.

340
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,305
Dad, you always told me

341
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,391
that I must fly with eagles
if I want to become one.

342
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,517
That's right.

343
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,020
That's the true shortcut to success.

344
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,440
Only complete losers hide their past

345
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,525
and lie their way through everything.

346
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,485
But the truth always comes out eventually,

347
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,029
and they face utter humiliation.

348
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:46,946
Honey,

349
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,657
why are you bringing that up
out of the blue?

350
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,620
Well, the kids already know
about it anyway.

351
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,830
I'm telling them to educate them.

352
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,708
Who is he talking about?

353
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,919
-Ye-seo's mom.
-Hey!

354
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,086
What did she do?

355
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,504
Gi-jun.

356
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,590
Ye-seo is so full of herself.

357
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,133
She got what she deserved.

358
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,677
How could you say that about your friend?

359
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,054
You reap what you sow.

360
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,182
Is Jun-sang extremely understanding
or just clueless?

361
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,518
I wouldn't be able to stand
a woman like that even for a day.

362
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,689
My gosh.

363
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,156
Su-han!

364
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,616
You little...

365
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,576
Why are you still in bed?

366
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,287
You have to go to your academy. Get up!

367
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,040
I went to bed at 2 a.m. last night.

368
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,710
It's 7 a.m. now. Get up already.

369
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,670
Gosh.

370
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,506
Why did Ye-bin have
to go to the basics class?

371
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,924
You idiot.

372
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,259
You should be thinking about outdoing her.

373
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,221
Her mom looks down on me
because you're like this.

374
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,767
-Wake up, will you? Get up already.
-Gosh!

375
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,811
I'm skipping the academy today.

376
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,647
You're skipping?
Get back here. You're so dead.

377
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,232
Stop right there.

378
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,192
Who lives at the academy

379
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,653
from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
during winter break?

380
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,822
Everyone does it. So many kids
do exactly that and more.

381
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,074
Don't you know Ye-bin studies again
when she gets home?

382
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,993
Even if I do all this,
I won't be able to beat her.

383
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,577
You can't beat her
because you don't study!

384
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,954
No, it's because I take after you.

385
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,330
How dare you use me as an excuse!

386
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,999
You got bad grades
when you were in school.

387
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,501
Did you see them?
Did you see my grades? Did you?

388
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,253
-Will you go to the academy or not?
-Let go.

389
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,380
-Will you go or not?
-Let go of me.

390
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,342
No!

391
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,605
Oh, my god.

392
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,650
These cost a fortune!

393
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,657
It cost me so much to collect these.

394
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,995
Hey! How dare you break
this expensive collection?

395
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,706
You get poor grades,
and you can't do anything right!

396
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,374
Gosh, I can't even stand the sight of you.

397
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,335
Get out. You don't even deserve to study.

398
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,837
Don't even go to the academy.

399
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,672
My gosh.

400
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,801
Why did I give birth to that idiot?

401
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,857
Look.

402
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,526
I've scored an eagle seven times so far,

403
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,112
but that was my first time hitting an ace.

404
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,075
They say you'll be lucky for three years
after hitting an ace.

405
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,952
Only good things will happen to you
from now on.

406
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,832
I got lucky because I played with you.

407
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,628
Next time, we should invite him, too.

408
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,171
What was his name again?

409
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,048
Professor Cha Min-hyeok.

410
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,718
That's right. Let's have
Professor Cha join us as well.

411
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,596
If possible,

412
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,933
we could also invite
Congressman Kim Hyeok-jae as well.

413
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,773
I've actually...

414
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,776
brought it up to him already,

415
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,987
but Mr. Kim is quite uptight.

416
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,075
He won't be up for playing golf with us.

417
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,871
Is that so? Goodness.

418
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,165
He sounds like a fussy man.

419
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,127
He should be more open
and outgoing in order to succeed

420
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,461
as a politician.

421
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,924
It'd be best

422
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,678
to meet him naturally, don't you think?

423
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,806
"Naturally"?

424
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,057
How?

425
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,526
I've heard that there's a teacher

426
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,905
he's been admiring
as his mentor all his life.

427
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,282
I see.

428
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,035
I heard that person is ill
and could pass away any day now.

429
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,706
If you run into him naturally
at the funeral

430
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,209
and share your memories
of his late teacher,

431
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,630
the two of you should
definitely be able to bond.

432
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,385
Share memories of his late teacher?

433
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,515
About that,

434
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,061
Professor Cha will advise you
on what to do.

435
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,990
My gosh, you're incredibly thoughtful.

436
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,826
I can't believe I haven't
realized that until now.

437
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,539
I'm sorry for not realizing it sooner.

438
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,635
How about we have some ribeyes
for dinner tonight?

439
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,303
I'll buy.

440
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,263
Ribeyes? That sounds great.

441
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,432
Dr. Kang will treat us all
to dinner tonight.

442
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,975
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

443
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,269
They sound so happy.

444
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,064
I want you to check
if the surgery went well.

445
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,190
-Okay, sir.
-Okay.

446
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,025
I'll check again in the afternoon.

447
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,814
Let go of this while I'm being nice.

448
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,357
Stop acting like a loser.

449
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,109
"A loser"?

450
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,320
How dare he call me a loser?

451
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,074
Are you not scared of anything
because you've gained

452
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,534
Director Choi's favor?

453
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,327
How dare you act like this toward me!

454
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,248
I can't believe he's a doctor
who's in charge of people's lives.

455
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,261
Due to so many critical patients
at the Spine and Joint Center,

456
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,972
the ICU is packed right now.
Are you aware of that?

457
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,350
I'm sure you know that constant
treatment of critical patients

458
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,811
will only end up causing a deficit
to the hospital, right?

459
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,897
What's so wrong about
sending critical patients to the ICU?

460
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:40,359
If university hospitals reject
critical patients as well, where are they

461
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,321
supposed to go?

462
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,409
You must still only care about
your track record, Dr. Kang.

463
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,580
What?

464
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,457
My track record?

465
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,632
Dr. Kang, get in. Come on.

466
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,176
Come on.

467
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,976
-You too, come on.
-Okay, sir.

468
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,311
It's all right, sir.

469
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,313
Yes, we're fine.

470
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,939
-Goodbye, sir.
-Okay.

471
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,816
-Goodbye, sir.
-All right.

472
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,989
My gosh.

473
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,326
I noticed that the orthopedics department

474
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,286
earned the most money again.

475
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,330
I have to say orthopedics is

476
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,291
practically in charge
of earning money for the hospital.

477
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,627
You really work so hard, Dr. Kang.

478
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,171
It's something I must do as a member

479
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,672
of Junam University Hospital.

480
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,675
It's nice to be a righteous doctor,

481
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,179
but that's only possible
when the hospital's running properly.

482
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:54,141
And it's all thanks
to Dr. Kang's hard work.

483
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,186
You all should be grateful.

484
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,396
By the way,

485
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,523
does Professor Cha know how to play golf?

486
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,733
-He plays as well as I do.
-Really?

487
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,361
Then the four of us

488
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,739
including Professor Cha
should play golf someday.

489
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,325
-I'm sorry, but I--
-What do you say, Dr. Woo?

490
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,119
Can you play golf?

491
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,871
Of course, sir.

492
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,999
I'd be honored to join you.

493
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,545
He's not recovered enough
to play golf yet.

494
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,507
My gosh, is it because the head
of the department is so impressive?

495
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,136
All the doctors in orthopedics
know how to be flexible.

496
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,138
He has not recovered enough to play golf,

497
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,140
but look at how he was
still willing to play.

498
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,724
Thank you for the compliment, sir.

499
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,105
One needs to know
how to get along with people

500
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,065
in order to succeed in their career.

501
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,486
I feel so frustrated every time
I come across amateurs

502
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,239
who mistakenly think
it's the right thing not to do so.

503
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,741
The doors are opening.

504
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,629
-Dr. Kang, come this way.
-Yes, sir.

505
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,674
I'll make reservations for a day
when the weather's nice.

506
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,261
Golf is fun when you play it
with people who are good.

507
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,430
Let's eat together
after we're done playing.

508
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,765
We can have some drinks together as well.

509
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,517
Hey, go back. Go back.

510
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,776
How could you not block that?

511
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,617
You like U-ju, don't you?

512
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,498
U-ju doesn't seem to like you, though.

513
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,625
So what?

514
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,002
I just feel sorry for you.

515
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,254
That's all.

516
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,509
I've never done it, so I don't know.

517
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,844
But I heard unrequited love
is pretty tough.

518
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,347
My mom

519
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,141
had unrequited love
for someone all her life.

520
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,727
My so-called dad

521
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,854
didn't even care about my mom.

522
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,357
She was such a fool.

523
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,485
Why are you telling me that?

524
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,903
Did I even ask?

525
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,956
Hye-na.

526
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,336
Can we talk for a moment?

527
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,561
Get in.

528
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,855
There's somewhere we need to go.

529
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,260
Where are we going?

530
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,143
I'll be careful from now on.

531
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,895
-I didn't mean to anger--
-Shut up.

532
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,436
Get out.

533
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,661
Did you say your mom had
unrequited love for someone all her life?

534
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,748
Why did you come to our house
when you knew all that?

535
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,461
Did you finally find out

536
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,255
whose daughter I am?

537
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,423
I'm asking...

538
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,342
why you came to our house
knowing who you are.

539
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,802
Do you really not know?

540
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,680
Do you think I came
to give you a pleasant surprise?

541
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,064
You're scared, aren't you?

542
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,316
You're scared he might abandon you too,

543
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,985
aren't you?

544
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,238
Isn't that why you can't tell him
that you're his daughter?

545
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,409
Ms. Han.

546
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,119
Don't be mistaken.

547
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,496
I never had a dad my whole life.

548
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,915
Why would I fear being abandoned?

549
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,126
Because you must have heard it clearly.

550
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,670
That it was over
with your mom 18 years ago.

551
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:57,754
Not at all.

552
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,424
I came here to give back
as much as I was given.

553
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,677
You gave me a lot yourself.

554
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,478
If he finds out you're his daughter,

555
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,480
what do you think he'll do?

556
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,357
He thinks the only flaw in his life

557
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,401
is that he couldn't finish his residency

558
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,987
at SNU before coming to
Junam University Hospital.

559
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,407
An illegitimate child?

560
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,495
He'll never acknowledge or accept you.

561
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,751
With his pride and ego, the likes of you

562
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,295
would be an unbearable flaw.

563
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,553
Is that so?

564
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:49,473
Now I want to see for myself.

565
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,644
I should see if you're right.

566
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,646
Let's go and find out.

567
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,840
What do you want?

568
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,718
To be on your family registry.

569
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,304
I want to live as Kang Hye-na.

570
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,768
Wait until Ye-seo
gets into SNU's med school.

571
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,645
There's a condition.

572
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:20,814
A condition?

573
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,567
Let's eat together from now on.

574
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,653
And I get to roam the house freely.

575
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,201
No one can know until Ye-seo is accepted

576
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,120
into SNU's med school.

577
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,373
Is it that important that she gets into--

578
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,583
Answer me.

579
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:41,960
Sure.

580
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,546
Let's do that.

581
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,009
Let me ask you a question.

582
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,596
You asked me
to let you be a live-in tutor.

583
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,057
Did someone tell you to?

584
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,017
No.

585
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,436
I wasn't considering
the option of living with you

586
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,147
until Ye-seo said it.

587
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,026
"Don't even dream of being
a live-in tutor."

588
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,365
That's why I decided to be one.

589
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,619
Did you not meet Kim Ju-yeong?

590
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,288
Who's that?

591
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,847
Woo Su-han!

592
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,974
Didn't you hear me?

593
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,143
What...

594
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,770
Where is he?

595
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,324
To Mom and Dad.

596
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,702
I'm sorry I was ever born.

597
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,620
I want to get perfect grades, too.

598
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,998
I want to get good grades
and make you both happy.

599
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,584
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.

600
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,421
If it's to put you at ease,

601
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,464
I don't mind dying.

602
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,465
What?

603
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,634
Thanks for raising me until now.

604
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,637
Goodbye. Sincerely, Su-han.

605
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,622
Ye-bin.

606
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,707
Ye-bin...

607
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,963
Hi, Ye-bin.

608
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,841
Have you seen Su-han?

609
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,178
I know, he missed class today.

610
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:57,846
You haven't seen him?

611
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,723
U-ju.

612
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,268
Have you seen Su-han?

613
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,854
The library?

614
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,734
Su-han.

615
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,321
Su-han.

616
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,325
Su-han.

617
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,872
Wait...

618
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,834
YANG-U

619
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,217
Darn it.

620
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,221
Why isn't he picking up?

621
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,014
Gosh.

622
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,520
Su-han.

623
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,525
Woo Su-han!

624
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,406
Su-han.

625
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,459
Su-han.

626
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,926
Where has he gone in such cold weather?

627
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,554
Woo Su-han.

628
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:23,473
Darn it.

629
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,767
Being an outcast at my age

630
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:27,853
made me think of you.

631
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,439
While the other women
left you out and bullied you,

632
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,067
I should've comforted you a bit more.

633
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,902
I felt bad.

634
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,283
I'm always thoughtful.
Did you realize that just now?

635
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,493
I'm almost home.

636
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,495
Okay, bye.

637
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,875
Su-han.

638
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,551
Su-han.

639
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,575
Ms. Jin?

640
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,787
Are you okay?

641
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,249
Dr. Hwang.

642
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,960
Su-han's missing.

643
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,004
Su-han's missing?

644
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,047
Yes.

645
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,299
Get up.

646
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,635
Let's look for him together.

647
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,397
I searched the whole complex,
but I couldn't find him.

648
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,817
What if he got out already?

649
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,903
He needs to take a bus
to leave the complex,

650
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,655
so I'll drive to the main gate.

651
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,615
It's my fault.

652
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,201
Grades aren't that important.

653
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,495
Tableware isn't that important.

654
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,331
Why did I compare him to Ye-bin?

655
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,710
Do you have any tissue?

656
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,879
Tissue? Tissue...

657
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,339
I found some.

658
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,221
What if

659
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,557
something happens to him?
It's already so late.

660
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,978
He knows nothing but home,
school, and classes.

661
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,564
What if he gets in an accident?

662
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,360
Don't worry too much.

663
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,530
My son ran away from home
when he was in elementary school.

664
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,532
They run away from home,

665
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,284
but they can't go too far
and just stay close by.

666
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:49,953
U-ju

667
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,622
ran away from home once?

668
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,957
Of course.

669
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,209
That's how kids grow up.

670
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,338
Do you know why God give us kids?

671
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:04,175
"You should learn that there's something
you can't always control."

672
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,601
Su-han might be having regrets right now.

673
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,400
SKY CASTLE MAIN GATE

674
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,865
Wait, Dr. Hwang. I see Su-han!

675
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:09,991
-Su-han?
-Yes.

676
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,793
Su-han!

677
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,546
Woo Su-han!

678
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,174
Su-han!

679
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,009
Su-han!

680
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,059
Woo Su-han!

681
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,812
Woo Su-han!

682
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,362
-Woo Su-han!
-Su-han!

683
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:58,998
Are you all right?

684
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,645
Are you okay?

685
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,691
It could've been really bad.

686
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,234
Is Su-han okay?

687
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,236
I held him in my arms when we fell,
so he's okay.

688
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,572
I think it scared him a little,

689
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,574
but kids grow up like that, you know.

690
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,909
I'm so relieved.

691
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,163
Well done, honey.

692
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:45,128
I'm worried that his mom
might scold him harshly.

693
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:47,881
So

694
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,924
were you actually going to die?

695
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,678
I really want to get better grades

696
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,139
and make you and Dad happy,

697
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,934
so it's really upsetting
that I can't do as well as I want to.

698
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,687
And you kept getting mad at me, so--

699
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,939
Still, how could you run away
like that when you saw me?

700
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,066
Do you know how much that shocked me?

701
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,485
At that moment,

702
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,070
you looked like an angry rhinoceros.

703
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,698
I thought you'd kill me if I got caught.

704
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,785
Why would I kill you?
You're my one and only son.

705
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,079
I really want to do well,

706
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:24,542
but being stuck at the academy all day
is extremely stressful.

707
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,965
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

708
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,051
You see,

709
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,137
I had no idea you were this stressed out.

710
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,807
I must've lost my mind
upon hearing that Ye-bin

711
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,726
passed the level-up test.

712
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,606
I promise you. I'll never...

713
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,150
compare you to Ye-bin again.

714
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,568
And the academy, too.

715
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:54,197
I won't force you to take
more classes than you can handle.

716
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,157
I'm sorry I was born, Mom.

717
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,368
No, don't say that.

718
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,912
You mean the world to me.

719
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:04,290
I will die...

720
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,294
if you aren't in my life.

721
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,755
You got that?

722
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,635
Come here, my son.

723
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,263
My baby. My son.

724
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,694
She's a model student,

725
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,947
but when it comes to
keeping her room tidy,

726
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,783
she's still so bad at it.

727
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,083
What's all this?

728
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,346
My gosh.

729
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,141
What is this?

730
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,134
Se-ri, Dad's home.

731
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:42,722
What's that?

732
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,308
I found this

733
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,394
in Se-ri's closet.

734
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,356
That's a wig.

735
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,400
She even wears things like that?

736
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,154
You see, brainiacs also know
how to have fun.

737
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,364
Just pretend you never saw it.

738
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:00,740
Where's Se-ri?

739
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,994
She went to Itaewon to meet up
with her friends.

740
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,871
Why did you throw it like that?

741
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,208
I bet all her friends

742
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,710
are dying to see her now that she's back.

743
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,837
She's so sociable, just like me.

744
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,389
Hey, I totally forgot to call you.

745
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,973
Se-ri arrived safely.

746
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,225
Se-ri, that witch.

747
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,851
She did go back to Korea, right?

748
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:30,937
Hey.

749
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,522
Is it your sister?

750
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,523
Let me talk to her.

751
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,695
It's a lie! She lied to us.

752
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,406
Everything including
her getting into Harvard was a lie.

753
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,242
Gosh,

754
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,244
I only found out about this just now.

755
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,955
What should we do about that girl?

756
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,457
What do we do with that damned girl?

757
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,003
Let me talk to her, will you?

758
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:58,923
Okay, bye.

759
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,092
Why did you hang up?

760
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,177
I wanted to thank her.

761
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:04,929
Well,

762
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,807
she called on her way to work to make sure

763
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,308
Se-ri arrived safely.

764
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,602
Really?

765
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,855
I should call her another time.

766
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,858
It's all thanks to her
that Se-ri is doing so well.

767
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,377
Hey,

768
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,254
what do you mean?

769
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,257
You went to Se-ri's entrance ceremony

770
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,426
and even took her stuff to her dorm room.

771
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,053
What do you mean, it's a lie?

772
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,430
I just got a call

773
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,308
from the Cambridge Police Station.

774
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:53,811
Se-ri

775
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,522
has been pretending
to be a Harvard student,

776
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,400
so Harvard sued her.

777
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,361
She's been sneaking into the lectures

778
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,988
and using their cafeteria as well.

779
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,866
She's been living in the dorms
as if she's a Harvard student.

780
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,454
That girl has gone crazy.

781
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,124
She was afraid she'd get caught.
That's why she fled to Korea.

782
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,169
Hey.

783
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,340
Harvard is demanding
62,000 dollars for all the damages.

784
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:23,966
Gosh,

785
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,802
what do we do with this girl?

786
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,846
What should we do about Se-ri, Seung-hye?

787
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:44,821
Seung-hye.

788
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,030
SEON-HYE

789
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,114
Seung-hye.

790
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,785
Seung-hye!

791
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:56,874
Oh, right. I'm sorry, Mother.

792
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,043
I've been so out of it these days.

793
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,128
That can't be an excuse.

794
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,756
How could you forget about the solo
recital of Mr. Lee's granddaughter?

795
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,466
It was even held at Sky Castle.

796
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:07,760
Anyway,

797
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:10,096
I ran into Ms. Jung at the recital.

798
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,014
Spare us just half an hour.

799
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,141
We're at the cafeteria now.

800
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,561
All right, we'll be waiting.

801
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:24,902
She's coming down.

802
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,071
Thank you so much.

803
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,451
Mr. Lee's granddaughter already
had a solo recital.

804
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,161
At this rate, she might
hold concerts soon.

805
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,372
I know, right? I'm so envious.

806
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,874
You should try, too.

807
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,458
I'd love to.

808
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,838
It's so hard to raise your child
to be a successful artist.

809
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:44,964
You're right.

810
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,176
-Grandma.
-Oh.

811
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,428
Goodness.

812
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,638
-You must be her younger grandkid.
-Yes.

813
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,974
My gosh, you look like a smart cookie.

814
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,559
-Hello.
-Hi.

815
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,606
Hello.

816
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,609
She's my tutor.

817
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,111
I always get perfect scores
on my math tests now, Grandma.

818
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,488
She's your tutor?

819
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,615
Yes.

820
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,658
She goes to the same school as Ye-seo.

821
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,285
She lives with us now.

822
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,954
You live with them?

823
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:20,791
Ye-seo's mom kindly let me move in
as Ye-bin's live-in tutor.

824
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,084
Gosh,

825
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,669
she hired a high school student?

826
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,428
-Ye-bin.
-Yes.

827
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,267
-Take Ye-bin upstairs.
-Okay.

828
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,312
See you again, Grandmother.

829
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,606
All right, go on.

830
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:49,570
Let's go.

831
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,956
It's nice to meet you.

832
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,042
Thank you very much for making time
to meet with me.

833
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,377
I'm Laura Jung.

834
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,171
My gosh,

835
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,048
we've met before,

836
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,383
haven't we?

837
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,178
Have we?

838
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,138
We met at Seoul Hotel that day,

839
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,390
in front of the elevator.

840
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,393
It's been so long,
so I wasn't sure if it was you.

841
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,186
You're Jennifer, right?

842
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,563
You used to live in Fairfax, Virginia.

843
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,524
I'm Laura. Laura Jung.

844
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:30,069
Oh, right. I remember you.

845
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,072
So you're her daughter-in-law.

846
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,199
What a small world.

847
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:36,575
Oh, right.

848
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,162
That woman you were with that day.

849
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,123
How do you know her?

850
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:44,208
Why do you ask?

851
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,336
She looks so much like Jennifer.

852
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,297
Didn't Coach Kim Ju-yeong say
you were mistaken?

853
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,174
Coach Kim Ju-yeong?

854
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,176
You mean, Ye-seo's coordinator?

855
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:55,678
Gosh,

856
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:57,805
she's Ye-seo's coordinator?

857
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,562
Jennifer Kim was famous in Fairfax.

858
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:08,399
Doesn't she have a daughter?

859
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,192
Her name is K.

860
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,115
I don't know anything
about her personal life.

861
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,575
I don't even need to know.

862
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:18,492
Hang on.

863
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,578
I'll show you something.

864
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:24,874
There it is.

865
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,170
Have a look.

866
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,880
It's her, right?

867
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:46,771
SUSPECT ARRESTED FOR MURDERING HUSBAND
AND STAGING IT AS AN ACCIDENT

868
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,547
I know that it's a personal matter,

869
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,716
but I think it needs an explanation.

870
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,427
If your husband finds out,
he will explode.

871
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,263
You're old enough now.
Why are you still such a mess?

872
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,723
Mom, what's wrong?

873
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,475
I see someone over there.

874
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:25,726
Yeong-jae.

875
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,271
Just think about how happy
you will be when you get accepted.

876
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:33,275
Reject and ignore everything
that gets in your way,

877
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,485
even if it's your mom.

878
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:35,903
There's something I must tell you.

879
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,696
She gave you Ga-eul's number?

880
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,740
She stirred up Yeong-jae's feelings.

881
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,158
That was the trigger.

882
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,286
Have you wondered what she may be
doing to provoke Ye-seo?

883
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,707
