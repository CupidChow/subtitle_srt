1
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,047
Ye-seo.

2
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,759
Listen to me carefully.

3
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,636
You got perfect scores

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,305
on your final exam,

5
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,640
but you didn't do it on your own.

6
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,271
Coach Kim made it happen.

7
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,317
Yes, I know that.

8
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,154
I could get perfect scores
thanks to the questions she gave me.

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,324
-Are we good now?
-The exam questions...

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,288
were leaked.

11
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,046
What do you mean?

12
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,132
The exam questions were leaked?

13
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,347
Yes.

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,058
If you want to help U-ju,

15
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,228
you'll have to be okay
with having your grades revoked,

16
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,440
and you should mentally
prepare yourself to either leave

17
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,901
or be expelled from your school.

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,987
I know

19
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,282
how ridiculous this situation is

20
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,369
and how wrong this is.

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,413
I know all that.

22
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,921
But you see, Ye-seo,

23
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,009
I can never give up on your life.

24
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,015
Whether people point fingers
or hurl stones at me,

25
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,893
and even if U-ju's mom
beats me up, I'll put up with it.

26
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,189
So don't worry about anything
and just study, please.

27
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,079
That woman, Kim Ju-yeong,

28
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,415
killed Hye-na?

29
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,502
-Honey.
-Where's her office?

30
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,507
Where is it?

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,014
I asked you where it is!

32
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Right.

33
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,416
It wouldn't be bad
if Jun-sang threatened her once.

34
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,543
It'll teach her to behave herself.

35
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
Why?

36
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,233
Are you still confused?

37
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,404
I keep questioning myself
if we really have to go this far.

38
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,424
-What's this?
-A gift for you.

39
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,509
BANPO-DONG, SEOCHO-GU

40
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,478
Honey, wait! Honey!

41
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,221
Did you kill her?

42
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,432
Are you trying to kill her?

43
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,975
Do you want to kill her?

44
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,393
I heard you killed Hye-na.

45
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,354
Why did you kill her? Why?

46
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,647
Stop it immediately.

47
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,483
She's struggling to adjust!

48
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,199
Are you trying to act like a father
for a change?

49
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,575
What? What did you just say?

50
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,870
You abandoned her all these years,
and now you're grieving?

51
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,455
You crazy bitch!

52
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,708
Honey.

53
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,754
When you thought
she was someone else's child,

54
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,589
you didn't care whether she died or not.

55
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,634
Are you having regrets now
that you know she's your daughter?

56
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,802
Why did you kill her?

57
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,721
Why did you kill that poor kid?

58
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,065
Ms. Han.

59
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,568
What is your husband talking about?

60
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,405
I heard you killed her.

61
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,241
You killed Hye-na

62
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,576
and even stole the exam papers!

63
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,791
As for the exam papers,
it was something I had to do for Ye-seo.

64
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,377
But killing Hye-na?

65
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,589
On what grounds are you making
such an absurd accusation?

66
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,715
You think it's absurd?

67
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,343
Shall we go to the police station now
and find out?

68
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,638
Whether you killed her
or someone else did,

69
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,350
I will reveal the truth. Come with me!

70
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,312
No! You can't go. You'll have to
kill me first if you want to go.

71
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,939
You said she killed Hye-na.

72
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,276
Why are you protecting this bitch?

73
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,694
You're the one who killed her.

74
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,448
She wouldn't have died
if you hadn't stopped her surgery.

75
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,701
You killed her with your own hands
for your own career.

76
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,744
You don't have the right
to blame someone else.

77
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,343
Yes,

78
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:50,845
I'm at fault.

79
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,346
It was all my fault.

80
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,182
I will pay

81
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,185
for what I did, so get out of my way!

82
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,769
I absolutely can't forgive this woman.

83
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,230
-Let go!
-Hye-na is already dead.

84
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,108
Are you going to ruin Ye-seo's life
because of that dead girl?

85
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,320
Are you saying we should bury
all of this for Ye-seo's grades?

86
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,490
You've completely lost your mind.
Step aside!

87
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,409
Listen, you're the one
who's not in your right mind.

88
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,788
You didn't recognize your daughter
when you lived with her for over a year.

89
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,293
And you killed her with your own two hands
for your own career.

90
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,629
You just want to lessen the guilt somehow.

91
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,799
You're about to completely ruin
Ye-seo's life just to lessen your guilt.

92
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,511
Let go!

93
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,890
Going to the police station now
will be like killing Ye-seo.

94
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,434
You'll be killing Ye-seo as well.

95
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,567
Is failing to get into SNU
the end of the world?

96
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,277
Yes, it is.

97
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,821
It'll really kill her!

98
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,909
How could you say that?
Do you not know Ye-seo?

99
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,453
People will criticize her saying
she cheated to become the top student.

100
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,956
Do you think she'll be able to
handle all that criticism?

101
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,875
It'll stick with her for the rest
of her life like a scarlet letter.

102
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,419
What do you think
she'll be able to do in the future?

103
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,590
Once her name
is revealed online, it's over.

104
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,592
Her entire life will be destroyed.

105
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,471
You bitch!

106
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,392
Was it not enough for you to kill Hye-na?

107
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,437
Did you have to make Ye-seo suffer, too?

108
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,649
You were paid billions of won.

109
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,237
Why in the world would you do
something like this?

110
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,908
What other reason would there be?

111
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,453
All I ever tried to do

112
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,332
was to make Ye-seo
become the best student.

113
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,419
You little--

114
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,462
-Honey, calm down.
-Let go of me!

115
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,922
-Calm down, honey.
-Let go!

116
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,257
Honey.

117
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,344
Let's think of Ye-seo.
Let's think of our daughter.

118
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,388
We need to save our daughter.

119
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,515
Even so,

120
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,643
how could you frame it on U-ju
when he didn't even do anything?

121
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,645
What about that poor kid?

122
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,897
How could you do something like that?

123
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,692
Please don't think about anything else.

124
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,321
I don't care if I get stoned
to death for doing this.

125
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,238
I...

126
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,448
I don't care.

127
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,533
I'm going to protect my daughter.

128
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,579
Honey, this is the only choice
we can make right now.

129
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,541
You bitch!

130
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,293
You...

131
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,844
Mr. Jo.

132
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,806
I'm going home first.

133
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,617
You bitch!

134
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,452
You witch!

135
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,534
Regardless of how great
they think they might be,

136
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,743
they're still beneath us.

137
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,745
Once they entrust us with their child,

138
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,956
we're the ones who have control over them.

139
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,417
We can make them laugh or cry.

140
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,503
And we can even make their lives
a living hell.

141
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,383
As long as parents continue to have
the desire to make their kids

142
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,926
become more outstanding than anyone else,

143
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,887
we won't need to take responsibility
for anything

144
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,139
as long as the kids get accepted.

145
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,852
After all, we're their idols, and we have
total control over them in this era

146
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,440
of endless competition.

147
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,173
MR. JO

148
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,469
MR. JO

149
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,641
Do you like it?

150
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,059
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

151
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,936
I'll do my best.

152
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,710
Hey, this is my desk. Move.

153
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,840
I said, move.

154
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,969
Why is this your desk?

155
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,138
You got expelled
for stealing the exam papers.

156
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,434
Kang Ye-seo's personal information
is all over the Internet.

157
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,603
You got perfect grades
by stealing the exam papers?

158
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,021
I hope your life gets ruined.

159
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,773
I hear the sound of handcuffs.

160
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,775
She should get locked up in jail, too.

161
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,194
She probably didn't study anything
on her own at all.

162
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,988
She should be forbidden to take the CSATs.

163
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,156
She shouldn't be allowed
to live in this country.

164
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,492
I don't care if she gets expelled or not.
I just hope she dies.

165
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,786
Even if she gets into med school,
she won't be able to graduate.

166
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,454
I feel sorry for her.
Her life's ruined now.

167
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,957
-How is she going to get a job?
-She lives in Sky Castle.

168
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,126
Her dad's the planning manager
of Junam University Hospital.

169
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,419
Her family's ruined now.

170
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,421
If I were her, I'd die of embarrassment.

171
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,382
I get goosebumps thinking people
like her end up in SNU's med school.

172
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,467
She was probably really happy
when she got perfect grades.

173
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,011
Your life's over, you brat.

174
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,016
Your life is over.

175
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,851
It's over.

176
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,149
Honey.

177
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,151
What are you doing?

178
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,194
Don't look for me.

179
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,073
If you want to leave,
leave in the morning.

180
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,199
It's too late right now.

181
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,283
Why?

182
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,078
Are you scared that I might
go to the cops?

183
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,204
Does that scare you?

184
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,081
Honey.

185
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,710
Did you think I was that decent?

186
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,924
I'll just keep quiet,

187
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,926
so do whatever you want.

188
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,653
Honey.

189
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,240
I know it's hard for you.

190
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,076
I know that.

191
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,788
But can you not go?

192
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,171
Can you

193
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,591
just forget about who's responsible...

194
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,637
and be on my side

195
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,682
just this once?

196
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,027
If Ye-seo is also suspicious
of Kim Ju-yeong,

197
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,071
I'm sure her mother knows
something as well.

198
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,364
Why she won't tell us anything?

199
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,076
An innocent kid is locked up
in prison. How...

200
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,119
How could she be like this?

201
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,291
It means Kim Ju-yeong has something on her

202
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,835
that's stopping her from saying anything.

203
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,839
There's no use in trying
to convince Ye-seo's mom.

204
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,132
We need to...

205
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,969
look into Kim Ju-yeong.

206
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,933
Do you really think we can find out
why she killed Hye-na

207
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,018
just by looking into her past?

208
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,895
Up until now,

209
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,107
we only focused on
why she's trying to ruin

210
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,275
her students' lives

211
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,070
including Jung-min, Yeong-jae, and Ye-seo.

212
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,324
This is just my gut feeling.

213
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,451
But I think she killed Hye-na
for the same reason

214
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,328
that she didn't want me to write

215
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,414
the novel about Yeong-jae.

216
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,548
Did you get any calls
from the Koreans living in Virginia?

217
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,094
I asked for an introduction to someone
who knows the case.

218
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,057
So we'll have to wait.

219
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,522
It must be them.

220
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,483
Su-im.

221
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,153
I heard you went to the ER last night.

222
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,320
Are you all right?

223
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:19,241
You must have been really stressed
if you got stomach cramps.

224
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,078
I feel better now that the pain's gone.

225
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,957
Come and sit down.

226
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,459
-Okay.
-Can you get us something to drink?

227
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
Sure.

228
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,422
Do you want coffee or green tea?

229
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,340
Anything that's easy for you to make.

230
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,842
-Me, too.
-Okay.

231
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,221
He looks haggard, too.

232
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,575
Seo-jun and Gi-jun
are asking friends to sign

233
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,577
a petition saying U-ju's innocent.

234
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:09,291
Su-han, Yang-u, and I
are going to file petitions as well.

235
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,674
Thank you.

236
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,969
I didn't dare ask in case

237
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,264
it interrupted their studies.

238
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,018
I won't forget

239
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,562
how you helped.

240
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,274
We're doing what we should.

241
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,151
That's right.

242
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,445
U-ju's a senior,

243
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,615
and it breaks my heart
to think he's in a cell.

244
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,242
You must feel terrible.

245
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,454
-Thanks.
-Honey.

246
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,831
Seo-jun and Gi-jun

247
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,042
are getting their friends
to sign a petition.

248
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,045
Su-han's family will file petitions, too.

249
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,341
Thank you.

250
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,594
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

251
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,137
It's such

252
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,223
a big help.

253
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,225
Don't mention it.

254
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,811
We're all parents.

255
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,771
We should do something.

256
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,233
By the way,

257
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,112
do you have any idea about
who could have framed U-ju?

258
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,488
And don't you think

259
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,325
it's suspicious that the guesthouse
security guard suddenly quit?

260
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,245
The dashboard camera
was from his car, too.

261
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,165
Yes. Our lawyer's
looking for him right now.

262
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,750
How terrible.

263
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,961
The security guard could be the killer.

264
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,715
I really hope
we find the real killer soon.

265
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,094
But...

266
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,014
where's Ms. Han?

267
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,519
Why isn't she here?

268
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,439
We agreed to visit to see how you were,

269
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,065
then go and see U-ju.

270
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,650
Ms. Han said...

271
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,405
she'd visit U-ju?

272
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,243
Honey.

273
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,425
How can I face him?

274
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,845
Should I just not go?

275
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,890
What excuse could I give?

276
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,647
Hi.

277
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,609
I'm sorry. About today...

278
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,653
Did something happen between
you and Dr. Hwang?

279
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,073
What do you mean?

280
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,284
When I mentioned that you were
coming with us to see U-ju,

281
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,203
he seemed a bit angry.

282
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,538
Why would he object to you
visiting his son?

283
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,706
Isn't that odd?

284
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,710
Dr. Hwang isn't at all a rude person.

285
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,588
Weren't you mistaken?

286
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,632
Nothing happened between us.

287
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,636
I'm about to leave right now.

288
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,305
Okay.

289
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,308
That's strange.

290
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,310
Is something going on?

291
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,355
I have a feeling
that something's going on.

292
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,786
Please don't tell U-ju that I'm sick...

293
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,371
Don't you worry.

294
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,748
We'll tell him that you're eating well

295
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,251
and that you're doing just fine.

296
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,548
Do you want us to give him a message?

297
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,176
Tell him that I'll visit tomorrow,
so he doesn't need to worry...

298
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,949
I believe that one day,
you will reveal the truth.

299
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,870
Thank you

300
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,956
for going with them.

301
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,753
Look after yourself. See you.

302
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,306
Get in.

303
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,188
Su-im.

304
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,939
Rest well and don't worry.

305
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,859
Dr. Hwang, don't skip your meals.

306
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
Okay.

307
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,435
U-ju.

308
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,316
Hello.

309
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,361
Goodness.

310
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,989
You must have been really distressed.

311
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,660
Are you eating at all?

312
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,667
I know

313
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,461
that you're innocent.

314
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,755
That's right.

315
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,884
Everyone in Sky Castle
knows you're innocent.

316
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,636
We all do.

317
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,974
Thank you.

318
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,851
Oh, dear.

319
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,730
Please look after my mom for me.

320
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,528
When I was young,

321
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,865
I was really nasty to her.

322
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,079
I guess

323
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,792
I'm being punished for being
such a bad son.

324
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,839
I used to throw a fit
and knock over the table.

325
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,593
I'd scream and break things.

326
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,475
I was always thinking of ways
to upset her.

327
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,940
I had no idea.

328
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,609
I thought your mom

329
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,446
had absolutely nothing to worry about.

330
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,448
U-ju.

331
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,533
Be strong.

332
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,994
The day will come
when you can smile about the past.

333
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,412
Yes, U-ju.

334
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,914
You can't cover the sky
with the palm of your hand.

335
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,043
The truth will come out one day.

336
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,590
Thank you.

337
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,639
JEONGSEON MEDICAL CENTER

338
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,349
-How about here?
-That hurts.

339
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,102
DOCTOR PARK SU-CHANG

340
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,021
Where does it not hurt?

341
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,148
Oh, dear.

342
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,527
I ache all over.

343
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,445
-My goodness.
-Give me a drug that will kill me.

344
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,571
Oh, dear.

345
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,783
You need to live for a long time.

346
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,828
I saw your x-ray, and you're just fine.

347
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,872
If you drink to sleep better,
your head will hurt more.

348
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,883
What should I do now?

349
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,804
I always got perfect scores in my exams.

350
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,732
But I don't know the answer
to problems like this.

351
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,694
Think simply.

352
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,488
The right answer is always simple.

353
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,199
Those who are sick should be treated,

354
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,619
and no one should be victimized.

355
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:12,917
Right.

356
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,795
If you don't do anything about it,
your daughter will get sick.

357
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,840
She'll get really sick, and you might not
be able to cure her later.

358
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,676
Cut out the rotten parts now.

359
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,512
You must do it while you still can.

360
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,222
I couldn't do it.

361
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,642
That's why I lost my wife

362
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,897
and made Yeong-jae
go through all that ordeal.

363
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,028
I'm afraid that Ye-seo

364
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,490
may resent me if I do something.

365
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,284
Hye-na ended up like that because of me.

366
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,120
-And if Ye-seo--
-It'll be hard for your wife and Ye-seo

367
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,706
to let go of what they're holding.

368
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,250
But you see, life is long.

369
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,960
Don't be shortsighted.

370
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,921
Think about 10 or 20 years from now.

371
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,964
University?

372
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,759
In my opinion, it's not a big deal at all.

373
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,262
But the guilt of turning
an innocent person into a murderer

374
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,640
will haunt her for the rest of her life.

375
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,975
Why would you want your daughter
to carry such a burden?

376
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,603
Do you think Ye-seo

377
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,606
will thank her parents for their
shortsightedness down the road?

378
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,901
There's the saying,
"You reap what you sow."

379
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,947
It's so true.

380
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,942
I guess

381
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,655
I'm being punished for being
such a bad son.

382
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,966
-Hello?
-Ms. Han.

383
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,802
Ye-seo's phone is off.
We can't get a hold of her.

384
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,970
Ye-seo?

385
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,973
Okay, I'll look for her.

386
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,934
Miss.

387
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,812
-Yes, ma'am.
-Ye-seo isn't back yet, right?

388
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,607
She got home a while ago.

389
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,317
-She's home now?
-Yes.

390
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,909
Thanks for believing me.

391
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,755
Ye-seo.

392
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,430
Mom.

393
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,433
What should I do now?

394
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,814
I came straight home from school.

395
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,776
I can't bring myself to go to the lessons.

396
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,321
I can't even go to Coach Kim's office.

397
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,370
But then again, I can't go
to the police station either.

398
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,835
What should I do?

399
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,882
I can't be like this
knowing that U-ju is behind bars.

400
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,767
I know.

401
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,478
I...

402
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,481
understand how you feel.

403
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,026
I really do.

404
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,373
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT,
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT

405
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,499
All this

406
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,960
is the outcome of our hard work

407
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,504
over the years.

408
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,967
Since you were four years old,

409
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,762
for the past 15 long years,

410
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,392
you and I, the two of us...

411
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,019
DOCTOR KANG YE-SEO

412
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,146
The two of us accomplished this together.

413
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,191
Ye-seo.

414
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,903
Can you give this up?

415
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,077
Think about everything we've done
to accomplish this.

416
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,206
Over the years,

417
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:07,045
we've never gotten
more than four hours of sleep.

418
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,302
I've never let loose and had fun.

419
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,471
I've never played any games
in my entire life.

420
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,432
We've never gone on vacation.

421
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,938
I've really done my very best, Mom.

422
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,193
I really want to get into
SNU's med school.

423
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,072
Why do I have to be torn about this?

424
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,038
I know, Ye-seo.

425
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,833
Let's hang in there
for just one more semester.

426
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,128
If we manage to get through
the first semester,

427
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:55,426
you'll be able to wear this gown
that you've always wanted to wear.

428
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,804
Only if we can get through
the first semester.

429
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,142
Am I really going to be okay?

430
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,561
Mom, if I can get through
just one more semester,

431
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,606
I'll be fine, right?

432
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,906
Of course.

433
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,451
You'll be fine.

434
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,436
Are you out of your mind?

435
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,108
Boys, you're in your senior year.

436
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,194
Why are you wasting
your time like this? A petition?

437
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,197
What on earth are you thinking?

438
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,615
U-ju is also in his senior year.

439
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,035
That model student with good grades
is wasting his time behind bars.

440
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,830
He must be devastated.
We must help him in any way we can.

441
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,999
Do you think petitions have legal force?

442
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,501
It's all useless.
It's a complete waste of your time.

443
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,962
-Our friend is in trouble...
-"Friend"?

444
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,298
Hwang U-ju is your friend?

445
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,675
How could you consider a murderer
your friend?

446
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,969
I'm baffled.

447
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,637
How could you call him a murderer?

448
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,432
Don't you know
the presumption of innocence?

449
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,142
Since he hasn't been convicted yet--

450
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,520
The presumption of innocence is just
a principle applied in criminal cases.

451
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,398
Gosh. Fine.

452
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,943
Let's say he didn't do it.
Even if that's the case,

453
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,362
he has already been eliminated
from this race.

454
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,032
He won't be released
until the real culprit turns himself in.

455
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:41,949
University?

456
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,994
It's already all over for him.
He's just...

457
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,372
He's just like a bad card in your hand
that you should get rid of.

458
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,000
What kind of nonsense is that?

459
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,505
Hey, don't even talk
to an old, stuffy man like him.

460
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,175
It's impossible to get through to him.
Why bother?

461
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,384
You should just ignore him.

462
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,012
His anger will exhaust him eventually.

463
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,513
Okay, bye.

464
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,681
See you later, Mom.

465
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,439
Honey! You'd better stay focused.

466
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,192
Do you want the twins
to become a failure like her?

467
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,318
Dad.

468
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,528
Did you just call me a failure?

469
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,161
What?

470
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,372
What's wrong with what I said?

471
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:33,042
Why am I a failure?
You're the one who has failed.

472
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,045
They say your life is successful
if you're respected by your children.

473
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,255
Hey, twins.

474
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,006
Do you guys respect Dad?

475
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,966
Respect?

476
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,676
I'd love to respect him if I could.

477
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,637
I want to respect him, too.

478
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,473
Dad, you heard that, right?

479
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,559
You're the failure, not me.

480
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,311
I pity you the most, Dad.

481
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,897
You're a total failure.
You're at rock bottom. An epic failure.

482
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,274
Shut your mouth!

483
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,652
You brat, how dare you!

484
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,654
-Honey.
-You coddle her too much.

485
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,157
That's why she can be so proud
even after conning everyone.

486
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,701
I want to talk to you about something.

487
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,202
Go have a seat.

488
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,956
Se-ri, go have a seat. Boys, you too.

489
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,249
-Okay.
-Okay, Mom.

490
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,176
How dare you order your husband
to sit down?

491
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,262
Just say it.

492
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,263
Then

493
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,223
will you just stand there and listen?

494
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,058
Just say it. Go ahead and say it.

495
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,143
I...

496
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,022
really can't live with you anymore.

497
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,276
What?

498
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,237
How do you guys feel?

499
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,117
I can't live with Dad, either.

500
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,411
Same here.

501
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,206
I can't, either.

502
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,045
You can't live with me?

503
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,216
-What are you doing right now?
-Cha Min-hyeok.

504
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,677
I want

505
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,388
a divorce.

506
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,448
I have several conditions.

507
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,162
Get rid of that pyramid right now,

508
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,916
and stop forcing your educational
values and life values on them.

509
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,086
I also want you to stop demoralizing
the kids by calling them a failure.

510
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,213
I want you to respect the kids
and treat them exactly how

511
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,715
you'd like to be treated.

512
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,597
What?

513
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,726
If you don't accept
those conditions I just mentioned,

514
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,312
I'm going to get a divorce.

515
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,814
Do you understand?

516
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,444
Se-ri, go to work.

517
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,530
You guys should go upstairs.

518
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,243
-Goodnight, Mom.
-Bye.

519
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:18,499
I'm going to go to bed.

520
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,850
This is unbelievable.

521
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,686
I can't...

522
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,397
I can't believe this.

523
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,696
So you're saying Dr. Hwang

524
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,782
glared at Ye-seo's mother
when she said she'll visit U-ju?

525
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,285
"You mean bitch."

526
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,412
Did he glare at her like this?

527
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,414
Yes, just like that.

528
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,748
So you think

529
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,585
Ye-seo's mother hired
the guesthouse security guard,

530
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,629
asked him to kill Hye-na,
and framed it on U-ju?

531
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,385
Goodness, how could you think
of something so horrible?

532
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,554
You don't know anything.

533
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:17,433
Seo-jin would even jump
into a fire pit for Ye-seo.

534
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,436
If Hye-na kept provoking Ye-seo

535
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,646
and made Ye-seo's grades go down,

536
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,982
she would've done something
to take care of that.

537
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:25,900
There's no doubt.

538
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,693
But even so, she couldn't have killed...

539
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,238
Are you mad? That's nonsense.

540
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,407
But then again, you're right.
It is nonsense.

541
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,285
Then why did Dr. Hwang
glare at her like that?

542
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,078
He would never glare at anyone like that.

543
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,956
I've never seen him so angry at someone.

544
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,542
When did you exchange
so many looks with him?

545
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,090
Do you know everything about him
just by seeing the look in his eyes?

546
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,384
Gosh, is that important right now?

547
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,512
Yes, it's important. It's important to me.

548
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,305
Wait.

549
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,808
Seo-jin also seemed very intimidated
when Dr. Hwang glared at her.

550
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,393
It's so strange.

551
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,395
I'm sure there's something going on.

552
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,398
There must be something
very serious going on.

553
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,835
Mom.

554
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,339
Ye-seo, what's wrong?

555
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,423
Gosh,

556
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,592
you're sweating so much.

557
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,554
It's okay.

558
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,015
It's okay. Everything's fine.

559
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,434
There, there. It's okay.

560
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,814
It's okay.

561
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,983
It's okay, Ye-seo.

562
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,528
How can he be so irresponsible?

563
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,822
How could he just apply for a leave
and disappear

564
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,699
when he didn't even make
the budget execution plan?

565
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,326
The hospital isn't getting managed
properly because he's gone.

566
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,829
Well, sir...

567
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,000
-He has his reasons--
-What reason could he have

568
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,043
for not calling
and keeping his phone turned off?

569
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,632
Well, the thing is...

570
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,846
Then are you saying in order to save
my grandson, Dr. Kang...

571
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,349
He's in extreme shock right now.

572
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,026
-Okay, you may leave.
-Yes, sir.

573
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,491
I can't talk to him

574
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,786
about Congressman Kim Hyeok-jae
after what happened.

575
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,929
Hello, Director Choi. How may I help you?

576
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,099
Professor Cha,
I managed to get my hands on

577
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,395
a very expensive bottle of Chinese
alcohol that's 60 years old.

578
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,564
So how about you, me,

579
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,692
and Congressman Kim
get together for a drink?

580
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,696
I'm sorry, but I'm really busy these days.

581
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,990
I'm sorry.

582
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,164
I already did enough for him.
He should do the rest himself.

583
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,832
Why is he asking me for more?

584
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,842
A divorce?

585
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,472
How dare you even say something like that?

586
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:48,477
You completely ruined my dignity
in front of the kids.

587
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,773
"Do you want to live with Dad?"

588
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,193
You've been saying this all night.
Aren't you sick of it already?

589
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,779
You are unbelievable.

590
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,906
When did I say this all night?

591
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,543
A divorce? She must be out of her mind.

592
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,586
How could she dare say
something like that?

593
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,759
And how could she ask the kids
if they want to live with me?

594
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:27,057
She completely destroyed my dignity.

595
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,436
A divorce?

596
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,604
How dare you say that word?

597
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,398
How can you sleep?

598
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,066
How in the world can you sleep?

599
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,695
How can you sleep after behaving
like that in front of the kids?

600
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,990
Wake up.

601
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,368
You said you have a meeting
with the Minister of Justice

602
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,911
and the law school professors today.

603
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,623
I'll listen to this recording
until you feel better.

604
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,168
So you should stop talking and go to work.

605
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,713
You recorded that?

606
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,424
You really enjoy recording things,
don't you?

607
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,844
I should record everything
since I might even go to court with you.

608
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,845
Go to court?

609
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,763
Do you think I'll let that happen?

610
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,974
Stop talking nonsense.

611
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,684
If you don't want to get divorced,

612
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,770
you just need to accept
the conditions I proposed.

613
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,191
I'm a law school professor.

614
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,112
You're going to file a lawsuit against me?

615
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,115
Do you think you'll win?
I never did anything to cause the divorce.

616
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,326
We

617
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,703
will have to see about that.

618
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,707
I mean, it's not like
I ever cheated on you,

619
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,502
gambled, or never gave you
any living expenses.

620
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,378
Plus, I never even used
violence on you either.

621
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,088
Verbal violence is also
considered as violence.

622
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,882
Cut the nonsense.

623
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,552
I want you to write a ten-page
letter of repentance

624
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,930
until I come back home.

625
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,890
Tell the kids to write it, too.

626
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,643
It should be written on A4 paper,
and the font size should be 11.

627
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,232
If you don't write it,
I'll kick all of you out of here.

628
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,749
Honey.

629
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,251
I'll drive.

630
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,295
-You can't drive yet.
-No, it's okay.

631
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,048
If you join, we might not be able
to have a deep conversation.

632
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,758
I'll just go by myself.

633
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,302
What if you get stomach cramps again?

634
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,012
I'll just drive.

635
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,015
-I won't go inside.
-Okay, fine. Let's hurry up.

636
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,787
Are you

637
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,582
the one from Fairfax?

638
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,083
Yes.

639
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,168
Ms. Lee Su-im?

640
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,758
I thought it very strange.

641
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,136
She was definitely Jennifer,

642
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,306
but Ms. Han insisted she wasn't.

643
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,186
Even though she was cleared of
the charges and was released,

644
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,314
I heard that the Koreans there
still believed

645
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,150
she was the one who killed her husband.

646
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,861
Why was that?

647
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,744
She had a clear reason to kill him.

648
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,080
Their relationship was so bad
that they were about to divorce.

649
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,291
Her husband tried to take custody
of their daughter.

650
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,918
She killed him for that?

651
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,130
She valued her daughter
more than her life.

652
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,757
K was a genius.

653
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,343
She got into George Washington
University at the age of nine.

654
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,219
The chancellor

655
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,848
was so sure she'd be the next Einstein.

656
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,894
All the moms in Fairfax
treated her like a queen.

657
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,064
Not just the Koreans
but the Americans, too.

658
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,816
She was our community's pride.

659
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,120
Her husband tried to take custody
of the child she was so proud of,

660
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,832
so she killed her husband
and made it look like an accident.

661
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,128
What evidence do they have
to back that up?

662
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:29,341
They had drifted apart
and had lived separately already.

663
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,009
On the day of the accident,

664
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,387
her husband came to take his things.

665
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,057
No. K!

666
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,809
No!

667
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:42,229
K!

668
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,980
No!

669
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,096
As soon as the car left,

670
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,933
Jennifer ran after it like crazy,
and someone saw that.

671
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,436
She screamed for K.

672
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,148
As if she knew there would be an accident.

673
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,776
She could've just been
trying to get her daughter back.

674
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,237
Isn't that why she was
cleared of suspicion?

675
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,822
That could be true.

676
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:37,284
But the guilt and loss she felt
after ruining the future

677
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,952
of her genius daughter...

678
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,330
That's the only thing
that explains her behavior.

679
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,000
Think about it.

680
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,918
She wanted to kill her husband

681
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,254
to keep custody of her smart daughter.

682
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:52,466
But what if K got into her dad's car
without her mom knowing?

683
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,342
What if her husband died

684
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,136
and her daughter

685
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,722
became mentally impaired?

686
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:04,269
Nothing would have consoled the guilt
and loss she felt.

687
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,773
That doesn't mean it's okay to ruin
other people's kids and families.

688
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:09,858
What about Hye-na?

689
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,068
Why did Coach Kim kill Hye-na?

690
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,364
Since Hye-na had no family to lose,

691
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,450
there would be another reason.

692
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,410
That reason might be...

693
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,874
what's holding Seo-jin back.

694
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,221
You go home first.

695
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,059
Honey, why? Where are you going?

696
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,302
Why did you take a day off?

697
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,806
What are you

698
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,392
trying to avoid?

699
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,108
Let's talk later.

700
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,526
Later?

701
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,821
My innocent son's in a cell,
and you say later?

702
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,824
My family's in turmoil,
and you want to wait?

703
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,458
If you wanted to crush people
in order to become the director,

704
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,836
why didn't you just crush me?

705
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,547
Why go after my innocent son?

706
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,926
You think you can hide after doing that?

707
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,221
Do you think you can
just turn a blind eye?

708
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,933
Honey! Don't do it. Stop it.

709
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,061
Let's go. Come on, stop it.

710
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,105
Let's go, come on.

711
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,190
-Are you even human?
-Don't.

712
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,818
-How can you call yourself human?
-Stop it.

713
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,321
-U-ju did nothing to deserve this!
-Let's go.

714
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,477
Ma'am.

715
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,062
Your husband's home.

716
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,188
Is he?

717
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,023
Will you clean this up?

718
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,906
What's gotten into Ye-seo?

719
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,159
She was such a neat freak.

720
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,612
Cut out the rotten parts now.

721
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,448
You must do it while you still can.

722
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,325
I couldn't do it.

723
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,578
That's why I lost my wife

724
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,125
and made Yeong-jae
go through all that ordeal.

725
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,932
If you wanted to crush people
in order to become the director,

726
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,184
why didn't you just crush me?

727
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,104
Why go after my innocent son?

728
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,189
You think you can hide after doing that?

729
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,860
Do you think you can
just turn a blind eye?

730
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,168
Mother.

731
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,671
-Where's Jun-sang?
-He just came home.

732
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,132
-What brings you here?
-He asked to see me.

733
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,176
Did he?

734
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,602
What tea would you like?

735
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,270
Just give me some cold water.

736
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,521
Okay.

737
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,371
You sit down, too.

738
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:16,956
I have something to say.

739
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,708
After I get Mother some water.

740
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,043
Sit down.

741
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,808
Do you agree with Seo-jin

742
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,395
that we should cover up Ye-seo's secret?

743
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,064
We should.

744
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,650
If word gets out that the exam was leaked,

745
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,985
not only will her life be ruined,

746
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,364
but yours will, too. And you've come
this far to become the planning manager.

747
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,408
Even if my life

748
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,578
is nothing but an empty shell,

749
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,666
despite that title?

750
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,504
What did you just say?

751
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,757
If only I had been more mature...

752
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:09,759
If I had known

753
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,762
to look around me

754
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,807
and behind me instead of
focusing solely on reaching the top,

755
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,227
I wouldn't have

756
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,188
killed Hye-na like that.

757
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,732
Do you call that repenting?

758
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,860
If you want to repent, do it properly.

759
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,070
I don't want to bring up the past,

760
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,656
but none of this would've happened
had you listened to me.

761
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,658
Hye-na wouldn't even have been born.

762
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,120
So it's all my fault?

763
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,665
Had you trusted me and waited patiently,

764
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,376
my relationship with Eun-hye
wouldn't have lasted that long.

765
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:47,005
You stepped in
and made things get out of hand.

766
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,089
So?

767
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,885
Are you saying you dated her
just to rebel against me?

768
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,351
I guess you're still emotional
from what happened.

769
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,354
-Let's talk another time.
-I'm going to resign

770
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,484
from Junam University Hospital.

771
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,111
-What did you say?
-Honey.

772
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,493
You'll do what? Have you lost your mind?

773
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,536
You've been through so much to get here.

774
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,371
You'll quit knowing
you'll be the next director?

775
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,626
Mom, when will you stop
pushing me onstage?

776
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,505
You've groomed and trimmed me,
and showed me off.

777
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,298
Haven't you received enough applause?

778
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,884
What?

779
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,262
"Groomed"?

780
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,348
Because you groomed me so much,

781
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:42,769
I lived almost 50 years
without knowing who I really am.

782
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,604
I've done so much to raise you well.

783
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,357
Thanks to me, you've been able
to enjoy a successful life

784
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,317
as a doctor at a university hospital.

785
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,693
And you're blaming me now?

786
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,905
Honey, what is your true self?

787
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,407
You're a son to Mother,
a father to Ye-seo and Ye-bin,

788
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,284
a husband to me,
and a university hospital doctor.

789
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,537
Isn't that who you are?
Who else would you be?

790
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,956
There is no Kang Jun-sang.

791
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,832
I don't know who I am.

792
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,919
I've been working toward the goal
of becoming the hospital director.

793
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,254
While pursuing that goal,

794
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,507
I ended up killing my own daughter.

795
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,885
Why is that title so important?
It doesn't even matter.

796
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,805
I have no idea who I am.

797
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,641
I feel like I'm nothing.

798
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:28,314
All right. Then how about
you request a leave of absence?

799
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,693
You can take some time off
until you pull yourself together.

800
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,487
No, just until Ye-seo
gets into university.

801
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,284
So you will send her to SNU?

802
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,786
We have to. She must get into
SNU no matter what.

803
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,622
-We need a third-generation--
-A third-generation doctor.

804
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,457
Why is that so important?

805
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:50,420
You turned Seo-jin into a crazy woman
obsessed with that.

806
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,796
That's the least she can do!

807
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,715
She lied about her family and education.

808
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,258
You and I

809
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,760
were the ones who caused that.

810
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,682
You and I

811
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,019
have lived our lives wrong.

812
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,032
Since I still have some shame left in me,

813
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,994
I cannot operate on patients
at the hospital

814
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,913
where I killed my own daughter.

815
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,585
Do you not understand how I feel?

816
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,683
Right.

817
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,478
You only found out after she died
that she was your child.

818
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,937
You must be utterly devastated.

819
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,939
But when you become

820
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,984
the director of the hospital,
the position everyone looks up to,

821
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,111
and send Ye-seo to SNU's med school,

822
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,280
Hye-na

823
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,366
won't even cross your mind.

824
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,160
Aren't I right, Seo-jin?

825
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,372
Everyone will look up to me?

826
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,958
When will you stop caring only about
how you appear to others?

827
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,962
When will you stop obsessing
about what others think of you?

828
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,100
Seo-jin,

829
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,893
listen to me carefully.

830
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,646
If you and Ye-seo disclose

831
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,857
the exam paper leak yourselves
and beg for forgiveness,

832
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,651
Ye-seo won't be criticized

833
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,696
even if her name gets exposed
all over the Internet.

834
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,825
Su-chang advised me
not to be shortsighted.

835
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,787
He told me to think about
10 and 20 years from now.

836
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,373
Think about U-ju's life.

837
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,542
Do you think Ye-seo will be able

838
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,586
to live happily after ruining U-ju's life
if she manages

839
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,588
to get into SNU's med school?

840
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,052
It's your choice.

841
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,455
You ungrateful fool!

842
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,581
You fool.

843
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:34,625
Do you even know how much I've done
to raise you well?

844
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,962
I've done so much to raise you!

845
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,631
What? I've lived my life wrong?

846
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,468
How dare you betray me like this?

847
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,553
You absolutely can't quit.

848
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,098
If you want to submit
your letter of resignation,

849
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,767
you'll have to kill me first.

850
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,144
Kill me before you quit!

851
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,937
Kill me first. Just kill me.

852
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,815
Kill me before you quit!

853
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:01,027
Kill me first. Kill me before you quit.

854
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,653
Kill me first.

855
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,614
Kill me first.

856
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,876
Mother.

857
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,214
Even if

858
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,550
I don't become
the director of the hospital,

859
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,764
I'll still be your son, you know.

860
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:32,809
Can I...

861
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,686
just...

862
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,901
be your son?

863
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:45,256
The same goes for you.

864
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,511
Stop being so greedy.

865
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,811
Ye-seo's life

866
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:02,899
and yours are different.

867
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,295
Why are all the lights off?

868
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,651
Honey.

869
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,947
Honey!

870
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,340
Cha Seo-jun!

871
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,177
Cha Gi-jun!

872
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,912
Letter of repentance.

873
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:06,749
I regret marrying a man like Cha Min-hyeok

874
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:10,669
without even having a single deep
conversation about our values

875
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:14,965
just to get away
from my patriarchal father.

876
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,426
As a mother of three,

877
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:21,222
I failed to protect my children
from Cha Min-hyeok's

878
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:25,101
coercive and abusive educational methods
and neglected

879
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:28,229
my children's pain and suffering
for almost two decades.

880
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,023
I deeply regret my past decisions.

881
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,275
They say that broken tools
can be repaired,

882
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,153
but people cannot be fixed.
I ignored that saying

883
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,990
and did not give up hope on Cha Min-hyeok.

884
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:40,991
I...

885
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,284
wholeheartedly regret

886
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,079
thinking that way.

887
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,747
"P.S.

888
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,916
I'm leaving

889
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,294
the divorce papers on your desk.

890
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,798
Sign and submit them..."

891
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,351
The boys are in their senior year.

892
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,608
Their midterm exam
is just around the corner.

893
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:30,249
They can't be wasting even a second.

894
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,587
How dare she do this?

895
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:51,729
Seo-jin,

896
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,814
listen to me carefully.

897
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,900
If you and Ye-seo disclose

898
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,986
the exam paper leak yourselves
and beg for forgiveness,

899
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:00,905
Ye-seo won't be criticized

900
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,200
even if her name gets exposed
all over the Internet.

901
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:09,038
I've really done my very best, Mom.

902
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:12,833
I really want to get into
SNU's med school.

903
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,965
A third-generation doctor.

904
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,550
Why is that so important?

905
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:25,930
You turned Seo-jin into a crazy woman
obsessed with that.

906
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,410
KOREAN

907
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,626
MATH

908
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,549
ENGLISH

909
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,830
Did you not expect this outcome at all?

910
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:37,584
You told Ye-seo about the exam
paper leak without expecting this?

911
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,045
You should've

912
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,549
kept it from Ye-seo, no matter what.

913
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,301
She said she'd run to the police station

914
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:48,429
and tell the cops that she found
the key chain in this office

915
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,139
and that U-ju isn't the culprit.

916
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,599
How else was I supposed to stop her, then?

917
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,145
You should've calmed her down
and sent her to me.

918
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:58,939
She's been missing all the lessons.

919
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,151
Did you actually think she'd do well
on the test?

920
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:05,154
This isn't time to talk about
who's at fault. We need a plan.

921
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,697
Her midterm exam is coming up soon.

922
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,657
You promised me

923
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,785
that you'd make sure Ye-seo gets into SNU.

924
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,206
Of course.

925
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,083
Since I'm coaching her,

926
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,878
she must get accepted.

927
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,401
It contains Shin A High School's
midterm exam papers.

928
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,033
Once again,

929
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,412
Ye-seo will get perfect scores
in all subjects.

930
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,502
Su-chang advised me
not to be shortsighted.

931
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,670
Think about U-ju's life.

932
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,672
Do you think Ye-seo will be able

933
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,051
to live happily after ruining U-ju's life
if she manages

934
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,053
to get into SNU's med school?

935
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,600
It's your choice.

936
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,717
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL MIDTERM EXAM PAPERS

937
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:55,931
CONFIDENTIAL

938
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,773
K.

939
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,200
