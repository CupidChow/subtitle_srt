1
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,547
Can you even call yourself human?

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:48,965
Ye-bin,

3
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,425
be quiet.

4
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,302
You had no idea
that Hye-na is your daughter.

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,929
You didn't even go to her funeral.

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,434
You shouldn't even call yourself human.

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,482
What's she saying now? What?

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,858
Hye-na is what?

9
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,860
Hye-na is your daughter.

10
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,944
Go to your room!

11
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,030
I heard you went to Seonjae Island
with her mom.

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,991
You caught fish with her
and had a great time.

13
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,494
Don't you remember?

14
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,794
Seonjae Island?

15
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,589
What's she saying?

16
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,893
Is it...

17
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,855
Kim Eun-hye?

18
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,275
You're drunk. You should go to bed.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,693
I asked you to explain!

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,781
Is it true?

21
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,577
Let's go. We can talk in our room.

22
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,371
-I asked you if it's true!
-It is true!

23
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,543
Hye-na is your daughter.

24
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,033
How did you find out?

25
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,998
In Hye-na's room,

26
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,917
I found a photo of you and Kim Eun-hye.

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,379
She was fully aware that you're her dad

28
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,756
and moved into our place on purpose.

29
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,011
You said to me countless times

30
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,930
that she married another man
and even had a kid with him.

31
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,390
And now, you're saying...

32
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,392
Hye-na...

33
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,394
is my daughter?

34
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,897
I didn't know. I had no idea.

35
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,358
I never thought she'd back down
so easily when she had your child.

36
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,568
If you weren't certain,

37
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,404
why did you lie to me
that she had a child with another man?

38
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,572
I ran into her on the street.

39
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,449
She was with a kid,
so I assumed that was the case.

40
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,659
I'm sure you did a paternity test.

41
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,661
Then after confirming that,

42
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,914
you must have made her
keep her lips sealed.

43
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,416
Can't you think about
what it must have been like

44
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,919
to have had to look after your child
right in front of you?

45
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,463
That impudent brat
intentionally distressed me so much.

46
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,089
She kept upsetting Ye-seo as well!

47
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,507
You should've told me!

48
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,053
How could you keep
something like this from me?

49
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:42,013
You should've told me first!

50
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,891
Had you found out sooner,
things would've gotten out of hand.

51
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,644
You can't hold back your feelings
for our kids' sake, and Ye-seo

52
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,770
is a high school senior!

53
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,480
University!

54
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,398
That's all you think about.

55
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,693
I bet you didn't even care about Hye-na.

56
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,029
I know. I don't even have to see
what you did to her.

57
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,157
You must have been
incredibly mean and harsh to her.

58
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,492
That's why...

59
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,662
she couldn't even bring herself
to call me Dad before she died.

60
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,249
You should've at least told me
at the hospital!

61
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,627
You're the one who called her a nuisance.

62
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,673
Didn't you tell me that
I shouldn't have let her into our house?

63
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,010
What did you say when I asked you
to go to Hye-na's funeral with me?

64
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,596
You're the one who took her out of the OR

65
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,932
just so you could save
the hospital director's grandson.

66
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,102
You're the one...

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,272
who killed Hye-na.

68
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,689
Mr. Kang, have you also
been to Seonjae Island?

69
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,232
No, I haven't.

70
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,987
We could go fishing in Seonjae Island
and catch baby blowfish--

71
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,698
Let's be quiet when we're eating, okay?

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,457
Dr. Kang Jun-sang?

73
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,791
It's...

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,543
Eun-hye.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:36,961
Kim Eun-hye.

76
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,756
I need to ask you for a favor.

77
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,799
You've dialed the wrong number.

78
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,888
Hye-na's in bad shape too!

79
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,224
She's barely conscious and
the hematoma's so large, during transfer--

80
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,435
This boy is the director's grandson!

81
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,729
Will you take the blame
if something goes wrong?

82
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,701
Dad.

83
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,997
Dad.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,248
Are you threatening me?

85
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,958
Not at all.

86
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,043
I'm just asking

87
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:03,172
how Kang Ye-seo got perfect scores.

88
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,758
You gave her the exam questions, right?

89
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,012
Ye-bin.

90
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,932
What's this?

91
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,684
It belongs to Hye-na.

92
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,811
It's Hye-na's?

93
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,813
Then why do you have this?

94
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,816
Hye-na and I were going to bury it
in a time capsule.

95
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,491
But what does she mean
by stealing the exam papers?

96
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,327
Did Ye-seo get full marks
by stealing exam papers?

97
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,582
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

98
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,250
Hye-na was surely mistaken.

99
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,294
How does that make any sense?

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,881
If you...

101
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,676
go around talking about this
when you're not even sure of anything,

102
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,428
you'll end up ruining your sister's life.

103
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,929
She'll be done for.

104
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,392
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

105
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,314
And why did you tell your dad
when I clearly told you not to?

106
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,566
I was going to tell him
once your sister got into university.

107
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,694
How could you ask your dad
if he could call himself human?

108
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,530
Have you thought about how miserable
that would make him feel?

109
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,462
Are you threatening me?

110
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,172
Not at all.

111
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,174
I'm just asking

112
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,178
how Kang Ye-seo got perfect scores.

113
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,472
You gave her the exam questions, right?

114
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,351
I sneaked into her room
before the final exam

115
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,103
and peeked at a few pages
of the questions you gave her.

116
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,274
You changed the numbers and wordings

117
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,611
and added a few more problems to mask it.

118
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,281
It seems like Ye-seo really believes
they are expected questions

119
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,993
with a 100 percent accuracy rate
since she trusts you so much.

120
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,246
Who is it?

121
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,457
Who in our school

122
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,793
is working with you?

123
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,753
Do you...

124
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,298
fear nothing?

125
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,261
Why wouldn't I?

126
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,931
I'm scared that I don't have any money.

127
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,308
I'm also scared that I don't have a home,

128
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,311
and that I don't have a mom.

129
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,856
There are tons of things I'm scared of.

130
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,025
You must be scared that your dad
might not acknowledge you

131
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,319
as his daughter too, right?

132
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,702
Fine.

133
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,746
What is it you want?

134
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,415
Make sure that Ye-seo

135
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,418
doesn't get into SNU's med school.

136
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,005
I'll get in with my own skills.

137
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,882
You just have to make her fail.

138
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,052
You already know that I am

139
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,805
Dr. Kang's daughter, don't you?

140
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,350
After all, we're sisters.

141
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,477
So I can't be too harsh on her.

142
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,230
It's not like Ye-seo knew anything either.

143
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,817
Are you sure it's not because
you're scared that your dad

144
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,946
might end up hating you
if he finds out that you reported Ye-seo?

145
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,451
Do you think your dad and grandma
will accept you as their family

146
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,578
if you get into SNU's med school

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,371
instead of Ye-seo?

148
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,831
Is that why you're doing this?

149
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,335
Yes, that's right.

150
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,795
I'll get into SNU's med school
without an exam coordinator

151
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,298
and prove that I'm more competent
than Ye-seo

152
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,302
and that my mom's a lot better
than Ye-seo's mom.

153
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,140
What if I refuse?

154
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,441
The Education Office Reporting Center

155
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,109
and the Educational Call Center.

156
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,738
I can report you by either calling them
or sending them an email.

157
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,992
And if I upload a post

158
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,245
on our school's anonymous website
saying the school test got leaked,

159
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,581
everyone in our school
will find out eventually.

160
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,377
But I think it'd be better
to report this to the Education Office.

161
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,340
That will make the person
who cooperated with you tremble in fear.

162
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,345
You're very cute.

163
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,682
If you don't give me an answer
in three days,

164
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,061
I'm going to hand in
all the expected questions

165
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,814
you gave to Ye-seo including
our school's final test questions

166
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,857
as evidence.

167
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,151
You may leave now.

168
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,214
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL,
SOPHOMORE TEST QUESTIONS

169
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,688
EXPECTED QUESTIONS

170
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,585
Gosh, that bitch.

171
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,796
This is how she managed
my daughter's grades?

172
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,259
If Ye-seo got caught with this,
her life would've gotten ruined.

173
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,892
Then...

174
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,020
did Kim Ju-yeong...

175
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,481
kill Hye-na?

176
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,693
DOGOK STATION, EXIT 3

177
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,528
WILL YOU SEND THE EMAIL?

178
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,704
PLEASE ENTER THE PASSCODE

179
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,687
Ye-seo.

180
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,197
Ye-seo.

181
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,157
That...

182
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,493
Isn't it Hye-na's?

183
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,287
Did Hye-na

184
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,872
come here?

185
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,251
I don't know. How would I know that?

186
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,628
That

187
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,631
was hung on Hye-na's bag.

188
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,508
No, it's mine.

189
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,218
We had the same thing.

190
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,226
Ye-seo.

191
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,228
Ye-seo, let's talk.

192
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,563
Ye-seo.

193
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,398
Let's talk.

194
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,838
Ms. Kim, spare me some time...

195
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,092
You know that
U-ju's not the killer, don't you?

196
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,469
He had no reason to kill Hye-na.

197
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,598
Only Ye-seo and her mom do,

198
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,142
but not even Seo-jin can dupe the police.

199
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,351
No way.

200
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,395
Only you could make that possible.

201
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,355
It takes someone like you to plan--

202
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,191
You're a true novelist.
What an imagination you have.

203
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,407
You said you once had a kid
that was a blessing.

204
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,577
That she was a gift from the god.

205
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,456
I get that you couldn't handle the pain,

206
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,584
so you chose to say she had died.

207
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,588
But killing Hye-na too?

208
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,175
And framing my innocent son for it?

209
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,510
With what evidence do you say that?

210
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,431
You.

211
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,351
You met Hye-na, didn't you?

212
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,064
She came here, didn't she?

213
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,148
Not at all.

214
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,400
Why would she come here?

215
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,821
Fine. Shall I tell you what happened?

216
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,492
You and Seo-jin

217
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,411
had a reason to kill Hye-na.

218
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,580
That's why you joined forces.

219
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,459
Seo-jin wanted her husband's
illegitimate child out of the way.

220
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,628
And you...

221
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,340
had a secret that had to stay hidden.

222
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,386
That's why you lied to stop me
from writing about Yeong-jae.

223
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:12,721
Am I wrong?

224
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,306
You thought

225
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,934
Hye-na would expose your secret,

226
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,312
so you killed her.

227
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,821
The evidence says
your son did it for certain.

228
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,784
Who would believe you?

229
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,589
You ruined Jung-min and Yeong-jae

230
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,008
and killed Hye-na.

231
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,552
Now my son too?

232
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,597
Wait and see.

233
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,976
I will clear my son's name.

234
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,855
I will catch the real killer.

235
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,620
You said I would be punished by the gods.

236
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,627
You try living in a hell that
you can never escape from.

237
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,608
MR. JO: IT HAS BEEN DONE

238
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,820
I feel as if I'm in a trap.

239
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,615
For you to get out

240
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,076
without getting hurt,

241
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,662
you must tell me the truth
about everything honestly.

242
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,333
What do you want to say now?

243
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,127
At the guesthouse that night,

244
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,463
when Hye-na fell,

245
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,757
were you really listening
to an online lecture?

246
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,802
Yes. How many times must I tell you?

247
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,845
Just leave me alone.

248
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,598
You are my daughter.

249
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,017
Do you think Coach Kim
will protect you forever?

250
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,774
-Ye-seo.
-I was crying.

251
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,484
I was crying.

252
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,361
Do you know how upsetting that is?

253
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,696
-Before the mafia game,
-Let's stop this, then.

254
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,407
-I saw U-ju and Hye-na fight.
-Let's end things.

255
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,911
How can you say that so easily?

256
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,455
Don't you know how I feel?

257
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:47,292
Why does U-ju like her
when she doesn't even care for him?

258
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,629
Hye-na laughed and had fun
while we played Mafia.

259
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,382
U-ju looked so upset.

260
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,175
On his own birthday.

261
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,848
That upset me so much
that I cried in the master bathroom.

262
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,017
Is that true?

263
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,857
Why are you doing this?

264
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,527
This is exactly the reason
why I go to Coach Kim!

265
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,905
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

266
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,534
How could you suspect me?

267
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,829
Why would I suspect you?
You're my daughter.

268
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,497
Coach Kim...

269
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,876
I'm sorry. Sorry.

270
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,379
Oh, Mom.

271
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,468
This is Hye-na's.

272
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,180
I think she went to Coach Kim's office.

273
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,474
She was upset that Coach Kim
considered her as my study tool.

274
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,484
Really?

275
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,154
But Coach Kim said she never met Hye-na.

276
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,740
What do you think?

277
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,660
Kim Ju-yeong's the one who killed Hye-na.

278
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,122
And then...

279
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,585
she made my daughter
look suspicious to control me.

280
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,004
We'll need a scapegoat.

281
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,590
U-ju will get hurt.

282
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,217
She killed her herself and said...

283
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,719
U-ju will get hurt.

284
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,140
U-ju.

285
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,726
U-ju.

286
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,646
U-JU'S MOM

287
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,651
If word gets out
that the exams were leaked,

288
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,321
Ye-seo will end up with zero marks.

289
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,700
She'll have to drop out or be expelled.

290
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,244
Then SNU...

291
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,963
It's been two days, but he hasn't called.

292
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,883
I texted him to say I'm sorry,
but he hasn't replied.

293
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
What should we do, Mom?

294
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,179
He was the one in the wrong.

295
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,931
He did this to himself.

296
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,391
Why should we be worried?

297
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,852
Oh, so you're worried.

298
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,229
My little brother's worried about Dad?

299
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,898
Of course, he is.

300
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,235
It's my fault.

301
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,862
For whatever the reason,

302
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,114
I made you throw out your dad.

303
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,950
The shock must have been huge.

304
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,202
It's just been two days.

305
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,372
Are you repenting after two days,
not even two months?

306
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,834
You'll never beat him at this rate.

307
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,978
I told you not to rush out.

308
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,902
Where should it go?

309
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,072
Right here. Bring it over here.

310
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,323
Okay.

311
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,379
There.

312
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,300
Open it up, please.

313
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,561
What do you think? Isn't it fantastic?

314
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,449
-Take care.
-Thank you.

315
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,829
From now on, I want you guys

316
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,540
to look at the top of this pyramid
whenever you walk by it.

317
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,127
Until the image is engraved
in your subconsciousness.

318
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,628
Got it?

319
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,298
Why aren't you guys answering?

320
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,592
I barely managed to hold in my anger.

321
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,805
I thought of getting
this custom-made pyramid as part

322
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,933
of my prayer for your success
and brought it all the way home.

323
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,476
Cha Gi-jun!

324
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,067
I'm happy you broke that little pyramid.

325
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,486
You're young and full of energy.
I understand why you broke it.

326
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,197
You guys can totally pick up
your stuffy old father and...

327
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,991
Let go of me!

328
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,494
How have you been educating them?

329
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,996
This is wrong!

330
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,914
This is immoral!

331
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,875
I understand.

332
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,751
You guys can rebel.

333
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,669
Studying?

334
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,797
I get that you won't always want to study.

335
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,048
However,

336
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,802
parents must still urge
their children to study.

337
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,054
Even if the children rip their books
to pieces,

338
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,891
their parents ought to get them new books.

339
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,475
And if they break their pencils,

340
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,103
their parents ought to put new ones
in their hands.

341
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,314
Dad, it's not like we don't study.

342
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,107
We get good enough grades.

343
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,776
Yes, you do. I'm aware.
But I just want you guys...

344
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,197
to study a little harder, that's all.

345
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,406
That way, the Level One...

346
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,285
Right there.

347
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,207
Only then will you be able
to reach the top.

348
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,379
Yes.

349
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,218
Okay, we heard you.

350
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,844
Good.

351
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,935
Did you say the cold wind
would knock some sense into Dad?

352
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,437
I told you it wouldn't work, right?

353
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,248
This one is unbreakable.

354
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,463
Su-han,

355
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,215
send it again.

356
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,300
Just one more so that
we can make sure they're okay.

357
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,385
Mom.

358
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,429
I've sent her four texts,
but she's not responding.

359
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,265
She's ignoring them all.

360
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,518
Something must have happened.

361
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,353
What do I do?

362
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,147
Oh, my gosh.

363
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,067
Honey, yes.

364
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,194
Ye-seo's dad?

365
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,156
I told you to keep your lips sealed,
didn't it?

366
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,367
He's the planning manager
and the chief of the center.

367
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,203
After getting all those titles,
he took the day off.

368
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,831
His phone is off as well.

369
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,875
The minister is visiting
the hospital today.

370
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,211
I can't believe he's not coming in
and even turned his phone off.

371
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,006
This is very serious.

372
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,924
Gosh, what should we do?

373
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,384
The bomb must have gone off last night.

374
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,970
I bet Ye-bin told him.

375
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,140
Jin, Jin.

376
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,850
Everyone's saying he removed Hye-na

377
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,020
from the OR because he wants
to be the next director of the hospital.

378
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,188
He must be devastated now.

379
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,232
I mean, he only found out now
that she's his daughter.

380
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,109
Even I'd go crazy
if I were in his position.

381
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,819
Do you think he'd want to come to work?

382
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:58,158
Then if he decides to leave the hospital,
what about us? What will happen to us?

383
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,326
What do you think?

384
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,455
I don't know. I have no idea,

385
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,875
so you'll have to sort this out
no matter what.

386
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,294
You're such a bigmouth. I have to go!

387
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,133
What should I do?

388
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,386
What if no one has our back in the future?

389
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,971
Gosh.

390
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,224
I have no time to waste like this.

391
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:34,569
YOUNGLIM INDUSTRIAL INC.

392
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:39,491
Hello, you can view decors from the door
to the kitchen in this showroom.

393
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,159
Please let us know if you need anything.

394
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,202
Okay.

395
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,120
Tell me if you spot anything you like.

396
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,458
Mom, are you serious about this?

397
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,669
Your dad came home with another pyramid,

398
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,381
so I think this is the only way.

399
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,091
The boys are high school seniors,
you know.

400
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,094
That's precisely why Dad will be livid
if he finds out.

401
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,388
And what will you do if this doesn't work?

402
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,640
Will you divorce Dad or what?

403
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,018
I should mentally prepare myself for that.

404
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,312
This is my last resort.

405
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,357
I really hope this works.

406
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,695
By the way, do you want
to redo the entire decor?

407
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,532
Shall we take a look
at kitchen cabinets and sink first?

408
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,701
I'm sick of all-black decor.

409
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,122
This is so bright and nice, Se-ri.

410
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,416
-Hello.
-Hello.

411
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,302
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL,
SOPHOMORE TEST QUESTIONS

412
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,267
Where's Seo-jin?

413
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,519
Seo-jin.

414
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,230
Seo-jin.

415
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,024
I heard Dr. Kang took the day off

416
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,651
and even turned his phone off.

417
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,362
Gosh, Yang-u is so worried about him.

418
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,741
I guess you didn't know?

419
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,368
What should we do?

420
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,996
It was a big shock for him, right?

421
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,039
It must have been.

422
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,542
He has found out about Hye-na,
so he must be--

423
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,668
Is this fun for you?

424
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,422
Seo-jin,

425
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,174
what do you mean?

426
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,592
How could you say that?

427
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,469
I didn't even get any sleep

428
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,138
because I was so worried all night,
knowing Ye-bin had found out.

429
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,307
You may think you're doing this
out of genuine concern,

430
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,350
but you're sprinkling salt on my wound.

431
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,728
Don't bring it up ever again
unless you want me to think that.

432
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,316
What?

433
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,234
This again?

434
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,158
HUSBAND

435
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:15,647
KIM HYE-NA, OCTOBER 23, 2001
TO FEBRUARY 27, 2019

436
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,866
Your dad is here, Hye-na.

437
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,411
Gosh, Hye-na...

438
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,249
Goodness.

439
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,555
Where are you now?

440
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,558
I'm at Millow Hotel for a massage.

441
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,102
Why do you ask? Did something happen?

442
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,729
I'll meet you at the cafe
on the second floor of the hotel.

443
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,774
I'll be there in an hour.

444
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,359
Jun-sang.

445
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,288
Yes, Mother.

446
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,123
Jun-sang sounds upset.

447
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,374
Did something happen?

448
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,628
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

449
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,591
You remember the girl, Hye-na,
who had moved into our place

450
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,384
as Ye-bin's live-in tutor, right?

451
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,511
The girl who died in the guest house?

452
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,722
She is...

453
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,641
Jun-sang's daughter.

454
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,226
What?

455
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,688
What do you mean...

456
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,153
She's Jun-sang's daughter?

457
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,906
Mother, you're the only one
who can help him pull himself together.

458
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,618
If he keeps being that emotional
and causes trouble,

459
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,078
I'll be too anxious
since Ye-seo is in her senior year--

460
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,747
I don't want to hear
about how upset you are.

461
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,956
Just explain what happened.

462
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,043
Hye-na's mother...

463
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,671
is Kim Eun-hye, Jun-sang's first love.

464
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,631
What?

465
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,217
You had no idea and let that girl
move into your place?

466
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,638
She deliberately moved in to live
with us knowing that he's her dad.

467
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,514
I really had no idea.

468
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,266
Are you kidding me?

469
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,101
How could you let this happen?

470
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,146
Mother, is Hye-na my daughter?

471
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,190
Your son is fully responsible for it.

472
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,776
I've been doing my best
to sort things out.

473
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,736
Don't you understand
I had to keep it a secret

474
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,821
to make sure Ye-seo isn't distracted?

475
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,704
-It's been a long time.
-It's nice to see you.

476
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,456
-I'm meeting my son here.
-Oh, really?

477
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,832
-She's here to see her son.
-Yes.

478
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,584
-All right.
-See you around.

479
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,389
You haven't had breakfast, right?

480
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,475
The onion soup here is pretty good.
Do you want some?

481
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,435
You heard that Hye-na
is my daughter, right?

482
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,690
One bowl of onion soup, please.

483
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,609
She was brought to the hospital,

484
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,696
and I knew she could die
while she was being transferred.

485
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,906
But I was blinded by my ambition--

486
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,408
How's that your fault?

487
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,868
She may have been your daughter.

488
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,454
But you're a doctor who saved

489
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,873
a nine-year-old boy who was
in a more critical condition than her.

490
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,876
I'm trying to tell you
that you did nothing wrong.

491
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,586
You're always like this.

492
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,463
Okay, fine.

493
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,382
Then give me an answer.

494
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,510
-Jun-sang.
-What should I do now?

495
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,763
You told me to study hard,

496
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,724
so I became the top student
in the entire country.

497
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,560
You told me to go to med school,
so I became a doctor!

498
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,854
And you told me
to become the hospital director,

499
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,399
so I was so caught up
in trying to get promoted...

500
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,694
that I ended up killing Hye-na
without even knowing

501
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,196
that she was my daughter!

502
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,701
What am I going to do now?

503
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,747
I killed her without even knowing
that she was my daughter.

504
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,042
So how do you expect me
to continue being a doctor?

505
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,376
How?

506
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,924
No one's a better doctor than you are.

507
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,802
You achieve the highest performance
at the hospital every year.

508
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,138
You're the planning manager
as well as the chief.

509
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,932
And you'll soon become the director.
You lack absolutely nothing.

510
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,395
Mom!

511
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,814
How many times must I tell you
that it's not your fault?

512
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,484
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

513
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,403
What kind of attitude is this
in front of all the other customers?

514
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,156
Is it so important to keep your reputation
even in this mess?

515
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,034
You're the one who made me who I am now.

516
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,953
I couldn't even recognize my own child

517
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,789
because I was blinded by my ambition.

518
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,374
What's so great
about becoming the hospital director?

519
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,464
I'll be turning 50 soon,

520
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,552
but I don't even know
how to live my own life because of you!

521
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,876
U-ju.

522
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,005
Did you eat?

523
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,556
Do you sleep well?

524
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,185
You need to force yourself...

525
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,521
to eat and sleep well.

526
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,362
This isn't your fault.

527
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,156
Hye-na didn't die...

528
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,075
because of you.

529
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,704
So don't be discouraged.

530
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,040
You need to stay strong.

531
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:56,964
Do you remember

532
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,800
walking along the Baekdudaegan
Mountain Range with me?

533
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,555
Just when we were about
to reach the peak of Joryeongsan,

534
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,891
I told you that I couldn't do it anymore,

535
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,809
you told me.

536
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,648
"Let's overcome this moment."

537
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,818
You told me that we should never give up.

538
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,153
Do you remember that?

539
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,870
U-ju.

540
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,540
This is just one
of the many hardships in life.

541
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,005
Let's...

542
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,967
overcome this hardship.

543
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,720
Together with your mom and dad.

544
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,557
Let's overcome it together.

545
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,476
Okay?

546
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,773
Okay.

547
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,653
Okay.

548
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,588
That's right, U-ju.

549
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,009
Let's overcome it together.

550
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,108
It's all my fault.

551
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,910
U-ju's going through this mess
all because of me.

552
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,912
It's my fault.

553
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,373
No.

554
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,209
Why is that your fault?

555
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,420
If I didn't insist on writing my novel,

556
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,801
she wouldn't have framed
everything on U-ju.

557
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,888
I couldn't even protect my own kid.
Who am I to butt in?

558
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,808
I have no right.

559
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,025
We shouldn't be regretting
and blaming ourselves for this.

560
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,402
We need to...

561
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,530
fight against that woman.

562
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,992
I'll meet the security guard
of the guest house one more time.

563
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,370
In-gyu...

564
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,496
His name is In-gyu, right?

565
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,747
Yes.

566
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,833
You should get going, honey.

567
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,015
MOTHER

568
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,104
-Yes, Mother.
-I don't want to talk to you,

569
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,397
so I'll make it short.

570
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,858
If you want Jun-sang
to pull himself together,

571
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,193
you better get Ye-seo accepted
to SNU's Med School.

572
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,737
That's the fastest way
to make him forget about Hye-na.

573
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:49,989
Do you understand?

574
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,283
Yes.

575
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,434
If you don't give me an answer
in three days,

576
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,811
I'm going to hand in
all the expected questions

577
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,189
you gave to Ye-seo including
our school's final test questions

578
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,274
as evidence.

579
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,236
You stole the test questions, didn't you?

580
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,281
You already know the answer to that.

581
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,575
This is how you made my daughter
get the best grades in school?

582
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,078
Do you think I gave you billions of won
so that you could commit a crime?

583
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,334
As you already know,
Ye-seo is mentally fragile.

584
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,212
She became helpless once she found out...

585
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,506
that Hye-na was her dad's daughter.

586
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,050
You're the one who told me
to bring her into the house!

587
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,636
You said she needed Hye-na by her side
because she's mentally fragile!

588
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,721
And now, you're telling me
that she became helpless?

589
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,232
You kept on agitating Hye-na.

590
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,443
You're the one to blame for sabotaging

591
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,487
my perfect plan.

592
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,246
I had no choice
but to use my final option.

593
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,872
Because at all costs,

594
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,291
Ye-seo had to come first in her year.

595
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,256
The 100-percent acceptance rate
to SNU Med School.

596
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,133
Is this how you achieved it?

597
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,971
I wouldn't have to take such risks
with kids who are capable.

598
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,890
To get one in
who would never get in otherwise,

599
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,184
I had no choice but to do such things.

600
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,982
This must be how you got Yeong-jae in.

601
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,776
After he'd seen a psychiatrist for a year.

602
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,027
Ms. Han.

603
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,821
When Ye-seo was at her lowest point,

604
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,949
we ran a simulation
of the final exam and she placed

605
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,328
exactly 44th out of 100 students.

606
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,955
Could you have...

607
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,042
accepted that result?

608
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,252
Is that why...

609
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,507
you killed Hye-na to cover up your crime?

610
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,428
And then you played me
by insinuating Ye-seo had done it?

611
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,639
And you framed innocent U-ju?

612
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:24,977
Let's be honest.

613
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,898
Didn't I get rid of
a life-long burden of yours?

614
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:30,983
Shut your mouth!

615
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,068
How can you say that?

616
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,655
Why did you come to see me?

617
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,326
Since Ye-seo came first
with stolen exam papers,

618
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:44,038
do you want to come clean
and have her marks changed to zero?

619
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:44,955
Or will you

620
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,626
report me as Hye-na's real killer?

621
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,088
Report me right now

622
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,382
if you feel that sorry for U-ju.

623
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,634
If you do,

624
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,554
the issue of the leaked exam papers
will come to light

625
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,474
and Ye-seo will get zero marks
for that whole exam.

626
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:09,480
The other students' parents
in Shin A High will revolt and then...

627
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,524
Ye-seo will have to drop out

628
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,361
or end up being expelled.

629
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,656
SNU's med school?

630
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,284
She'll never be able to get in...

631
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,287
even under special circumstances.

632
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,582
You know that, don't you?

633
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,256
So you're telling me to shut up
about you being the real killer?

634
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,427
Do you think I'll let you be?

635
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,731
Kwak Mi-hyang.

636
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,576
You can't...

637
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:08,372
give up on getting your kid
into SNU's med school.

638
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,627
I will get her in for you.

639
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,630
You just...

640
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,799
be good.

641
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,634
Do

642
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,010
nothing.

643
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,763
As if you're dead.

644
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,691
Fine.

645
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,902
As you promised,

646
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,948
you'd better get Ye-seo in.

647
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:49,496
Don't you dare touch a hair
on my daughter's head.

648
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,749
If she goes through what Yeong-jae had to,

649
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,502
I will kill you myself.

650
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,717
Fine.

651
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,596
Of course.

652
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,641
That's reasonable.

653
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,813
You just...

654
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,566
have to trust me,

655
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,859
Ms. Han.

656
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,726
You can't give up on getting your kid
into SNU's Med School.

657
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,687
I will get her in for you.

658
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,606
Be good.

659
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,483
Do

660
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,692
nothing.

661
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,403
As if you're dead.

662
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,755
I'm sorry.

663
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,715
I was too rash.

664
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,511
I was so flustered
that I thought you were guilty.

665
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,264
I don't think you killed Hye-na.

666
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,187
Kim Ju-yeong.

667
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,606
Was it her?

668
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,904
I'm sure you think that she...

669
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,447
killed her.

670
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,326
So I thought about why you'd keep quiet.

671
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,120
Ye-seo's university admission?

672
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,997
It can't be.

673
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,498
I don't think so.

674
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,542
Even if that's a big deal,

675
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,295
who'd entrust her kid to a murderer?

676
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,673
You must have a reason you can't ignore.

677
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,304
Hye-na met with Kim Ju-yeong.

678
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,347
You know it, don't you?

679
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,808
Ye-seo would too.

680
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,811
I saw the parrot key chain.

681
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,981
Kim Ju-yeong definitely...

682
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,859
had a reason to kill Hye-na.

683
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,905
I'm sorry.

684
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,283
You're mistaken.

685
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,745
I don't know anything.

686
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,332
You don't?

687
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,669
You don't?

688
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,635
You're a mom yourself.

689
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,846
Do you think we're different
because I'm a stepmom?

690
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,349
Whatever people say, U-ju's my son.

691
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,433
I need...

692
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,727
to bring him home.

693
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,189
He may look grown up,
but when no one's home,

694
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,524
he turns the light on in every room.

695
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,028
Without his parents...

696
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,364
or friends,

697
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,741
branded as a murderer...

698
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,535
and kept in a strange place...

699
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,922
Please.

700
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,966
Please help U-ju.

701
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,847
There's nothing I can do.

702
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,141
Sorry. Will you please leave?

703
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,687
Please.

704
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:46,400
Please help my son, my U-ju.

705
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:52,864
Okay.

706
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,075
It's my fault.

707
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,120
I'm sorry I crossed the line

708
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,956
and insisted on writing about Yeong-jae.

709
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,418
I'm sorry I exposed you as Kwak Mi-hyang.

710
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:08,630
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have done that.

711
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,259
I'm...

712
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,930
so sorry to U-ju that I'm his stepmom.

713
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,183
I'm sorry I'm not his biological mom.

714
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,729
He has me for a mom,

715
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,981
and I got him in trouble.

716
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,444
I told him not to worry and to trust me,

717
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,029
that I'd get him out of there,

718
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,115
but there's nothing I can do.

719
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,869
I went to the prosecutor...

720
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,457
and begged him
to investigate one more time.

721
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,461
The evidence is so clear
that there's nothing he can do.

722
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,466
I beg of you. I'm on my knees pleading.

723
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,512
Please. Please save U-ju. Save my son.

724
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,681
Please save my son.

725
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,934
Please, please...

726
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,062
Please. Please save him.

727
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:10,108
Report me right now
if you feel that sorry for U-ju.

728
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,276
If you do,

729
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,363
the issue of the leaked exam papers
will come to light

730
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,991
and Ye-seo will get zero marks
for that whole exam.

731
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,120
I'm sorry.

732
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,330
Please.

733
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,920
No...

734
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,131
No.

735
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,050
No...

736
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,095
What should I do now?

737
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,432
What now?

738
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,561
There's nothing I can do.

739
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,529
You must be hungry. Have some snack.

740
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:22,574
I asked you ladies to come over
to discuss something with you.

741
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,909
What did you want to discuss?

742
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,537
Shouldn't we visit U-ju as well?

743
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,707
Oh, you're right.
We should visit him at least once.

744
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,126
Let's go tell him
that we know he didn't do it

745
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,962
and that all residents of the Castle
completely trust him.

746
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,048
That will console him, won't it?

747
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,134
Since he only gets ten minutes
of visitation time a day,

748
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,553
I was concerned we'd be taking time away
from his parents.

749
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,305
So I brought it up to his mom,

750
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,767
and she said our visit
will give him moral support.

751
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,976
She was rather grateful.

752
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,062
Then when would be good?

753
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,897
Seo-jin, when are you available?

754
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,649
What?

755
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,235
Well, why don't the two of you
find a time that works?

756
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,862
I'll work around your schedules.

757
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,533
Honey.

758
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,621
Gosh, this is actually great.

759
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,289
I have a question for him.

760
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,626
-Honey.
-Yes.

761
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,127
Why are you home so early?

762
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,090
I must be coming down with something.
My entire body aches.

763
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,758
Professor Cha.

764
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,802
Are you feeling sick?

765
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,762
Yes, I'm...

766
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,104
I'll rip your jaw open.
Who are you calling a monster?

767
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,147
Rip what off? That's so low.

768
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:38,191
You vulgar woman.

769
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,319
It's good to see you.

770
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,155
Please don't mind me.

771
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,366
I should go lie down
as I'm not feeling well.

772
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,201
Gosh, that's too bad.

773
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,412
There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

774
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,289
Me? Sure, go ahead.

775
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,499
You see,

776
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,167
this pyramid.

777
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,712
Why are you keeping it
in your living room?

778
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,131
Seung-hye said you put it there,

779
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,134
but it obviously
doesn't go with the decor.

780
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,760
It looks hideous.

781
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,222
However, you're the one who put it there,

782
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:13,893
so I'm sure there must be
a very important reason for it.

783
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,730
Seo-jin, you're curious too, right?

784
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,947
I'll explain since you ladies
are so curious.

785
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,245
"You cannot escape the pyramid

786
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,331
as long as you live in this world."

787
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,043
Said a wonderful, successful man.

788
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:42,922
Son, wherein the pyramid
do you want to be?

789
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,842
The bottom or the top?

790
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,761
The top.

791
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,472
-That's right, my son.
-You're so smart.

792
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,265
You have to get to the top, right?

793
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,433
All right.

794
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,896
Then what needs to be done
for you to get there?

795
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,857
I should've been born to good parents.

796
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,986
Hey, you were born to wonderful parents.

797
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,323
That part has already been done,
so what's next?

798
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:12,452
What should you do to get to the top?

799
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,748
I should work hard and live a good life.

800
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,543
Right. Then in order for you
to live a good life,

801
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,170
what should you,

802
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:26,299
as a student, work hard at?

803
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,679
-I should make sure I eat well,
-Right.

804
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,306
-sleep well,
-Correct.

805
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,933
-and poop well.
-That's...

806
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,103
Poop? Honey, where's the stick?

807
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,606
Oh, Dad. I actually heard

808
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,691
that the mummy isn't placed
at the top of the pyramid.

809
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,944
It's usually kept around here,
at the center of mass.

810
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,362
Really? Here?

811
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,865
I always thought it was at the top.

812
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,618
No, it's not. It's usually here.

813
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,954
In other words, this is the prime spot.

814
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,413
The middle is the best spot.

815
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,998
That's why it's kept here.

816
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:00,917
What?

817
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,794
The middle is the best.

818
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,337
Hang on a second.

819
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,423
That wasn't Professor Cha's conclusion.

820
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,591
He has a point.

821
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,426
Being in the middle is most comfortable.

822
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,345
-Gosh, he's so wise.
-Honey, the middle?

823
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,181
Where's the middle for you?

824
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,349
-Right here.
-Here?

825
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,184
Shall I break your seventh vertebrae?

826
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,479
Gosh, why?

827
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,900
-Don't!
-What kind of dream did you have?

828
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,820
-Stop recording.
-Why did you snore so much?

829
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,864
Come on, don't lie...

830
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,158
Hey, you have U-ju's mom's number, right?

831
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,910
-Why do you need it?
-Just give it to me.

832
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,788
-For what?
-Just give me her number!

833
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,042
He's gone?

834
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,711
He quit out of the blue,

835
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:48,298
so I can't stop thinking
there's something suspicious about him.

836
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,258
The investigation also revealed

837
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,386
that the dashcam was installed
in Park In-gyu's car.

838
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,930
That's not his usual parking spot.

839
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:59,517
I was thinking it's odd
that he happened to park there that day.

840
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,187
Are you saying...

841
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,397
In-gyu could be involved?

842
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,901
At the moment, our priority
is finding Kim Ju-yeong's motive

843
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,944
for killing Hye-na.

844
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,906
How could we find it though?

845
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:16,117
Evidence to prove
that she and Hye-na met privately

846
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:19,037
and that she had a motive
for killing Hye-na.

847
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,373
-That's what we need.
-That parrot key chain.

848
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,295
I saw Ye-seo with Hye-na's key chain.

849
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,630
Really?

850
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,383
But will her mom let us meet her?

851
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,262
I'm not sure.

852
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,687
Ms. Lee, it's me, Ye-seo.

853
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,565
I'd like to visit U-ju.

854
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,484
May I visit him?

855
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:50,818
Honey.

856
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,489
Ye-seo...

857
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,408
wants to visit U-ju.

858
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,204
-Really?
-Yes.

859
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,681
Hey, Ye-seo.

860
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,978
Mom and Dad.

861
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,785
Thanks for coming.

862
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,788
But do you have time for this though?

863
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,416
I mean, I have no choice,

864
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,376
but you should study.

865
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,757
Don't worry about me and just study hard.

866
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,635
You need to get into the school you want.

867
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,311
Mom.

868
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,063
I have to talk to Ye-seo about something.

869
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,024
Oh, okay.

870
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,401
We'll wait outside.

871
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,659
To be honest,

872
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,079
I want to apologize to you
for many things.

873
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,166
I knew you had feelings for me,

874
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,835
but I pretended not to know
because I didn't know what to do.

875
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,255
It must've been hard for you, right?

876
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:37,300
I'm sorry.

877
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,427
I really

878
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,679
wanted to say this.

879
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,598
No.

880
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,810
I'm sorry.

881
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,729
I'm sorry, U-ju.

882
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,691
I know you didn't kill her.

883
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,277
I know that you're completely innocent.

884
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,615
Thanks for believing me.

885
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:16,714
Ye-seo.

886
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,177
U-ju is innocent.

887
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,263
You know that, right?

888
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,599
Can you tell me the truth?

889
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,726
That parrot key chain.

890
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,813
Is it really yours?

891
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,652
It's Hye-na's.

892
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,199
I think she visited
Coach Kim Ju-yeong's office.

893
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,078
The cleaning lady said
she found it in that office.

894
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:54,794
I'm sorry.

895
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,046
It's just...

896
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,632
I was just so scared.

897
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,140
Because Coach Kim
might actually be the culprit?

898
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,813
She's been coaching you,

899
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,150
so I understand
how much you trust and rely on her.

900
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,610
But you see,

901
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,947
I think that woman...

902
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,617
is dangerous.

903
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,376
MOM

904
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,754
Gosh, where did she go?

905
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,672
Mr. Jo will be here soon.

906
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,508
Is she at the library?

907
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,142
Ye-seo!

908
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,395
Ms. Lee, I'll get going.

909
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,063
All right.

910
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,774
Thanks for today, Ye-seo.

911
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,779
Hey, what on earth are you doing
with my daughter?

912
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:07,950
Mom,

913
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,535
I asked her to take me.

914
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,163
I told her I wanted to visit U-ju.

915
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:16,709
She visited him?

916
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,509
Ye-seo.

917
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,554
Ye-seo.

918
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,445
Where did you say you went?

919
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,906
How could you go there
without even telling me?

920
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,452
Mom.

921
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,705
Do you know what's happening to U-ju now?

922
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:57,834
Even though he's completely innocent...

923
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,884
I told you to forget about U-ju.

924
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,803
You're in your senior year.

925
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,180
If you do a good job this semester,

926
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,683
you'll accomplish your goal
of getting into SNU's med school.

927
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,351
You're so close to it.

928
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:19,647
What about U-ju?

929
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,233
Isn't he also in his senior year?

930
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,319
What will happen to his life after this?

931
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,614
Why does he have to be
in a prison uniform?

932
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,117
What wrong has he done?

933
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,661
Yes,

934
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,663
I understand how you feel.

935
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,291
U-ju may be innocent.

936
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,751
After all, he hasn't been convicted yet.

937
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,839
He may get released during the trial,
so don't worry about him and please--

938
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,465
Where's the parrot key chain?

939
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,136
-What?
-I have to help U-ju

940
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,680
in any way I can
so that he can be released soon.

941
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:57,059
I have to find a way to prove
that he didn't kill Hye-na!

942
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,688
Who knows?

943
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,649
That parrot key chain might be helpful.

944
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:04,901
Have you lost your mind?

945
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,987
Don't you know what that means?

946
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:11,407
I do.

947
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,123
I know that you're suspecting
Coach Kim too.

948
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,296
Stop thinking about it
and just go get ready.

949
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,423
You have
a supplementary Korean lesson today.

950
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,634
-Mr. Jo will be here any minute now.
-I'm not going.

951
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,345
You're not going? What do you mean?

952
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,679
Why are you being like this?

953
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,681
Why are you being like this, Mom?

954
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,559
You want me to go study with the person
who might have killed Hye-na?

955
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,811
What on earth are you talking about?

956
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,605
Why would Coach Kim kill Hye-na?

957
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,232
Then why was Hye-na's key chain
found on her office floor?

958
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,070
I know U-ju didn't kill Hye-na.
Who killed her, then?

959
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,863
Don't you think it's strange?

960
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,574
I'll go tell the police.
Why won't you let me?

961
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:54,825
Kang Ye-seo!

962
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,162
Fine.

963
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,623
So you don't think she killed her.

964
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,667
Then I'll just go tell the police.

965
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,338
Ye-seo.

966
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:09,799
Listen up.

967
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,011
You got full marks

968
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:15,846
on your final exam.

969
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,057
You didn't do it on your own.

970
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:23,854
Coach Kim made it happen.

971
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,567
Yes, I know that.

972
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,405
I was able to get the top mark
thanks to the questions she gave me.

973
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,031
Are we good now?

974
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,616
Those questions...

975
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,414
were stolen.

976
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:48,796
What do you mean?

977
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,757
Are you saying she stole the exam papers?

978
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:57,972
Yes.

979
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,766
If you want to help U-ju,

980
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,894
you'll have to be okay
with having your marks revoked,

981
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,357
and you should also
mentally prepare yourself to either leave

982
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,609
or be expelled from your school.

983
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,654
I do know...

984
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,033
how ridiculous this situation is,

985
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,077
and how wrong this is.

986
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,080
I know all that.

987
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,964
But you see, Ye-seo,

988
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:38,554
I absolutely cannot give up on your life.

989
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,017
Whether people point the finger
or hurl stones at me,

990
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,187
and even if U-ju's mom beats me up,
I'll put up with it.

991
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,358
Don't worry about anything
and just study, please.

992
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,124
That woman, Kim Ju-yeong...

993
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,668
killed Hye-na?

994
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,298
-Honey.
-Where's her office?

995
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,220
Where is it?

996
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:24,975
I asked you where it is!

997
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,885
Did you kill her?
I heard you killed Hye-na.

998
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:04,265
Why did you kill her? Why?
Why did you kill her?

999
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,586
I really want to get into
SNU's med school.

1000
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,047
I know, Ye-seo. Let's hang in there
for just one more semester.

1001
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,675
They say your life is successful
if you're respected by your children.

1002
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,135
I pity you the most, Dad.

1003
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:42,678
Hey, this is my desk.

1004
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:43,929
Why is this your desk?

1005
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,848
You got expelled
for stealing the exam papers.

1006
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,475
Kang Ye-seo's personal information
is all over the Internet.

1007
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,768
I hope your life gets ruined.

1008
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,229
If you don't do anything about it,
your daughter will get sick.

1009
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,606
What should I do now?

1010
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,857
It's your choice.

1011
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,027
Ye-seo's life and yours are different.

1012
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,908
