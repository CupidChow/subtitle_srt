1
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,630
Seo-jin,

2
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,049
I've come to ask you a favor.

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,637
You have Ms. Kim Ju-yeong's

4
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,389
contact information, right?

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,061
Why do you need her contact information?

6
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,522
Please help me out.

7
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,200
I should've introduced myself
to you sooner, Mr. Park.

8
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,079
I'm Kim Ju-yeong.

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,587
Let me talk to you for a moment.

10
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,133
Coach Kim.

11
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,182
There's no need to worry.

12
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,501
Professor Park, where are you going?

13
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,017
Goodness.

14
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,310
My phone.

15
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,478
Oh, gosh.

16
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,107
More than a dozen times a day,

17
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,235
I wanted to kill a woman
named Kim Ju-yeong.

18
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,071
I shot down wild animals

19
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,657
imagining that they were that woman.

20
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,451
I wondered

21
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,831
if that woman ever even thought
about how my wife would've felt...

22
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,670
when she held this rifle to her head.

23
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,886
I am grieved about her death as well.

24
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,682
But am I responsible for that?

25
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,480
What were you doing on the night

26
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,400
your wife decided to kill herself?

27
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,695
When she suggested receiving
a parent-child consultation,

28
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,948
you turned her down, saying your weak
and idiotic son was the problem.

29
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,034
What were you doing when Yeong-jae
was trying hard to endure

30
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,870
living with a dad like you
for three years?

31
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,999
It might already be late,
but instead of blaming me,

32
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,710
don't you think

33
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,464
you should try to be
a proper dad to Yeong-jae?

34
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,261
He lived obediently.

35
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,347
He followed his parents' orders.

36
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,935
Both my wife and son

37
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,481
probably trusted you as a teacher.

38
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,066
But you incited my son
to take revenge on his parents

39
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,528
when you knew what kind of misery
that would bring about?

40
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,490
How can you even
call yourself a human being?

41
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,782
That's a misunderstanding.

42
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,742
Shut up.

43
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,251
You received billions of won from us,

44
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,378
and you killed my wife

45
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,548
and ruined my son's life!

46
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,448
I'd like to shoot you dead right now.

47
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,451
But...

48
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,455
I need to start being
a decent dad to my son.

49
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,793
I'm warning you.

50
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,587
This kind of misery

51
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,049
must end with my son.

52
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,344
Just end it with our family.

53
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,977
If this kind of thing ever happens again,

54
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,355
I'll kill you without anyone knowing.

55
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,977
Seo-jin.

56
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,731
Do you want to end up like my wife?

57
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,152
But then again,

58
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,572
my wife would never have listened
to anyone's advice, either.

59
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,782
No one knows before they die.

60
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,161
They only find out after they do.

61
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,096
Are you okay?

62
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,391
Yes, I'm okay.

63
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,727
You must be in shock.

64
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,357
Seeing Yeong-jae's father

65
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,318
made me realize how much Yeong-jae
must have suffered until now.

66
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,112
It breaks my heart.

67
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,885
Let's see.

68
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,889
May I help you, ma'am?

69
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,643
I want something that's really
fancy, elegant, and luxurious

70
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,562
so that whoever receives it becomes
ecstatic the moment they see it.

71
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,072
Here.

72
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,740
I brought you some spicy pollack gimbap.

73
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,700
I heard Ye-seo's dad really loves them.

74
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,827
You...

75
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,663
You made these yourself
with those elegant hands?

76
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,664
Me?

77
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,041
Are you mad?

78
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,836
I searched online and made
a special order at a popular restaurant.

79
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,879
You're so cute.

80
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,674
I bought a lot so that you can
eat them with your colleagues.

81
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,426
So tell them that I made them.

82
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,594
And schedule a date for your surgery.

83
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,554
What?

84
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,935
Don't get intimidated. Come on.

85
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,104
Just think about Su-han.

86
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,982
Think about our son,
and just lie on the operating table.

87
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,650
Just lie down there.

88
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,318
You're the head of our household.

89
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,488
Okay.

90
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,616
He already got humiliated by
losing that position as chief.

91
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,994
But you're humiliating him
even more by trying to

92
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,871
receive surgery from Dr. Hwang.

93
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,122
My gosh.

94
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,001
You're the one who kept telling me
not to get surgery from Dr. Kang.

95
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,504
That's because it seemed like you
couldn't trust his surgical skills.

96
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,633
Jin Jin, this is the hospital.

97
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,510
You can't yell like that here.

98
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,055
My gosh, I'm sorry.

99
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,849
We're not fighting.

100
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,642
Eat up. I'm sorry.

101
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:56,275
Hey, Chung-seon.
I want you to go and tell Dr. Kang

102
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,986
exactly what I say, word by word.

103
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,196
Good.

104
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,074
She got up at dawn to make
your favorite dish herself.

105
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,244
Enjoy the heartfelt gimbap
she made, and...

106
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,249
You're the best doctor
in Junam University Hospital,

107
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,709
and for the development

108
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,669
and unification of
the Orthopedics Department

109
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,589
that has an important role
in the aging society--

110
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,966
Don't overdo it, all right?

111
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,931
Hello.

112
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,600
-Hello.
-Sit down.

113
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,810
Okay.

114
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,126
-Eat up.
-Yes, sir.

115
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,419
Eat up.

116
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,547
Dr. Kang.

117
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,090
The Spine and Joint Center

118
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,134
asked us to send over
a few residents to help out.

119
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,970
-Right?
-That's right.

120
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,015
-Did they?
-Yes.

121
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,434
Then

122
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,522
the one who has been sweet-talked
by the chief can go.

123
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,152
Coke.

124
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,322
Drink up.

125
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,578
Check if he finishes it.

126
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,955
-Okay.
-Goodbye, sir.

127
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,461
What?

128
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,798
He's really small-minded.

129
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,717
Just text him like crazy.

130
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,136
I did already. I sent nine messages.

131
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,762
Nine text messages.

132
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,431
I have pride, too. I've done enough.

133
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,807
No, bye.

134
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,938
Professor, send just one more.

135
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,234
I was forgiven for the frog incident
after ten messages.

136
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,319
Are you crazy?

137
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,739
Why send that many
when I didn't do anything that bad?

138
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,241
Hey!

139
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,916
What did you say to him? Tell me.

140
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,342
Dr. Kang.

141
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,845
This sinner will say one last thing.

142
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,181
You are like Hua Tuo to me.

143
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,352
How could I trust someone
other than you to fix my body?

144
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,480
-Dr. Kang!
-Hua Tuo?

145
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,777
Is this jerk mocking me or what?

146
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,820
My gosh.

147
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,996
I can't stand him anymore.

148
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,831
Are you free later?

149
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,886
Did I surprise you?

150
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,264
I've been living off wild boars.

151
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,602
It's time you got over all this.

152
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,771
Right.

153
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,732
I should get over it.

154
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,652
How's Yeong-jae?

155
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,612
Is he well?

156
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,157
It seems like that jerk really wants
to cut ties with me.

157
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,327
He won't answer my calls.

158
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,000
And he doesn't reply to my texts
saying I was in the wrong.

159
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,335
What do you mean?

160
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,426
Jun-sang.

161
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,764
Seo-jin.

162
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,475
Do you want to end up like my wife?

163
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,893
But then again,

164
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,312
no one knows before they die.

165
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,232
They only find out when they die.

166
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,698
What were you doing
while all that was happening?

167
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,451
To send him to med school,
I had no choice.

168
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,120
My wife was in charge of his education.

169
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,081
I believed that

170
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:26,003
bringing home money was my only duty
as a husband and father.

171
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,134
And I foolishly thought

172
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,679
that I was a wise parent.

173
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,600
And that I was much better
than my violent father.

174
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,187
I realized only after the tragedy

175
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,607
that a woman named Kim Ju-yeong

176
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,567
was eating away

177
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,903
at my son and wife.

178
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,323
Kim Ju-yeong?

179
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,493
Her name is Kim Ju-yeong?

180
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,122
Coach Kim is weird.

181
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,041
She told me to give up
on being the school president.

182
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,375
Who's Kim Ju-yeong?

183
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,420
-Her homeroom teacher?
-No, an instructor at her academy.

184
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,341
Seo-jin wouldn't have told you anything.

185
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,928
My wife never told me anything
about that woman.

186
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,516
I put up with everything
because I thought it was all my fault.

187
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,480
But I suddenly wondered
if that woman would create more victims.

188
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,818
You shouldn't end up like me.

189
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,800
Thanks. That's all for today.

190
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,013
You know I met Su-chang today, right?

191
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,598
Explain.

192
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,603
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd object.

193
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,438
Do you know what kind of woman she is?

194
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,984
-I know.
-What? You know?

195
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,403
And you let her teach Ye-seo?

196
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,740
I vetted her as thoroughly as possible,
and I'm sure it's going to be fine.

197
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,200
So you don't have to worry.

198
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,035
Are you crazy?

199
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,164
Myeong-ju's dead because of her!

200
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,878
Yeong-jae didn't get along
with his parents and was forced to study.

201
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,174
Ye-seo studies because she wants to
with no problem at all.

202
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,051
She wants to go to SNU's med school
more than anyone else.

203
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,638
Don't use her as an excuse,
and fire that woman immediately.

204
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,308
You don't know anything about this.

205
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,351
You never cared about the kids' education.

206
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,854
Why are you suddenly interfering?

207
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,575
Where did you get the money from?

208
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,414
Where did you get that huge
amount of money to pay that bitch?

209
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,958
Your mother gave me that money.

210
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,502
Why would she...

211
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,174
Don't we have other ways
to get her into SNU?

212
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,473
Things are different from when you could

213
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,308
go to university by just memorizing facts.

214
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,978
These days it's about school activities
and various other things.

215
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,273
Kids win or lose based on
their parents' wealth and data.

216
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,818
Why does that matter
when our kid is smart?

217
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,030
If she concentrates in class

218
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,990
and takes some extra classes,

219
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,743
-she won't--
-Don't you read the papers?

220
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,747
Parents even fake their kids' grades
to send them to good universities.

221
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,124
Even the poor take out loans

222
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,961
to hire essay tutors, consultants,
or people to write essays for them.

223
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,713
Why shouldn't we do those things
when we can afford them all?

224
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,303
Please, just keep still
and don't ruin things.

225
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,431
-She's your daughter.
-That's why I'm like this!

226
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,602
Why do you think Su-chang said
he wanted to shoot that woman?

227
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,897
Myeong-ju trusted her
as you trust her now,

228
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,483
and now their family is in tatters.

229
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,155
Unless you want to end up like that,

230
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,324
fire her right now.

231
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,662
You know my temper, right?

232
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,673
Darn it.

233
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,557
Both my wife and son
probably trusted you as a teacher.

234
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,269
But you incited my son
to take revenge on his parents

235
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,355
when you knew what kind of misery
that would bring about?

236
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,483
How can you even
call yourself a human being?

237
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,526
That's a misunderstanding.

238
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
Shut up.

239
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,457
MR. JO

240
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,752
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,463
We have to make Ye-seo
the school president.

242
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,382
Keep a close eye on Kim Hye-na,

243
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,134
twenty-four hours a day.

244
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,647
ACADEMIC STRESS CAUSED BY COMPETITION

245
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,192
SON'S SUICIDE DUE TO POOR GRADES
LEADS TO FATHER'S SUICIDE

246
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,319
SNU FRESHMAN COMMITS SUICIDE
AND FAMILY MEMBERS FOLLOW SUIT

247
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,165
You want to meet
Coach Kim Ju-yeong in person?

248
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,460
Yes, I'd like to hear more
about what happened to Yeong-jae.

249
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,796
I do know where her office is,

250
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,464
but meeting her won't be easy.

251
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,342
The security there is very tight,
and she's a discreet person.

252
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,843
Right, it won't be easy.

253
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:07,886
But

254
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,805
I still want to try.

255
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,434
A tragedy happened right here.

256
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,396
Someone has to ask, don't you think?

257
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,361
About why Yeong-jae's family
had to suffer such misery.

258
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,842
It's on the 18th floor of the building.

259
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,387
There's no business name.
You won't find a sign, either.

260
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,501
Ms. Lee?

261
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:23,879
Ye-seo.

262
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,715
Ms. Lee, what brings you here?

263
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,300
Do you know her?

264
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,093
She's my next-door neighbor.

265
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,428
She's Hwang U-ju's mom.

266
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,639
Hello, I'm Lee Su-im.

267
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,766
I'm sorry I came unannounced,

268
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,352
but would it be possible
to meet Ms. Kim Ju-yeong?

269
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,812
What is it about?

270
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,856
I'd like to ask her a few questions.

271
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,357
Unless you have an appointment with her,

272
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,818
it'll be hard to meet her
as she's very busy.

273
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,945
Oh, really?

274
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,490
Then I'll leave
my contact information with you.

275
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,534
Could you please arrange
an appointment for me?

276
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,457
LEE SU-IM

277
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,760
Here you go.

278
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,514
Please help me out.

279
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,270
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Park Yeong-jae.

280
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,940
Who is this woman?

281
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,777
-I'm not sure--
-Didn't you arrange U-ju's file?

282
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,240
All we know is which middle school
he went to.

283
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,452
-My apologies.
-Her job, educational background,

284
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,496
family, hobbies, and personal life.

285
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,873
Find out everything about her.

286
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,542
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,760
She wants to ask questions
about Yeong-jae?

288
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,596
Seo-jin.

289
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,852
I thought this would look great on you
as it's elegant and classy.

290
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,693
Don't do things like this from now on.

291
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,194
Come on.

292
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,072
I just got you this
while getting one for myself.

293
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,495
Hi, Ye-seo.

294
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,456
U-ju's mom?

295
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,083
Why would she go there?

296
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,338
All right. I'll look into it,
so you don't need to worry about it.

297
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,673
Okay.

298
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,884
Gosh, that woman.

299
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,636
Why? What about U-ju's mom?

300
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,139
Apparently, she visited
Coach Kim's office to meet her.

301
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,099
What? U-ju's mom?

302
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,726
How did she find out where her office is?

303
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,020
I bet Professor Cha's wife told her.

304
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,188
Anyway, I can't stand both of them.

305
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,065
Oh, right.

306
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,608
I heard from Su-han

307
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,652
that she's collecting information
to write a novel.

308
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,156
What if she wants to write
about what happened to Yeong-jae?

309
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,534
About Yeong-jae?

310
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,869
I mean, it'd be pretty sensational.

311
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,288
A boy who got accepted to SNU's
med school runs away from home,

312
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,873
and his mother takes her own life.

313
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,876
It's shocking. It'll be a great story.

314
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,253
Why else would she go all the way there?

315
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,839
What if it becomes a best-selling book?

316
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,841
It'll ruin Sky Castle's
image and reputation.

317
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,509
This is so annoying.

318
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,386
What should we do?

319
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,531
Hey,

320
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,659
are you testing me to see
how much I can put up with?

321
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,286
Are you testing my patience?

322
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,664
Just cut to the chase and keep it short.

323
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,584
I don't care whether or not

324
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,753
you turn Yeong-jae's story into a novel,

325
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,421
but leave Coach Kim out of it.

326
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,215
I told you she's
my daughter's coordinator.

327
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,175
Why don't you get it?

328
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,636
Kwak Mi-hyang.

329
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,349
Who are you to order me around?

330
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,935
What did you say?

331
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,272
You acting like this only makes me
want to dig deeper.

332
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,024
That family used to live in my house.

333
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,236
Must I sit back and just watch
their tragedy like you?

334
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,570
I'm a writer after all.

335
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,739
A writer? Someone as lame as you?

336
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,536
Sure,

337
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,787
we shall see

338
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,081
how impressive your novel will be.

339
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,750
No, let's see if you can even pull it off.

340
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,090
Are you threatening me right now?

341
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,720
Fine,

342
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,346
then I'll do the same thing.

343
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,559
Mi-hyang,

344
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,020
don't get on my nerves.

345
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,064
You...

346
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,067
can't beat me.

347
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,197
Don't mind her, Ms. Han.

348
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,992
I did hear that she came to my office,

349
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,244
but I don't care.

350
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,080
She actually read Yeong-jae's diary.

351
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,128
Yeong-jae's diary?

352
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,297
I think she read the last few pages.

353
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,966
She's been fixated on it ever since.

354
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,885
Still, what can she do?

355
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,973
She'll only realize that the tragedy
was caused by his own family.

356
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,018
Even so, I'm worried
because she's so unpredictable.

357
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,895
Please don't worry, Ms. Han.

358
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,981
You should focus on Ye-seo's
school president election.

359
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,152
Sure. Got it, Coach Kim.

360
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,252
I can't beat her?

361
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,136
Are you crazy?

362
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,930
Did you threaten my mom for more money?

363
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,640
You were the one who suggested it first.

364
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,477
I can totally take
those stupid assessments myself.

365
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,230
I only let you help me
because I pitied you. How dare you?

366
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,273
You better stop that.

367
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,610
Hey, you'd better not
tell my mom on me again.

368
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,077
School president?

369
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,037
I'm going to vote for Hye-na.

370
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,248
You too? I'm going to vote for her, too.

371
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,709
You're going to vote for Hye-na?

372
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,921
You should be thinking about
running in the election yourselves.

373
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,549
Honey, being a board member
of a school club

374
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,343
is a much more effective way
to showcase leadership skills.

375
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,388
It shows their aptitude and
which career paths they're interested in.

376
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,390
Ye-seo and U-ju
are running in the election.

377
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,600
You're okay with our boys
not participating in it?

378
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,728
My sons must take the lead.
What are you talking about?

379
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,234
Others struggle to find running mates,
but you don't have to.

380
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,236
You two can run
for president and vice president.

381
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,822
I won't be elected
even if I decide to run.

382
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,241
They're definitely more likely
to be elected.

383
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,159
"They"?

384
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,871
Who are they?

385
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,791
A SCHOOL WHERE EVERYONE IS EQUAL
KIM HYE-NA, HWANG U-JU

386
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,172
Just a second.

387
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,680
-Can you cut this?
-Yes.

388
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,056
Okay.

389
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,771
Between these two, which one do you think
would look better?

390
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,231
What?

391
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,694
I think we should...

392
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,324
Yes.

393
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,619
-Is everything going well?
-Yes.

394
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,583
You guys are so impressive.

395
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,418
WE WILL ABOLISH INTENSIVE READING CLASS

396
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,587
Your pledges are also really great.

397
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,714
U-ju's helping me out a lot by stepping up

398
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,215
even when he's in Intensive Reading.

399
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:10,803
To be honest, I also felt it was unfair
to receive special treatment.

400
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,765
I was able to muster up my courage
thanks to you.

401
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,810
I'm impressed that Hye-na
thought of straightening out the school's

402
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,395
unfair treatment toward their students.

403
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,065
And I'm impressed

404
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,233
that U-ju felt embarrassed
of receiving special treatment.

405
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,278
I hope you guys win the election.

406
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,281
You should get some rest.
I prepared some fruits for you.

407
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,659
Let's go.

408
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,578
U-ju's running with Hye-na?

409
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,205
I don't care.

410
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,380
Coach Kim said she'll help,

411
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,757
so let's use this chance

412
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,510
to beat U-ju and Hye-na.

413
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,054
We'll make sure U-ju regrets it big time.

414
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,431
Coach Kim said she'll help?

415
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,142
Of course. You don't need to worry.

416
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,187
She's going to make sure
you become the school president.

417
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,190
Have you thought of asking Gi-jun?

418
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,442
You guys are even in the same club.

419
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:07,819
Gi-jun?

420
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,529
I can't stand you.

421
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,490
I really can't stand him.

422
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,243
Ye-seo. Congratulations on coming first.

423
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,746
-Seo-jun will be better than Gi-jun.
-Really?

424
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:20,915
Okay,

425
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,750
leave it to me.

426
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,294
This is a sweet osmanthus.

427
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,630
The scent is really nice
once the flowers bloom.

428
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,215
Hye-na,

429
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,009
you know about sweet osmanthus?

430
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,513
Yes, my mom really loves
the scent of these flowers.

431
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,682
The flowers are really small,

432
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,517
but their scent fills up the entire house.

433
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,186
It seems like you and I
will get along really well.

434
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,314
I agree. It seems like you guys
will get along really nicely.

435
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,234
-Hye-na, come over often.
-Okay.

436
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,237
-Here.
-Let's eat.

437
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,363
-Take a seat.
-Okay.

438
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,243
I prepared your favorite fruits.

439
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,830
You're the best.

440
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,416
Let's eat.

441
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,752
Hello?

442
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,087
What?

443
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,881
My mom?

444
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,360
They say it's pneumonia,

445
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,571
so she'll get better in a few days
after some treatment.

446
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,365
And after a good sleep,
her fever will go down as well.

447
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,077
Thank you.

448
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,828
Mom,

449
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,580
you should go home with Dad.

450
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,040
I'll stay here a little longer.

451
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,625
No, U-ju.

452
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,210
You should go home, too.

453
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,545
I want to be alone with my mom.

454
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,966
Will you be okay all by yourself?

455
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,679
I've been through this numerous times.

456
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,390
Don't worry, Ms. Lee.

457
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,184
I'm strong.

458
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,773
Call us anytime if something comes up.

459
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,484
This place is under my jurisdiction,

460
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,821
so I can take care of
pretty much everything

461
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,240
in an instant.

462
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,909
Thank you.

463
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,121
Okay. Let's go.

464
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,677
Mom, why did you even bother
to give money to my wife?

465
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,180
Do you even know
what kind of woman that coordinator is?

466
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,308
She made a complete mess
of Su-chang's family.

467
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,977
Ask Seo-jin to return the money
you gave her.

468
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,203
You better not ignore what I said.

469
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,210
I really didn't want to tell you this,

470
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,296
but I guess I have no choice
since you're so against it.

471
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,008
Professor Park probably
couldn't tell you this, either.

472
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,093
What are you talking about?

473
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,847
Do you remember the housekeeper

474
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,059
named Ga-eul that used to live
at Yeong-jae's house?

475
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,978
Ga-eul? What about her?

476
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,398
Ga-eul

477
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,361
and Yeong-jae
used to be in a relationship.

478
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,697
What?

479
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,241
She was the core reason

480
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,159
behind Yeong-jae's conflict
with his parents.

481
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,161
After they kicked Ga-eul out
of their house,

482
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,248
Yeong-jae had to receive
psychotherapy for a whole year.

483
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,960
Is that true?

484
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,754
But Yeong-jae was so young back then.

485
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,089
How does that make any sense?

486
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,091
But Coach Kim managed

487
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,593
to send him to SNU's med school
regardless of all that.

488
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,472
All she ever did was do her best to
achieve what Yeong-jae's parents wanted.

489
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,602
Yeong-jae ran away from home
to look for Ga-eul

490
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,604
the moment he got accepted
to SNU's med school.

491
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,107
How exactly is that Coach Kim's fault?

492
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,445
Honey.

493
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,242
Dr. Hwang's son, U-ju,
will be running with Hye-na.

494
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,161
And there's a high chance
that they'll get elected.

495
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,080
They have such a high chance of winning

496
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,457
that some students have already
given up running for president.

497
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,501
What's your point?

498
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,671
Are you saying that woman can make
Ye-seo become the school president?

499
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:19,839
Of course.

500
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,050
Do you think I'd leave Ye-seo
to just anybody?

501
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,218
You'll see.

502
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,345
She'll make Ye-seo win the election
no matter what.

503
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,100
My gosh.

504
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,021
Yes, Mother.

505
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,862
Don't have too much confidence
in that woman, Kim Ju-yeong.

506
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,198
She's just like a reference book
you use and throw away.

507
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,118
You need to have initiative

508
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,870
to get Ye-seo accepted
to a good university.

509
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,871
Do you understand?

510
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,165
Yes, Mother. I'll keep that in mind.

511
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,499
If you want Jun-sang to give in,

512
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,169
Ye-seo will have to become
the school president.

513
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,463
Yes, I was thinking that as well.

514
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,590
Don't worry, Mother.

515
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,509
Okay, bye.

516
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,813
Hey, Seung-hye. This is Seo-jin.

517
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,566
You want him to be Ye-seo's running mate?

518
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,027
I'm sorry,

519
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,446
but both my sons aren't interested
in the election.

520
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,947
Wait. Give me that.

521
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,575
Hello, it's me.

522
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,662
You must be searching
for Ye-seo's running mate.

523
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,291
Yes, but since your kids aren't
that interested, I'll just--

524
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,459
Ms. Han.

525
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,170
Just a moment.

526
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,424
Yes, go ahead.

527
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,302
Right now?

528
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,599
I'm very much on board with Seo-jun
teaming up with Ye-seo.

529
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,352
To be honest,

530
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,396
I really do want our kids

531
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,649
to win the election
since U-ju is a candidate.

532
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,568
But Ye-seo as school president...

533
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,030
Do you think she has
a high chance of winning?

534
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,618
No one thought Donald Trump
would win the election.

535
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,288
You've heard
of the "shy Trump supporters," right?

536
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,209
I agree that one's values, morality,
and leadership

537
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,294
are all important.

538
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,296
But the type of leader
that the public wants

539
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,133
is the kind of person
that will directly benefit them.

540
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:31,095
Air purifiers, Wi-Fi, and bidets.

541
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,975
Do you really think we can convince
the public with that kind of stuff?

542
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,603
You really underestimate
the students of Shin A High School.

543
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,315
The students are crazy about
the candidate named Hye-na.

544
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,901
Did you see her pledges?

545
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,197
Since Seo-jun and Gi-jun
aren't in the intensive reading class,

546
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,491
I guess you don't know much.

547
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,493
But the parents of the students there

548
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,746
are voluntarily paying for
the school's development funds.

549
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,207
Do you really think
they'll get rid of that class?

550
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,418
The student body president
is elected by the students.

551
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,921
You think the school can interfere
because they don't like a pledge?

552
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,465
In this day and age?

553
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,469
It sounds like you're saying

554
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,640
Seo-jun should run for president
for them to have a chance.

555
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,771
Very well. Let's hear why that is.

556
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,151
This attribute of his

557
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,362
irks me as a father sometimes,

558
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,198
but he also

559
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,992
earned my respect for his actions.

560
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:39,455
During an exam, when everyone else
was trying to get one more point,

561
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:43,334
only Seo-jun got up
to help a sick student.

562
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,253
He got the Friendship Award
because of his teacher's nomination,

563
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,963
but that's not important.

564
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,008
What's important is that
among the students,

565
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,262
Seo-jun is now an icon
of consideration and sacrifice.

566
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,889
He's not a student

567
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,225
who cares only for himself.

568
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,352
Would the students

569
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,522
want him as their president or Ye-seo?

570
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,655
We're going to be in the same boat.

571
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,116
We shouldn't take the path
that obviously leads to failure.

572
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,582
If you insist that Seo-jun
run for president,

573
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,960
then that's fine.

574
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,842
Can I make a suggestion?

575
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,975
Ye-seo's running for president
and Seo-jun's running for vice president?

576
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:41,976
And

577
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,561
you accepted those terms?

578
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,271
What's wrong with being
the vice president?

579
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:48,023
It's the participation that counts.

580
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,233
Did you

581
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,403
make some kind of deal with Seo-jin?

582
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,739
It wasn't really a deal.

583
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,576
It's not like she doesn't know you.

584
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,494
What was it?

585
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,621
What made you let Ye-seo be the president?

586
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,123
You don't need to know.

587
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,458
Stop asking and convince Seo-jun.

588
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,211
The boys are like you
and aren't at all competitive.

589
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,462
Look at Se-ri.

590
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,548
She's like me, perfect in every way.

591
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,217
I got it.

592
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,065
Overtreatment?

593
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,403
I only suggested
the best way to heal the spine.

594
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,322
We know that.

595
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,575
But within the same hospital,
one doctor recommends surgery

596
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,368
and another says the opposite.

597
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,038
That's why the patients are complaining.

598
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,082
Rather than operating thoughtlessly,

599
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:51,045
isn't it best for the patients to offer
treatment with the least side effects?

600
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,463
"Thoughtlessly"?

601
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,923
Did you just say "thoughtlessly"?

602
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,467
Sorry if that offended you.

603
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,429
But it's a fact that most
disk problems heal naturally.

604
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,766
Surgeries are for when patients
are struggling with everyday life--

605
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,603
The reason patients get an operation
despite their fear is because

606
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,522
they are that desperate.

607
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,525
They trust a doctor
who can eliminate the pain immediately.

608
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,321
Would they trust a doctor
who says they'll heal in time?

609
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,447
Dr. Kang.

610
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,532
Answer this truthfully.

611
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,035
When you compare the risk of paralysis
without surgery,

612
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,496
and the risk of paralysis after surgery,

613
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,040
which is higher?

614
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,048
Dr. Hwang. No, Chief Hwang.

615
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,467
Don't you know
we're urged to use treatments

616
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,929
not covered by insurance
to increase patient turnover?

617
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,515
I operate on patients
one after another like crazy

618
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:48,060
to make money for the hospital
and now you say I'm overtreating?

619
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,771
You're confusing me about what to do.

620
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,943
Why is that so important?

621
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,445
How we should deal with this situation--

622
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,446
I apologize.

623
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,448
I have a surgery to go to.

624
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,790
Gosh. He's so short-tempered.

625
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,546
-How did it go?
-What do you mean?

626
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,674
The student body president election.

627
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,510
She's running with Seo-jun. Don't worry.

628
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,928
What are her pledges?

629
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,306
She's going to install bidets
in the bathrooms,

630
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,767
and an air purifier each
for all 24 classrooms.

631
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,018
Twenty-four?

632
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,982
Offer them 200 air purifiers.

633
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,652
No. Say every student
can get one each for their homes.

634
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:43,740
If we leave it to Kim Ju-yeong,
she'll be elected for sure.

635
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,119
Don't worry. Ye-seo will crush U-ju.

636
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,583
What?

637
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,959
Is that true?

638
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,962
Jun-sang must be furious.

639
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,380
Don't even mention it.

640
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:02,384
What now? You can't go to Dr. Hwang now.

641
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,510
Mom.

642
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,554
Can't Ye-bin's dad treat Dad?

643
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,473
Son.

644
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,974
I'm going to lose my mind.

645
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,643
I sent him ten texts
and he ignored them all.

646
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,353
-You sent ten?
-Yes.

647
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,023
He's playing high and mighty.

648
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,858
How great does he think he is?

649
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,360
I'm going to go and kill him for you.

650
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,237
-What?
-How dare he ignore my husband?

651
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,575
Hey, what's with you?
What do you think you're doing?

652
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,368
Even a worm will turn when trodden on.

653
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,828
Are you going to keep groveling?

654
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,538
Honey, no. Don't!

655
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,915
Dad, your back.

656
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,333
Jin Jin.

657
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,584
This scumbag.

658
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,551
Send.

659
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,012
It's sent.

660
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,194
Dr. Kang, my dear brother.

661
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,697
I am an imbecile,
and I made a grave error,

662
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,699
but if my wife were to need surgery,

663
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,452
I would send her to you in a heartbeat.

664
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,248
Why do you not see how sincere I am?

665
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,499
I'm crying.

666
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,213
Just do the operation.

667
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,590
I heard he can barely sleep
because of the pain.

668
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,315
You're still not going to reply?

669
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,483
Fine,

670
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,610
let's see who'll win.

671
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,737
I'm Cheongdam-dong's Short Shorts.

672
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,576
He replied.

673
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,996
Honey. He replied.

674
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,582
Look at this. Read it. He replied.

675
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,711
Set a date. Let's sort out your back.

676
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,797
He's saying he'll operate on you, right?

677
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,715
Yes.

678
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,553
I should say thank you.

679
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,139
"Thank you so much.

680
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,309
My body is now yours."

681
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,688
JUNAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

682
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,444
Don't worry about the hospital bills.

683
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,446
I saved up a lot of money
through my part-time job.

684
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:32,075
Okay. You're just like your dad.

685
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,661
You are smart and bright.

686
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,121
Stop it, Mom.

687
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,499
Why do you like him when he died
as soon as I was born?

688
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,002
Don't hate your dad.

689
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,547
The best thing I did in my life

690
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,633
was having you.

691
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,219
If I hadn't met your dad,

692
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,264
you wouldn't have been born.

693
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,895
Thanks for giving birth to me, Mom.

694
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:08,737
Mom.

695
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,490
Get well soon,
so we can go to Seonjae Island.

696
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,911
You said you went there with Dad
and caught a baby blowfish.

697
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,460
It was yellow
and the size of a sunflower seed.

698
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,170
It was so cute.

699
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,340
All your dad did was study all his life,

700
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,300
so he was even scared of that.

701
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,015
Hye-na.

702
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,602
Let's go to Seonjae Island someday.

703
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,772
Okay.

704
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,565
You can see that
the first lumbar vertebra is damaged.

705
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,817
In this patient's case,

706
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,404
the vertebrae are pressing down
on the disk.

707
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,574
What would happen
if they press down on a nerve?

708
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,578
How was the training?
Do you think you can handle med school?

709
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,913
Yes, Dad. It suits me perfectly.

710
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,041
Well done. You must be hungry.

711
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,251
Help yourselves.

712
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,545
-Eat up, guys.
-Thank you.

713
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,088
This looks delicious.

714
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,631
Hey, don't eat too much.

715
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,926
Here's a slice for my daughter.

716
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,846
-Thanks for the pizza.
-Sure.

717
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,306
Don't eat too much.

718
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,978
My, it looks delicious.

719
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,188
It's so good.

720
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,774
Hey, this is good.

721
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,068
You'll make Hye-na withdraw her candidacy?

722
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,114
At this moment, it's the only way
we can make sure Ye-seo gets elected.

723
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,867
If Hye-na withdraws her candidacy,
Ye-seo will be the only candidate,

724
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,660
so voting won't be necessary.

725
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,749
But will Hye-na do it?
From what I know, she's an ambitious girl.

726
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,765
Why isn't Do-hoon running
in the school president election?

727
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,768
His homeroom teacher
kept suggesting it too,

728
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,144
but I told him not to do it.

729
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,271
Being class president is enough
to showcase his leadership,

730
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,231
so why should he?

731
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,733
He'll have less time and energy
to focus on studying,

732
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,819
and people will criticize him
no matter how well he does.

733
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,322
I don't want him to suffer
just to fulfill my greed.

734
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,325
Oh, no.

735
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,661
I guess I'm making my daughter suffer.

736
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,996
Seo-jin.

737
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,874
I'm telling you this
because I care about you.

738
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,710
I heard everyone is saying
they'll vote for Hye-na.

739
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,671
Do-hoon said

740
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,258
Ye-seo has no hope
of winning the election.

741
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,388
-He said she has no hope?
-Yes.

742
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,891
Then you can help her out a little.

743
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:27,853
Me?

744
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,354
How?

745
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,438
Kim Hye-na.

746
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,152
Can you make her back out?
I think you can do it.

747
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:45,453
Gosh, how could I make her
withdraw her candidacy?

748
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,169
I have nothing to do with her.
Why are you asking me to do it?

749
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,422
Don't you think you're out of line?

750
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,633
You're being incredibly rude.

751
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,657
Keep a close eye on Kim Hye-na,

752
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,492
twenty-four hours a day.

753
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
Are you crazy?

754
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,382
Did you threaten my mom for more money?

755
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,426
You were the one who suggested it first.

756
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:45,138
I can totally take
those stupid assessments myself.

757
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,099
I only let you help me
because I pitied you. How dare you?

758
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,444
Hye-na's mom is hospitalized,

759
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,321
but she's been studying
with an expensive tutor

760
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,989
and even paying her mom's hospital bills.

761
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,325
I was wondering where
she was getting all the money from,

762
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,204
and Do-hoon kindly answered my question.

763
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,792
Seo-jin.

764
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,003
I think you got the wrong idea.

765
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,506
I gave her money as a scholarship.

766
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,633
I was just helping a pitiful kid.

767
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,931
But will the principal think that, too?

768
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,809
"Any student who commits a dishonest act

769
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:33,937
during an exam or any assessment
will be expelled."

770
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,441
You know the school rules, too.

771
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,402
Wait, Seo-jin!

772
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,862
Why are you in such a rush?

773
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,907
Don't be like this.

774
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,867
This isn't the kind of relationship
we have.

775
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,413
Wait, Seo-jin!

776
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,332
Tell me.

777
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,501
What should I do?

778
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,753
Make Hye-na withdraw her candidacy?

779
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,631
Okay, I'll do it. You have my word.

780
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,717
I'll make her withdraw immediately,

781
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,884
so Do-hoon...

782
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,471
Leave Do-hoon out of this. Please?

783
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,557
Please?

784
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,564
Who did this?

785
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,483
Who recorded this?

786
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,401
Hey!

787
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,944
That's not important right now!

788
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,280
You and Do-hoon are about to be expelled!

789
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:29,701
Listen.

790
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,579
Stop doing Do-hoon's assessments
and stop the tutoring sessions, too.

791
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,123
Also, give up on becoming
the school president.

792
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,460
You should've known your place.
You brought this upon yourself.

793
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:51,056
Are you doing this to make me give up
on the school president election?

794
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,892
Is this related to Ye-seo?

795
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,519
-Is her mom behind this?
-My gosh.

796
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,606
Goodness, look at you.

797
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,192
You're quick-witted.
I guess you'll survive wherever you go.

798
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,245
Mom!

799
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,998
Hye-na is backing out.

800
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,875
Kim Hye-na is withdrawing her candidacy!

801
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,087
Does that mean you have
a higher chance of winning now?

802
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,923
She's the only candidate,
so no voting is required.

803
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,508
Your daughter is the school president now.

804
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,592
Really?

805
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,261
Then we should celebrate with some drinks.

806
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,222
Hang on, where are the champagne bottles?

807
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,473
They're in our wine cellar.

808
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,560
Ye-seo, I'll go bring a nice bottle
of champagne. Give me a minute.

809
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,190
Then I should make some snacks for us.

810
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,110
Mom.

811
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,570
U-ju must be totally regretting
his decision now, right?

812
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,991
-Which champagne should we open?
-I'm coming.

813
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,620
Hey, you have a crush on U-ju, don't you?

814
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,123
You little brat.

815
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,042
That's crazy!
Why would I have a crush on him?

816
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,461
"You little brat."

817
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,339
I could really smack you.

818
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,467
I think she decided against it

819
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,094
because her mom is sick.

820
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,304
Why?

821
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,724
I thought her mother moved back
to a nursing home because she got better.

822
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,936
She said she wants to spend
more time with her mom,

823
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,688
and I couldn't dissuade her from it.

824
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,357
I know what that feels like.

825
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,653
Right, I can understand
why Hye-na made such a decision.

826
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,094
Mom!

827
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,598
Mom!

828
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,893
Mom, no.

829
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:00,977
Mom.

830
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,063
Mom!

831
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:45,224
MOM'S

832
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,277
MOM, I'LL BE BACK BY 9 P.M.
DON'T SKIP DINNER.

833
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,779
IF YOU FEEL ANY PAIN, CALL THE DOCTOR

834
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,739
MOM, I LOVE YOU THE MOST
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD

835
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:08,748
FISHING TRIP TO SEONJAE ISLAND

836
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,891
JANUARY 14, 2001
SEONJAE ISLAND

837
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,158
There.

838
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,827
KANG YE-SEO, SCHOOL PRESIDENT

839
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,638
Here's a slice for my daughter.

840
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:32,206
You must have been surprised
by that unexpected call from me.

841
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:36,919
I called you because
there's something I must tell you.

842
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,464
You have...

843
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:41,674
a daughter.

844
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,068
Hello?

845
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,028
Hello?

846
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,575
Is it you, Eun-hye?

847
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,500
You're Kim Eun-hye, right?

848
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,613
Treat other families to celebrate
Ye-seo becoming school president?

849
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,365
Make sure you invite Dr. Hwang's family.

850
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,367
I heard you have questions
about Yeong-jae.

851
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,411
What will happen if people find out

852
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:35,663
that people here spend
billions of won on a coordinator?

853
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:38,958
I think you're fixated on Yeong-jae
because of Yeon-du.

854
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,585
How could I forget that?

855
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:44,088
Is this it? The deal you made
with Ye-seo's mom?

856
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,883
Be really careful with Hye-na.
She could really do something.

857
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,386
I think Hye-na knows I was the one
who made her withdraw.

858
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,471
Mr. Jo, keep an eye on Kim Hye-na.

859
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,015
What did you just say?

860
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,434
I said you should have Hye-na
move into your place.

861
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,352
Hye-na? Why?

862
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,897
