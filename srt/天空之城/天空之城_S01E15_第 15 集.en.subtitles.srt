1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,388
My gosh! Seo-jin, you made it.

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,640
Take a seat.

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,188
Shin A High is famous
for their difficult exams.

4
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,606
A legend has been born.

5
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,358
Good for you. I'm so envious.

6
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,402
-Congratulations, Seo-jin.
-Congratulations.

7
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,286
Ye-seo must be a genius.
I bet you're so proud of her.

8
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,332
Seong-jae thinks Ye-seo
is too self-centered and bullheaded.

9
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,043
And because of it,
he doesn't want to study with her.

10
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,711
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,799
She still has a long way to go.

12
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,302
Wouldn't it be harder
to maintain the status quo?

13
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,263
You're all vying for the opportunity
to take my position, after all.

14
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,392
Gosh, you really know how to make jokes.

15
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,894
Yes, exactly.

16
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,771
-Don't be absurd.
-That's not true.

17
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,190
-That's out of the question.
-My goodness.

18
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,278
Gosh, it looks delicious.
Look at all the crab meat.

19
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,514
It's delicious.

20
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,982
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

21
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,110
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

22
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,030
-Happy birthday, dear U-ju
-Happy birthday, dear U-ju

23
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,117
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

24
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,038
It's time to hit the birthday boy.

25
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,500
-Stop it.
-Come on.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,502
Here are your cocktails.

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,546
Goodness, they look amazing.

28
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,298
Se-ri, you made all this?

29
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,217
Of course. We should raise our glasses
to celebrate his birthday.

30
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,344
But of course,
they're all non-alcoholic cocktails.

31
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,554
Guys, you can each pick a glass.

32
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,017
Seung-hye. Jin-hui.
Let's raise our glasses too.

33
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,226
Okay.

34
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,731
Ye-seo.

35
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,483
Aren't you going to pick one?

36
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:13,902
Pardon?

37
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,124
U-ju, why don't you make a toast?

38
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,417
It's your birthday.

39
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,877
Should I?

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,587
-Yes. Come on, U-ju!
-Go on.

41
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,632
-U-ju!
-U-ju!

42
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,967
-Okay.
-U-ju!

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,347
We're high school seniors now.

44
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,058
And Ye-bin and Su-han
are seniors in middle school.

45
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,102
I know this year is going to be hard,

46
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,647
but I hope everything all works out
for me, you, and--

47
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,524
I hope everything works out
for me, you, and my mom.

48
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,193
-Hey, let's raise our glasses.
-Let's do it.

49
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,028
-All right. Cheers.
-Go for it.

50
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,740
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

51
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,285
Okay, U-ju. Bottoms up!

52
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,039
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

53
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,791
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

54
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,417
Didn't you hear what my dad said?

55
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,378
Do you want me to repeat what he said?

56
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,420
That's Ye-seo.

57
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,005
He called you a nuisance.

58
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,757
Yes, I get that.

59
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,551
I'll show you just how big of a nuisance
I can be.

60
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,304
I'll make sure you find out
for good, so you just wait.

61
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,768
Do you think
that's going to intimidate me?

62
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,603
You know what day it is tomorrow, right?

63
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,938
It's the day the school uploads

64
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,107
next month's lunch menu
on the school website.

65
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,693
Everyone will be visiting the website.

66
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,778
I'll post it just in time
for everyone to see.

67
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,364
Post what? What are you going to post?

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,119
I'll post that your dad is also my dad

69
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,414
and that I'm actually
Kang Hye-na, not Kim Hye-na.

70
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,169
Do you want to die?

71
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,757
You're an idiot. The only thing
you're good at is getting high grades.

72
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,343
Someone like you is no match for me.

73
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,603
Gosh, that's absurd.

74
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,107
I'm serious. I heard it loud and clear.

75
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,862
She threatened Ye-seo,
saying she'll post on the school website

76
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,614
that she's actually Kang Hye-na,
not Kim Hye-na.

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,534
Really?

78
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,202
Goodness,

79
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,455
how did she keep it a secret
all these years?

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,333
Wait a minute. If Ye-seo knows,

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,376
that definitely means
her mom knows as well.

82
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,546
Gosh. Then did Seo-jin take Hye-na in
even though she knew?

83
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,922
Or did she find out afterward?

84
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,884
Listen to me, honey.

85
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,722
You should never ever tell this to anyone.

86
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,266
Keep it to yourself
until you get buried in your coffin, okay?

87
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,602
-I can't guarantee that.
-Do as I say.

88
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,147
Gosh, I really want to tell someone.

89
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,900
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

90
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,318
Gosh, I really want to talk.

91
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,944
Okay, you guys.

92
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:07,033
I rented out this guest house
so you guys could have a lot of fun.

93
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,787
So don't think about your studies
and just concentrate on having fun, okay?

94
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,288
-Okay.
-Okay.

95
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,916
Should we also get going
to enjoy our social life?

96
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,084
Should we do that?

97
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,252
It's been so long
since I've seen a musical.

98
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,171
By the way,

99
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,340
why isn't Seo-jin coming with us?

100
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,383
She apparently has
a really important appointment today.

101
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:26,969
Let's go.

102
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,015
Ye-seo is the top student in her year.

103
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,767
Everything will be fine.

104
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,020
Not every student that Kim Ju-yeong
sent to SNU's med school

105
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,647
ended up dying.

106
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,899
I'm doing a good job.

107
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,366
Ye-seo, Hye-na will never
be able to do that.

108
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,993
She'll gain nothing from doing that.

109
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,121
What if she really posts
it on the website?

110
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,791
I'll be too humiliated
to even go to school.

111
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,877
Coach Kim.

112
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,840
I really...

113
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,095
want to kill Kim Hye-na.

114
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,392
You said she heard your dad
call someone like her a nuisance.

115
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,686
So she only said that to you out of anger.

116
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,313
Of course.

117
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,649
When was I ever wrong?

118
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,153
It's U-ju's birthday party today.

119
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,280
Don't worry and have fun, okay?

120
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,335
Ms. Kim, you need to get going.

121
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,174
Hye-na's pretty impressive.

122
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,135
She really knows how to provoke Ye-seo.

123
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,930
Thanks to that, Ye-seo seems
to rely on you a lot more.

124
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,851
Do you also think so?

125
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,438
She trusts and listens to you
more than her own mom.

126
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,026
It's been a while...

127
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,445
since I last met Ye-seo's mother.

128
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,406
I shouldn't make her wait for too long.

129
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,466
Gosh.

130
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,220
Is she out of her mind?

131
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,139
She's already 20 minutes late,
but she hasn't even called yet.

132
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,642
Even my mom came to see her.

133
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,311
I'll try calling her.

134
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,604
You don't need to do that.

135
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,899
I had to deal with so many
different types of private tutors

136
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,151
during the times
when private lessons were illegal.

137
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,904
And that's how he became
the top student in the entire country.

138
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,741
Those teachers don't have honor or power.

139
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,244
I guess she wants to put on airs
while she's in charge.

140
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,662
So just let it slide.

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,623
I already told you before

142
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,542
that she's just like a reference book

143
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,252
you throw away
after you're done reading it.

144
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,964
All we need
is to get Ye-seo accepted to university.

145
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:09,924
Yes, Mother.

146
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,928
Yes, she's just a reference book
I'll use and throw away.

147
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,013
She's here.

148
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,395
Welcome.

149
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,897
Nice to meet you, Coach Kim.

150
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,065
Have a seat.

151
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,289
I'll post that your dad is also my dad

152
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,625
and that I'm actually
Kang Hye-na, not Kim Hye-na.

153
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,212
They're already always locking horns
over who will get higher grades.

154
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,798
But on top of that, they're half sisters?

155
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,098
Let's concentrate.

156
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,945
She's already doing really well,

157
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,990
but a good ending
is what's most important.

158
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,701
Please take good care of Ye-seo.

159
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,664
Don't worry.

160
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,166
If she keeps this up,
she'll have no trouble getting accepted.

161
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,339
Thanks to you, my mother
will be able to achieve her dream

162
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,342
of having three generations
of doctors in our family.

163
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,178
Thank you so much.

164
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,597
I'm not the one you should thank.

165
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,767
You should thank Ye-seo's mother instead.

166
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,144
We got these results

167
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,230
because she trusted me
from the very beginning.

168
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:34,944
I'd like to take this opportunity
to thank you for your trust.

169
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,157
I entrusted you with my child,
so of course I should have faith in you.

170
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,576
Please keep doing your best in the future.

171
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,212
YE-BIN

172
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,258
Do excuse me.

173
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,014
I'm in an important--

174
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,100
Mom, she fell down.

175
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,019
She fell off the balcony
and her head is bleeding.

176
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,021
What should we do?

177
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,190
What? Ye-seo fell?

178
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,193
No, Hye-na. Hye-na fell.

179
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,779
Hye-na?

180
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,198
Where is she now?

181
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,242
Dad, we just left.

182
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,078
-We're headed to Junam's ER.
-The ER?

183
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,997
Who's there from Neurosurgery?

184
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,957
Hwang Chi-yeong?

185
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,709
-Just him?
-Where's Ye-seo?

186
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,794
-Where's your sister?
-The director's not in today.

187
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,838
-He's celebrating his retirement.
-Is she not with you?

188
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,214
I'll be right there. Hurry.

189
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,008
Okay, hang up.

190
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,885
Honey, wait!

191
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,765
Mother, Hye-na's badly hurt.

192
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,060
They took her to the ER.
I should go as well.

193
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,104
Hye-na's at the ER?

194
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,272
What happened?

195
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,025
The kids gathered at the guest house
to celebrate U-ju's birthday.

196
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,776
But it seems there was an accident.

197
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,029
Keep me updated on her condition too.

198
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,280
I will. Bye.

199
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,129
There could be fractures, so be careful.

200
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,756
One, two. three.

201
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,218
She fell down.

202
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,762
As soon as she's ready, get a CT done.

203
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,055
Hye-na.

204
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,723
Can you hear me?

205
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,562
She's been asking for water.
She must be thirsty.

206
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,774
I'll give you some
after the tests are done. Hang in there.

207
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,192
Let's hurry.

208
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,361
Kid.

209
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,072
This belongs to her.

210
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,115
Thank you.

211
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,369
What happened?

212
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,955
Dad. Will she be okay?

213
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,290
-Will she make it?
-Of course she will.

214
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,000
What exactly happened?

215
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,254
I don't know.

216
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,048
I went to the balcony
after getting a text from Hye-na.

217
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,387
The epidural hematoma's quite big.

218
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,181
Get ready for her surgery. We must hurry.

219
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,225
-Yes, Dr. Hwang.
-Traffic accident victim coming in.

220
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,483
Dr. Hwang, we have an urgent case.

221
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,443
A nine-year-old traffic accident victim.

222
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,237
Suspected head injury. Look.

223
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,366
Another epidural hematoma.

224
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,493
This one's quite big too.

225
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,037
I'll call a colleague.

226
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,499
They'll be drunk
after the retirement ceremony.

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,376
Operate on him first.

228
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,504
Find another hospital to take her.

229
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,881
-Do it.
-Yes, sir.

230
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,173
That patient...

231
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,634
is Hye-na.

232
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,511
Kim Hye-na.

233
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,513
She lives in your house.

234
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,895
Does it matter
if I know the patient or not?

235
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,563
The worse case has priority.

236
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,231
Hye-na's in bad shape too!

237
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,441
She's barely conscious

238
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,401
and the hematoma's so large,
so during transfer--

239
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,528
This boy is the director's grandson!

240
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,364
Will you take the blame
if something goes wrong?

241
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,034
They're both serious cases.

242
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,329
I'm ordering as the Planning Manager.

243
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,622
Save the boy first.

244
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,665
Operate on him first!

245
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,437
OPERATING ROOM

246
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,406
Who is she on the phone with?

247
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,452
Hye-na.

248
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,250
Doctor, why didn't you operate?

249
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,419
-Why?
-There was a more urgent case.

250
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,171
She will be transferred
to another hospital.

251
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,299
What? Where's my dad?

252
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,593
Where's Dr. Hwang Chi-yeong?

253
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,187
Where's Dr. Hwang Chi-yeong?

254
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,499
Dad.

255
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,275
-Go on. Hurry.
-Yes, sir.

256
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,369
Dad.

257
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,789
Dad.

258
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,046
You can't do this.

259
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,381
Why won't you help her
when she arrived first?

260
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,259
Why? She got here first!

261
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,345
There was a more serious case.

262
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,558
She'll be taken to the ICU
and then to another hospital.

263
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,643
Don't worry.

264
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,814
Any news?

265
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,234
Then call another hospital.

266
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,070
Why are you calling me, you idiot?

267
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,284
Ye-seo?

268
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,827
Ye-seo.

269
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,498
Ye-seo, it's okay.

270
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,125
Trust me.

271
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,127
You did nothing wrong.

272
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,256
Hye-na's your rival.

273
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,552
It's natural to hate
and resent your rival.

274
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,096
Of course it is.

275
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,141
Who is she on the phone with?

276
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,854
U-ju.

277
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,192
Did you say there was no one
on the balcony when you got there?

278
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,119
Wait. Just a moment.

279
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,538
Hye-na. Hye-na.

280
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,540
Hye-na, wait. Wake up.

281
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,792
Wait, doctor. Just a minute.

282
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,336
Hye-na. Hye-na, wait for a minute.

283
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,672
Hye-na!

284
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,258
Hye-na. Hye-na, wait.

285
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,052
Kim Hye-na just died in the ICU.

286
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,262
KANG JUN-SANG

287
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,222
We couldn't find a hospital
to take her on time.

288
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,406
Wait...

289
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,867
Just a moment. Wait.

290
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,578
Wait. Hye-na, please.

291
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,246
-Hye-na.
-U-ju!

292
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,789
-Hye-na, wait.
-U-ju.

293
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,999
Wait. No.

294
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,211
My goodness. What happened?

295
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,130
Why is she dead? What happened to her?

296
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,632
Hye-na. Hye-na!

297
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,383
Hye-na, what happened?

298
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,792
No.

299
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,419
Did Ye-seo do something because

300
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,129
of what happened in the morning?

301
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,215
Dad.

302
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,343
One of my friends is having
a nervous breakdown these days.

303
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,553
She is? Why?

304
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,764
She found out that her dad
had another daughter her age.

305
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,851
-Ye-seo.
-Her dad

306
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,728
had no idea she existed.

307
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,607
She was the result of a mistake he made
before he got married.

308
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,235
What would you do if that were you, Dad?

309
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,533
What a nuisance.

310
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,246
He never should've made such a nuisance
in the first place.

311
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,790
"A nuisance"?

312
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,085
Yes, it's certainly a nuisance.

313
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:40,507
To have a peaceful family,
parents and children must do their duties.

314
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,010
After doing something
so reckless and irresponsible,

315
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,012
how's he going to assert
his authority as a father?

316
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,898
Then if someone shows up one day
saying she's your daughter,

317
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,859
will you kick her out?

318
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,531
Are you a kid? Why are you asking
such a dumb question?

319
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,869
My princesses,

320
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,705
don't even imagine
something like that will happen.

321
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,124
Ye-seo and Ye-bin,

322
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,419
you two are and will always be
my only daughters.

323
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,391
She's still his child.

324
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,143
How could you call her a nuisance?

325
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,647
Don't you think it's wrong of you
to say that as a dad yourself?

326
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,364
Think about that child.

327
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,784
What did she do wrong?

328
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,666
No one told her to be born like that.

329
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,794
Ye-seo.

330
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,214
Why are we talking such nonsense
in the morning?

331
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,051
Let's eat. Eat, girls.

332
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,904
MY PRINCESS

333
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
Who were you on the phone with?

334
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,017
You ignored all my calls.

335
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,272
Who were you talking to?

336
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,150
I was talking to Coach Kim.
Can't I even talk to her on the phone?

337
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,030
What happened to Hye-na?

338
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,410
-I don't know.
-You were at the guest house too!

339
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,995
I was in the master bedroom!

340
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,623
They were playing games,

341
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,542
so I was listening to a lecture
with my earphones on.

342
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,379
I didn't even know that Hye-na fell.

343
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,093
Who saw you...

344
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,803
listening to the lecture?

345
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,266
Did anyone actually see it?

346
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,269
Do you not trust me?

347
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,731
Hye-na is dead.

348
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,235
You two were enemies.

349
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,946
If people find out
that you two are half sisters,

350
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,282
the police will suspect you first.

351
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,701
Tell me everything that happened.

352
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,578
Only then can I help you.

353
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,249
You provoked her even this morning.

354
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,960
Did nothing happen between you two?

355
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,759
She said she'd post on the school website
that she's Dad's daughter.

356
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,678
And?

357
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,097
Did you two fight?

358
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,105
Are you suspecting me now?

359
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,066
Do you think I killed Hye-na?

360
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,151
Have you lost your mind?
How could you say such a thing?

361
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,780
You absolutely cannot tell

362
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,157
what you just said to anybody else.

363
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,786
Do not tell anybody
that you and Hye-na argued, okay?

364
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,042
What happened to Hye-na?

365
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,212
She'll be okay after the surgery, right?

366
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,047
Right?

367
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,135
Ye-bin.

368
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,681
Hye-na...

369
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,685
went to a good place.

370
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,607
What does that mean?

371
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,696
Hye-na...

372
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,615
Is Hye-na dead?

373
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,593
What do I do?

374
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,191
Hye-na, my gosh...

375
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,653
No...

376
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,644
Sir!

377
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,688
Sir!

378
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,776
Sir!

379
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,239
Sir, wait.

380
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,616
Sir!

381
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,412
Sir!

382
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,622
Sir!

383
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,428
Have a nice day.

384
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,204
What is happening?

385
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,958
See? I told you something must be up
between Ye-seo and Hye-na.

386
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,376
Quiet.

387
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,795
I told you to never even bring it up.

388
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,839
If you aren't careful
with what you say now--

389
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,174
But how can I not say anything?

390
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:22,594
Hye-na said she would disclose
Dr. Kang being her birth father,

391
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,262
and she died.

392
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,014
Are you saying Ye-seo did it or what?

393
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,557
It was probably an accident.

394
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,811
Please. Keep your lips sealed.

395
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,938
Just stitch them together, okay?

396
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,668
U-ju.

397
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,255
U-ju, will you be all right?

398
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,466
You don't have to go to school today.

399
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,426
I'll call and let your teacher know.

400
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,053
Okay?

401
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,735
U-ju.

402
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,072
I...

403
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,116
I had no choice but to--

404
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,993
Because the other patient
is younger than Hye-na,

405
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,333
you felt that you had
to save that kid's life first.

406
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,503
That's why you had no choice.

407
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,133
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,178
I'm really sorry...

409
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,558
-about what happened to Hye-na.
-You're sorry?

410
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,688
We lost Mom in the same way,
and that's all you can say?

411
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,860
Mom told you her stomach was upset,
but you gave her digestive pills

412
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,653
and went to some hospital to volunteer.

413
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,697
It's you...

414
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,576
who killed Hye-na.

415
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,121
U-ju,

416
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,998
you know that it wasn't intentional.

417
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,146
Hey, I heard Hye-na from Class Three died.

418
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,190
Do you think Ye-seo killed her?

419
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,984
She'll always be the top student
now that Hye-na's dead.

420
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,235
Exactly.

421
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,201
He won't pick up.

422
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,370
U-ju didn't even come to school.

423
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,289
-Do you think he'll be okay?
-Of course not.

424
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,541
I'm barely staying sane myself.

425
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,462
It's crazy that we need to study
even in this kind of situation.

426
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,382
Hye-na's no longer here,
but everything else is the same as before.

427
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,426
She seriously gives me the creeps.

428
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,472
She really is cold-hearted.

429
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,643
-Do you think she killed her?
-Hey.

430
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,895
Don't suspect her like that.

431
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,898
Ye-seo can be selfish,
but she'd never do something like that.

432
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:04,941
I mean, come on.

433
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,776
They were always fighting
because of their grades.

434
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,070
They hated each other's guts.

435
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,334
She died while living poorly
without her mom.

436
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,711
I feel so sorry

437
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,170
for Hye-na...

438
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,590
Never mind. Eat up.

439
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,722
You guys fought?

440
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,559
You fought with her?

441
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,689
I told you we should talk
after she finishes her meal.

442
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,441
How can she eat in this situation?

443
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,193
I can't believe she's acting so brazenly.

444
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,781
I heard you and Hye-na fought.

445
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,950
I heard everyone saw you two fight.

446
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,746
I told you that we quickly made up.

447
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,874
-How many times do I need to--
-Do you think the cops will believe you?

448
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:08,004
Do you think they're going to trust a girl
who drinks and dances at clubs?

449
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,840
Se-ri works as a club marketing director.

450
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,426
She's in charge of planning,
marketing, and attracting customers.

451
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,386
-She's a professional--
-A professional?

452
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,890
Cut the bullshit.

453
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,607
Why did you even go to the party?
Weren't you embarrassed?

454
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,901
Why did you have to make cocktails
and go to the party

455
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,861
when you had done
absolutely nothing right?

456
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,495
Aren't you going
to send her to university?

457
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,121
You should focus on that.

458
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,915
You shouldn't be cooking
hangover soup for her

459
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,583
after she came home drunk.

460
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,876
She...

461
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,253
doesn't want to go to university.

462
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,340
Are you crazy? Have you gone mad?

463
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,509
You're going to let her go on
living like that?

464
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,135
She's my daughter!

465
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,597
She enjoys what she does.
She likes her job, so just please...

466
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,432
let her do whatever she--

467
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,602
I let her do what she wanted
and look what happened!

468
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,569
Who do you think the cops
will suspect the most

469
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,197
out of all the kids
who were in the guest house?

470
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,701
Ye-seo was the one
who was on bad terms with Hye-na.

471
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,747
Ye-seo's a model student.

472
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,336
Would you trust

473
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,964
a kid that gets
the highest grades in her year,

474
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,883
or a fraud that pretended
to be a Harvard student?

475
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,220
Will you please get a grasp
of what's going on?

476
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,120
I heard your daughter and Hye-na
used to be rivals.

477
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,790
They did compete against each other
to be the top student.

478
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,792
But think about it, sir.

479
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,460
If they were on bad terms,

480
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,963
why would I have let her live here
as my younger daughter's tutor?

481
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,344
What kind of student was Hye-na?

482
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,556
She was very ambitious
about getting the best grades,

483
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,310
but she was also smart,
polite, and diligent.

484
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,353
She was pretty much perfect.

485
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,316
How did this happen?

486
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,775
By any chance,

487
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,029
did she have her own laptop?

488
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,489
A laptop?

489
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,076
I've never seen her use one at home.

490
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,996
Can we meet both of your daughters

491
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,498
who were at the guest house last night?

492
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,254
Are you saying it might
not have been an accident?

493
00:36:56,088 --> 00:37:00,509
The railing of the balcony
that Hye-na fell from is 130cm high.

494
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,931
That's about 10cm higher
than the average balcony railings.

495
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,516
So it's very unlikely
that it was just an accident.

496
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,518
On top of that, the paint

497
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,729
on the railing was peeled off,
and it was also rusty.

498
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,106
But the victim's socks were clean.

499
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,652
So it's also unlikely
that she would've committed suicide.

500
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,280
Then...

501
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,950
are you saying she was murdered?

502
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,201
Well...

503
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,664
Someone called an ambulance

504
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,749
exactly at 9:34 p.m.

505
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,669
Can you tell us what you guys
were doing at that hour?

506
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,005
I already told you.

507
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,593
They had dinner together
and played Mafia in the living room.

508
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,013
But Ye-seo was in the bedroom
listening to an online lecture

509
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,306
with her earphones on.

510
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,100
So she didn't even know that Hye-na fell.

511
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,185
And Ye-bin didn't know either
because she was playing

512
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,145
video games with the boys
in the living room.

513
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,981
I asked the kids.

514
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,526
My kids are seniors in middle school
and high school.

515
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,445
They can't afford
to waste a single minute of their time.

516
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,031
Why would you ask them something
that you already confirmed?

517
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,202
Stop asking the kids who pushed her.

518
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,996
Just check the CCTVs.

519
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,956
We'd love to do that if we could.

520
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,294
But you see, there are a lot
of CCTVs outside of the Castle.

521
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,171
But we couldn't find any
inside the Castle.

522
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,715
Apparently, it's for privacy issues.

523
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,591
This is a place for people

524
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,468
who are well-educated, refined,

525
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,096
and who also have noble characters.

526
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,472
-So--
-Your name's Ye-seo, right?

527
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,975
If you were listening
to an online lecture then,

528
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,560
we'll be able to check your log-in record.

529
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,895
Can you bring us your laptop?

530
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,690
Pardon?

531
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,199
Okay.

532
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,538
Ye-bin,

533
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,624
did anything unusual happen last night?

534
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,376
Did anyone fight with each other?

535
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,755
I heard Hye-na and Se-ri had a huge fight.

536
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,381
Right?

537
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,305
They fought with each other
while we were playing Mafia.

538
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,182
-Mafia?
-Mafia?

539
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,184
I also think Hye-na's the mafia.

540
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,271
Mafias tend to be good
at using other people's weaknesses

541
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,648
just like how you spread rumors
the moment you found out

542
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,317
that I wasn't a Harvard student.

543
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,779
You had to pretend
like you were a university student

544
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,739
despite the kind of environment
you grew up in.

545
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,368
The fact that you live
such a pathetic life

546
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,370
shows that you're the mafia.

547
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,830
Hye-na, you're crossing the line.

548
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,126
Do you feel inferior
to the people who live here?

549
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,796
That's a sense of inferiority
and victim mentality.

550
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,675
You think I have a sense
of inferiority and victim mentality?

551
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,638
After I started living here in the Castle,

552
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,392
I realized that it's not worth
feeling inferior to you guys.

553
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,396
My mom never could do much
for me because she was ill,

554
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,773
but she at least loved me for who I was.

555
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,192
She wasn't like your dad.

556
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,654
She never thought of me
as one of her trophies.

557
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,949
But I have to admit,
you're very courageous of having managed

558
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,909
to backstab your dad like that.

559
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,662
You're just like the mafia
who don't stop at anything.

560
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,372
You'll even betray your family.

561
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,165
What did you just say, Hye-na?

562
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,376
Gi-jun, it's just a game. Sit down.

563
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,928
Who said Hye-na fought with my daughter?

564
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,973
Is it always a fight
if you have clashing opinions?

565
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,351
Se-ri's being framed by others.

566
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,272
If Hye-na told the whole neighborhood

567
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,190
that Se-ri wasn't actually
a university student,

568
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,985
wouldn't you want to see her dead or--

569
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,947
Are you investigating or writing a novel?

570
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,783
I'm a law professor
and an ex-chief prosecutor.

571
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,743
I have seniors and juniors in the field.

572
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,538
You do?

573
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,874
Then you must know

574
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,751
that when we investigate a case,
we have to consider all--

575
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,044
I'm hesitant...

576
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,047
to share such information, but...

577
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,509
Se-ri wasn't the only person
Hye-na fought with.

578
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,136
No way.

579
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:16,098
U-ju was closer to her
than any of the kids living here.

580
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,851
Detective, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

581
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,020
It was U-ju's birthday yesterday.

582
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,065
Considering his and Hye-na's
personalities, they wouldn't have fought.

583
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,444
The EMT who transported her
said he gave you her phone.

584
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,405
Did you lose that too?

585
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,407
That was...

586
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,368
He could've dropped it somewhere
in the hospital.

587
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,329
He put it in the pocket of his hoodie.

588
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,039
Couldn't it have fallen out?

589
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,750
Sure, that's possible.

590
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,961
You were the first one to find her.

591
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,756
Why did you go to the balcony?

592
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,967
Why?

593
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,934
Hye-na sent me a text
asking me to meet her

594
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,852
on the balcony.

595
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,438
Can we take your phone?

596
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,066
Do you suspect my son?

597
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,195
Ye-seo and Se-ri gave up
their phones and laptops too.

598
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,323
We could bring a warrant and seize it,

599
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,951
but why don't you cooperate with us?

600
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,702
Go on.

601
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,088
Thanks.

602
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,814
That means one of our kids is the culprit.

603
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,985
I knew something would happen.

604
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,114
That's why I asked to meet up.

605
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,075
The kids will be middle school
and high school seniors soon.

606
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,869
Nothing good will come
from dragging this out

607
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,913
at such an important time of their lives.

608
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,331
That's very true.

609
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,334
Let's compare the kids' statements

610
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,713
and reach a conclusion
as soon as possible.

611
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,091
Please tell the truth
without adding or subtracting facts.

612
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,594
Wasn't the one who found Hye-na first

613
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,262
U-ju?

614
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:22,600
You know the first witness
is usually the prime suspect?

615
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,184
What suspect?

616
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,229
U-ju said Hye-na had already fallen
when he reached the balcony.

617
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,480
How can we believe that?

618
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,983
He could be defending himself.

619
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,527
How can you say that?

620
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,114
If that's the case, how can we
believe Se-ri and Ye-seo?

621
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,033
At the time, Se-ri was in the kitchen

622
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,285
and Ye-seo was in the master bedroom.

623
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,288
The kitchen and master bedroom
are all connected to the balcony.

624
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,624
Of course, there are doors in the kitchen

625
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,667
and the bedroom that lead to the balcony.

626
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,961
What's most important
is the motive for murder.

627
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,464
U-ju and Hye-na...

628
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,886
were so-and-so.

629
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,306
What do you mean "so-and-so"?

630
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:07,645
Are you saying that my son killed Hye-na?

631
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:11,106
Can you take responsibility
for that statement?

632
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,442
Why are you yelling?

633
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,778
I'm just saying
we should discuss the possibilities.

634
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,073
It could be U-ju,
but it could also be Ye-seo.

635
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,491
"It could also be Ye-seo"?

636
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,952
Gosh, this is just unbelievable.

637
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,955
Hey, if you want to look at possibilities,

638
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,500
your daughter's the most likely suspect!

639
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,085
Think about it.

640
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,712
The whole neighborhood found out

641
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,090
that Se-ri doesn't actually attend Harvard
because of Hye-na.

642
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,841
Se-ri must've hated Hye-na.

643
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,052
Wouldn't she want her dead?

644
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,846
Yes, of course.

645
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,264
Would she...

646
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,974
not want her dead?

647
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,435
Who here

648
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,187
doesn't know...

649
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,940
that Hye-na and Ye-seo hated each other?

650
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,528
I know very well.
They couldn't stand each other.

651
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,446
-Be quiet.
-Why?

652
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,906
Don't you know what Ye-seo's like?

653
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,950
She's the most problematic kid
of them all.

654
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,661
Hey, shut your mouth! What do you know?

655
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,454
You raise your kid without a backbone.

656
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,414
What?

657
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,542
Are you having another go at me? Damn you.

658
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,294
I'd love to hook you up to a dogsled

659
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,965
and drag you around
so your eyes flip and lips rip off.

660
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,175
You're right! I don't have a backbone.

661
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,054
But I didn't raise my kid
into a scumbag like yours!

662
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,974
What? "Scumbag"? Do you have a death wish?

663
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,352
You're the only one who doesn't know
how nasty your kid is.

664
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,564
You're the only one who doesn't know
how messed up Ye-seo is.

665
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,523
Hey!

666
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,734
Of all our kids, your daughter's the one
with the worst character!

667
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,319
How dare she lie?

668
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:40,988
About going to Harvard, no less.

669
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,281
Kwak Mi-hyang!

670
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,910
You're in no position to criticize her.
Don't you think so?

671
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,872
My point exactly. Who are you framing?

672
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:50,998
"Framing"?

673
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,124
I apologize.

674
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,461
Let's be honest here.
She just dances at clubs.

675
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,880
Who knows if she pushed the girl over?

676
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,006
You bastard!

677
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,674
Se-ri's a club marketing director.

678
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,135
She's in charge of planning,
marketing, and attracting customers.

679
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,261
She's a professional!

680
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,263
She works hard and lives independently!

681
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,347
That's right!

682
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,350
She's not like Ye-seo,
a monster who only cares about grades.

683
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,353
I'll rip your jaw open.
Who are you calling a monster?

684
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,689
Rip what off? That's so low.

685
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,649
You vulgar woman.

686
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,776
What? "Vulgar"?

687
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,322
Hey. Come over here, you asshole.

688
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,575
I need to rip your jaw open first.
Come here!

689
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,619
Go ahead, bastard. Rip it open.

690
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,496
-My gosh.
-Stop it.

691
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,705
-Do it.
-Hey.

692
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,958
I can't do it
until you show me your mouth.

693
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,295
Oh, no. Honey.

694
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,257
Blood?

695
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,259
Dr. Kang.

696
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,928
Don't get involved.

697
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,137
-Stay out of it.
-He's bleeding.

698
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,931
How long will you grovel?

699
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,350
-I'm not groveling.
-You stay still.

700
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,893
-Jin Jin.
-Sit still.

701
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,019
Damn you.

702
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,437
Hey!

703
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,167
-Take off your glasses.
-No.

704
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,210
Take them off.

705
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,379
-I will not.
-You jerk.

706
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,422
Take them off. Take them off.

707
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,092
-Hey!
-That hurts.

708
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,095
-He's bleeding.
-Stop groveling.

709
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,225
That hurts.

710
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,730
What are you all doing?

711
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,448
A girl is dead.

712
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,245
A girl who lived among us is now dead!

713
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,624
She was alone, without family,
and now she's dead.

714
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,586
Don't any of you care for her?

715
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,596
What's the point
when the adults don't act like adults?

716
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,223
Honey,

717
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,474
let's go home.

718
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,287
This is infuriating.

719
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,872
I can't stand it.

720
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,958
Honey, get up. We're leaving.

721
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:40,917
What?

722
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,174
Seung-hye.

723
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,675
You're right.

724
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,511
Ye-seo and Hye-na hated each other.

725
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,097
I saw them fight yesterday.

726
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,891
We're leaving.

727
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,603
Sorry.

728
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,356
-Sorry.
-Jin Jin.

729
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,622
Jin Jin, I told you not to say a word.

730
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,832
Dr. Kang hates Professor Cha.

731
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,000
Why...

732
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,754
How am I to face him now?

733
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,383
I just couldn't stand
what your boss was doing.

734
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,469
He provided the cause
that led to this incident.

735
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,223
How dare he have an illegitimate kid,
and put the blame on another kid?

736
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:41,019
I noticed today that Dr. Kang
doesn't know Hye-na was his.

737
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,437
He doesn't know?

738
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,314
When he is the one who had her?

739
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,607
How can he not know?

740
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,695
You know, men can't always know...

741
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,407
-Whatever.
-Gosh.

742
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,909
What? No backbone?

743
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,620
I should rip Kwak Mi-hyang's jaw open.

744
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,374
I might blab about the fight
and ruin Ye-seo for good.

745
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,376
Now that's just dangerous.

746
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,169
Even if they fought, would Ye-seo do that?

747
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,504
No way.

748
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,549
Don't jump to conclusions. Don't you dare!

749
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,677
Her husband had an illegitimate child
and now Ye-seo...

750
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,512
Gosh, she must be feeling terrible.

751
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,725
Shall I disclose it or not?
Tell everyone or not?

752
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,659
You're right.

753
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,328
Ye-seo and Hye-na hated each other.

754
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,497
I saw them fight yesterday.

755
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,545
She said she'd post on the school website
that she's Dad's daughter.

756
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,410
Who's here at this hour?

757
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,003
What brings you here this late?

758
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,466
-Jin-hui.
-What are you doing?

759
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:38,970
Jin-hui,

760
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,972
please help me out.

761
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,519
I'm sorry.

762
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,938
I'm sorry about everything.

763
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,900
I'm sorry I said you have no backbone.

764
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,402
I also want to apologize
for grabbing you by the hair.

765
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,072
I'm also really sorry
for pouring that syrup on your face.

766
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,159
Couldn't you have apologized sooner?

767
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,786
I don't need your apology now.

768
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,872
Jin-hui, what can I do?

769
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,749
-What can I do to make it up to you?
-Gosh.

770
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,501
Get on my knees?
Shall I get down on my knees?

771
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,461
Gosh, why on earth
are you being like this?

772
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,338
This won't change anything.

773
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,966
I don't know how you've been
living your life,

774
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,968
but I'm not two-faced.

775
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,388
I have eyes, ears, and a mouth.
How could I not say what I saw and heard?

776
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,808
Jin-hui, please.

777
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,061
Frankly,

778
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,771
I can't forgive you for grabbing my hair

779
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,731
and pouring the syrup on my face,

780
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,317
but being criticized for not having
a backbone infuriates me even more.

781
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,986
How dare you say such a thing to me?

782
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,823
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
It's all my fault.

783
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,117
I beg you, Jin-hui. Forgive me, please?

784
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,627
Let's talk inside.

785
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,296
It's cold out here.

786
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,972
You see, Ye-seo can be greedy
when it comes to grades,

787
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,682
but she's definitely not spiteful.

788
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,603
I mean, even Coach Kim said
she's mentally fragile.

789
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,316
Ye-seo was listening to an online
physics lecture when it happened.

790
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,817
We have a record of her logging in.

791
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,821
I'm aware.

792
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,698
I know Ye-seo well enough.

793
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,075
I said whatever came out of my mouth
because I was angry.

794
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,332
It's not nice to say this
about a girl who's dead,

795
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,376
but both Ye-seo and I...

796
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,130
have been so distressed by Hye-na.

797
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,342
You...

798
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,094
must have been through a lot.

799
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,847
She moved into your place,

800
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,641
fully knowing that Dr. Kang
is her birth father.

801
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,355
I begged her not to tell anyone about it
until Ye-seo gets into university.

802
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,317
It must have been driving you crazy.

803
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,153
You've lost a lot of weight.

804
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,744
Jun-sang has no idea
that Hye-na is his daughter.

805
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,623
He just made a mistake when he was young,

806
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,625
and he doesn't even seem to remember it.

807
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,168
I've kept it from him

808
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,295
because I thought it'd distract Ye-seo
if he found out.

809
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,254
My gosh,

810
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,924
so you haven't told him about it yet?

811
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,093
Because it might distract Ye-seo?

812
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,637
I have so much respect for you.

813
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,682
I would've grabbed my husband
by the collar and tortured him.

814
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,183
I was foolish.

815
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,770
I should've just told Jun-sang already.

816
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,273
That poor little thing...

817
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,069
She died before she could
even call him Dad once.

818
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,613
Gosh, Seo-jin.

819
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,158
You're actually so softhearted.

820
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,424
I've hurt your feelings a lot, haven't I?

821
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,762
You aren't the only one who's at fault.

822
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,514
I kept...

823
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,225
provoking you intentionally.

824
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,937
I had no idea
what you had been going through.

825
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,649
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

826
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,294
I'm home.

827
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,923
How much longer
do you plan to live like that?

828
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,343
I'll get out of your sight.

829
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,261
Cha Se-ri!

830
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,059
Have you not learned
your lesson from this?

831
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,394
Everyone is pegging you as a suspect

832
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,396
just because you pretended
to be a Harvard student.

833
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,023
If you were actually a Harvard student,

834
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:45,777
no one would dare to suspect you.

835
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,028
Honey,

836
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,781
she worked all night and just got home.

837
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,157
Must you do this now?

838
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,452
Everyone said Se-ri
is the most problematic one in the Castle.

839
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,579
How could you sleep after hearing that?

840
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,459
Don't use others as an excuse.

841
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,046
Isn't that what you think, Dad?

842
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,007
-What?
-I told you.

843
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,678
I was in the kitchen after the mafia game.
Then Hye-na called me, so I followed her.

844
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,762
Se-ri,

845
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,140
I was out of line earlier.

846
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,225
I'm sorry.

847
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,104
I should've been more thoughtful.

848
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,902
Anyway, I envy you
for being proud of your mom.

849
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,614
I know she passed away,

850
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,825
but you are staying strong thanks to her.

851
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:35,994
Se-ri.

852
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,997
I'm sorry I talked about inferiority
and provoked you.

853
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,250
And I was the mafia.

854
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,169
Wait and see.

855
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,171
I'll show you how the mafia
can turn her life around.

856
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:56,014
You jumped to the conclusion that no one
would believe me because I had lied.

857
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,849
That's just what you think.

858
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,145
Of course.

859
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,732
This is precisely
why you have to go to university.

860
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,239
Why do I have to go to university?

861
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,700
My dream is to work hard

862
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:18,244
so that I can open a club
with my hard-earned money.

863
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,914
Must I really go to university?

864
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,877
I didn't actually get accepted to Harvard,
but I have experienced everything.

865
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,296
I thought the best university
in the world would be special,

866
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,506
but it was no big deal.

867
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,550
All those students are human too.

868
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,427
I've seen people who got accepted

869
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,012
because they hired someone
to take the SAT.

870
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,680
They all lie and cheat.

871
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,516
I've even heard some say

872
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,227
that not cheating in exams means
you don't want to be the best.

873
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,855
It's not like every Harvard graduate
is successful.

874
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,899
A guy I know is in a mess
because his life went downhill

875
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,442
even after he graduated from Harvard.

876
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,236
That is obviously a rare case.

877
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,405
-If you're a Harvard graduate, everyone--
-Everyone will acknowledge you?

878
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,699
Who cares what everyone else thinks

879
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,201
as long as I'm happy?

880
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,667
Dancing gives me joy.

881
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,169
I get so excited when I see
people unwinding at the club.

882
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,671
So, Dad,

883
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,131
please do me a favor
and respect my decisions.

884
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,593
Before I start completely ignoring you,
who only respects those

885
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,388
who graduated from elite schools.

886
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,279
It's like talking to a wall.

887
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,991
I just can't get through to her.

888
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,248
Hye-na,

889
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,584
I'm sorry.

890
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,548
I'm sorry.

891
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,594
I'm sorry...

892
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,782
Ms. Han!

893
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,160
I'll do it, ma'am.

894
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,019
Ye-seo!

895
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,105
Ye-seo!

896
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,565
Ye-seo!

897
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,155
Ye-seo, wait. Ye-seo.

898
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,307
Let's go.

899
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,903
Ms. Han, Ye-seo will stay with me tonight.

900
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,455
Who were you on the phone with?

901
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,831
You ignored all my calls.

902
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,959
I was talking to Coach Kim.
Can't I even talk to her on the phone?

903
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,132
It was at that time.

904
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,051
The time when Hye-na fell.

905
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,053
Did the two of them...

906
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:54,038
As soon as Ye-bin called me and told me

907
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,666
that Hye-na fell from the balcony,

908
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,168
I called Ye-seo.

909
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,671
But the line was busy.

910
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,383
I kept calling,
but I couldn't get a hold of her.

911
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,012
What did you and Ye-seo
talk about for over an hour?

912
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,144
I tried...

913
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,190
to calm her down.

914
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,277
What do you mean?

915
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,867
What if she really posts
it on the website?

916
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,122
I'll be too humiliated
to even go to school.

917
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,126
Coach Kim.

918
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,462
I really...

919
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:47,091
want to kill Kim Hye-na.

920
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,566
On the day of U-ju's birthday party,

921
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,527
this was...

922
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,654
the only thing on Ye-seo's mind.

923
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:11,657
Wanting to kill someone and
actually doing it are clearly different.

924
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,494
Ye-seo would never do such a thing
no matter how much she hated her.

925
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,122
It was a murder,
neither suicide nor an accident.

926
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,542
Among all the kids
who were there that day...

927
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,548
who do you think killed Hye-na?

928
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,388
When Hye-na fell from the balcony,
Ye-seo was listening

929
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,223
to an online lecture
in the master bedroom.

930
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:39,310
All she had to do was play the clip.
Even if she did something else...

931
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,688
no one would know.

932
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:53,783
Are you saying...

933
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,828
Ye-seo was the one

934
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,122
who killed Hye-na?

935
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,878
Whether Ye-seo killed her or not,
the important thing is

936
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,589
the fact that she's a high school senior.

937
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:11,676
And since I am coaching her,

938
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,679
she absolutely cannot be the culprit.

939
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,897
Well, that being said,

940
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,777
we'll need a scapegoat.

941
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,974
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

942
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,854
Hwang U-ju, get out. Just get out.

943
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:07,106
-What is going on? Why--
-Get out, please.

944
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,442
-Why are you doing this?
-What is the matter?

945
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,069
You're under arrest for the murder
of Kim Hye-na. Cuff him.

946
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,071
-What?
-What are you talking about?

947
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,741
-That is crazy.
-You have the right to an attorney.

948
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,117
Look!

949
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,606
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!

950
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,941
Would the police have taken him
without any evidence?

951
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,652
My goodness. You're saying U-ju did it
because he was stressed out?

952
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,489
Did anyone else other than our kids

953
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,616
enter the guest house on the day
of U-ju's birthday party?

954
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:01,744
As you know, only residents
of Sky Castle can enter the premises.

955
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,871
Don't you feel bad about
U-ju getting arrested?

956
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,082
Who did it if it wasn't U-ju? Who did it?

957
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,584
I think the culprit must be someone
who lives in Sky Castle.

958
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,586
Right, she said she'd post it
on the website.

959
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:11,504
What do you mean?

960
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,548
U-ju is under police custody.
Do you think Ye-seo would be happy?

961
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,967
You are pushing your own daughter
into a corner, too.

962
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:20,096
I'll reveal the truth no matter what,
so just wait and see.

963
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,309
