1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,423
Are you saying...

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,926
Ye-seo was the one

3
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,345
who killed Hye-na?

4
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,184
Whether Ye-seo killed her or not,
the important thing is

5
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,228
the fact that she's a high school senior.

6
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,231
And since I am coaching her,

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,401
she absolutely cannot be the culprit.

8
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,203
Well, that being said,

9
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,832
we'll need a scapegoat.

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,342
U-ju will get hurt.

11
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,186
Ms. Han.

12
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,816
What do you want me to do?

13
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,582
Ye-seo is in her senior year.

14
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,461
Even after she found out
that you were Kwak Mi-hyang

15
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,214
and that Hye-na was Dr. Kang's daughter,

16
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,967
she still managed to come this far
by keeping herself together.

17
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,890
And she even proved her competence
by getting a perfect score

18
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,601
for every subject on the final exams.

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,605
Now, she just needs to get
perfect scores on her exams

20
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,524
during the first semester
of her senior year.

21
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,693
Then she'll easily be able
to get into SNU's med school.

22
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,364
Just the first semester
of her senior year?

23
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,490
That's right.

24
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,367
Just the first semester.

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,998
Now,

26
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,377
what do you want me to do,

27
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,715
Ms. Han?

28
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,056
Please...

29
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,477
help Ye-seo, Coach Kim.

30
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,844
Aren't you hungry?

31
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,639
You didn't even eat dinner.

32
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,526
I hoped

33
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,487
that you'd never have to
go through the pain

34
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,782
of losing someone precious to you
ever again.

35
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,411
I'm so sorry.

36
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,872
After your mom

37
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,708
passed away,

38
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,168
I wouldn't have been able to endure it

39
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,045
if it weren't for you.

40
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,800
You can resent me and blame me
for what happened,

41
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,469
but I hope you don't suffer

42
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,389
all on your own.

43
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,893
I'll always be on your side.

44
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,024
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,860
I shouldn't have said what I said.

46
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,073
I'm sure you didn't have a choice.

47
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,828
I would never have invited her
to my birthday party

48
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,538
if I'd known such a thing was going
to happen.

49
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,543
If only I hadn't invited her
to my party...

50
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,506
U-ju.

51
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,763
It's not your fault.

52
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,140
I feel so sorry for her, Dad.

53
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,811
All she did was study
throughout her whole life.

54
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,647
What does that make of her life, Dad?

55
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,318
Why did she have to live
and die like that?

56
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,673
All she had to do was play the clip.
Even if she did something else,

57
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,634
no one would know.

58
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,850
Did Ye-seo really...

59
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,936
Did she really kill Hye-na?

60
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,219
She is such an angel.

61
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,847
There's just no way.

62
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,265
That's absolute nonsense.

63
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,309
There's no way my daughter
would have done that.

64
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,835
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,172
Hye-na.

67
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,344
Ye-seo.

68
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,221
It's okay.

69
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,764
It's okay.

70
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,100
It's just a nightmare.

71
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,604
Nothing will happen.

72
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,356
That's right. Nothing will happen.

73
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,067
It's okay.

74
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,214
My goodness.

75
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,100
-What's going on?
-What's happening?

76
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,812
What's going on?

77
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,566
Hwang U-ju, get out. Just get out.

78
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,777
-What is going on? Why--
-Get out, please.

79
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,946
-Why are you doing this?
-What is the matter?

80
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,740
You're under arrest for the murder
of Kim Hye-na. Cuff him.

81
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,492
-What?
-What are you talking about?

82
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,244
-That is crazy.
-You're under arrest.

83
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,703
You have the right to an attorney.

84
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,705
-Hey! What are you doing?
-This is absurd.

85
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,082
-Take him.
-U-ju.

86
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,667
-Take him.
-No! U-ju!

87
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,834
Sir, wait!

88
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,920
-What are you doing?
-What's wrong with you guys?

89
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,713
-You have no evidence!
-What proof do you have?

90
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,715
-U-ju! No!
-Please wait.

91
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
What evidence do you have?

92
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,053
-U-ju! No!
-Please, sir.

93
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,388
I did nothing wrong.

94
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,266
Mom. I really didn't kill her.

95
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,851
-No!
-I really didn't kill her.

96
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,895
-U-ju!
-I really didn't kill her.

97
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,772
He says he didn't kill her! Wait!

98
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,065
-No, please.
-Sir!

99
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,859
-What do you think you're doing?
-What evidence do you have?

100
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,113
He didn't do it!
My son says he's innocent!

101
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,948
-U-ju!
-U-ju!

102
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,701
You can follow us
if you have something to say.

103
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,744
-U-ju!
-U-ju!

104
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,912
-U-ju!
-U-ju!

105
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,122
-Mom.
-U-ju!

106
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,541
We'll follow you there, so don't worry.

107
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,834
Don't worry.

108
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,335
Don't worry.

109
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,219
Honey, you should go first.

110
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,179
I'll bring Professor Cha with me.

111
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,264
Okay.

112
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,687
Don't start the investigation
before we hire an attorney.

113
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,896
Do you understand?

114
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,368
My goodness.

115
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,165
Goodness, gracious.

116
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,459
Did U-ju kill Hye-na?

117
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,795
Let's talk later.

118
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,005
-Can you call the kids?
-Okay.

119
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,924
Ye-bin. Su-han. Get in the car.

120
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,929
I'm sorry, but can you please help?

121
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm really sorry to say this,
but full-time professors

122
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,684
teaching in private universities

123
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,063
aren't allowed to do any work
outside of school.

124
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,232
So I'm not allowed to work
as an attorney these days.

125
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,947
Then can you introduce me
to another attorney?

126
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,451
We have no one else to ask,
and it's really urgent.

127
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,041
As you already know,

128
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,126
it's been a long time
since I quit working at a law firm.

129
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,003
This is a criminal case.

130
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,172
If I introduce you to someone,

131
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,299
and you don't get the results
that you want,

132
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,385
that will cause even bigger trouble.

133
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,147
I'm sorry for bothering you.

134
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,441
Seo-jun's and Gi-jun's friend
just got arrested.

135
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,443
You can at least go
as the father of his friends.

136
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,530
You don't need to go there as an attorney.

137
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,534
Goodness, honey.

138
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,620
Did you forget that I have a lecture
in the first period today?

139
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,376
I'm sorry for intruding. Goodbye.

140
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,462
Come by again if you have any questions.

141
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,172
I'll answer as best as I...

142
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,299
That jerk.

143
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,933
Don't you know when not to get involved?

144
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,101
Why did you interrupt?

145
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,357
You're a father yourself.

146
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,192
If you can't rush over in person,

147
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,237
you could at least make a call,
but you won't even do that?

148
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,531
Our kids are high school seniors now.

149
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,117
We need the case to be wrapped up soon

150
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,578
if our sons are to concentrate
on their studies.

151
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,205
Concentrate on their studies?

152
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,625
Do you mean you don't care
if U-ju gets framed?

153
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,131
The detectives took him away in handcuffs.

154
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,051
That means they have evidence
that no one can deny.

155
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,304
U-ju's a model student.

156
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,848
Besides his good grades,

157
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,309
he's really polite and has
a decent personality, too.

158
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,310
Do you...

159
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,730
really think U-ju did it?

160
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,984
Can you say that after
being betrayed by your own child?

161
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,071
He's not even our child.
We can't be sure of anything.

162
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,161
Make sure the kids don't get distracted
because of U-ju.

163
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,384
Su-im, one of my seniors is a lawyer

164
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,012
who's interested in teenagers' cases.

165
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,223
Shall I ask her for help?

166
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,184
We have Kim Hye-na's autopsy report.

167
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,104
Hwang U-ju's skin cells
were found under her fingernails.

168
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,398
-What?
-What?

169
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,025
You tried to push her

170
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,194
and she scratched you in the process.

171
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,862
That's not true.

172
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,491
Hye-na was already on the ground
when I went out to the balcony.

173
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,493
Then why did we find

174
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,662
your skin cells beneath her fingernails?

175
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,913
U-ju,

176
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,332
there's no rush. Think about it carefully.

177
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,002
Did you two hold hands
or make physical contact?

178
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,381
Yes, U-ju. Think about it calmly.

179
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,385
That's it.

180
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,595
Before playing the mafia game,

181
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,430
Hye-na and I had a squabble.

182
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,184
Here's your birthday present.

183
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,687
I didn't know what you'd like.

184
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,314
GIFT CERTIFICATE

185
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,526
I said

186
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,572
that I wanted us to wear
identical wish bracelets.

187
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,660
A bracelet worth 2,000 won
doesn't mean much.

188
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,662
It's just a superstition.

189
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,081
Does it make sense
that your wish will come true

190
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,166
if you wear the bracelet
until it wears off?

191
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,209
Who am I

192
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,503
to you?

193
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,217
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,928
I don't have as much free time as you.

195
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,139
Do you think I'm doing this
because I'm bored?

196
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,099
You never take me seriously.

197
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,227
You ignore my texts and forget our plans.
Do you know how upsetting that is?

198
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,478
Let's stop this, then.

199
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,732
Let's end things.

200
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,446
How can you say that so easily?

201
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,949
Don't you know how I feel?

202
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,619
I don't, and I don't want to know.

203
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,246
I don't have the time and energy
to spend on you.

204
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,831
That's what happened.

205
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,667
She scratched me
as she pushed away my arm.

206
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,587
Why didn't you tell us before
that you two fought?

207
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,257
It wasn't me. It really wasn't!

208
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,635
My son and Hye-na were good friends.

209
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,178
He said he didn't hurt her.

210
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,347
Why do you keep being so intimidating?

211
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,183
Will you two please calm down?
They're just investigating.

212
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,226
Detective.

213
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,770
She scratched him during a fight.

214
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,482
Just because you found his skin cells
doesn't mean he murdered her.

215
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,552
This is from the dashboard camera

216
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,846
of a car that was parked outside.

217
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,641
It's too far away to make out any faces.

218
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,643
How can you be sure it's him?

219
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,188
You're the only one
who wore a red hoodie that night.

220
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,779
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!

221
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,117
It's not like you can make out any faces.

222
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,120
How is this evidence? It makes no sense!

223
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,372
Wait.

224
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,624
Can I speak with them in private?

225
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,501
Ms. Hong.

226
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,089
Think about it under the assumption
that it wasn't him.

227
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,674
If it wasn't U-ju,

228
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,135
then why did the culprit
wear a red hoodie?

229
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,554
To make it look like U-ju did it.

230
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:59,226
Are you saying that someone wore
a red hoodie and killed Hye-na

231
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,103
to make it look like U-ju did it?

232
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,772
From our standpoint,
that's the only explanation.

233
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,233
This is just freaking crazy!

234
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,114
He is a minor,

235
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,908
but since it's a murder case,
he'll likely be detained.

236
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,872
That's not the point.

237
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,458
He must get a guilty verdict.

238
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,213
Wrap things up
so the police don't catch on.

239
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,842
Ms. Kim, must you go this far to...

240
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,397
We must get Ye-seo into SNU's med school.

241
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,233
That's our job.

242
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,311
It smells lovely.

243
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,730
It's hazelnut.

244
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,775
Seo-jin must have brewed it
especially for you. Right?

245
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,610
Enjoy, Seung-hye.

246
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,612
Thanks.

247
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,240
Seo-jin.

248
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,618
My husband and I went too far, didn't we?

249
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,037
Take them off. Take them off.

250
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,372
Hey!

251
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,541
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,587
It's okay. My husband and I weren't
much better ourselves.

253
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,757
I can't do it
until you show me your mouth.

254
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,759
Take off your glasses.

255
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,221
We fought because of the circumstances
back then.

256
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,557
It's not like we hate each other.

257
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,809
You're right.

258
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,311
Ye-seo and Hye-na hated each other.

259
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,438
I saw them fight yesterday.

260
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,779
Anyway, U-ju takes after his father

261
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,907
and is sweet, smart,
and has a great personality.

262
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,494
That's not all.
He's gentle, just like his dad.

263
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,204
This makes no sense.

264
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,499
When everyone gossiped about
Se-ri not being in Harvard,

265
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,878
he stayed with my twin boys.

266
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,505
That kindhearted boy wouldn't hurt Hye-na.

267
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,302
My point exactly.

268
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,220
Su-han said that

269
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,472
U-ju liked Hye-na a lot.

270
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,224
It makes no sense.

271
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,317
Would the police have taken him
without any evidence?

272
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,822
Think about it.

273
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,242
Before his mom died, we all thought

274
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,744
Yeong-jae was a good,

275
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:07,080
smart, obedient boy
who did what his mom said.

276
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,583
Su-im isn't U-ju's birth mother.

277
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:15,422
He could have a dark side to him
that we know nothing about.

278
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,468
-A dark side?
-Competition for grades is fierce.

279
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,639
Kids get stressed out
even with their moms' full support.

280
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,392
But U-ju must have managed on his own.

281
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,560
My goodness.

282
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,772
You're saying U-ju did it
because he was stressed out?

283
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,700
This is so shocking.

284
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,661
Dr. Hwang's son...

285
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,290
killed Hye-na?

286
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,877
So Hwang Chi-yeong's son was the culprit?

287
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:58,465
He kept showing off
as if he were some humane doctor.

288
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,509
It's all useless.

289
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,428
Nothing is more important
than how you raise your children.

290
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,554
Right.

291
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,890
THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD TORTOISE

292
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,518
Dr. Kang.

293
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,276
Yes.

294
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,735
It's me, sir.

295
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,862
Thank you. Thank you very much.

296
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,448
My family owes you big-time.

297
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,662
I'll never forget
what you did for my family.

298
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,332
Please don't mention it.

299
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,253
I heard the other patient died.

300
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:40,465
My gosh, my heart almost dropped
when I heard that.

301
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,676
If it weren't for you,

302
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,012
my grandson might not have lived.

303
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,640
That's why I wanted
to have dinner with you and Dr. Hwang

304
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,935
to thank you for operating on my grandson,

305
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,063
but I heard Dr. Hwang
is taking some time off.

306
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,691
I guess

307
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,943
you haven't heard.

308
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,872
What...

309
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,584
Gosh, what on earth does this mean?

310
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,461
Murder?

311
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,007
He damaged the hospital's
reputation with those columns, and now...

312
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,598
What do we do now?

313
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,603
It'll be too much for you to take on
the role as the chief

314
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,897
of the Spine and Joint Center as well.

315
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,732
Not at all, sir.

316
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,821
I should certainly give my all
for the hospital.

317
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:53,497
You're just as ambitious as I am
when it comes to work.

318
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,958
That's only natural.

319
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,877
After all,

320
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,545
you are...

321
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,048
my role model, sir.

322
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,592
Role model?

323
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,346
My gosh.

324
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,932
I'm your role model?

325
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,642
Okay, great.

326
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,394
I heard you'll also be the chief
of the Spine and Joint Center.

327
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,479
Congratulations, honey.

328
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:23,068
Dr. Woo, that fool. I guess he already
went around telling everyone.

329
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,904
Thanks to him, we get to know
what's going on at the hospital.

330
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,240
It's great. I'm very grateful.

331
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,950
My goodness.

332
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,911
He raised his son to be a murderer.

333
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,330
And what? A humane doctor?

334
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,293
As if. How despicable.

335
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,878
You just watch.

336
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,632
I will make sure
he gets kicked out of the hospital.

337
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,010
But...

338
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,639
can U-ju's actions be sufficient
grounds for his dismissal?

339
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,393
Power can make anything happen
even if it seems impossible.

340
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,563
Let's use this as an opportunity
to kick that family out of here.

341
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,732
Things have been going haywire
ever since they moved here.

342
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,693
Well,

343
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,864
they'll have to move out anyway
if he gets ousted from the hospital.

344
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,490
Why cause unnecessary trouble?

345
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,869
Why did you have that girl move
into our place in the first place?

346
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,370
It only got us in this mess.

347
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,747
Lowborn girls like her
are bound to cause trouble.

348
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,459
Take Su-chang's family for example.

349
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,170
That happened because of Ga-eul.

350
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,353
The police told us not to let anyone in,

351
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,646
but since you're asking...

352
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,690
Thank you, In-gyu.

353
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,275
No problem.

354
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,402
I should help you in any way I can.

355
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,795
Wait, put this over your shoes.

356
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,797
-You'll also have to wear these gloves.
-All right.

357
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,698
Gosh, you're so bad at it.

358
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,950
Ye-bin, you do it.

359
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,911
-Move over.
-No, don't.

360
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,747
Just let her do it. Su-han, stay still.

361
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,682
Ms. Hong.

362
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,883
In-gyu, did anyone else
other than our kids

363
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,470
enter the guest house on the day
of U-ju's birthday party?

364
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,597
No. As you know,

365
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,766
only residents of Sky Castle
can enter the premises.

366
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:49,978
Then...

367
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,647
it must be one of the residents.

368
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,234
One of the residents?

369
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,695
Ms. Lee, among the residents,
is there anyone

370
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,698
who might have wanted to kill Hye-na?

371
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,658
Can you think of anyone?

372
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,669
Ye-seo, let's eat.

373
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,590
Eating carbohydrates in the morning
helps your brain function better.

374
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,966
Will U-ju be released?

375
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,179
Ye-seo.

376
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,098
You're a high school senior.

377
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,726
If you can just make sure
the first semester goes perfectly--

378
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,728
I asked you if he'll be released.

379
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,230
Stop obsessing over it.

380
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,149
What are you thinking?

381
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,609
It wasn't U-ju.

382
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,028
U-ju is innocent. It can't be him.

383
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,863
When will you stop obsessing over U-ju?

384
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,115
You'll meet many guys
who are much better than U-ju

385
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,117
when you go to university.

386
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,208
Don't you feel bad about
U-ju getting arrested?

387
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,168
How can you act like this?

388
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,378
Do you really not know that he's innocent?

389
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:07,055
Who did it if it wasn't U-ju? Who did it?

390
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,101
-Mom.
-No one in Sky Castle

391
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,938
is saying anything, but do you
know who they suspect the most?

392
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,316
You and Hye-na hated each other.

393
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,110
Su-han's mom saw Hye-na threatening you,

394
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,071
saying she'd reveal the truth
on the school website.

395
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,781
And she died the day

396
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,492
before she was going to post it.

397
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,538
Everyone is suspecting you the most
based on the circumstances.

398
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,252
So?

399
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,922
Do you want me to be grateful
for U-ju getting arrested instead of me

400
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,423
and just focus on studying?

401
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,068
This is why you should focus
on your studies instead of dating.

402
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,863
This happened because they forgot

403
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,948
about their duties as a student
and dated each other.

404
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,325
Did I or did I not tell you
that you'd get a better spouse

405
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,953
if you study hard
and go to a good university?

406
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,080
You cheeky little punks.

407
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,624
I especially want the guys
to pay attention to what I'm saying.

408
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,627
You'll end up ruining your life
if you meet the wrong kind of woman.

409
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,504
You'll end up just like U-ju.

410
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,549
I don't even get why he dated
an impudent and rude little brat

411
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,967
like Hye-na.

412
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,427
Sir.

413
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,096
Aren't you being too harsh about the dead?

414
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,806
You think I'm being too harsh?

415
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,808
You're in no place think like that.

416
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,060
Look at Ye-seo.

417
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,898
She's so strong-minded
that she doesn't get fazed by anything.

418
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,983
You guys really need
to learn to be like her.

419
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,526
That's how you'll be able to succeed.

420
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,414
Ye-seo.

421
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,249
Hey, Kang Ye-seo.

422
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,501
Where are you going?

423
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,598
Is Ye-seo skipping class?

424
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,725
-That nerd is skipping class?
-Seriously?

425
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,560
-This is unbelievable.
-Ye-seo is skipping class?

426
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,770
-No way.
-She is?

427
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,066
She's skipping class.

428
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,360
-Ye-seo is skipping class?
-This is crazy.

429
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,486
How absurd.

430
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,573
Ye-seo did what?

431
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,492
She left school early?

432
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,872
Ye-seo has been having a hard time

433
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,667
after what happened to Hye-na.

434
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,921
Hye-na must have grown on her
while they lived together.

435
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,175
But sir.

436
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,679
It won't affect her student record
since she took a sick leave, right?

437
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,223
I'll hand in a medical certificate
within three days.

438
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,851
Thank you.

439
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,187
Okay, bye.

440
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,987
MY PRINCESS

441
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,115
MOM

442
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,045
My mom's suspecting me.

443
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,595
Goodness, I guess that's why
you're feeling so upset.

444
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,681
Ye-seo.

445
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,726
Do you still have nightmares these days?

446
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,698
You're not at fault
for what happened to Hye-na.

447
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,451
Hye-na's fully responsible

448
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,162
for her own death.

449
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,624
You know what they say about
too much greed causing trouble, right?

450
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,211
Strictly speaking,

451
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,547
Hye-na's life was full of abundance.

452
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,759
What?

453
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,806
She was smart enough to get good grades

454
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,808
even without receiving any support
from her parents.

455
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,103
And it's only natural for people
to be jealous of smart people.

456
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,731
But she even received full
support from her classmates

457
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,193
because she was pretty,
sympathetic, and sociable.

458
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,986
On top of that,

459
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,489
she was wise enough
to take care of her sick mom

460
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,282
even when she was so young.

461
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,536
Her life would have been just fine
if she was grateful

462
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,539
for what she was given
instead of being greedy for more.

463
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,127
Wanting to steal everything you had

464
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,129
was what caused her to die.

465
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,677
So don't feel guilty about Hye-na's death,

466
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,304
and just forget about it.

467
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,599
Okay?

468
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,234
What about U-ju?

469
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,735
It wasn't him.

470
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,071
It really wasn't him.

471
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,789
I feel so sorry for him, Coach Kim.

472
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,716
You need to consider the possibility
that the criminal might have hidden

473
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,762
inside the boiler room in the balcony,
killed Hye-na, and framed it on U-ju.

474
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,474
In order for your assertion to be valid...

475
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,060
Listen to me carefully.
First of all, the culprit

476
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,689
would have had to know that U-ju's party
was going to be held at the guest house.

477
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:50,982
Secondly,

478
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:55,778
the culprit would have also had to know
that U-ju was going to wear a red hoodie.

479
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,323
Thirdly, the culprit would have
had to assume that Hye-na would be

480
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,783
out in the balcony all by herself.

481
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,742
Fourthly,

482
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,163
he or she would have had to push
Hye-na as soon as she was outside.

483
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,164
And then,

484
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,500
that person would have had to hack
the victim's cell phone,

485
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,170
send a text to U-ju, and make him
become the first witness.

486
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,462
After that,

487
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,341
the culprit would have had to make
sure it got caught on the dash cam.

488
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,178
And then, that person would have had
to escape from Sky Castle

489
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,722
without getting caught on any
of the CCTVs that are installed outside.

490
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:26,893
So you're telling me to think about
all of these possibilities, right?

491
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,492
Ms. Hong.

492
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,163
How did it go?

493
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,458
I tried to convince the detective
that the actual criminal

494
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,294
might have worn a red hoodie
and killed Hye-na

495
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,213
so that he or she could
frame U-ju as the culprit.

496
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,174
But he thinks it makes no sense.

497
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,927
There are so many coincidences
that need to fall into place

498
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,845
in order for that assertion to be true.

499
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,513
Then

500
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,308
what's going to happen to U-ju now?

501
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,519
They're going to transfer him

502
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,438
to the prosecutors' office.

503
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,522
What?

504
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,069
-U-ju.
-U-ju.

505
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,528
-U-ju.
-U-ju.

506
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,614
U-ju, are you okay?

507
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,077
Detective,

508
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,954
can you please reconsider?

509
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,039
It might not be a coincidence.

510
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,166
Wait a minute. Sir.

511
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,086
It's actually possible that someone
might have planned all this

512
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,546
so that he or she could kill Hye-na
and frame my son for her death.

513
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,258
We already investigated
all her acquaintances.

514
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,551
But there wasn't anyone who seemed
to have a grudge against her.

515
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,887
Who do you think would have done
something like this?

516
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,392
U-ju.

517
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,270
Did Hye-na ever tell you anything?

518
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,314
Did she ever mention anything
upsetting her

519
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,525
or anyone that she wasn't
on good terms with?

520
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,655
Mom.

521
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,949
Hye-na said...

522
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,244
Ye-seo's exam coordinator thinks
of me as Ye-seo's studying tool.

523
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,787
I seriously feel

524
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,998
disgusted by that.

525
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,088
Kim Ju-yeong?

526
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,591
KANG YE-SEO'S MOTHER

527
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,643
I also can't believe
that a model student like U-ju

528
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,979
did something like that.

529
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,858
But Ye-seo.

530
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,698
U-ju lost his biological mother
when he was only 13 years old.

531
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,493
He couldn't bear with his loss
and got involved in a group fight,

532
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,829
so he was even forced
to transfer to another school.

533
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:56,000
And after his dad got remarried,
he also frequently ran away from home.

534
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,461
U-ju used to be a troublemaker.

535
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,422
His aggression was inherent
deep inside of him,

536
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,215
and it popped out once he realized

537
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,343
that Hye-na was only using his feelings.

538
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,556
How did you know all that?

539
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,641
In order to make you become the best,

540
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,603
I had to get a grasp
of all your competitors.

541
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,193
Hye-na got angry after she heard

542
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,445
that she was being used
as my studying tool.

543
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,531
Have you ever met her by any chance?

544
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,034
No, never.

545
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,911
There was no need for me to meet her.

546
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,585
KANG YE-SEO'S MOTHER

547
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,753
It's my mom, isn't it?

548
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,881
I really don't want to go home.

549
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,390
-Yes, Ms. Han.
-Coach Kim.

550
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,725
By any chance,
are you with Ye-seo right now?

551
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,852
Yes, she's with me.

552
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,981
Ye-seo's feeling very insecure right now.

553
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,776
So I think it'd be best for her
to stay with me for a while.

554
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,986
What are you talking about?

555
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,864
She'll need to stay with me
for at least a week

556
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,743
in order for her to recover
and return to her usual state of mind.

557
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,662
I'll send Mr. Jo over to your house.

558
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,622
So please give him
Ye-seo's clothes and necessities.

559
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,458
-Please put Ye-seo on the phone.
-I'm sorry to say this...

560
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,214
but being with you will only
get in the way of her studies.

561
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,509
I hope you think objectively
about what's right for her.

562
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,811
I need to get a grip.

563
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,855
Ye-seo is my daughter.

564
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,823
I already told you before

565
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,659
that she's just like a reference book
you throw away

566
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,119
after you're done reading it.

567
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,746
She's a reference book that I will

568
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,541
throw away when Ye-seo gets accepted.

569
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,577
Ye-seo left school early?

570
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,454
She did?

571
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,374
She just studied as usual
after Hye-na died.

572
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,834
But I guess she's human after all.

573
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,794
I thought she was a machine.

574
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,671
She must be distraught

575
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,757
now that U-ju's in trouble, too.

576
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,885
She must be having a hard time.
She probably can't concentrate, either.

577
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,059
This is

578
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,979
the best opportunity for you
to improve your rank.

579
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,653
I really don't want to have to say this,

580
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,780
but face your reality.

581
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,865
Out of the 100 kids in your year,

582
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,575
only four kids get level one.

583
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,161
Hye-na and U-ju are gone.
And if Ye-seo's grades drop...

584
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,038
That's three competitors out.

585
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,831
Honey, stop it.

586
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,043
Why should I stop when it's
an opportunity from the heavens?

587
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,754
I can't believe
I'm listening to this nonsense.

588
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,132
It'd be the same as one of my friends

589
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,052
who does worse than me in school
being happy if I'm dead.

590
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,220
How can...

591
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,723
How can a father say that?

592
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,892
A Master's from SNU?
What's the point of having a Ph.D.?

593
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,144
You're saying things
not even a preschooler would say!

594
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,105
U-ju didn't do it.

595
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:50,317
Competition is so fierce that
there are so many kids who break rules.

596
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,070
But U-ju even lets other kids
borrow his notes.

597
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,030
U-ju...

598
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,575
is my friend.

599
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,034
He's my friend.

600
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,911
He's wrongfully detained

601
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,622
and you want us to study
to improve our grades?

602
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,421
Yes.

603
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,966
You're right. You're very right.

604
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,676
Completely right.

605
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:21,849
Yes.

606
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,934
You're still young.

607
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,020
This is what the youth should be like.

608
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,940
I threw a lot of
Molotov cocktails back in my day.

609
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,233
But...

610
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,572
youth passes by in the blink of an eye.

611
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,699
When you're older,

612
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,952
you'll realize how completely right I was.

613
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,665
What really counts in life
isn't friendship or loyalty.

614
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,792
It's your status and position.

615
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,919
What's important is your place
in the social pyramid.

616
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,173
If you're at the bottom,
you'll be squashed.

617
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,133
If you're at the top...

618
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,179
you enjoy life.

619
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,942
That fool.

620
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,752
Why would the world be a pyramid?

621
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,672
Why would it be a pyramid
when the earth is round?

622
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,082
Let go of me.

623
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,751
I said, let go of me.

624
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,464
Have you lost your minds?

625
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,925
Let go of me!

626
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,513
Let go.

627
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,931
Let go.

628
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,724
Let go!

629
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,767
Boys.

630
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,561
Take your father outside.

631
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,438
Hey, grab hold of him.

632
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,565
What are you two doing?

633
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,359
Don't move!

634
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,111
Relax or you'll hurt yourself!

635
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:42,739
Let me go. Let go of me!

636
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,662
How dare you mock
the head of this household?

637
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,622
Have you lost your mind?

638
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,583
How have you been educating them?

639
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,960
This is immoral!

640
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,464
This is wrong! This is immoral!

641
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,593
It's immoral!

642
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,888
This is immoral!

643
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,681
What if someone sees?

644
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,475
Let's talk this out.

645
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,079
Open the door. Come on!

646
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,627
Fine.

647
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,005
I'll give you one last chance
to earn my forgiveness.

648
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,008
Let me in before I count to ten.

649
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,886
One.

650
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,846
Two.

651
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,016
-Three.
-I had you two

652
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,185
-take him outside,
-Four.

653
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,145
-hoping that...
-Five.

654
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,481
he'd come to his senses in the cold.

655
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,607
Six.

656
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,734
-Go upstairs.
-Seven.

657
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,903
I'll sort it out. Don't worry.

658
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,739
-Okay, Mom.
-Eight.

659
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,909
Nine.

660
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,996
Nine.

661
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,953
Darn it.

662
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,279
I might end up getting sick.

663
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,116
You just sit and watch.

664
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,075
That means

665
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,244
don't get involved, okay?

666
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,913
The police would know
what they're doing, right?

667
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,665
What kind of a neighbor are you?

668
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,792
Think about the position Dr. Hwang's in.

669
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,295
He must be upset and distraught.

670
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,340
He saved Su-han's life, and you're
saying we should just sit and watch?

671
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,760
You said earlier that U-ju did it
because he was stressed out.

672
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,678
I just...

673
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,598
Seo-jin mentioned Yeong-jae,

674
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,807
and I wondered if U-ju

675
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,685
has a secret we don't know about.

676
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,853
Jin Jin.

677
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:05,317
You are fantastically perfect,

678
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,028
but you have just one flaw.

679
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,321
What's that?

680
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,239
You're wishy-washy.

681
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,493
Will you please stay on one course?

682
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,371
My gosh.

683
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,332
Are you proud that
you're practically Dr. Kang's servant?

684
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,875
I love you, darling.

685
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,045
NOH SEUNG-HYE

686
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,883
Hi, Seung-hye.

687
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,773
Have some more. You have to eat
to have the energy to fight.

688
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,942
The case has been forwarded
to the prosecutors' office,

689
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,403
but U-ju will be released
because he's innocent.

690
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,781
It's sending chills down my spine.

691
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,616
If someone wore a red hoodie

692
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,994
and pushed Hye-na off the balcony
to frame U-ju,

693
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:02,124
it means the culprit
was in the boiler room that day.

694
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,877
That's right.

695
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,047
I'm certain that the culprit
was there that day.

696
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,882
Who could it be?

697
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,510
-Who'd do such a thing?
-The lawyer and I

698
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,430
think the culprit must be someone
who lives in Sky Castle.

699
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,976
Could it have been Ye-seo?

700
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,687
Did Ye-seo

701
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,147
really do it?

702
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,481
Right,

703
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,276
she said she'd post it on the website.

704
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,990
Jin-hui.

705
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,911
-What do you mean?
-Post what?

706
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,124
What? Did I say something?
I didn't say anything.

707
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,835
Jin-hui, you know something, right?

708
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,295
You're hiding something, right?

709
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,548
No, I'm not hiding anything.

710
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,218
Please, help me.

711
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,220
I beg you.

712
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,014
Save U-ju. Please?

713
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,266
-Gosh.
-It's related to Seo-jin, isn't it?

714
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:05,979
You told me on the day of the meeting
that you saw Ye-seo and Hye-na fighting.

715
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,314
Darn it.

716
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,440
Whatever.

717
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,443
This could jeopardize my husband's career,

718
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,529
but it's wrong to falsely accuse someone
who is completely innocent.

719
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,033
Okay, I'll tell you what I know.

720
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,376
What brings you here?

721
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,421
You evil witch.

722
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,674
You killed that poor young girl

723
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,843
and had the audacity to frame my son?

724
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,887
Have you lost your mind?

725
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,597
Watch your mouth.

726
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,436
After all you've done,

727
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,689
do you think nothing
will happen to your daughter?

728
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,399
Do you think she'll stay unscathed?

729
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,278
Stay away from my daughter.

730
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,907
I guess you want to get my daughter
in trouble just to save your son.

731
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,868
You're the one who got my son
into this mess!

732
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,247
No, you are pushing
your own daughter into a corner, too.

733
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,249
U-ju is under police custody.

734
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,042
Do you think Ye-seo would be happy?

735
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,253
Do you think your daughter,

736
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,631
who's in her senior year,
can focus on studying as you wish?

737
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,221
I'm going

738
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,181
to meet the prosecutor.

739
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,895
I'll reveal the truth no matter what,

740
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,314
so just wait and see.

741
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,665
U-ju's mom went to meet the prosecutor.

742
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,336
If the prosecutor suspects Ye-seo,

743
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,254
you won't be safe either.

744
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,049
I think you'll have to come up
with a plan.

745
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,717
Don't worry, Ms. Han.

746
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,594
U-ju won't be released,

747
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,429
with such firm evidence.

748
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,515
You know that woman
isn't someone who'll give up so easily.

749
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,642
U-ju

750
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,353
will be indicted according to our plan,

751
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,022
and he will be convicted.

752
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,656
We have a witness who saw

753
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,617
Hye-na and Ye-seo fighting
on the morning of the incident.

754
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,495
I'll ask her to testify if necessary.

755
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,997
You're saying Ye-seo and Hye-na
had a fight,

756
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,999
but U-ju had an argument with her as well.

757
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,085
The two cases are comparable.

758
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,504
On top of that,

759
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,631
U-ju's skin tissue was found
in the autopsy.

760
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,341
And the dash cam footage
shows his red hoodie.

761
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:22,425
The police believe

762
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,136
that no one was holding a grudge
against Hye-na,

763
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,972
but we now know
that Hye-na was planning to post

764
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,432
on the school website
that Dr. Kang is her birth father.

765
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,185
Don't you think that could have been
the motive for the murder?

766
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,104
They're all just speculations.

767
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,189
We won't be able to persuade
the prosecutor based on them.

768
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,149
There is

769
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,485
firm evidence against U-ju.

770
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,281
Then...

771
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,033
What will happen to U-ju?

772
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,577
What do we do about U-ju?

773
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,717
-U-ju!
-U-ju!

774
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,343
-Mom!
-U-ju!

775
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,053
-U-ju.
-Mom!

776
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,138
-U-ju.
-U-ju.

777
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,264
-U-ju.
-Excuse me.

778
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:12,475
U-ju, we will get you out no matter what,

779
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,227
so hang in there, okay?

780
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,604
-Wait just a little longer.
-U-ju.

781
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,939
I promise...

782
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,607
All right?

783
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,776
U-ju.

784
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,777
U-ju!

785
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,196
U-ju.

786
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,365
U-ju.

787
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,451
-U-ju.
-U-ju, hang in there.

788
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,578
Just a little longer.

789
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,789
-U-ju.
-Wait just a little longer.

790
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,292
I'll get you out. Hang in there, okay?

791
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,461
U-ju!

792
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,046
U-ju...

793
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,714
U-ju...

794
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,344
The Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office

795
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,181
indicted the suspect
in the guest house murder.

796
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,058
He is believed to have

797
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,143
pushed his classmate off the balcony.

798
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,313
At his birthday party in February,
the suspect, Hwang...

799
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,827
Hwang Chi-yeong's son got indicted, right?

800
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,498
Oh, boy.

801
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:20,376
Just like his dad,
he looks like a charmer,

802
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,087
but inside, he's all...

803
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,592
How could he kill someone?

804
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,597
Hye-na's funeral is at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

805
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,058
Tomorrow?

806
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,394
It's tomorrow?

807
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:44,275
I'm going golfing
with the director tomorrow.

808
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,780
I've been telling you for days to
make sure not to make other plans.

809
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,700
You're going, so I don't need
to attend it as well.

810
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,745
You can go golfing another day.

811
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,873
Have you lost your mind?

812
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,043
Playing golf with him is really important.
I can't reschedule it.

813
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,921
Attend the funeral,
or you'll regret it later.

814
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:05,880
Regret it?

815
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,298
Why would I regret it?

816
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:10,760
Well...

817
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,638
She lived here with us,
even if it was for a short while.

818
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,933
She was an orphan.
Wouldn't it be nice to be there for her?

819
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:22,188
Stop talking nonsense
and just get my golf outfit ready.

820
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,441
Gosh.

821
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,604
KIM HYE-NA, BORN OCTOBER 23, 2001
DIED FEBRUARY 27, 2019

822
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,518
Thinking about Hye-na's life
breaks my heart.

823
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,938
You must be so devastated, Seo-jin.

824
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,652
When I think about her life,
I feel so bad for her.

825
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:53,404
I do feel bad for Hye-na,

826
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,407
but Seo-jin must have been
incredibly distressed.

827
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,411
Gosh, I wouldn't have been
able to get through it.

828
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:03,998
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

829
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:09,420
Su-im kept grilling me, asking if I was
hiding anything, so I had no choice.

830
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,421
What?

831
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,552
Right, I knew it was you.

832
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,428
It wasn't Jin-hui's fault.

833
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,348
Su-im desperately begged her
for any information.

834
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,183
How could she have kept it from her?

835
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,645
To be honest, it's been killing me.

836
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,565
Ever since I told Su-im, I've been feeling

837
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,733
like I accused Ye-seo of killing Hye-na.

838
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,987
I've been feeling so terrible about it.

839
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,533
Thank goodness there was
firm evidence against U-ju.

840
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:41,744
You almost made my daughter a murderer.
Do you realize that?

841
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,747
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

842
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,835
But you see, even as I was telling Su-im,

843
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:53,256
I never suspected that Ye-seo
could've killed Hye-na.

844
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,509
I just told her that Hye-na
is Dr. Kang's daughter

845
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,429
and that she said she was going to post it

846
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,805
-on the school website--
-Ye-bin.

847
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,779
Ye-bin.

848
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,449
Do you think she heard?

849
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,536
Ye-bin, wait.

850
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,042
Hye-na is Dad's daughter?

851
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,880
Let's go home and talk.
I'll explain everything.

852
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,048
Forget it.

853
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,499
Ye-bin.

854
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:14,128
I'm really sorry I've kept it from you.

855
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,925
I was planning to tell you
and Dad all about it

856
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,762
as soon as Ye-seo entered university.

857
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,645
I know you were very fond of Hye-na.

858
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,064
I'm really sorry.

859
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,610
The fact that Hye-na died like that

860
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,863
utterly breaks my heart as well.

861
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,910
Look at me, Ye-bin.

862
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:47,787
Please?

863
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,497
Look at me.

864
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,665
Get out.

865
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,710
Ye-bin.

866
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,920
I heard you, so get out now.

867
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,674
Okay, all right.

868
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,803
But do me a favor.

869
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,430
Don't tell your dad--

870
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,639
Get out, right now.

871
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,725
Get out this instant.

872
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,853
Okay.

873
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:16,065
All right. I'll be downstairs.
Come downstairs when you feel better.

874
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,150
Okay?

875
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:58,024
CONGRATULATIONS ON LEVELING UP

876
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,631
YOUR FIRST PERFECT SCORE

877
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:40,775
What's this?

878
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,110
It's a bracelet.

879
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,164
It's a good luck bracelet.

880
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,375
If you keep it on at all times,

881
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,585
you won't have dreams about Hye-na.

882
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,425
It'll protect you
from all sorts of negative emotions

883
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,971
such as anxiety, restlessness, fear,
and guilt.

884
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:13,558
Really?

885
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,145
Touch this pendant
whenever you get distracted.

886
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,607
It'll calm you down and help you focus.

887
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:26,195
Mint is a color that is known
for slowing down the heart rate.

888
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,031
Okay, I will.

889
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,787
Kang Ye-seo will live
a successful life no matter what.

890
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,882
I love you, Ye-seo.

891
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:56,225
Honey! My wife!

892
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:00,730
Honey! My wife!

893
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,693
You see,

894
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:09,780
I made a hole-in-one today.

895
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:16,287
Gosh, everyone was so jealous of me.

896
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:22,293
Gosh, even the golf match went so well.

897
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:28,716
I must say, life is great these days.

898
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,010
Why did you drink so much?

899
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,054
Gosh, keep it down.

900
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,932
Right, I'll be quiet.

901
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,101
Ye-seo is studying, right?

902
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,146
It's been a while,

903
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,733
so I should go and see my daughter.

904
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,279
My smart daughter.

905
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,156
My daughter who makes me so proud.

906
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,660
Hey, Kang Ye-seo!

907
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:56,994
-Ye-seo!
-She's not home yet.

908
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,245
-Dad's home.
-She's not back yet.

909
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,331
-She'll be home later.
-Daddy is home!

910
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,959
Ye-bin, what are you doing there?
Go to your room.

911
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,044
Gosh, look who's here.

912
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,965
Oh, it's my dear Ye-bin.

913
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,801
My adorable younger daughter.

914
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,678
Come here, Ye-bin. Come here.

915
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,429
Can you even call yourself human?

916
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,390
Ye-bin, be quiet.

917
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,894
You had no idea
that Hye-na is your daughter.

918
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,397
You didn't even go to her funeral.

919
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,649
You shouldn't even call yourself human.

920
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,904
What's she saying now? What?

921
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,322
Hye-na is what?

922
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:37,368
-Hye-na is your daughter.
-Go to your room!

923
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,328
I heard you went to Seonjae Island
with her mom.

924
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,998
You caught fish with her
and had a great time.

925
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,001
Don't you remember?

926
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,761
Seonjae Island?

927
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,265
What's she saying?

928
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,892
What...

929
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,812
Hye-na is my daughter? What did she mean?

930
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:18,909
Is it...

931
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:24,874
Kim Eun-hye?

932
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,045
You're drunk. You should go to bed.

933
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,755
I asked you to explain!

934
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,428
Is it true?

935
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,225
Let's go. We can talk in our room.

936
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,144
-I asked you if it's true!
-It is true!

937
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,149
Hye-na is your daughter.

938
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:00,284
MODEL STUDENT SUSPECTED OF
KILLING HIS GIRLFRIEND

939
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,827
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, ON THE 27TH...

940
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:07,083
HE GETS GOOD GRADES,
BUT I GUESS HE WASN'T EDUCATED WELL

941
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,418
THEY SHOULDN'T GO EASY ON HIM
JUST BECAUSE HE'S A TEENAGER

942
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,966
THAT MORNING,
HYE-NA SAID SHE'D REVEAL THE TRUTH

943
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,468
ON THE SCHOOL WEBSITE

944
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,305
Even so,

945
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,809
could a mere housewife
have fooled the police?

946
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,104
You evil witch.

947
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,192
Was I jumping to conclusions?

948
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:46,956
Mom,

949
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,833
Hye-na told me

950
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,627
that Ye-seo's coordinator
thinks of her as a mere tool.

951
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,880
Ye-seo's exam coordinator thinks
of me as Ye-seo's studying tool.

952
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:55,840
I seriously feel

953
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,591
disgusted by that.

954
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,593
Kim Ju-yeong.

955
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:03,180
If Hye-na

956
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,183
went to meet Kim Ju-yeong...

957
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,567
Is your class over?

958
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,693
I see.

959
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,863
I already fixed a meal for you,
so make sure you eat it.

960
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,447
All right, bye.

961
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,493
Hye-na.

962
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,377
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

963
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,171
Where did you get this parrot?

964
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,881
This?

965
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,508
I found it while cleaning Room 1802.

966
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,552
Why? Is it yours?

967
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,929
Hye-na got angry after she heard

968
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,098
that she was being used
as my studying tool.

969
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,184
Have you ever met her by any chance?

970
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,435
No, never.

971
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:50,978
There was no need for me to meet her.

972
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,148
-Yes.
-Hey.

973
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,025
It's mine.

974
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,033
Ye-seo.

975
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,250
Ye-seo.

976
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,419
That...

977
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:17,588
Isn't it Hye-na's?

978
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,466
Did Hye-na

979
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:22,092
come here?

980
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,221
I don't know. How would I know that?

981
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:27,973
That

982
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,601
was hung on Hye-na's bag.

983
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,688
No, it's mine. We had the same thing.

984
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,204
Ms. Kim, spare me some time...

985
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,625
You know that
U-ju's not the killer, don't you?

986
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,086
He had no reason to kill Hye-na.

987
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:03,550
You.

988
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,428
You met Hye-na, didn't you?

989
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,475
She came here, didn't she?

990
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,726
Are you

991
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,770
threatening me?

992
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,273
Not at all.

993
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:23,279
I'm just asking
how Kang Ye-seo got perfect scores.

994
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,615
You gave her the exam questions, right?

995
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:31,328
I sneaked into her room
before the final exam

996
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,123
and peeked at a few pages
of the questions you gave her.

997
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:38,460
You changed the numbers and wordings

998
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,380
and added a few more problems to mask it.

999
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,465
Who is it?

1000
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,844
Who in our school

1001
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:48,804
is working with you?

1002
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,390
Fine.

1003
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,435
What is it you want?

1004
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,437
Make sure that Ye-seo

1005
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,814
doesn't get into SNU's med school.

1006
01:11:59,064 --> 01:12:01,025
I'll get in with my own ability.

1007
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:03,277
You just have to make her fail.

1008
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,030
Do you...

1009
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,450
fear nothing?

1010
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:18,167
How could you do that to Hye-na?

1011
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,628
And frame my innocent son for it?

1012
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,103
You said I would be punished by the gods.

1013
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:46,653
You too try living in a hell that
you can never escape from.

1014
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:15,140
The 100-percent acceptance rate
to SNU's med school.

1015
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,392
Is this how you achieved it?

1016
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,644
To get kids accepted
who would never get in otherwise,

1017
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,021
I had no choice but to do such things.

1018
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,731
Do you think I'll just leave you be?

1019
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,358
Kwak Mi-hyang.

1020
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:29,113
You can't give up on getting
your kid into SNU's med school, can you?

1021
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:31,448
I will get her in for you.

1022
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:32,950
You just

1023
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,201
sit and watch.

1024
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,163
Don't you dare touch a hair
on my daughter's head.

1025
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,373
Of course.

1026
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,959
I won't touch Yeo-seo.

1027
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,836
You just...

1028
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,754
have to

1029
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:46,964
trust me.

1030
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:50,050
