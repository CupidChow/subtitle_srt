1
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,235
DAECHI STATION

2
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,287
KANG YE-SEO

3
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,979
You don't have to be in a rush yet though.

4
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,148
I have to be ready for war now.

5
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,274
Don't worry.

6
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,777
If I learn any know-how,
I'll definitely pass it on to you.

7
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,695
Seriously?

8
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,322
You really mean it, right?

9
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,032
I'll count on you, then.

10
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,743
You know that you're my role model, right?

11
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,830
It's at 6 p.m. sharp. Don't be late.

12
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,789
Oh, right.

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,165
Should I wear a dress?

14
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,416
If you can.

15
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,877
It's the most special day
for Myeong-ju, you know.

16
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,629
I envy her so much.

17
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,423
Myeong-ju's life is so perfect.

18
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,260
I'll dress up well, then.

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,428
See you later.

20
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,153
Wake up.

21
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,156
-Wake up already.
-Gosh, please.

22
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,617
I operated on five patients yesterday.

23
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,120
And that's why you drank until 2 a.m.

24
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,122
Wake up. Get up!

25
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,208
Why?

26
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,210
Drink this. It'll wake you up.

27
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,838
-Open it for me.
-What?

28
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,091
We have to go to an important party
in the evening.

29
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,097
-Please.
-Get up!

30
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,099
A party? For what?

31
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,478
I think Ye-seo's mom is throwing a party.

32
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,523
So what is the party for?

33
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,318
To congratulate...

34
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,278
Yeong-jae's mom.

35
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,448
She beat you to it again.

36
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,283
Once again, we're one step too late.

37
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,453
I got back from the US yesterday.
While I was away, Ye-seo's mom--

38
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,955
Hello, Lawyer Kim. I'm really sorry.

39
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,166
Something has come up.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,585
I don't think
I can play golf with you today.

41
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,587
I'll take care of your caddie fee
next time.

42
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,882
All right. Thank you. Bye.

43
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,016
Do you know what your problem is?

44
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,354
The fact that you told me about it today.

45
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,564
On the day of the party.

46
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,236
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,987
I forgot to tell you.

48
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,908
You forgot?

49
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,997
Don't you know that you're a mother?

50
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,999
Our sons are in high school now.

51
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,002
I hope you're not thinking
that Ye-seo's mom

52
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,797
is throwing this party
because she's sincerely happy for her.

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,590
Like you, I also think...

54
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,428
-about these things.
-Don't try to change the topic.

55
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm not saying you don't think.

56
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,516
The problem is that you're always...

57
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,940
Ye-seo's mom beats you to it.
That is my point.

58
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,278
The excruciatingly slow tortoise

59
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,280
ended up beating the hare.

60
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,949
-What did you say?
-Don't jump to conclusions.

61
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,200
Yeong-jae's portfolio...

62
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,245
isn't in her hands yet.

63
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,176
Mom, you're the best!

64
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,804
Mom, you seriously rock.

65
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,098
Are you that happy?

66
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,101
Getting Yeong-jae's portfolio

67
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,854
will be like
having a golden roadmap, right?

68
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,022
That's right.

69
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,483
It'll be our strategy to make sure
you can achieve your goal.

70
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,236
I'm going to do it.
I'll get into that school too.

71
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,531
Like Yeong-jae, I'll get into
Seoul National University Medical School.

72
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,909
You're so adorable.
Whose daughter are you?

73
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,244
Yours, of course.

74
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,042
You also prepared some candles, right?

75
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,129
Why not? We need candles
to get rid of the food smell.

76
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,255
Hold on, please.

77
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,924
Ye-seo, make sure Ye-bin wears her dress.

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,010
Okay. By the way, what about my hair?

79
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,511
Ma'am.

80
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,930
Wait upstairs, Ye-seo. I'll help you.

81
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,140
Sorry about that.

82
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,934
I'll be there shortly.
Please start setting the table.

83
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,648
Honey, your outfit is in our room.
Make sure you get changed.

84
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,567
Why do I have to get changed?

85
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,737
It'd be nice to put
on something formal, you know.

86
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,324
Is Yeong-jae our son?

87
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,659
Why are you even throwing a party for him?

88
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,080
I told you that it's a party
for Yeong-jae's mom, not him.

89
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,623
It's the same thing.

90
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,458
It's not the same thing.

91
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,752
Yeong-jae is the one
who got into the medical school,

92
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,295
but his mom had to put up

93
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,215
with so much more stress than he did.

94
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,342
Okay, let's say that is the case.

95
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,678
Other moms aren't doing anything.
Why must you do all this?

96
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,100
I don't have time to argue with you now.

97
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,559
Just come with the girls on time.

98
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,187
Don't make such a fuss over these things.

99
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,025
"A fuss"?

100
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,194
Do you think I'm just making a fuss now?

101
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,612
I'm doing my best as a mother.

102
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,573
If you want to congratulate her,
just take her out for a meal.

103
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,450
Why do you have to throw a party for her?

104
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,287
Yeong-jae got into SNU Med School
without the college entrance exam.

105
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,914
I need to know how he managed his grades,

106
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,332
what he wrote in his admission essay,

107
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,501
what volunteer work he did,
and what school clubs he joined.

108
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,671
I desperately need to get my hands
on his portfolio.

109
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,133
You are throwing a party for her
just to get your hands on it?

110
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,551
Your mother wants her grandchildren

111
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,511
to become doctors
like you and your father.

112
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,639
She already looks down on me
for not having given birth to a son.

113
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,516
Imagine how she'll react if Ye-seo fails.

114
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,184
I won't even be able to breathe.

115
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,894
Why would my daughter fail?

116
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,479
There is no need for this extravagance--

117
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,107
She needs to take action
in order to get in.

118
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,867
Gosh, excuse me.
I'd like to use this glass.

119
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,412
-Please switch to bigger glasses.
-Okay.

120
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,372
-Please use this.
-Okay.

121
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,707
Get rid of everything.

122
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,625
No, wait. That's not the right one.

123
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,544
I'd like them in white.

124
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,629
-The desserts are ready.
-Okay.

125
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,091
Let's take that one out.

126
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,260
-Just prepare the two.
-Okay.

127
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,224
How would you like to arrange the seats?

128
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,602
You can guide them to their seats
in the order of their arrival.

129
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,272
By the way, our family will be sitting
right next to the VIP seats.

130
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,857
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,619
Mi-ra, are you ready?

132
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,828
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,457
I put in double the amount
that I agreed to pay you.

134
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,709
My goodness, thank you.

135
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,714
Will you let me keep your cell phones
until the party's over?

136
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,382
I'll return them to you
once the party's done.

137
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,219
Okay.

138
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,555
By the way, this is
a non-disclosure agreement...

139
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,225
that is saying you won't reveal

140
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,102
anything you saw or heard
at this party to a third party.

141
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,104
Will you please sign this?

142
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,316
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

143
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,193
I SHALL NOT REVEAL WHAT I SAW
OR HEARD AT THIS PARTY

144
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,122
Open the doors.

145
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,026
Welcome.

146
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,738
You should've told me beforehand.
Then you wouldn't have had to suffer.

147
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,073
I didn't suffer.

148
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,409
Myeong-ju and I are really close.

149
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,119
It was only right for me
to prepare this party.

150
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,663
I can't believe you prepared a party
for Yeong-jae's mother.

151
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,956
You really are incredible.

152
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,792
I didn't come up with it by myself.

153
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,627
It's Sky Castle's tradition

154
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,963
to hold a party for all the mothers
that managed

155
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,673
to get their kids into universities.

156
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,758
Really?

157
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,927
It's been two years since we moved here.

158
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,929
But I was never aware of that.

159
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,975
Sky Castle really is amazing.

160
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,561
Professor Park's family
will be ten minutes late.

161
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,938
Of course. They're the ones
who are getting celebrated.

162
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,274
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

163
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,115
We're late. Hurry up.

164
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,825
Hey, hold it properly.

165
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,870
-Listen to your mother.
-My goodness, do you want to die?

166
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,913
-It's heavy.
-Be quiet. Hurry up.

167
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,666
Not that way. It's this way.

168
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,834
Hurry up.

169
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,545
Gosh, will you come to your senses?

170
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,756
Open your eyes. I said, open your eyes.

171
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,299
It's heavy.

172
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,759
-Go inside.
-It's heavy.

173
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,677
My gosh, get inside. Come here.

174
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,804
-My goodness.
-Welcome.

175
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,930
Hello.

176
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm sorry, Seo-jin.

177
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,895
I wanted to come early and help,
but those two wouldn't listen to me.

178
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,661
I guess he decided to act up again.

179
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,789
Who's going to fix
that personality of his?

180
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,377
-You should go inside.
-Gosh, it must be so tiring...

181
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,974
Hey.

182
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,729
If I dressed up too,
it would've been embarrassing for Dad.

183
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,731
What a filial daughter.

184
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,066
Where's your sister?

185
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,527
She'll probably be late.
She's busy dolling herself up.

186
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,862
My gosh, who does that brat take after?

187
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,489
Mom!

188
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,498
I'm sorry, Mom. I had to get my hair done.

189
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,416
How do I look?

190
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,292
You're my daughter.
You will always look beautiful.

191
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,261
Hello. Hi.

192
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,058
My gosh, look at those sneaky people.

193
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,310
How dare they try
to sit beside the VIP seats?

194
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,730
My gosh, you're so pretty.
Come here, Ye-seo.

195
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,152
I should hold a party for you
in three years.

196
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,820
Thank you. I hope you really do.

197
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,988
Of course.

198
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,679
At least you got here in time.

199
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,097
I was worried that you might be late.

200
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,099
Were there a lot of people
on the mountain?

201
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,143
What mountain?

202
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,566
They're here.

203
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,687
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

204
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,022
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

205
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,106
Congratulations.

206
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,025
-Yeong-jae, congratulations.
-Thank you.

207
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,736
Thank you, everyone,
for sincerely congratulating us.

208
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,904
It's weird.

209
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,156
I feel a thousand times happier
than back when I got accepted

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,533
to SNU's med school.

211
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,867
Of course, you'd be.

212
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,453
Your family's achieved
in making three generations of doctors.

213
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,498
Professor Cha, your family
will soon become the Kennedys of Korea.

214
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,958
That doesn't just apply to my family.

215
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,835
Everyone here living in Sky Castle
sets a high value

216
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,505
on maintaining family traditions.

217
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,551
Yes, of course.
I don't even envy conglomerates.

218
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,637
I personally think Sky Castle
is a great environment

219
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,847
to educate our kids.
That's what I love about it.

220
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,058
Exactly. I totally agree.

221
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,645
On top of that, you can't live here
just because you're rich.

222
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,563
Of course.

223
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,481
Only the best professors
at Junam University

224
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,650
are allowed to live here.

225
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,610
I know it's owned by the foundation,

226
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,445
but we're probably the only ones

227
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,156
that are allowed to live
in this expensive mansion

228
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,325
for free until the day we retire.

229
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,289
-Here. Cheers!
-Cheers.

230
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,040
Cheers.

231
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,043
I hope Su-han also gets to...

232
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,255
No, I hope my grandchildren
and great-grandchildren

233
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,508
also get to live in Sky Castle.
I really do.

234
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,095
We're all helping each other out
for the same purpose.

235
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,769
I heard a single family

236
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,480
is able to own a castle for hundreds
of years if you live abroad.

237
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,901
The fact that my descendants
will also be able to walk through

238
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,028
the beautiful forests
that I walked through

239
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,738
is indeed an amazing thing.

240
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,492
I really think Sky Castle
is located in a great area.

241
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,038
That's why Se-ri and Yeong-jae were able
to get into university without a fuss.

242
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,123
He's right. That's also why

243
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,460
Ye-seo, Seo-jun, and Gi-jun
were able to get into

244
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,837
the prestigious Shin A High School.

245
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,672
Yes, it is located in a great area.

246
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,301
Back when they built this place,
the first chairman of the board

247
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:31,305
even considered the feng shui
of the location.

248
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,807
I'm sure it has more to do with genetics.

249
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,643
Look at everyone here.

250
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,603
The parents of all our kids are either

251
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,190
professors of Junam Medical School
or law school professors.

252
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,610
On top of that, you successfully managed
to support your kid,

253
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,655
and that's why he was able
to get accepted.

254
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,287
I'd love for you to teach my wife
a few know-how.

255
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,352
I'm sure everyone will manage
to do a good job on their own.

256
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,229
She managed to send your daughter
to Harvard.

257
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,816
Let's eat.

258
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,953
Thank you.

259
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,415
Do you really want to go
to medical school?

260
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,292
I heard you have to cut open
countless rabbits and mice.

261
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,712
Will you be able to do it?

262
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,588
You love dogs.

263
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,383
Are you a kid?

264
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,093
Why would that matter?

265
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,262
-He got into SNU Medical School.
-What?

266
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,347
You must be really happy though, right?

267
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,225
Yes, I made my mom happy.

268
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,311
How annoying.

269
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,899
Yeong-jae, can you take me with you
when you volunteer during the holidays?

270
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,277
I'll do a really good job
in helping you out. Please?

271
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,113
Why do you want to go
to medical school so badly?

272
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,614
Her mom wants her to.

273
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:13,907
-Hey.
-What?

274
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,075
Watch it.

275
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,078
Son.

276
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,958
My smart son. Come here.

277
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,129
My son.

278
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,089
My gosh.

279
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,133
-He's at it again.
-Look at that.

280
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,969
He's handsome,
did well in school, and is polite.

281
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,722
Can he be my son-in-law?

282
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,641
There's a waiting list.

283
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,643
Son.

284
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,189
Even if I'm born again,
I'll marry your mom.

285
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,982
She gave you to me.

286
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,027
My great son Park Yeong-jae.

287
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,655
Let me kiss you. Come on.

288
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,074
-No.
-Come here.

289
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,658
He got into medical school,

290
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,827
so she gets a confession of love
at her age.

291
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,287
You're lucky.

292
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,040
Ye-seo does well in school,
so you must be loved.

293
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,465
Here, I have a present for my wife.

294
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,050
For me?

295
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,096
What is it?

296
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,185
Gosh, honey.
These are tickets to a cruise.

297
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,062
Take your mom.

298
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,064
Here.

299
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,983
This platinum credit card...

300
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,444
-is an extra.
-Oh, darling.

301
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,950
Son.

302
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,744
I get to enjoy such luxury thanks to you.

303
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,125
A celebration like this
isn't complete without dancing.

304
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,129
-Play some music.
-Professor Cha.

305
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,340
A waltz.

306
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,544
Change. Change!

307
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,255
Teuroteu.

308
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,424
Play a teuroteu song.

309
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,426
Teuroteu.

310
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,469
Teuroteu.

311
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,013
Teuroteu.

312
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,524
This is so much fun! Yeong-jae!

313
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,228
You just had to spoil the party.

314
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,812
Don't irritate me.

315
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,315
I did you a favor by being there.

316
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,070
What are you so upset about?

317
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,365
Didn't you learn anything
from Professor Cha's wife?

318
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,700
Their daughter went to Harvard,

319
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,036
but she never bragged or talked about it.

320
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,497
Didn't you hear Professor Cha?

321
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,376
He asked Myeong-ju
to teach his wife a few things.

322
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,127
I don't even ask for you to do that much.

323
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,506
Do you want me to play along too?

324
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,176
How much did you spend on that party?

325
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,306
Do you think Yeong-jae's portfolio
is something you can buy?

326
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,517
I don't believe this.

327
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,353
Will doing everything Yeong-jae did
guarantee entry?

328
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,147
Why not even ask for his underwear
and put them on Ye-seo?

329
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,401
Don't treat me like an airhead.

330
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:21,071
It's not like your era
when you took an achievement test.

331
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,490
There are even instructions
on how to cook ramyeon.

332
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,159
How can you not have a strategy
to get into the best medical school?

333
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,289
Is that strategy to just throw a party
to get Yeong-jae's portfolio?

334
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:34,001
It may seem like nothing to you,
but it's a vicious fight for information.

335
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,545
Didn't you see Professor Cha's face?
He thought I beat him to it.

336
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,340
Gosh. You must be so confident
that you got in there first.

337
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,551
Can Ye-seo really go
to SNU Medical School?

338
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,511
You'd better not fail.

339
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,405
You're playing marvelously well today.

340
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,742
I am. I'm in such a good mood
that even my game's improved.

341
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,535
When's the trip?

342
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,956
I fly to London in 2 days
then will visit 17 countries in 2 months.

343
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,250
-The day after tomorrow?
-That soon?

344
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,127
It's not some picnic.

345
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,546
This is how my husband plans things.

346
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,342
How about lunch tomorrow
at your favorite Italian restaurant?

347
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,468
Sorry.

348
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,054
I'm meeting my mom for lunch tomorrow.

349
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,680
That sounds like fun.

350
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,141
Whenever I'm worried about something,
I'd call my mom...

351
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,228
She knows you're anxious.

352
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,064
Is she teasing you or what?

353
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,733
Gi-jun wants to study medicine too.

354
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,359
She's caught in-between.

355
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,528
Professor Cha's family is just a neighbor.

356
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,655
Your husband and hers studied medicine
a few years apart.

357
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,115
What's the problem?

358
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,577
Even so, Professor Cha
did help Yeong-jae a lot.

359
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,454
She should share the info
with you both, then.

360
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,207
It involves Yeong-jae's privacy.

361
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,042
She wouldn't want to spread it around.

362
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,585
You know what Myeong-ju's like.

363
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,130
Look at her following Myeong-ju around.

364
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,174
You know how cunning Seung-hye can be.

365
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,219
You might lose out. Watch it.

366
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:18,438
Se-ri will graduate from Harvard,
get an MBA and work at Wall Street.

367
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,817
One of the twin boys
will study law, the other medicine.

368
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,985
That's my husband's dream.

369
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,655
You have nothing to worry about.

370
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,033
Professor Cha's heavily invested
in the kids' education.

371
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,620
I feel bad
because I can't match his passion.

372
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,123
I want to be a perfect mom like you.

373
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,458
Could you...

374
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,002
please teach me?

375
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,055
Myeong-ju, I have something important
to tell you.

376
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,516
Can you spare me some time after the game?

377
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,226
Just five minutes.

378
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,104
Was that from Ye-seo's mom?

379
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,067
Shall we have tea later?

380
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,156
I'll be frank.

381
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,740
I won't...

382
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,661
share Yeong-jae's portfolio.

383
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,371
Myeong-ju.

384
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,207
I know very well how desperate you are.

385
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,461
It would be nice
if there were something I could give you,

386
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,630
but you can all manage without it.

387
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,466
Aren't you all experts?

388
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,261
Ye-seo competed
in the Korean Mathematical Olympiad.

389
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,973
Professor Cha will teach Gi-jun well.

390
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,434
Myeong-ju, even so--

391
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,769
I'm very grateful for what you did.

392
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,608
I don't think you threw that party,
purely to get my son's portfolio.

393
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,818
Our friendship isn't that cheap.

394
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,406
You only have one child.

395
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,241
You have nothing to lose by sharing.

396
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,242
Jin-hui.

397
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,788
Don't I get to decide whether or not
to share my son's details?

398
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,127
The coffees are on me.

399
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,430
I should go too.

400
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,432
Seung-hye.

401
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,396
Do you know why she's like that?

402
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,731
Why would you...

403
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,858
ask me that?

404
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,194
I wonder what your intention is.

405
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,238
There is no intention.

406
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,365
Seo-jin must feel totally lost.

407
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,367
She just got royally betrayed.

408
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,286
"Don't I get to decide
whether or not to share?"

409
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,708
How can someone
just stab you in the back like that?

410
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,391
Are you busy? Were you busy?

411
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,393
Were you busy? Were you?

412
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,769
Were you busier than me?

413
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,480
Surgeries, outpatients,
lectures, papers, college.

414
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,691
Are you busier than me?

415
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,859
Answer me. Answer me!

416
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,654
How busy have you guys been?

417
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,573
How could the three of you
not come up with a summary of this?

418
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,825
Answer me!

419
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,702
-What's going on?
-Gosh.

420
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,495
-Hello.
-Hello.

421
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,171
Do we have Anesthesia's permission
for Oh Kyung-soo?

422
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,758
His blood pressure is high now.

423
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,344
It looks like we'll have to wait
for Internal Medicine's results.

424
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,638
Call me when the results are out.

425
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,848
-Got it, Doctor.
-Okay.

426
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,606
What are you hiding behind you?

427
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,777
Oh, it's nothing.

428
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,696
I asked these guys to do something, but--

429
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,655
Let me see.

430
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,324
What, sir?

431
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,575
Come on.

432
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,537
-Give it to him.
-Come on.

433
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,215
"The Selfish Gene"?

434
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,842
What is this?

435
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,136
Well, that is...

436
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,805
I have to read it
for this month's book club meeting.

437
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,682
It's for the essay test.

438
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,477
Just don't do it, then.

439
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,480
You used to attend it every month too.

440
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,898
I mean, at the beginning.

441
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,192
That was because Professor Cha
thinks orthopedic surgeons

442
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,777
are like ignorant butchers.

443
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,737
I only attended those meetings
to teach him a lesson.

444
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,115
Hey, those guys don't even
have enough time to sleep.

445
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:42,410
Do you think pestering them
will make you look and feel knowledgeable?

446
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,162
Was that what you were expecting?

447
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,332
Well, at least I should attend it

448
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,918
so that Su-han can develop
a habit of reading regularly.

449
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,547
Why is it that you're becoming
so much like my wife day by day?

450
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,427
SU-CHANG

451
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,720
Hey, Su-chang.

452
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,397
Su-chang.

453
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,315
Have a seat.

454
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,778
What's up?

455
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,988
Why couldn't you tell me about it
over the phone?

456
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,867
We've decided on the name
for the new center we're opening up.

457
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,913
Spine and Joint Center.

458
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,585
Hey, if it was "Joint and Spine Center,"
you wouldn't be able

459
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,045
to seize hegemony there.

460
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,756
Now that the name has been decided
as "Spine and Joint Center,"

461
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,552
you, Kang Jun-sang,
our best spine specialist,

462
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,263
can aim to become the head
of this new medical center.

463
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,268
And only then will you be able
to take this position after me.

464
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,522
It will only help you become

465
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,568
the director of the hospital.
Why leave that part out?

466
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,611
You won't thank me, will you?

467
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,906
Shall we grab a drink?

468
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,742
I don't want to, you jerk.

469
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,911
Gosh, come on.
I'll make a reservation at Pungwon.

470
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:07,996
I don't want to go.

471
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,374
Goodness, don't be so difficult.

472
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,507
You and that hobby of yours.

473
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,927
You can probably live without me,
but not without your guns.

474
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,097
You pick them up every morning
as if they're your lovers,

475
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,891
and return them every evening.

476
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,435
Gosh, what a hassle.

477
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,562
It's hunting season now, you know.

478
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,316
I can only enjoy this for two months
a year. You won't understand.

479
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,029
By the way, why don't you
help her out a little?

480
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,657
Jun-sang's wife has been
so devoted to you for years.

481
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,035
Still, I can't tell her everything
about our son's personal life.

482
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,537
His personal life?

483
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,791
As soon as I give her the information,

484
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,627
she'll go through everything,
knowing how thorough she is.

485
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,295
What if she finds out?

486
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,672
You wrote down all the details?

487
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,549
Have you lost your mind?

488
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,761
Quiet, Yeong-jae will hear us.
What will you do if he hears us?

489
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,058
That boy is such a weakling.

490
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,142
What are you talking about?

491
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,102
Then how could he go backpacking
by himself?

492
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,562
For a whole month.

493
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,808
PASSWORD OPTIONS

494
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:52,892
DELETE PASSWORD

495
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,021
ENTER YOUR PASSWORD

496
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,023
YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN DELETED

497
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,671
She must have a secret
that she can't tell anyone.

498
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,382
What if she lied to us
about Yeong-jae getting into SNU?

499
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,509
We confirmed it with her
when the results were announced.

500
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,303
Then what could the reason be?

501
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,555
Why can't she give it to you?

502
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,390
What would you do?

503
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,729
What if someone else wrote
Su-han's admission essay for him?

504
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,232
And what if he got in
because of that essay?

505
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,156
Why didn't I think of that?

506
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,241
Professor Cha must've revised it.

507
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,993
He even proofreads his kids' book reports.

508
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,328
That essay was definitely revised.

509
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,538
Myeong-ju must've pestered
Professor Cha about it.

510
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,457
What if Myeong-ju already gave it
to Seung-hye

511
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,667
and decided to put on a show,
saying she can't show it to us?

512
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,711
No, she wouldn't do that.

513
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,339
She couldn't deny that she got help
from Professor Cha,

514
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,925
and at the same time, she couldn't
betray me, her best friend, either.

515
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,010
That's probably why she decided
not to show it to anyone.

516
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,179
That's what I'm guessing,
knowing her personality.

517
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,641
So?

518
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,643
Will you give up?

519
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,728
Me?

520
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,608
You'll give up?

521
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,568
Do you think Ye-seo's mom
will give up too?

522
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,446
What can she do? Yeong-jae's mom
is saying she can't give it to us.

523
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,657
Be persistent and proactive.

524
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,367
Can't you try to persuade her
more earnestly?

525
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,789
If you approach her
without Ye-seo's mom knowing,

526
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,958
she'll give it to us.
I'm 100 percent sure.

527
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,210
How can you be so sure?

528
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,047
Who started Omphalos?

529
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,590
For the past two years,

530
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,760
all the families at Sky Castle
have been meeting once a month

531
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,637
to discuss the books they're reading.

532
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,722
Who's the person that started it
and is leading the club?

533
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,602
The books that I got Yeong-jae to read

534
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,813
made it into the list of books
on his student record.

535
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,982
I have to take these snacks to the girls.

536
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,192
The fourth question
in his admission essay!

537
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,242
"The three most memorable books
you've read in high school."

538
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,994
Even for that question, I--

539
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:16,911
Did you...

540
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,455
write his admission essay for him?

541
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,667
So stop worrying
about these stupid snacks, and please...

542
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,876
Please!

543
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,298
Don't let anyone steal what's ours.

544
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,594
Yeong-jae!

545
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,095
Yeong-jae.

546
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,142
I'm also leaving for my trip today.

547
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,770
I won't see you for two months.
You won't even say goodbye to me?

548
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,855
Well, I thought you were asleep.

549
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,358
My dear son.

550
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,659
Have a good trip, okay?

551
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,578
Make sure you call me when you arrive.

552
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,330
I'll get going.

553
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,123
Yeong-jae,
you must be leaving for your trip.

554
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,044
-Hello.
-Hi, have a great trip.

555
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,170
Bye.

556
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,925
What brings you here so early?

557
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,052
I have something to give you.

558
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,012
-Me too.
-What?

559
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,517
What's this?

560
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,645
I heard the Wi-Fi
on the cruise ship is slow

561
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,980
and that you can't even use
roaming services.

562
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,274
I thought you might get bored
during the trip,

563
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,360
so I downloaded some music
and movies you'd like.

564
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:17,323
You're too much.
You're making me feel bad.

565
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,660
I also brought this for you.

566
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,620
What is this?

567
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,831
It's cash.

568
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,125
You can use it for tips.

569
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,334
I figured

570
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,920
you probably didn't have time
to prepare petty cash.

571
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,714
Are you two really going to keep this up?

572
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,759
Myeong-ju, if you don't think it's fair
to give it to just one of us,

573
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,344
could you at least give us a simple list?

574
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,055
Yes, could you please do that for us?

575
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:41,973
I'm sorry.

576
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,142
I cannot give you the portfolio.

577
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,936
But instead,

578
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,231
I'll tell you my secrets
to getting Yeong-jae into SNU.

579
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,942
-Your secrets?
-Your secrets?

580
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,902
Your goal is getting your kids
into SNU, right?

581
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,114
This will probably be more effective
than getting the portfolio.

582
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,991
What is it?

583
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,033
Which bank

584
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,077
do you mainly use?

585
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,537
Pardon me?

586
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,081
I don't know which bank you ladies use.

587
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,624
Answer my question.

588
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,334
Let's see how lucky you ladies are.

589
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,967
-Hannam Bank.
-Seodong Bank.

590
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,857
You really are full of luck.

591
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,953
HANNAM BANK

592
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,344
HANNAM BANK

593
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,476
Around this time of year,

594
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,771
the bank sends out invitation cards
to the VVIP customers.

595
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,357
It may seem like an investment briefing,

596
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,944
but it's actually a very secret gathering

597
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,197
where they connect the VVIP customers

598
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,907
with the best entrance exam coordinators.

599
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,952
If you're able to meet a coach
that perfectly suits your kid,

600
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,162
their chance of getting accepted
will be guaranteed.

601
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,832
Hello, please show me
your invitation card.

602
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,295
VVIP CUSTOMER
HAN SEO-JIN

603
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,340
We'll guide you to your seat.

604
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,926
Your seat is B03. It's in the center.

605
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,934
I'm done filling this out.

606
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,188
How did she get in here?

607
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm the only one
that got the invitation card.

608
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,072
The presentation will begin
in ten minutes.

609
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:06,909
Those of you who haven't filled in
your forms, please quickly do so.

610
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,452
I will repeat the announcement.

611
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,955
The presentation will begin
in ten minutes.

612
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:15,209
Those of you who haven't filled in
your forms, please quickly do so.

613
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,340
How did you get me this?

614
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,010
I couldn't stay still
after hearing that high-class information.

615
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,430
I used all my connections to get you that.

616
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,641
I want you to bring me...

617
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,353
Yeong-jae's coordinator.

618
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,189
-A coordinator?
-I have no time to explain.

619
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,566
Remember to text me everything.

620
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,404
I'm telling you to report everything
that happens there in real time.

621
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,573
This is coordinator number one.

622
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,534
It's beginning.
They're announcing the first one.

623
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,538
He taught in the best math academy
in Daechi-dong.

624
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,334
He has the highest number of students
that won KMO and IMO awards.

625
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,961
And for the past ten years,
he's been consulting students that aimed

626
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,588
to go to the top three universities
in Korea.

627
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,341
His success rate in getting his clients
accepted to the schools they wanted

628
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,300
was 93 percent.

629
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,968
-My gosh.
-He's not bad.

630
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,472
It's not only the top three universities.

631
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,724
He also got 271 students accepted

632
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,227
to nine different medical schools
that are located in Seoul.

633
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,520
-271 students?
-My gosh.

634
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,983
That means he managed
to get 27 students accepted every year.

635
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,277
If you include medical schools
in the suburbs,

636
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,905
he gets around 60 students accepted
to medical school each year.

637
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,324
-My goodness.
-60 students?

638
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,621
The number of acceptance doesn't matter.

639
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,208
What's important is
whether that person has the ability

640
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,501
to get my kid accepted.

641
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,169
How would anyone know that?

642
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,506
Yeong-jae's coordinator used
to be SNU's admission officer.

643
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,591
That makes her perfect for him.

644
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,675
On top of that,

645
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,762
her work partners are one of a kind.

646
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,263
What partners?

647
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,724
As you already know,
school grades are very important.

648
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,476
Once she gets assigned to you,

649
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,230
she creates a team
of professional teachers

650
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,232
that analyze the test questions
of your kid's school.

651
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,527
-There are professionals for that?
-They're like fortune tellers.

652
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,739
Their accuracy for all midterm
and final test is 100 percent.

653
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,909
It's not like our kids
don't know the answers.

654
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,786
But they make sure
our kids don't make any mistakes.

655
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,206
They also plan the right kind
of clubs and volunteer work

656
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,624
to get your kid into medical school.

657
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,001
But of course, they also plan ahead
so that your kid

658
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,670
can win several awards
at school competitions.

659
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,506
And they easily get your kid
to become the school president.

660
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,759
-Myeong-ju.
-On top of that,

661
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,762
they also manage your kid's stress levels
for three whole years.

662
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,224
The team also has
a professional counselor for teenagers.

663
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,768
Let's move onto candidate number seven.

664
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,565
They're announcing the last candidate.

665
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,444
Our last candidate used to work
as an admission officer at SNU.

666
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,320
Her client acceptance rate...

667
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,156
is 100 percent.

668
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,658
-What?
-Seriously?

669
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,326
For the past eight years,

670
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,579
she got 16 students accepted
to SNU Medical School.

671
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,956
What's the point of having such a rate?

672
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,292
She only gets two people in every year.

673
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,759
SHE ONLY GETS TWO PEOPLE IN EVERY YEAR

674
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,095
She accepts no more than two clients
every year,

675
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,639
which means you have to pay her a lot.

676
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,434
But every kid she coaches
gets in 100 percent.

677
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,479
-She's that confident?
-She guaranteed it.

678
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,565
She even said she'll give back
all the money if she fails.

679
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,568
I really want her.

680
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,530
There's no point. She needs to want you.

681
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,407
What?

682
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,284
What do you mean?

683
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,746
You'll see for yourself.

684
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,294
Now, let's begin
choosing your coordinators.

685
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,713
Open the envelope in front of you,

686
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,549
and you'll find a blank space
where you can write down who you want.

687
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,676
Write down the candidate's number...

688
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,596
I need to write down who I want.
Should I choose number one?

689
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,390
I hope you all make careful decisions.

690
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,607
Excuse me.

691
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,616
Honey, hurry up.

692
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,493
Hurry.

693
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,578
Are you all done?

694
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,622
No, not yet.

695
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,670
Those of you
who have chosen your coordinators,

696
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,215
please follow our employees
to your designated rooms.

697
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,606
Here you go.

698
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,861
HUSBAND
1 NEW MESSAGE

699
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,290
My sister-in-law's husband
is a professor at Yale University.

700
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,586
And apparently, events like this
also take place in the States as well.

701
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,589
They fully understand
the needs of their customers.

702
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,716
This event is the only reason

703
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,468
why I put money in this bank
that's worth an entire building.

704
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,307
Anyway, I hope it's only the three of us.

705
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:57,843
Hey, Ye-seo. It's me.

706
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,762
Mom.

707
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,807
I came in first place.
I got in as the top student.

708
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,601
I'll be leading the entrance ceremony.

709
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,645
Really?

710
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,855
You really got in as the top student?

711
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,276
I'm so proud of you, Ye-seo.

712
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,861
Did you tell your dad?

713
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,573
You should tell him yourself.
I'm here to meet your coordinator.

714
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,450
Oh, right. How did it go?

715
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,621
I chose the person that Yeong-jae's mom
told me about. Don't worry.

716
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:26,705
Mom,

717
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,792
what if I end up
being the top student in the country?

718
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,752
If I get a perfect score
on my college entrance exam,

719
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,087
Grandma will have nothing to say.

720
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,675
-Mom, I've got to go.
-Okay.

721
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,390
-Hey! You startled me!
-Move! Hey!

722
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,401
Hey, twins. You guys
heard the news, didn't you?

723
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,985
That's why you're being pettish, right?

724
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,530
-Gosh, are you crazy?
-Hey, Gi-jun.

725
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,452
I know you're jealous
that I got in as the top student.

726
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,748
But even so,
don't you think this is out of line?

727
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,751
I can't stand you. Get out of my way.

728
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,381
What? He can't stand me? Cha Gi-jun!

729
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,340
Ye-seo.

730
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,092
Congratulations on coming first.

731
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,886
Tell that jerk.

732
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,557
I'll stay in first place
so he can go on hating me.

733
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,586
HANNAM BANK VVIP INVESTMENT BRIEFING

734
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,971
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Ju-yeong.

735
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,723
-Hello.
-Hello.

736
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,851
The four of you here chose me,

737
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,854
but I only coach two students a year.

738
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,398
Two of you will be dropped.

739
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,448
I'll ask some questions.
Seon-kyu's mother.

740
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,616
Yes, Coach Kim.

741
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,327
You have a job.

742
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,329
I do work,

743
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,998
but I'm a patent attorney
with my own office.

744
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:36,001
I can adjust my schedule
to accommodate anything,

745
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,337
so I never missed

746
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,380
a school event or PTA meeting.

747
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,054
Children of working moms
can stay at the top of their class,

748
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,140
but they cannot stay at the top
of the top for extended periods.

749
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,808
You would have heard that.

750
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,854
Getting into college is a four-legged race
in which the mom,

751
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,398
the child, and I are a team.

752
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,616
CHA SEO-JUN, CHA GI-JUN

753
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,911
I studied for a doctorate
in French Literature

754
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,206
but stopped writing my thesis
when my eldest started school.

755
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,209
My husband and I then
tutored our kids at home.

756
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,837
My eldest daughter studies
Economics at Harvard

757
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,506
and the twins...

758
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,220
You didn't send your children
to extra classes or hired tutors?

759
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,224
We did sometimes send them
to extra classes,

760
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,477
but my husband taught them
math, English, and reading.

761
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,690
I tried to broaden their horizons
through various experiences.

762
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,568
Ma'am,

763
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,778
if I decide to coach your children,

764
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:48,198
your husband will have
to stop teaching them altogether.

765
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,368
You must leave everything to me.

766
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,954
Is that possible?

767
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,718
I taught for a short while
before getting married,

768
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,720
but quit after I got pregnant.

769
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,054
I thought that

770
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,725
Korea's curriculum was set up
assuming a full-time mom

771
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,560
is always there to help the child.

772
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,938
Still, you sent a four-year-old
to prepare for a gifted children's school.

773
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,484
I realized that my eldest daughter
is gifted and will do well in school.

774
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,571
The more I taught her,
the more she enjoyed learning.

775
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:30,657
Most importantly,
she's quite the perfectionist.

776
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,993
She would have a fit
if she got one question wrong.

777
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,538
She would only go to bed
once she had mastered that.

778
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,041
She has a high level of focus
and a drive to achieve something.

779
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,587
But those characteristics are shared
by all at the top of their class.

780
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,089
When she was five,

781
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,675
she lost to her father in a game of Omok.

782
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,303
Just so she could beat her dad
who came first

783
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,014
in the national achievement test,
she didn't eat or sleep for three days.

784
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,184
In the end, she succeeded
in making her dad surrender.

785
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,186
That's how competitive she is.

786
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,025
You recognized
her exceptional talents early on.

787
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,778
Making my daughter a successful person

788
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,572
is more important to me
than anything else.

789
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,598
I hope we get along.

790
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,726
Thank you, Coach Kim.

791
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,821
Seon-kyu's mother and Seo-jun's mother,
will you excuse us?

792
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:04,960
You're envious?

793
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,922
"I envy our coffee mug more than anything.

794
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:14,261
It does nothing and my mom
treats it so preciously.

795
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:18,724
All she does to me is tell me to study
or go to class.

796
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:26,773
A coffee mug doesn't have to study
or go to class and it's still loved.

797
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,070
Coffee mugs must have selfish genes.

798
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,614
I should've been born as a coffee mug.

799
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,450
The end."

800
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,326
The end...

801
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,122
"The end"? Why you little...

802
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,458
Come here. Come back here!

803
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,960
I'm sorry I was born.

804
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,086
You're sorry you...

805
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,337
How dare you say that?

806
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,840
Woo Su-han! Stop right there.

807
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,176
Su-han. Stay where you are.

808
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,678
What was that about a mug?

809
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:59,639
Watch out. Don't bump into those.

810
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,099
You fool!

811
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,269
Come here. Come here! You fool!

812
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,271
Come here.

813
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,982
I'll kill you.

814
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,370
Woo Su-han!

815
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,707
You brat! Where did he go?

816
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,167
Gosh.

817
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,841
-What was it this time?
-A book report.

818
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,968
I wrote how I felt.

819
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,053
No way.

820
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,139
Did you really say
you're jealous of a mug?

821
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,559
My mom would wail
if someone smashed a mug.

822
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,686
She wouldn't budge if I disappeared.

823
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,027
Ye-bin, shall we run away from home?

824
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,779
What do you mean?

825
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,365
You always said you wanted
to run away from home.

826
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,866
I would love to.

827
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,244
This is the worst neighborhood
in the world.

828
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,831
Shall we? Let's. I have money.

829
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,082
You idiot.

830
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,376
Do you think money is all you need?

831
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,672
For two 14-year-olds to leave home,
we need a 20-year-old guardian.

832
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,466
Only then can we rent a room
or get into a sauna.

833
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,011
Really? What should we do?

834
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,888
There is a way.

835
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,308
There's a way? What is it?

836
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,191
-Will you be my minion?
-What?

837
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,442
Then I'll tell you.

838
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:36,903
Yes.

839
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,321
I'll do it.

840
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,200
I'll do everything you say.

841
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,620
Does Jun-sang know?

842
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,916
You know what he's like, Mother.

843
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,002
-He won't let--
-You want me to give you

844
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,921
that much behind his back?

845
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:56,965
Mother.

846
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,467
I want to make your wish come true.

847
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,178
I gave up on that long ago.

848
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,557
No. I can do it.

849
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,643
Ye-seo can be the third-generation doctor.

850
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,771
The day she got the grand prize
at the math contest,

851
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,523
you were pleased too.

852
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,026
Mother.

853
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,278
Ye-seo entered high school
the top of her year.

854
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,529
If you help me out,

855
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,948
I can get her into SNU Medical School.

856
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,665
That coach.

857
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,584
Are you sure she can do it?

858
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,172
Professor Park Su-chang's wife
recommended her.

859
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,467
She coached their son for three years,
and he got into SNU Medical School.

860
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,679
I'll wire it by today.

861
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,973
Thank you, Mother.

862
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,309
This is the last chance
to make me acknowledge you.

863
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,644
Do you understand?

864
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,562
Yes.

865
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,524
I promise to get her in. I promise.

866
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,543
Mother.

867
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,004
Wait and see.

868
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,131
I'll raise her

869
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,885
way better than you raised your own son.

870
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,684
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

871
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,728
This is the kid's file.

872
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,271
Okay, you can go.

873
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:52,580
Coach Kim, I was just about to call you.

874
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,499
I wired the down-payment yesterday.

875
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,710
I'll send you the rest within today.

876
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,587
You said Ye-seo got into Shin A High
the top of her year.

877
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,298
Yes, apparently so.

878
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,051
She was in joint first place
with a student named Hwang U-ju.

879
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,096
He was from a middle school
on the outskirts of Daejeon.

880
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,474
If a child with that background
scored the same as Ye-seo,

881
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,269
it'd be fair to assume
that kid is smarter than her, right?

882
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,900
I'll send you his mom's phone number.

883
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,944
Being friendly with her will help you out.

884
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:27,282
Having a competition
will motivate Ye-seo to study harder.

885
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,160
All right, Coach Kim. Thank you.

886
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,211
NAME: HWANG U-JU

887
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,921
PARENTS: HWANG CHI-YEONG, LEE SU-IM

888
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,971
Come and have a look.

889
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,475
It's very fresh! Come and have a look.

890
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,187
The color is too dark.

891
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,230
Are you sure this is congealed ox blood?

892
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,066
I know I'll get in trouble if I fool you.

893
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:04,486
It is ox blood. 100 percent ox blood.

894
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,496
I'd like a tub of it, then.
I also need tallow to boil with it.

895
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,208
-Tallow will be free, right?
-All right, fine. Goodness.

896
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,340
My daughter, Kang Ye-seo,
will be going to the same school as U-ju.

897
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,967
You know that they got
into the school top of their year, right?

898
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,637
Would you be able to make some time
for a cup of tea, please?

899
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,306
BLOCK CONTACT

900
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,487
What's with this woman?
I texted her hours ago.

901
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,322
Maybe she's a working mom.

902
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,325
If she was a working mom,
she'd bend over backward

903
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,661
and do whatever she can
to get information from me.

904
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,204
That's true.

905
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,374
Then she must be a stay-at-home mom.

906
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,127
She's really something.

907
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,087
I've never met such a strange woman.

908
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,630
What kind of person is she?

909
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:06,965
DO-HOON'S MOM

910
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,140
Hi, Do-hoon's mom.

911
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,392
You must have a team ready for Ye-seo.
Can Do-hoon join too?

912
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,270
They went to the same middle school,
so let's help each other out.

913
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,229
Goodness.

914
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,481
No, I don't have a team.

915
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,649
You know her situation.

916
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,527
She's already finished Math II
because she had to get ready for KMO.

917
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,738
For Korean Literature, she says
the book club is enough. What can I do?

918
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,240
The discussions?

919
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,575
That's...

920
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,659
No, no way.

921
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,703
Only the residents here can join the club.

922
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,080
Yes, I'm sorry.

923
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,917
-She wants to join the book club, right?
-Yes, everyone does.

924
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,211
All moms of Su-han's friends
are so jealous too.

925
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,422
When I tell them it's led
by a law school professor...

926
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,548
Gosh.

927
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,592
Oh, no. It's time to go.

928
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,678
Goodness, Su-han's book report
isn't ready yet.

929
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,769
Did everyone have a busy month?

930
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,314
I saw that only four people
posted their book reports.

931
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,234
Frankly, writing a book report
is a little...

932
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,704
All right, then.
Who would like to go first?

933
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,372
Me.

934
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:27,795
Go ahead, Ye-seo.

935
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:49,526
The author's insight
into mankind deeply moved me.

936
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,570
I always thought everything
other than number one was meaningless,

937
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,157
and reading this book taught me
that I was right.

938
00:58:56,407 --> 00:59:01,704
I, too, inherited superb genes
from my parents.

939
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,624
I'm smart and goal-oriented.

940
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,168
Also, I'm competitive, and I never lose.

941
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,129
I will continue to follow
my genetic instincts.

942
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,590
In other words, I'll continue
to do my best to always be number one.

943
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,344
I'll always follow my instincts
to be selfish.

944
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:29,065
But can we really conclude
that we, human beings, are selfish

945
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,608
just because genes are selfish?

946
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:34,529
I mean, some people die
while trying to save others' lives.

947
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,155
Do you think they expected to die?

948
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,074
They probably did it to be complimented.

949
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:41,411
It says that only we, humans,
can overcome our genes' selfishness.

950
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,955
I think that's the gist
of what this author is trying to say.

951
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,331
Have you read the book thoroughly?

952
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,543
Gi-jun, don't you think you have
a bias against the word, "selfish"?

953
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,254
A purely selfless act
cannot be found anywhere in nature--

954
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,423
-Nature is--
-Back in middle school,

955
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,551
I had a math teacher named Lee Won-do.

956
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,761
Whenever my partner
got any question wrong,

957
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,555
he whipped me instead,

958
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,850
calling me a selfish jerk who studies hard

959
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,560
only for my own sake.

960
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,313
Cha Min-hyeok, turn around.

961
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,856
Now!

962
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,201
Since then,

963
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:26,372
I had always asked myself
if I'm a selfish person.

964
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,584
Then I read this book in college,
and it answered my question.

965
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,920
Being selfish.

966
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,881
What does it mean?

967
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,217
It's doing something
that will help you reach your objectives.

968
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:41,929
What?

969
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:43,389
Yes,

970
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,724
that's right.

971
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:49,395
Exactly, being completely selfish

972
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:54,233
is how you can become truly selfless.

973
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,429
What did you say?

974
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,307
Honey, what did you just say?

975
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,560
I wonder if Richard Dawkins
actually wrote the book

976
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,897
to tell his readers
that they should become

977
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,732
completely selfish.

978
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,985
Boys, go upstairs.

979
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,872
Stop talking nonsense.

980
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,874
Do you actually have time
to talk nonsense now?

981
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,711
We must make sure the boys
get into college without the coordinator.

982
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,422
We have to compete against people
who spend well over a billion won.

983
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:00,091
Still, how will you coach them yourself?

984
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,594
No matter how hard I try, it'll be useless
if the boys don't make efforts.

985
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,887
You saw Ye-seo earlier, right?

986
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,639
The boys should be doing that.

987
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,975
-Even you're not being supportive?
-Don't you remember?

988
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,270
You've tried tutoring them.
You know it can actually worsen--

989
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,980
Don't you know why I do this?

990
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,276
I wouldn't be living like this
if it weren't for your father.

991
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,690
-It's gotten pretty warm.
-Yes, it's a nice day.

992
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,363
My, it's so nice.

993
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,491
A taxi?

994
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,326
Where is it going?

995
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,787
It's pulling over
in front of Myeong-ju's place.

996
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,622
Who's visiting?

997
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,506
-Myeong-ju!
-Myeong-ju!

998
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,676
I'm so exhausted.

999
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,970
Not everyone is cut out for lazing around.

1000
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,515
It made me so exhausted.

1001
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,725
But you got to go away
as a reward for all your hard work.

1002
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,061
-It hasn't even been a month.
-I know.

1003
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,439
I would've gone crazy
if I had stayed there for full two months.

1004
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,858
And the chatters went on nonstop
all day long.

1005
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:44,779
That woman is in her 80s now,
but she's still so energetic.

1006
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,656
Still, that's such a waste.

1007
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,033
So which places did you not get to see?

1008
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,662
Well, I got to see almost everything.

1009
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,414
I've been to Europe a few times,
but it's different every time.

1010
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,544
Rome, Budapest, Prague, and Naples.

1011
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,839
The night view of Naples is fantastic.
It's breathtaking.

1012
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,925
Oh, right. I got you gifts.

1013
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,011
-Just a second.
-My gosh, what is it?

1014
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,472
I got the same thing for all of you.

1015
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,684
Here.

1016
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,478
Give one to Seung-hye too.

1017
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,691
Thank you, Myeong-ju.

1018
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:23,484
-I'll open it.
-Sure.

1019
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:26,529
What could it be?
My, you wrapped it so carefully.

1020
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,537
-This is so beautiful.
-It's exquisite.

1021
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,205
Thank you so much, Myeong-ju.

1022
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,459
Well, can we catch up tomorrow?

1023
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,836
I want to wash up and take a nap.

1024
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,423
Sure. How about a brunch tomorrow
at the Italian restaurant you like?

1025
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:47,466
All right, sounds good.
I'll treat you ladies.

1026
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,844
-We're off. Get some rest.
-Okay, bye.

1027
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,764
-Bye.
-Bye, Myeong-ju. Rest up.

1028
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,363
They moved as if someone is after them.
He even quit his job.

1029
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,865
Isn't it strange?

1030
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:59,700
Did Professor Park cheat on Myeong-ju?

1031
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,911
Don't you know how Myeong-ju is?
She would've figured it out

1032
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,121
and tracked that woman down
a long time ago.

1033
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,082
About Yeong-jae and his mom...

1034
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,292
Were there any problems between them?

1035
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,127
They must be moving
into Yeong-jae's place.

1036
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,172
Isn't he the person the director
of the hospital recruited himself?

1037
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,715
I wonder if they know.

1038
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,760
Hello, I just moved into that house
over there.

1039
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:19,637
-Oh, I see.
-Yes.

1040
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,348
By any chance, are you Mi-hyang?

1041
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,560
