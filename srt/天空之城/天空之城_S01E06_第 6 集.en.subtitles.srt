1
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,300
Aren't you going to take that?

2
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,306
Hello?

3
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,933
Hello?

4
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,729
Dr. Kang Jun-sang?

5
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,315
Who is this?

6
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,947
Who are you?

7
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,617
It's...

8
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,660
Eun-hye.

9
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,912
Kim Eun-hye.

10
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,138
I'm sorry about contacting you
like this all of a sudden.

11
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,975
I need to ask you a favor.

12
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,697
You've dialed the wrong number.

13
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,368
Who was that?

14
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,704
Didn't you hear what I just said?

15
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:16,970
Hey,

16
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,055
it's all because of you.

17
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,267
I broke up with Eun-hye because of you.

18
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,937
If it weren't for you, Eun-hye and I--

19
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,272
Eun-hye, Eun-hye, Eun-hye!

20
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,983
When will you stop talking about her?

21
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,027
She's already married and has a child.
What are you going to do if you find her?

22
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,404
Don't you see your own kids here?

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,990
I thought

24
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,950
Eun-hye

25
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,870
left me for my sake.

26
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,999
I never thought
that you would break us apart.

27
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,295
Don't be foolish.

28
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,632
-What? What did you say?
-You...

29
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,718
wanted to dump her.

30
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,052
Even though your mother opposed,

31
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,096
you started a life with her,
but it didn't work out.

32
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,639
Kim Eun-hye was a nurse's aide,

33
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,683
and her mother had fainted
from briquette gas.

34
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,894
You couldn't bear to
be responsible for them.

35
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,022
I just gave you a good excuse
to leave her.

36
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,774
And now it's all because of me?

37
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,902
That's why I'm being punished.

38
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,407
It's a shame

39
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,744
that I left her just to marry
someone like you.

40
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,172
It's

41
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,049
Eun-hye.

42
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,383
Kim Eun-hye.

43
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,847
I'm sorry about contacting you
like this all of a sudden.

44
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,934
I need to ask you a favor.

45
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,062
A favor?

46
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,942
RECENT CALLS

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,251
It's jasmine tea.

48
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,836
It's good for relieving stress.

49
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,135
Everything's going to be fine.

50
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,472
Honestly, education-wise or ability-wise,

51
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,517
no one is better suited
than you for the chief.

52
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,066
Things will go well, so don't worry.

53
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,736
I'm not worried.

54
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,738
Who says I'm worried?

55
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,867
Get some rest.

56
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,688
Are you playing games with me?

57
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,358
You call this dinner?

58
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,902
You said you'd give me
weekly living expenses

59
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,905
so that I'll have some respect
for the head of the household.

60
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,115
So?

61
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,454
I feel the same way.

62
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,706
Since you have no respect
for the housewife,

63
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,334
you need to realize how much effort
goes into preparing each meal

64
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,628
and how grateful you should be
for every well-made dinner.

65
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,965
That's what I want you to know first.

66
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,014
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

67
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,974
You're going to take revenge?

68
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,559
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,437
The Code of Hammurabi
does not say you should get revenge.

70
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,982
It just says you should pay a fair price.

71
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,150
You must pay

72
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,861
an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

73
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,820
"Fair"?

74
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,864
Did you just say, "fair"?

75
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,950
Was it fair to tear down the study room
without even discussing it with me?

76
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:12,497
You're the one who built that soundproof
room without discussing it with me.

77
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,083
Are you seriously going to be like this?

78
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,960
We don't even need to discuss this.

79
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,296
Change the room back
to how it was by tomorrow.

80
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,924
We both want our kids
to get better grades.

81
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,467
It's just that our methods are different.

82
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,844
They're not different.
Your method is wrong.

83
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,847
How will you send them to a prestigious
university with that mindset?

84
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,265
If your method is right,

85
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,685
then our kids will get better grades.

86
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,898
Of course. There's no way
their grades will fall.

87
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,026
Then

88
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,446
let's decide when
they get their midterm exam results.

89
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,698
If they get better grades,
I'll change the room back.

90
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,283
If not, I'll do things my way.

91
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:50,910
What do you say?

92
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,541
Sure. If their grades fall,
you can do whatever you want.

93
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,961
But if their grades improve
by even just one point,

94
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,547
put the study room back to how it was.

95
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,882
Fine.

96
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,510
Just don't go back on your word later.

97
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,068
Enjoy your dinner.

98
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,654
What about the kids?

99
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,949
Are you going to feed them this, too?

100
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,951
Of course not. They'll be getting...

101
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,872
a meal with 12 side dishes.

102
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,290
They need their energy to study.

103
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,269
KOREAN, MATH, KOREAN HISTORY,
SOCIAL STUDIES, SCIENCE

104
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,438
U-ju.

105
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,857
Hye-na scored a huge one today.

106
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,234
"Sir, why do you even get paid every month

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,320
when all you do is make us
watch internet lectures?"

108
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,280
Wow.

109
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,116
Isn't she incredible?
She's totally awesome.

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,369
She even knocked out Ye-seo
for taking the teacher's side.

111
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,207
We should help her
become the school president.

112
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,626
U-ju, everyone wants to become
the school president.

113
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,586
But you want to help Hye-na
become the president?

114
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,923
She says what needs to be said
even if it puts her at a disadvantage.

115
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,550
People like her should be
the school president. Right?

116
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,595
Gosh, you're just saying that
because you like her, right?

117
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,514
Hey, get over here!

118
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,394
That's absurd.

119
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,647
It's so hard to become
a teacher these days.

120
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,317
How could they hire someone so incompetent
just because he's the chairman's nephew?

121
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,694
No one can say anything even though
they're really dissatisfied.

122
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,364
But Hye-na confidently
stood up and told him

123
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,074
to stop making them watch
internet lectures.

124
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,451
What a brave girl.

125
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,121
You should invite her over sometime.
I'd like to meet her.

126
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,041
No,

127
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,627
I'm not that close to her.

128
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,631
You've been talking about her
a lot these days,

129
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,508
so I thought you two were close.

130
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,930
I'm just a little worried about her
because it seems like

131
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,765
her mom's sick.

132
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,393
-Her mom's sick?
-Her mom's sick?

133
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,648
I overheard her while I was passing by,

134
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,150
and she was talking about hospital fees.

135
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,154
It's really tough if your mom's sick.

136
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,246
I want to crush her pride.

137
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,499
Sometimes, I just want to beat her up.

138
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,750
Hye-na.

139
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,296
Yes, I know. But she's just so annoying.

140
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,715
She thinks she's the only one
that deserves to be the top student.

141
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,718
That's why she's the last person
I want to lose to.

142
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,512
You shouldn't hate your friend.

143
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,015
You should always have a kind heart.

144
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,601
You always say that, Mom.

145
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,231
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,568
If I had been healthy,

147
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,738
you would've been able to study
without a single worry.

148
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,282
There you go again.

149
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:24,081
I hope I stay alive at least
until you get into university.

150
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,626
Why do you keep saying that?

151
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,836
How do you expect me to live without you?

152
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,713
I hate coming here because you keep

153
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,673
saying stuff like that.

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,584
It seems like

155
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,420
U-ju likes that girl named Hye-na.

156
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,299
You thought so, too?

157
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,051
I think he cares about her more

158
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,928
because her mom's sick.

159
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,430
Yes, it seems that way.

160
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,516
Honey,

161
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,934
are you okay?

162
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:26,602
What do you mean?

163
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,356
Don't worry about it.

164
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,192
I actually liked the fact that he talked
about his biological mother.

165
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,194
It made me feel sad hearing him say

166
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,613
that it was hard for him
when his mom was sick.

167
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,324
Even when his mom was lying
in the hospital for five years,

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,368
he never once said he was having
a hard time.

169
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,662
But seeing how he talks about
everything now

170
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,872
shows me that you're a perfect mother.

171
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,917
I'm not a perfect mother.
U-ju's just a nice boy.

172
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,460
I really feel like

173
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,587
I got myself a good son for free.

174
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,135
By the way, do you think
Ye-bin will be okay?

175
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,928
How could she let her do that

176
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,721
for the sake of relieving her stress?

177
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,809
That's absurd. How could he
mistake me for some other kid?

178
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,938
So many kids go to that convenience store.
He probably mistook you for someone else.

179
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,691
You idiot. Do I have such a common face?

180
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,861
No, that's not what I meant.

181
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,030
So what are you going to do?

182
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,825
Something's weird.

183
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,618
Something's definitely weird.

184
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,246
I'm going to get caught
on purpose tomorrow

185
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,206
and see how he reacts.

186
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,459
Have you gone mad? Why would you do that?

187
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,626
I mean, it's just funny.

188
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,546
I stole it, but he said I paid for it.
It's nonsense.

189
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,965
So are you really going to do it?

190
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,717
Are you going to stay out of it again?

191
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,679
-Well...
-You idiot.

192
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,307
That's your limit. Even though
it's much better if you go beyond it.

193
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,986
You idiot. That's your limit. Even though
it's much better if you go beyond it.

194
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,323
KANG YE-BIN, LIMIT

195
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,498
Su-han.

196
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,750
Oh, Su-han.

197
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,880
You're still awake.
Were you studying all this time?

198
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,424
But why are you tearing out your hair?

199
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,801
I can't solve this math problem.

200
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,845
You can't solve a math problem?

201
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,097
But you still shouldn't
tear your hair out.

202
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,852
Su-han.

203
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,023
Do you want to lie down
with me for a minute?

204
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,401
-Yes.
-Shall we? Come on.

205
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,529
Come on.

206
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,656
All right.

207
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,784
Come here, darling.

208
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,081
Oh, you adorable thing.

209
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,084
Where did this adorable son come from?

210
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,502
From your belly.

211
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,797
My precious son. Oh, you're so adorable.

212
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,093
Su-han.

213
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,263
Studying is hard, isn't it?

214
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,849
I want you

215
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,726
to become

216
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,689
a doctor just like your dad,

217
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,692
but whenever I see you
having a hard time like this,

218
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,570
I start to wish

219
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,990
that you'd just grow up healthy
and have a happy life.

220
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,369
My mind changes day and night.

221
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,663
To be honest,

222
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,999
I'm not quite sure what's right.

223
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,168
Then why do you always tell me to study?

224
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,462
You're always nagging at me.

225
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,590
I know.

226
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,135
I wonder if I'm doing the right thing,
but there's no answer.

227
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,431
I don't have a strong backbone
like U-ju's mom.

228
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,225
And I don't have strong conviction
like Ye-seo's mom.

229
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,979
Su-han.

230
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,066
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,864
I'll be a nice kid, Mom.

232
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,991
My sweetheart, you're so adorable.

233
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,870
What was that supposed to mean?

234
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,830
You don't need to know.

235
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,542
Really? I don't need to know?
My sweetheart.

236
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,089
My adorable little son.

237
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,222
Seo-jin.

238
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,642
Did you call for me?

239
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,101
Take a seat.

240
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,902
I talked to the chairman of the board.

241
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,572
You'll get some good news soon.

242
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,700
Thank you, Mother.

243
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,953
I helped my son,
so there's no need to thank me.

244
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,498
You just have to get Ye-seo
into SNU Medical School.

245
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,084
Isn't that the deal we made?

246
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,629
Yes, it is.

247
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,214
You can go then.

248
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,718
I put some kimchi in the fridge, Mother.

249
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,486
What is it?

250
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,030
Your mother talked to
the chairman of the board.

251
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,908
You'll get some good news soon,
so don't worry.

252
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,118
I'm not worried.

253
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,453
Shall we have dinner with Mom?

254
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,665
Sure. I'll make a reservation
at her favorite Japanese restaurant.

255
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,918
I'll just let you and your mother
spend some time together.

256
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,504
She'll prefer that, too.

257
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,678
The newbie should know his place.

258
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,138
Pardon?

259
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,641
You can go now.

260
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,144
-Professor.
-Yes?

261
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,563
Will you be okay?

262
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,400
That man will know that
you're seeing outpatients today.

263
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,277
Don't worry and get back to work.

264
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,862
Bye, then.

265
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,114
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

266
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,866
Hello.

267
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,869
-Hello.
-Hello.

268
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,705
Sir, you're here.

269
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,832
-How are you feeling?
-Much better, thanks.

270
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,625
Kang Jun-sang!

271
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,211
You quack.

272
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,382
Why...

273
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,634
Why do you keep doing this?

274
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,886
I've told you multiple times.

275
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,096
Your surgery turned me into a cripple.

276
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,640
My leg was fine, but now it's paralyzed!

277
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,977
When you signed the consent form
for the operation,

278
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,730
I explained that nerve damage
could be a possible side effect.

279
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,857
Statistics say that
3 out of 100 people could--

280
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,526
So what? It's not your fault?

281
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,570
You ruined my life,
but it's not your fault?

282
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,157
I might have ethical responsibilities,
but I have

283
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,284
no legal responsibilities
regarding your case!

284
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,494
Why you...

285
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,787
You bastard.

286
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,915
Why are you doing this?

287
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,250
Why are you doing this?

288
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,878
-He's crazy.
-Kang Jun-sang!

289
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,880
You quack!

290
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,215
Will you calm down?

291
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,008
You jerk. Stop where you are.

292
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,636
Please calm down.

293
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,179
-Gosh.
-Kang Jun-sang!

294
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,263
Oh, no.

295
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,975
Kang Jun-sang!

296
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,602
Stop right there!

297
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,731
Stop where you are.

298
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,907
How could you do this to me?

299
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,580
Kang Jun-sang!

300
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,249
Where are you?

301
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,085
Kang Jun-sang!

302
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,795
Kang Jun-sang, stop!

303
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,672
Kang Jun-sang!

304
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,234
Kang Jun-sang?

305
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,029
Hey.

306
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,239
Kang Jun-sang.

307
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,283
It's you, right?

308
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,868
Kang Jun-sang!

309
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,837
I'll kill you...

310
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,970
What on earth...

311
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,223
-What a mess.
-Are you okay?

312
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,100
Darn it.

313
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,685
-Hello.
-Hello.

314
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,904
Kang Jun-sang! You quack!

315
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,864
Where are you?

316
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,824
Kang Jun-sang!

317
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,911
Where's Kang Jun-sang?

318
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,287
Kang Jun-sang!

319
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,917
-What a lunatic.
-Oh, gosh.

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,336
What's a doctor doing
in the women's bathroom?

321
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,217
Oh, no...

322
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,011
-What's going on?
-Sorry. Get out of the way, please.

323
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,055
-In there.
-They're in there.

324
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,848
Security. Call security.

325
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,099
-Now!
-Hurry.

326
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,184
Okay.

327
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,436
-The man...
-Calm down.

328
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,355
Be quiet, everyone.

329
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:32,981
He had a knife.

330
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,192
Dr. Kang?

331
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,779
Dr. Kang?

332
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,825
Dr. Kang?

333
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,915
My gosh. Is she okay?

334
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,471
That's the knife. My gosh.

335
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,223
Look.

336
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,478
-A gun?
-He has a gun.

337
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,399
You scumbag.

338
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,401
I gave you compensation.

339
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,237
You took my money
and you're still torturing me?

340
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,073
What? Would you swap your leg
for a tiny sum like that?

341
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,199
What?

342
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,785
If you think it's unfair, then sue me.

343
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,870
-Sue me!
-You jerk.

344
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,724
Call...

345
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,434
Emergency...

346
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,316
A GUN-WIELDING DOCTOR?
THE CURRENT STATE OF MEDICAL ACCIDENTS

347
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,410
That moron.

348
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,579
I set everything in his favor...

349
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,360
Hurry.

350
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,617
Sir.

351
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,079
Why did you pretend to not see?
You saw everything.

352
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,914
What?

353
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,166
See what?

354
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,546
You know, right?

355
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,216
You knew last time too,
but lied and said I paid.

356
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,592
Why did you lie?

357
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,011
Kid. I don't know

358
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,014
what you're talking about.

359
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,265
Why are you stuttering?

360
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,644
Are you hiding something from me?

361
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,398
What would I hide?
Go if you're not buying anything.

362
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,067
I'm busy. Go away.

363
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,031
Did Mom...

364
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,201
Shall I pack you a nice dinner?

365
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:33,370
So that you don't have to leave?

366
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,581
She knew everything.

367
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,261
-Here.
-Just a moment, please.

368
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,223
Hello, ma'am.

369
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,019
All right.

370
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,272
Yes, thank you.

371
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,401
Who does this brat take after?

372
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,159
Hey, it's me.
Can you pick up Su-han today?

373
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,038
I just need to talk to Ye-bin in private.

374
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,081
What's the matter?

375
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,708
Why are you angry?

376
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,128
Why are you always like this?

377
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,592
You colluded with
the convenience store man, right?

378
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,887
Does that make you that angry?

379
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,597
I did it for your own sake.

380
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,349
What's for my sake?

381
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,227
Paying the store owner was for my sake?

382
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,771
Why would you get involved
and give him money?

383
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,523
Raising you

384
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,486
is ten times harder
than raising your sister.

385
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,279
You're talking about Ye-seo again.

386
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,530
Are we the same?

387
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,908
Just raise her then. You can throw me out.

388
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,327
How can you talk like that to me?

389
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,663
You're the one that shoplifted
and you're yelling at me?

390
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,958
Why didn't you go to the police
instead of talking to him, then?

391
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,709
Why didn't you turn yourself in
for shoplifting?

392
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,628
Let's go to the police station.
I'll turn myself in.

393
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,879
I'll turn myself in!

394
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,676
Come on. Why aren't we going?

395
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,427
You think I can't?

396
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,054
I said I'll turn myself in!

397
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,198
-All right.
-Let's talk inside.

398
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,450
But...

399
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,495
Get out.

400
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,583
I said, get out.

401
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,467
Kang Ye-bin, aren't you getting out?

402
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,928
You can go and turn yourself in
for shoplifting.

403
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,406
Just listen.

404
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,158
That's not it.

405
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,370
Do you know how shocked I was
when I first found out?

406
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,249
Your teacher heard
from the store owner and called me.

407
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,418
I felt like the sky was
crumbling down on me.

408
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,295
"How could my daughter do such a thing?

409
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,422
Should I break her wrists?

410
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,174
Should I kick her out of the house?"

411
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,343
I had all kinds of thoughts.

412
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,430
I was worried that you might
do something worse if I scolded you.

413
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,932
So...

414
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,185
I believed that you would

415
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,022
learn that it was wrong and stop
on your own if I waited patiently,

416
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,274
since you were just stressed out
from studying.

417
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,402
Ye-bin.

418
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,447
Look at me. Come on.

419
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,449
Aren't you going to look at me?

420
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,498
MY PRINCESS

421
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,833
Yes, darling.

422
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,461
Mom, I got perfect scores
on my exam today!

423
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,129
I have perfect scores
on everything so far.

424
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,047
Really?

425
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,467
Great job.

426
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,677
That's my princess.

427
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,847
Then if you do well tomorrow, you might
get perfect scores on every subject.

428
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,684
I love you, darling.

429
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,812
I love you.

430
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,943
Your meal is ready.

431
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,570
Ye-seo, Ye-bin.

432
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,667
How was dinner with your mother?

433
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,670
The chairman of the board

434
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,713
said not to worry.

435
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,632
Is that so?

436
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,552
What a relief. I was so worried.

437
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,304
Why were you worried? It was self-defense.

438
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,891
He's a patient, but he was holding
a knife. I couldn't just stand there.

439
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,025
Honey.

440
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,904
Ye-seo has perfect scores
on all her exams so far.

441
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,158
Perfect scores?

442
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,078
Of course, she's my daughter.

443
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,332
What about U-ju?

444
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,587
How did he do?

445
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:17,672
Him?

446
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,341
He's no match for me.

447
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,551
That's right!

448
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:25,013
Hwang Chi-yeong's son
is no match for my daughter.

449
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,598
Hwang U-ju...

450
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,475
I'm going to crush him

451
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,602
with perfect scores on everything.

452
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,020
That's right.

453
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,730
You go and crush him.

454
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,568
That's right, my girl, eat up.

455
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,904
You should have a good breakfast
for your brain to function well.

456
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,322
-All right, Mom.
-That's right.

457
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,531
Have some bulgogi, too.

458
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,533
My sweetheart.

459
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,912
My princess.

460
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,497
Eat up.

461
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,707
Honey, would you like some too?

462
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,335
Yes, this is good.

463
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,712
Have some tea.

464
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,006
Yes, sir.

465
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,512
Since when did you carry around a gun?

466
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,056
It's not a real gun. It's a gas gun.

467
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,684
Under the gun and explosive control law,

468
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,603
the Chief of Police has permitted--

469
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,105
I guess you've been really
harassed by that man.

470
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,900
You must have gone through
a lot of trouble.

471
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,860
Surely you understand.

472
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,863
Between a doctor who performs
ten operations a month

473
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,448
and a doctor who performs 100 operations,

474
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,660
who would have a higher chance of having
patients who develop complications?

475
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,914
A doctor who performs
100 operations, of course.

476
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,624
Do you think I don't know that

477
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,086
you are one of the top three doctors
with the most patients?

478
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,255
That's why

479
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,967
I was going to make you
the chief of the new center,

480
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,636
but...

481
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,474
Junam University Hospital has just become
known as a hotbed of medical accidents

482
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,393
because of this incident.

483
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:59,357
It took a lot of effort to cover up
the incident,

484
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,111
but there are too many rumors
going around in the hospital.

485
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,321
People

486
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,824
are talking about whether it's okay

487
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,451
to let a doctor who pointed a gun
at his patient keep practicing.

488
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,709
But isn't it your goal
to make our hospital

489
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,711
one of the top three hospitals
in the country?

490
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,964
I've worked harder than anyone
to help you fulfill your goal.

491
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,800
When others treated
10 patients, I treated 100.

492
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,719
And I performed so many operations.

493
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,054
I know that. Of course, I do.

494
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,472
But

495
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,436
people are insisting that the personnel
committee should make a decision.

496
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,523
If I step in, the personnel committee
will do as I say,

497
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,487
but making you the chief of the new
center during all this fuss is a bit...

498
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,954
But since no one else
is as qualified as you are,

499
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,541
I'll just make you the chief anyway...

500
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,298
But then, they'll gather like
a swarm of bees and protest.

501
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,928
They'll keep talking about
the personnel committee and whatnot.

502
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,855
Dr. Kang.

503
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,069
Since you're a man of strong will,
you can handle that, right?

504
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,077
I thought about it because
others said that I'm the most qualified,

505
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,205
but I was never greedy for the position.

506
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:44,170
Of course, you are not the person
to obsess over titles.

507
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,465
I should get going, then.

508
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,800
All right, go on.

509
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,276
Hello. It's me, sir.

510
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,863
Since you seemed to favor Dr. Kang,

511
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,242
I've talked to him about it,

512
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,663
but he's as straight as an arrow.

513
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,874
I tried to persuade him,
but he wouldn't listen.

514
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,919
And what with the shameful incident,

515
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,298
he said he'll refuse the position.

516
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,052
The last thing I want to say is

517
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,097
that I want you to think of me as
more a colleague than the chief.

518
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,686
I hope the Spine and Joint Center can
be a place where we can trust each other.

519
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,855
Thank you.

520
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,115
INAUGURAL CEREMONY FOR THE CHIEF
OF THE SPINE AND JOINT CENTER

521
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,117
Congratulations.

522
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,952
Thank you.

523
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,998
Let's take a picture.

524
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,085
That thousand-year-old tortoise

525
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,005
took the GED test and graduated
from a nameless university.

526
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,965
Since you're a Seoul University graduate

527
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,802
who has a dad who was the president
of the Korean Medical Association,

528
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,805
he must have an inferiority complex
against you.

529
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,852
A hospital director who is from
the Department of Rehabilitation...

530
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,856
Can a doctor who doesn't even use
a scalpel be called a real doctor?

531
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,941
No, of course not.

532
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,319
Hwang Chi-yeong is also
a nameless university graduate,

533
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,404
so the tortoise is taking his side.

534
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,740
But still,

535
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,743
Ye-seo beat U-ju.

536
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,827
Your children's grades...

537
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,247
That's what the real battle is about.

538
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,291
Cut the nonsense.

539
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,128
Dr. Kang's daughter entered
Shin A High School as the top student.

540
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,798
And once again, she got
the highest score in her entire year.

541
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,635
Now, try to guess

542
00:34:55,718 --> 00:35:01,140
how Dr. Hwang's son did on his exam.

543
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,017
-Did he come in fourth?
-What are you saying?

544
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,728
My wife was really worried.

545
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,980
He was also the top student
when he entered,

546
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,817
but he didn't even make it
to the top 20 this time.

547
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,241
That's enough.

548
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,785
Congratulations on your daughter
getting the best grades.

549
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,286
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

550
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,371
My gosh.

551
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,751
Sit down.

552
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,920
Okay, that's enough.

553
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,714
Sit back down.

554
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:39,011
To be honest, the moment Ye-seo
gets into SNU's med school,

555
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,889
you'll become the true winner.

556
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,143
I know it's a prestigious high school,
but he can't get into med school

557
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,228
if he can't even make it to the top 20.

558
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,357
Back when I got into
SNU's med school as the top student,

559
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,359
my dad was extremely happy.

560
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,362
Even though he himself
was a graduate there.

561
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,367
And now, I finally feel like
I can understand how he must've felt.

562
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,122
-Okay, everyone. Let's drink. Here.
-Okay.

563
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,752
Hey.

564
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,297
Get that frown off your face.

565
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:17,300
You're the reason Dr. Kang
had to go through all this fuss

566
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,552
and ended up losing
the position as the chief.

567
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,013
Things ended up this way
because you couldn't

568
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,598
do a proper job finishing up.

569
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,350
I'm sorry.

570
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,728
It's all my fault.

571
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,647
Let's stop talking about that. Here.

572
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,442
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

573
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,440
I'm so sorry, Dr. Kang.

574
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,151
It was all my fault.

575
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,029
I'm the one who needs to
take responsibility anyway.

576
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,615
It's not like you did it on purpose.

577
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,080
We all learn by making mistakes.

578
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,249
Don't worry too much,

579
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,334
and work hard.

580
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,920
Thank you,

581
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,090
-Dr. Kang.
-Gosh, you punk.

582
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,301
You're ruining your image
as a doctor. Stop crying.

583
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,097
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

584
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,598
You punk.

585
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,101
Why did you become a doctor?

586
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,146
Because

587
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,357
my mom told me to.

588
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,242
You poor kid.

589
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,166
I'm sorry, sir.

590
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,597
Congratulations.

591
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,891
-Congratulations, Su-im.
-Congratulations.

592
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,522
You didn't need to do this.
It's not like I got promoted.

593
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,109
It's Sky Castle's tradition
to celebrate each other's good news.

594
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,529
Everyone living in Sky Castle
is considered family.

595
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,489
We're a family that's connected

596
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,950
with a strong sense of community spirit.

597
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,370
Did Ms. Han make all this food?

598
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,830
I wasn't done talking.

599
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,290
Gosh, I'm sorry.

600
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,209
This is all just basic stuff.

601
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,920
She's great with both cooking
and her kids' education.

602
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,174
She's the best in Sky Castle.

603
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,971
I haven't seen this plate before.

604
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,724
Did you also get this from your mother?

605
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,060
It's a plate with gold decorations.

606
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,979
Didn't your mom get this for you
in Germany?

607
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:18,856
Yes, she did.

608
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,652
Her dad used to be
the president of Bank of Sydney.

609
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,115
Your parents are rich,
and your kids get good grades.

610
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,034
You must feel like you have everything.

611
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,120
Plus, Ye-seo even got the best grades
in her year this time.

612
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,081
-Stop it.
-By the way,

613
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,083
how well did U-ju do?

614
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,383
Ms. Jin.

615
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,676
Isn't that a bit rude?

616
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,678
Yes, she's right.

617
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,430
Why are our kids' grades so important?

618
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,140
Of course, they're important.

619
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,434
I feel much happier
when Su-han gets good grades

620
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,145
than when my husband's career goes well.

621
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,148
My gosh.

622
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,068
We're here to congratulate U-ju's mother.

623
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,112
Eat up.

624
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,118
She was just pretending
to congratulate me.

625
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,703
But she just wanted to brag
that Ye-seo got the best grades.

626
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,708
How can they offend someone
while pretending to be so elegant?

627
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,546
I wanted to flip the table.

628
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,800
You should've shown them
your double sidekick.

629
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,094
I'm not joking.

630
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:36,183
I might really turn everything upside-down
if they keep this up.

631
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,645
You're overreacting a little today.

632
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,939
What's wrong?

633
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,900
They blatantly asked me
about U-ju's grades.

634
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,529
I already feel like it's my fault
that his grades went down.

635
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,284
Why is that your fault? Don't worry.

636
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,869
He said he'll manage
his grades on his own.

637
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,329
Didn't you hear him say he shouldn't
have overestimated himself?

638
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,751
I'm not sure if I'm being a good mom.

639
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,088
I told you not to worry.

640
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,383
You're doing great right now.

641
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,516
She's so sly.

642
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,353
She sent flowers
and even threw a brunch party.

643
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,105
So I thought she was crazy.

644
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,982
But she totally humiliated her

645
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,109
by showing off that Ye-seo
got the best grades.

646
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,111
Goodness.

647
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,448
I bet you totally sucked up to her.

648
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,908
Suck up to her?

649
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,451
Do you think I enjoy doing that?

650
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,536
Your future and Suhan's future
lie in Seo-jin's hands.

651
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,746
So what else can I do?

652
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,208
Gosh. Women can be so scary.

653
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,627
You were always following her around,
acting all friendly,

654
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,253
but I guess you had an ulterior motive.

655
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,755
Of course.

656
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,965
You should have some motives too,

657
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,301
instead of flattering Ye-seo's dad
like you have no pride.

658
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,471
You...

659
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,390
That's a lot less stressful, you know.

660
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,143
It's so pointless
having an ulterior motive.

661
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,562
What? "Pointless"?

662
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,147
What did you say?

663
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,483
"Pointless"? Did you say "pointless"?

664
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,527
-It hurts.
-You little...

665
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,946
Okay,

666
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,489
I'll do as you say.

667
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,368
Thank you, Coach Kim.
It was all thanks to you.

668
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,538
Don't mention it.
It was just an obvious result.

669
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,582
By the way, I feel sorry for U-ju.

670
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,335
He entered school as a top student,
but now he's not even in the top 20.

671
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,925
He's not the one you should
be worried about.

672
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,594
Pardon?

673
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:39,056
Are you aware that Ye-seo likes U-ju?

674
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,435
Ye-seo likes U-ju?

675
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,189
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

676
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,068
That can't be. I know Ye-seo inside out.

677
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,195
Parents think they know everything
about their children,

678
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,531
but that's just a delusion.

679
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,200
It's one-sided at the moment,

680
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,869
but you still need to pay
close attention to her.

681
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,913
The biggest reason top students

682
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,499
sometimes lose their pace
is because of relationship problems.

683
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,751
And if she actually starts dating,

684
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,920
her grades will go down for sure.

685
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,589
Shall I hold them for you?

686
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,259
Will you?

687
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,442
Then what should I do?

688
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,486
You need to support,
encourage, and empathize with

689
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,363
Ye-seo's feelings toward U-ju.

690
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,116
Shouldn't I stop her?
And who knows if that will even work?

691
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,286
The most important thing is to make
Ye-seo tell you everything

692
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,954
about how she feels,
without hiding anything.

693
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,291
That's how you'll be able to
control her feelings.

694
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,917
What if they actually start dating?

695
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,881
We'll have to make sure
that never happens.

696
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,507
How?

697
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,844
Once Ye-seo puts her mind to something,
she goes all the way.

698
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,137
Thankfully,

699
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,182
it doesn't seem like U-ju
is interested in Ye-seo.

700
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,938
You must keep what you heard today
to yourself.

701
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,857
Ye-seo can't find out.

702
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,152
I'll just

703
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,987
trust you.

704
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,740
By the way,

705
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,909
about the school president...

706
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,828
I didn't let her
become a class cabinet member

707
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,247
because I thought it might
get in the way of her studies.

708
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,668
But don't you think she should
become the school president

709
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,670
in order to show
that she has leadership skills?

710
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,714
Being the school president
isn't the only way

711
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,466
to get recognized for one's leadership.

712
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,636
Wait.

713
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,891
It's been so long,
so I wasn't sure if it was you.

714
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,851
You're Jennifer, right?

715
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,939
You used to live in Fairfax, Virginia.

716
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,442
I'm Laura. Laura Jung.

717
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,904
What about K?

718
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,447
How is K?

719
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,160
You've mistaken me for someone else.

720
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,335
"Fairfax"?

721
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,839
That city is famous for having
the best schools in the States.

722
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,593
Aren't the parents there as enthusiastic
as the parents in Daechi-dong?

723
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,305
I guess there's a coordinator
like me there, seeing how

724
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,765
she mistook me for someone else.

725
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,436
I guess so.

726
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,319
What about K?

727
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,696
How is K?

728
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,849
Aren't you going to come inside?

729
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,130
Where's K?

730
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,966
This way, sir.

731
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,268
Was she doing okay?

732
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,480
She was playing, as usual.

733
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,201
I

734
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,455
had to study in a room
full of people at home,

735
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,208
and your grandfather always
yelled at me to turn the lights off.

736
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,460
But even so, I was always the top student.

737
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,546
But what is your problem?

738
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,175
Honey, things are different
from how things were back then.

739
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,385
What's different?

740
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,595
They're just not in the right mindset.

741
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:40,102
Why are your grades even worse
than your entrance exam grades?

742
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,771
To be honest,
I can't concentrate in the study room.

743
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,565
But I made that room
so that you could concentrate.

744
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,568
We need to concentrate on our studies,
but you keep telling me to beat Seo-jun.

745
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,153
Why are you making us compete?

746
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,864
-What?
-That's what bothers me the most, too.

747
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,200
We're twin brothers that were born
on the same day and hour.

748
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,827
But you keep telling me to beat him.

749
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,286
So it makes Gi-jun...

750
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,749
seem like an enemy that I have to crush.

751
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,001
And I feel suffocated every time
I hear the clock ticking.

752
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,754
You are competitors
before you are brothers.

753
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,841
Are you responsible for Gi-jun's life?
Will you take care of him forever?

754
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:14,010
Of course, I can't do that. But we still
need to love each other as brothers.

755
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,971
You need to win first!

756
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,849
You need to survive in this world
full of competition!

757
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,935
Once you become a winner,
brotherly love...

758
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,148
will come naturally.

759
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,484
That's enough.

760
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,404
Just keep your promise.

761
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,614
I didn't promise anything.

762
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,669
Of course. There's no way
their grades will fall.

763
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,882
Then let's decide when
they get their midterm exam results.

764
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,009
If they get better grades,
I'll change the room back.

765
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,552
If not, I'll do things my way.

766
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,387
What do you say?

767
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:58,972
Sure.

768
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,142
If their grades fall,
you can do whatever you want.

769
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,269
But if their grades improve
by even just one point,

770
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,730
put the study room back to how it was.

771
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,607
Fine.

772
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,401
Just don't go back on your word later.

773
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:22,120
I'll decorate the study room
the way I want now.

774
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,915
Twins, let's go and have dinner.

775
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,002
I'll bring your dinner to your study.

776
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,170
Today,

777
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,133
I got you a spicy one.

778
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:39,554
Let's go.

779
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,360
Aren't you going to eat?

780
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,363
I heard you didn't even eat dinner
at the academy.

781
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,616
Forget it, Mom.
She'll eat once she gets hungry.

782
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,452
But then again, I'd call you
shameless if you eat

783
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,204
after the terrible grades you got.

784
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:05,997
My gosh,

785
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,666
are you glaring at me?

786
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,544
I could just guess all the answers
and still get better grades than you.

787
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,337
Ye-seo, go to your room.

788
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,797
Okay.

789
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,591
You'd better not tell anyone
that you're my sister.

790
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,301
It's embarrassing.

791
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,887
I'm more embarrassed
that you're my sister!

792
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,847
Hey.

793
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,266
How dare you talk like that
to your sister?

794
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,226
Hurry up and study.

795
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,353
You can't mess up on your finals, too.

796
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,488
I'm sorry. I'm almost there, honey.

797
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,658
Ms. Na came to congratulate
Eun-sil as well,

798
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,410
so I couldn't just leave.

799
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,169
Eun-sil's new book is really good.

800
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,755
I want to write a good book soon, too.

801
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,053
Let's hang up.

802
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,471
I'll be home soon.

803
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:25,905
Ye-bin,

804
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,824
where are you going at this hour?

805
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,493
It's none of your business.

806
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,954
Have you told your mother
where you're going?

807
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,457
-It's almost midnight.
-I said, mind your own business.

808
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,709
Kang Ye-bin.

809
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,962
The world is a scary place.
You shouldn't go out at this hour.

810
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,213
I can't let you go.

811
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,509
Ye-bin,

812
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,470
is there something wrong?

813
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,139
Please tell me.

814
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,771
You must be upset.

815
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,573
It's okay, just cry.

816
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,492
Just let it all out.

817
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,162
Mom...

818
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:19,084
She's not interested
in knowing why I shoplifted.

819
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,712
All she did was just cover up what I did.

820
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:27,258
She doesn't even ask why I shoplifted.

821
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,636
She doesn't even care.

822
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,601

823
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,201
Ye-bin...

824
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,308
Ye-bin is at my place.

825
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,195
That was delicious.

826
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,573
Ms. Lee, can I sleep here tonight?

827
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,286
Where should I sleep?

828
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,705
You shouldn't sleep right after you eat.

829
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:21,915
You should digest your food.

830
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,167
That's right.

831
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,503
Hang out with me before you go to sleep.

832
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:28,922
Come here.

833
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,930
YE-SEO'S ALBUM

834
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,848
Yeong-jae's tablet PC...

835
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,771
Ta-da,

836
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,564
I brought this to play games.

837
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:54,989
Which kinds of games
are popular these days?

838
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,992
When I was young,
simulation games were popular.

839
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,870
We don't play those
kinds of games these days.

840
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,747
We play shooting and killing games.

841
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,808
Finally, the day of revenge has come.

842
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,522
Tomorrow, I'll escape from this hell.

843
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,775
Now that I gave her SNU's
med school acceptance letter,

844
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,735
I've fulfilled my duties as a son.

845
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,363
I, Park Yeong-jae,

846
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,576
am not your son anymore.

847
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,858
What are you so mad about?

848
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,401
Yeong-jae also said

849
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:15,945
that he wanted to escape from this hell.

850
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,781
How much did you read?
Did Ms. Lee read it, too?

851
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,825
Seo-jin fired Coach Kim before.

852
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,994
Maybe it was because
she read Yeong-jae's diary.

853
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,954
How did the school president election go?

854
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,497
Tell her to go for it

855
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,334
and crush Hwang Chi-yeong's son.

856
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,377
Do you want to be my running mate
for the election?

857
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,338
I'll be the president,
and you be the vice-president.

858
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,089
You want double the money?

859
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,674
Then,

860
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,884
can you triple it?

861
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,637
Seo-jin, I've come to ask you a favor.

862
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,640
You have Ms. Kim Ju-yeong's
contact information, right?

863
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,854
