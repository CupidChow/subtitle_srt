YE-SEO'S ALBUM

2
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,424
Yeong-jae's tablet PC...

3
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,475
Finally, the day of revenge has come.

4
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,979
Tomorrow, I'll escape from this hell.

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,399
Now that I gave her SNU's
med school acceptance letter,

6
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,276
I've fulfilled my duties as a son.

7
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,111
I, Park Yeong-jae,

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,614
am not your son anymore.

9
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,159
What kind of parents raise a child
just so they can boast?

10
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,328
Don't look for me.

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,331
With this,

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,416
I'm cutting all ties with you two.

13
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,711
Gosh.

14
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,881
Is Yeong-jae completely out of his mind?

15
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,258
Yeong-jae?

16
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,928
Is he the boy that used to live here?

17
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,473
Yes, his mom took her own life.

18
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,564
Ye-bin, let's stop reading this.

19
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,899
I think that's for the best.

20
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,943
Why? It got me curious.

21
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,988
This looks like Yeong-jae's diary.

22
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,282
Would it be okay
to read someone else's diary?

23
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,579
But why does my mom have this?

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,082
Your mom had it?

25
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:10,588
By the way, I think the person
who used to live here left this behind.

26
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,674
-That's mine.
-Pardon?

27
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,259
I lent this to the previous owner.

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,014
I gave it to your mom and asked her
to pass it along to that family.

29
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,975
I figured they left it behind here.

30
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,612
Ms. Lee, did you tell on me to my mom?

31
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,573
No, I didn't tell on you.

32
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,201
I didn't want her to worry,
so I just told her you're here.

33
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,912
Still, how could you tell my mom?

34
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:45,999
Gosh.

35
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,090
You should've brought her home
the moment you saw her.

36
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,466
I texted you.

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,468
You always act like this
and complicate things.

38
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,553
What?

39
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,267
Kang Ye-bin, you brat.

40
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,371
How could you run away from home?

41
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,081
You even stole my tablet PC.

42
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,250
What are you mad about?

43
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,253
Did I ever scold you for shoplifting
or doing badly on your exam?

44
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,422
You ran away
when you should be apologizing.

45
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,798
What are you so unhappy about?

46
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,175
Yeong-jae also said it.

47
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,930
He wanted to escape from this hell.

48
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,230
How much did you read?

49
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,232
Did Ms. Lee also read it?

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,361
We only read his last journal.

51
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,279
Ms. Lee stopped me from reading more.

52
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,618
You read all of it, didn't you?

53
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,536
Why do you think he did such a thing?

54
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,791
Well, that's...

55
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,795
It's the same as how you relieved stress
at the convenience store.

56
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Yeong-jae must have felt stressed too.

57
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,800
But instead of doing
what you did, he just wrote

58
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,551
whatever that came to his mind.

59
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,347
He was just relieving his stress?

60
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,102
Even when his mom died?

61
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,504
You know how much Yeong-jae's mom
loved Yeong-jae, right?

62
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,506
Well, yes.

63
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,717
Imagine how hurt she must have been

64
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,262
when she found out that her precious son
wanted to cut ties with his parents

65
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,556
and was planning
on taking revenge on them.

66
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:10,059
I was also very hurt
when I read Yeong-jae's journal.

67
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,398
But why did Yeong-jae behave like that?

68
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:25,408
You can never tell anyone
what I'm about to tell you.

69
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,454
People can't ever find out
about this, for Yeong-jae's sake.

70
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,833
To be honest,

71
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,961
Yeong-jae was very sick.

72
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,881
-Yeong-jae, look at me. Are you okay?
-When he was in ninth grade,

73
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,592
he started suffering
from a mental illness.

74
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,302
Please. Please help me.

75
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,763
-Help me.
-Yeong-jae, look at me.

76
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,349
Look at me. Yeong-jae! Yeong-jae.

77
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,643
He became better
after he got treated for a year.

78
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,772
But he had a relapse
after he was done with his CSATs.

79
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,940
That's why he wrote
all that stuff in his journal.

80
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,526
Really?

81
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,238
But that doesn't explain why his mom died.

82
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,325
Maybe she was really upset.

83
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,287
I also feel like I want to die
every time you behave like this.

84
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,955
So imagine how bad
it must have been for her.

85
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,168
Gosh.

86
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,629
Ye-bin, life is hard, right?

87
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,091
I know it's hard too.

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,844
But to me, your future
is a lot more important

89
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,764
than what's going on right now.

90
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,142
That's why I always nag at you
to study hard.

91
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,520
Do you understand?

92
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,190
Yes, I know what you mean.

93
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,359
But it's just so suffocating.

94
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,659
You didn't want to learn the violin,
art, or horseback riding.

95
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,744
And if you also hate studying
on top of that,

96
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,788
what are you going to become
in the future?

97
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,792
Your dad and I can't take care of you
when you're all grown-up, right?

98
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,505
Are you going
to ask your sister for money?

99
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,506
No.

100
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,971
Okay, fine. I'll study. I will.

101
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,142
Promise me

102
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,936
that you'll never run away
from home again.

103
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,189
You should talk things out with me
regardless of how upset you may be.

104
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,941
Promise me that.

105
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,751
PARK YEONG-JAE

106
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,379
DELETE

107
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,756
DELETE

108
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,656
REVENGE, HELL, SOURCE OF PRIDE,
THE RIGHT TO BE A PARENT

109
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,330
What kind of parents raises
a child just so they can boast?

110
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,165
Don't look for me.

111
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,334
With this,

112
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,671
I'm cutting all ties with you two.

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,320
Get out of here. Go!

114
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,865
Don't ever come back again.

115
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,659
Do you understand?

116
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,897
Have you gone mad? Are you crazy?

117
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,441
What's wrong with you?
Why are you acting so unusual?

118
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,776
Bring back Ga-eul.

119
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,445
Who are you to kick her out?
You have no right!

120
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,656
She's six years older than you.

121
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,408
She's our housekeeper.

122
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,951
She's uneducated and didn't know better,

123
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,661
but how could I let that slut
stay in my house?

124
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,581
How many times do I need to tell you that
I can't live in this house without her?

125
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,001
Why can't you live without her?
What's so great about her?

126
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
Do you even know how I feel?

127
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,716
You stand with your arms crossed
and ask me to get a perfect score!

128
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,885
All you want is a perfect score,
so how would you know how I feel?

129
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,389
How dare you behave this way?

130
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,517
You shouldn't get involved.
I'll stop him. I'll do it.

131
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,811
I'm too embarrassed to even live!

132
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,064
I can't believe you got involved
with a slut like that.

133
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,400
What are you going to do
with a lowlife like her?

134
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,068
Are you going to marry her or what?

135
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,198
"Lowlife"?

136
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,327
If someone's uneducated and poor,
do they need to be called lowlife?

137
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,579
You people are the lowlifes
for looking down on people

138
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,913
who didn't graduate from SNU.

139
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,874
What?

140
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,043
"You people"?

141
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,962
You punk, have you gone crazy?

142
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,714
I told you to stay out of it!

143
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,549
You are so obsessed with SNU's med school.

144
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,761
You don't care what happens to me
or how difficult things are for me.

145
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,387
It doesn't matter as long as
I get into SNU?

146
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,223
Forget it if you're not smart
or competent enough.

147
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,769
I, your grandfather, and all of
your cousins went there, so why can't you?

148
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,480
Where in the world
did this idiot come from?

149
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,191
You are nothing if I just take you out
of our family tree!

150
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,153
Fine, go ahead. Take me out of it.

151
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,364
Go ahead! Do it!

152
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,076
I no longer want to live
in this house anyway.

153
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,829
What?

154
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,583
You don't want to live here?

155
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,211
Follow me.

156
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,550
Yeong-jae!

157
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,595
Why are you being like this?

158
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,306
Why are you throwing a fit
over that worthless slut?

159
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,975
Your finals start in two days.

160
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,895
What if you fail to get
into a specialized high school?

161
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,163
Honey!

162
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,084
Move. I'm going to teach
that punk a lesson today.

163
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,546
Why are you making things worse?
You should try to calm him down.

164
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,548
This is all because of Ga-eul.

165
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,676
We kicked her out,
so things will get better with time.

166
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,886
Move.

167
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,097
Honey, no. Honey. Yeong-jae!

168
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
Kneel.

169
00:12:58,819 --> 00:12:59,987
I said, kneel.

170
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:05,618
Honey, please put that gun away.

171
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,536
Please put the gun away.

172
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,747
How could you disappoint me like this?

173
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,292
I can't believe
that idiotic loser is my son.

174
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,586
Yeong-jae.

175
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,296
You should get on your knees first.

176
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,008
Get on your knees and apologize. Hurry up.

177
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,176
Kneel!

178
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,471
I'd rather live without a son like you.

179
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,307
Are you crazy?

180
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,734
Yeong-jae!

181
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,194
Yeong-jae.

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,196
Yeong-jae, look at me.

183
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,032
Yeong-jae, look at me. Are you okay?

184
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,700
Mom.

185
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,078
Please. Please help me.

186
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,664
-Help me.
-Yeong-jae, look at me.

187
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,165
-Look at me.
-Save me.

188
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,667
Yeong-jae. Yeong-jae!

189
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,585
Yeong-jae, wake up.

190
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,087
Yeong-jae. Yeong-jae.

191
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,130
Yeong-jae, wake up.

192
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,215
Yeong-jae!

193
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,962
I thought Yeong-jae had nothing
to do with their problem.

194
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,716
What do you think
wrecked their relationship so badly?

195
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,760
Didn't you say

196
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,429
Yeong-jae was coached for three years?

197
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,475
Coach Kim might know something.

198
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,893
Seo-jin

199
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,395
fired Ms. Kim as a coach once.

200
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,649
Maybe that's because
she read Yeong-jae's diary.

201
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,277
That's possible.

202
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,406
The coach could've influenced
Yeong-jae a lot.

203
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,034
The diary could've spooked her.

204
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,119
Then...

205
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,748
Coach Kim would've known
Yeong-jae wanted revenge, right?

206
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,334
-What are they talking--
-She would have.

207
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,461
Though I doubt

208
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,880
that a teacher
would've kept quiet knowingly.

209
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,884
Su-im.

210
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,513
Can we talk?

211
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,868
What are you blabbing about?

212
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,414
Coach Kim had nothing to do
with Yeong-jae's diary.

213
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,581
Don't be mistaken.

214
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,917
It's incredibly hard to get
into SNU's med school.

215
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,088
Yeong-jae got in with the sole purpose
of getting revenge.

216
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,340
Are you saying his coach didn't know that?

217
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,550
She didn't.

218
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,510
His parents knew nothing.

219
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,262
How could a coach know?

220
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,265
Fine, let's say she didn't know.

221
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,852
It's a fact that
Yeong-jae's mother is dead.

222
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,562
She hired a professional coach

223
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,356
for three years
to get him into medical school.

224
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,526
He got in, then tried to leave his family.

225
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
I can't stop thinking

226
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,573
that Coach Kim Ju-yeong
is behind all of this.

227
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,159
-Don't you think so?
-Don't be mistaken.

228
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,078
Yeong-jae's parents are the ones
that caused the tragedy.

229
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,999
They wanted a third-generation doctor
and ignored his well-being,

230
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,085
and that was the reason
behind this tragedy.

231
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,550
Why did you...

232
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,510
fire that coach

233
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,971
shortly after you hired her?

234
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,891
Were you scared by what you read?

235
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,100
Weren't you?

236
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,937
You knew the coach
had influenced Yeong-jae.

237
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,524
Not at all.

238
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,318
Then I'd have fired her for good.

239
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,819
That's why you fired her,

240
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,821
but then your greed got the better of you.

241
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,491
Because she can guarantee
a spot in SNU's med school--

242
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,450
You...

243
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,953
So what?

244
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,830
What does that have to do with you?

245
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,791
Coach Kim doesn't tutor U-ju.

246
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,460
She tutors my daughter.
Why is this your business?

247
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,212
I'm worried about you.

248
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,882
Your greed to make your daughter a doctor
is making you ignore--

249
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,510
I should really rip your jaw open.

250
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,595
How dare you lecture me?

251
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,055
Hey.

252
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,642
Don't worry about me,
and raise your own kid right.

253
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,151
Isn't she a crazy bitch?

254
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,780
What did she teach Yeong-jae
for three years that gave him that idea?

255
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,825
Shouldn't she have
at least told Myeong-ju?

256
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,285
What a heartless bitch.

257
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,080
We also tried to hire her
to teach our kids.

258
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,082
The thought scares me.

259
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,542
It's not just scary!

260
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,710
I wanted to hire her three years from now.

261
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,338
Seo-jin!

262
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,346
-Seo-jin, let's talk.
-Later.

263
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,891
I didn't get your logic
about the convenience store.

264
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,687
It was obviously theft,
but you called it a stress-reliever.

265
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,063
Fine.

266
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,357
Some moms go that far to brag

267
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,401
about their kid being in med school.

268
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,362
I didn't say a word
because I thought you had it figured out.

269
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,405
But what?

270
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,159
You were closer to Myeong-ju
than any of us.

271
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,162
That coach drove Myeong-ju to death
and ruined Yeong-jae's life.

272
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,914
-So what?
-"So what?"

273
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,333
How could you let that woman coach Ye-seo?

274
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,752
You should grab her by the hair
and drag her around,

275
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
but instead, you're praising her.

276
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,840
You really disgust me sometimes.

277
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,512
Didn't you say I was making a mistake
for firing her

278
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,139
because she might not coach your son?

279
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,141
That was when I didn't know the story.

280
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,101
Getting into a good school is important,

281
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,687
but how can you
let a family-breaker near your kid?

282
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,447
You said you'd do anything I told you to.

283
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,283
Did you ever see me talk back
to Myeong-ju?

284
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,493
I didn't even step on her shadow.

285
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,912
How dare you talk back to me?

286
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,374
-I'm afraid you'll pay dearly for this.
-Me?

287
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,502
I'll pay dearly for this?

288
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,717
Stop with your pointless worrying
and don't cross the line.

289
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,553
I've noticed that you sometimes
tend to cross the line.

290
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,102
Is she the 38th parallel?
Why can't I cross over?

291
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,812
How annoying.

292
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,483
Can I really trust and follow her?

293
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,376
Why did you...

294
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,419
fire that coach

295
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,630
shortly after you hired her?

296
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,591
Were you scared by what you read?

297
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,676
Weren't you?

298
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,471
You knew the coach
had influenced Yeong-jae.

299
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,267
How could you let that woman coach Ye-seo?

300
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,060
Getting into a good school is important,

301
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,230
but how can you
let a family-breaker near your kid?

302
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,816
No.

303
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,359
There's no problem.

304
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,403
Ye-seo is

305
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,196
not like Yeong-jae.

306
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,323
She's definitely different.

307
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,289
In the mock English exam,
the hard questions that split

308
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,457
the good students
from the best were much more difficult.

309
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,459
Still, Ye-seo got full marks.

310
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,253
She's so good at English,

311
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,047
it's almost a pity
the exam's an absolute evaluation.

312
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,632
She got full marks in math too.

313
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,427
That's because
she has the basic definitions down pat.

314
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,595
Problems that take
other students ten minutes,

315
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,848
Ye-seo solves in less than five.

316
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,184
She got full marks in every other subject,

317
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,936
but the problem is Korean literature.

318
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,400
She never got any
of the difficult questions wrong.

319
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,111
Why does she keep messing up
on a two-point question

320
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,196
that everyone else gets right?

321
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,907
Ye-seo's grammar
and vocabulary are perfect,

322
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,494
but she often lets her own opinion
cloud her judgment in the exam.

323
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,207
You said the same thing
after the mid-term exam.

324
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,336
I apologize.
We'll get full marks next time.

325
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,712
And her extra-curricular activities?

326
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,381
Last month, she visited Orthopedics
at Junam University hospital.

327
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,632
She observed a surgery

328
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,384
and took a lecture

329
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,219
on how to write a paper in medicine.

330
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,263
This month she will visit

331
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,432
Neurosurgery and the CT scan theater.

332
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,643
She also volunteers every weekend
at a nursing home.

333
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,813
Of course, she hands in
regular written reports.

334
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,484
Thanks to Mr. Jo,
I've been winning all the awards.

335
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,569
I won the grand prize
in the book report contest.

336
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,404
I also won gold
at the Young Scholars' Conference.

337
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,656
The results from the science competition
aren't out yet,

338
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,408
but I'm sure I'll win again.

339
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,412
We'll start preparing
for the final exams tomorrow.

340
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,915
I want you all to submit
a study plan for each subject.

341
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,209
And needless to say,
your goal should be...

342
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,461
getting perfect scores.

343
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,713
If you make one more mistake...

344
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,134
Three strikes and you're out.

345
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,762
Please don't worry, sir.

346
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,472
It was just a mistake.

347
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,766
I'll be sure to get perfect scores
next time.

348
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,771
Are you embarrassed in front of Ye-seo?

349
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,524
Having Ye-seo sit in

350
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,818
every time we analyze
her exam results is a little--

351
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,361
Don't kid yourselves.

352
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,738
You're mere trainers, not teachers.

353
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,659
No student respects you as teachers,

354
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,746
and no parent respects you
as their children's teachers.

355
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,542
Only the outcome...

356
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,878
can prove your value.

357
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,298
Do you all understand?

358
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,259
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

359
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,263
Ye-seo, let's go to the meditation room.

360
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,477
You got the highest score
on both the midterms and the mock test.

361
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,980
Are you satisfied?

362
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,192
Of course, I've never missed out
on being the top student.

363
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,193
That's not true.

364
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,988
Hye-na beat you this time.

365
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,243
I came in first place
and Hye-na came in second.

366
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,328
Right, you did come in first place.

367
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,957
You lost a two-point question,
whereas she lost a three-point one.

368
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,794
However, you had
the overwhelming advantage over her.

369
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,422
The teachers went over the questions
from the past years

370
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,299
as well as all the expected questions.

371
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,678
We also did countless exam simulations.

372
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,979
You should've gotten perfect scores.

373
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,399
You beat her only by one point,

374
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,276
yet you smile?

375
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,862
Are you satisfied?

376
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,542
Even though she lost to you by one point,

377
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,253
she has more independence, creativity,

378
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,672
better leadership skills, and friends.

379
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,424
In every aspect...

380
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,760
she surpasses you.

381
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,766
I'm certain that she'll become
the school president.

382
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,561
Your mom is doing everything
in her power to support you,

383
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,105
but her mom is bedridden in hospital.

384
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,109
She's looking after her mom.

385
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,780
Who'd win if you two got to compete
in the same environment?

386
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,464
Hye-na would.

387
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,759
I guarantee that you'd lose.

388
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,829
You're home, sweetheart.

389
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,331
What's wrong? Did something happen?

390
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,583
I don't know. I'm so annoyed.
Coach Kim is weird.

391
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,502
She told me to give up
on being the school president.

392
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,546
Who's Kim Ju-yeong?

393
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:30,922
Her homeroom teacher?

394
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,507
No, an instructor at her academy.

395
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,925
Then take her advice.

396
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,845
She's dissuading you from it
to make sure you're not distracted.

397
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,098
Honey, things are different these days.

398
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,808
What's so different?

399
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,560
Don't even think about helping her

400
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,187
get elected just so you can
get more involved in school affairs.

401
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,981
And you, just study hard.

402
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:51,568
You don't even have time to sleep.
School president? Forget it.

403
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,902
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

404
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,657
That rude brat.
You don't deserve to be elected.

405
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,909
Having one or two more achievements

406
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,620
on her student record can make
or break her college admission.

407
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,040
Experience as school president
is considered

408
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,958
the most basic extracurricular activity.

409
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,209
You don't know anything.

410
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,796
Goodness.

411
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,716
Why do extracurricular activities matter?

412
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,176
She just has to get good grades.

413
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,554
Why does it have to be so complicated?

414
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,105
Why did she tell you to give up on it?

415
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,359
Coach Kim is so weird.

416
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,986
She said Hye-na will be elected.
That Kim Hye-na.

417
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,905
Without even trying?

418
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,616
Gosh, she made a mistake.

419
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,369
Right, Mom? I'm baffled.

420
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,037
How does she know
when I haven't even tried?

421
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,205
Exactly.

422
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,209
By the way, do you have a running mate?

423
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:52,962
Well...

424
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,090
not yet.

425
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,886
I heard U-ju is very popular at school.

426
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,888
How about U-ju?

427
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,016
Running with U-ju will
increase your chances of getting elected.

428
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,020
Well...

429
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,856
I'll ask him.

430
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,363
Honey!

431
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,907
Honey, don't you have to go to work?

432
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,283
Jin Jin.

433
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,661
Honey, what's wrong?

434
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,871
Jin Jin.

435
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,248
What's wrong, Dad?

436
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,793
-Help me put my pants on.
-What?

437
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,587
I can't bend down.
I have a shooting pain down my legs.

438
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,841
Oh, my goodness.
So the injection isn't helping?

439
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,676
Dad, does it hurt a lot?

440
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,971
Don't worry, son. I won't die.

441
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,516
Goodness, you're such a wimp
just like your dad.

442
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,894
Su-han, he'll be fine
after he gets his surgery.

443
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,856
Dad, I heard that U-ju's dad
is a great surgeon.

444
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,858
Can't you get him to do your surgery?

445
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,154
Son, that simply won't happen.

446
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,906
-Why not?
-I'm a professor of orthopedics.

447
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,659
How could I get surgery
from a professor of neurosurgery?

448
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,704
Why not? Why can't you?

449
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:11,166
Every patient has the right
to get surgery from a good surgeon.

450
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,127
Stop spewing nonsense.
If Dr. Kang finds out--

451
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,253
You're a doctor.

452
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,173
You'll go into that operating room
just to not get on his bad side?

453
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,550
Do you want to end up like Dr. Song?

454
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,719
He had to get surgery three times.

455
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,805
Gosh, what should I do?

456
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,683
What do you think?
You can't grovel at his feet all the time.

457
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,729
It's your body. Your health, okay?

458
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,230
Watch it. My back.

459
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,068
Gosh, what do we do?
You and your back. My gosh, honey.

460
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,029
You need to get surgery.

461
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,447
This part is sticking out, see?

462
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,949
It's one of the symptoms of fibromyalgia.

463
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,286
If injections aren't helping
even after two months, you need surgery.

464
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,622
When should we do it?

465
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,625
Dr. Kang, you have a lot of operations
scheduled for this week.

466
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,043
You have five each day.

467
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,669
Doing one more won't kill me.

468
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,755
The other day,
I operated on seven patients.

469
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,924
I asked you when you want to get it.

470
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:01,966
Sorry?

471
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,593
Well.

472
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,346
I have my own schedule too, you know.

473
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,181
I have appointments
with my patients as well.

474
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,017
There's no need to rush,
so just let me know when's good for you.

475
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,101
Or...

476
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,522
we can get it done quickly
during our lunch break.

477
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,275
"Quickly"?

478
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,456
He's not in a good condition.

479
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,054
What did Dr. Kang say?
Did he say he'd do your surgery?

480
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,892
Why don't you go
and speak with Chief Hwang?

481
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,811
I heard he's an amazing surgeon.

482
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,272
All his patients praise him highly.

483
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,774
You idiot, have you lost your mind?

484
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,235
I'm an orthopedic specialist.
What? Go speak with who?

485
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,362
Gosh, you're clueless.

486
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,239
Is there a law that states

487
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,825
orthopedic specialists can't be treated
by other specialists?

488
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,953
Every patient should do his research
and find the best surgeon.

489
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,288
Hey!

490
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,833
You punk, watch your mouth.

491
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,961
How dare you compare such a skilled
spine specialist to Hwang Chi-yeong?

492
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,715
Then get it from that skilled specialist.
Why are you so scared?

493
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,466
"Scared"?

494
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,803
Who's scared?

495
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,889
Come here, you punk. Come here!

496
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,104
-Hey, gosh.
-Be careful.

497
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,105
The chair.

498
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,199
I'm dizzy.

499
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,371
I'll check it again.

500
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,305
Dr. Woo, are you in pain?

501
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,599
Oh, no.

502
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:15,975
Not at all.

503
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,561
I'm completely fine.

504
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,689
You don't seem fine. You're limping.

505
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,399
I just

506
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,360
drank too much last night.

507
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,113
I tend to limp a little
when I drink a lot.

508
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,282
When did the pain in your leg begin?

509
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,284
I told you it's from drinking.

510
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,664
I said I'm fine.

511
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,833
That's a relief.

512
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,716
I said I'm okay.
You really should stop asking!

513
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,889
That hurts.

514
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,354
If it's this bad,
your back must have hurt a lot.

515
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,316
Dr. Kang suggested conservative treatment,
so I took medicine and even got six shots.

516
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,570
Herniated disks

517
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,739
can cause back pain,

518
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,075
but 80 percent of patients

519
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,077
are healed naturally in one or two months.

520
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,122
However, if the pain is still severe
even after you got the shots,

521
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,082
I think it'd be better for you
to get surgery.

522
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,420
How am I going to get surgery?

523
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,258
A couple of years ago,

524
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,927
I got surgery on my left eye
because of retinal detachment.

525
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,054
And once I became a patient myself,

526
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,390
I learned that it's very important
to trust your doctor.

527
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,476
You should trust Dr. Kang and get surgery.

528
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,438
You're right.

529
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,733
The most important thing is
to trust your doctor. That's very true.

530
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,193
It's really important. It really is.

531
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,947
But you perform...

532
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,616
endoscopic surgeries, don't you?

533
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,536
I heard your incisions are only 7mm big.

534
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,914
Dr. Kang's incisions
are probably only 2 to 3cm big.

535
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,000
But still,

536
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:08,337
there's a huge difference
between 7mm and 3cm.

537
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,007
Don't worry.

538
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,260
People think using high-tech equipment
such as lasers

539
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,056
and endoscopes for herniated disk
surgeries will be safer.

540
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,724
But that's all a misunderstanding.

541
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:25,271
But you're a veteran when it comes
to minimally invasive surgery.

542
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,444
Perhaps...

543
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,405
do you want me to...

544
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,788
No, that's not it. Gosh, no.

545
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,165
I'm just saying.

546
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,251
I should get my surgery done
by Dr. Kang, of course.

547
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,421
Dr. Kang is a skilled spine doctor.

548
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,053
Whatever you decide to do,
just think about your health first.

549
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,638
That's what's most important.

550
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,350
This tea is good for pain relief.

551
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,340
She's turned it into a playroom.

552
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,633
A playroom.

553
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,489
Where did she put my pyramid?

554
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,409
Where did you put my pyramid?

555
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,412
I put it in your study

556
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,372
since it belongs to you.

557
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,666
Why did you put it in my study?

558
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,711
I put it there so that the kids could be
motivated by it!

559
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,964
Take a seat.

560
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,799
It's time for dinner.

561
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,906
Are you done protesting...

562
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,325
with cup noodles?

563
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,412
I tore down that soundproof room
without discussing it with you first.

564
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,747
I recorded what you said

565
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,250
and made you lose your authority
as a father. That's my fault.

566
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,253
I'd like to apologize sincerely,
so please sit down.

567
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,731
You should stop...

568
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,444
with the weekly living expenses, honey.

569
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,697
What made you suddenly change your mind?

570
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,784
You seemed pretty determined to feed me

571
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,662
cup noodles every day
throughout the entire year.

572
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,915
The only bad thing
about receiving weekly living expenses

573
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,166
is that it's annoying.

574
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:37,255
But making you eat cup noodles for every
meal is directly connected to your health.

575
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,175
I'm sure it must be exhausting to
do lectures and teach the twins at home.

576
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,011
I realized that it was wrong of me.

577
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,226
Gosh, it took you quite a while
to realize that.

578
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,811
That's your problem.

579
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,399
You're always one step too late.

580
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,654
You don't know

581
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,491
why Yeong-jae's mom made
such an extreme decision, do you?

582
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,299
See you.

583
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,552
Ye-bin. Su-han.

584
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,222
Ms. Lee.

585
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,310
You guys came across my mind
while I was nearby doing some research.

586
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,188
Ye-bin, you were upset with me,
weren't you?

587
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,232
I was a little upset at the time.

588
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,360
But come to think of it,
you had no choice but to do that.

589
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,781
Ye-bin, you have such a big heart.

590
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,826
-What's she talking about?
-You don't need to know, you punk.

591
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,663
Ms. Lee, did you start
gathering information?

592
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,206
Yes.

593
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,335
There's something I want to write about,
so I'm going to start writing.

594
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,759
You guys both know Yeong-jae, don't you?

595
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,803
Were you guys close to him?

596
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,806
He used to be really nice to us.
He's a good singer as well.

597
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,892
Anyway, he's a great guy.

598
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,643
Do you remember

599
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,146
-Yeong-jae's favorite song?
-"The Island Boy"?

600
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,692
The atmosphere turned really awkward
every time he whistled that song.

601
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,444
Why? I liked it.

602
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,905
I also liked Ga-eul's version of the song.

603
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,407
Do you want a refill?

604
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,791
Ga-eul?

605
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,542
Who's Ga-eul?

606
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,503
She's the daughter
of the in-house housekeeper

607
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,921
that used to live at Yeong-jae's.

608
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,090
She was really close to Yeong-jae.

609
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,550
So I'm sure he was pretty shocked
when she suddenly disappeared.

610
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,719
Really?

611
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,722
Where do you think he is,
and what do you think he's doing?

612
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,725
Haven't you tried calling him?

613
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,269
He doesn't answer my calls
and ignores my texts.

614
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,316
My gosh.

615
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,069
Do you think he contacted that teacher?

616
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,530
What teacher?

617
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,991
He told me she's the only person
that he can actually talk to.

618
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,288
That kind of disaster only happened
because they just paid Coach Kim

619
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,458
and trusted her way too much
with their son.

620
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,628
Am I the same as Yeong-jae's dad,
who was indifferent about his education?

621
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,754
Am I?

622
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,965
Being overly interested is also a problem.

623
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm worried that you and the kids
might end up cutting ties

624
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,554
like Yeong-jae and his parents
as you teach them.

625
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,347
So what exactly is your point?

626
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,433
Are you telling me
to stop caring about their education?

627
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,686
No, I'm just suggesting that
you take a different approach.

628
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,772
They say parents used to
teach their neighbor's kids

629
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,816
instead of their own

630
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,360
because their relationship
with their children might get ruined

631
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,279
if they keep pressuring their kids.

632
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,947
Even if...

633
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,701
my kids end up hating me
and want to get revenge later on,

634
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,411
once they get into SNU,

635
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,083
I'm sure they'll end up thanking me
later on in their lives.

636
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,460
Honey,

637
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,129
U-ju didn't even make it
to the top 20 on his exams.

638
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:08,174
But his parents didn't say anything,
and he came in third on his mock test.

639
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,468
-There's no use in parents--
-U-ju?

640
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,428
He was gifted with good genes.

641
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,388
He was born smart.

642
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,764
Look at Se-ri.

643
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,726
Have you ever seen me teach her
the way I teach our twins?

644
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,438
I'd leave them be if they took after me.

645
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,441
But look at Gi-jun's and Seo-jun's grades.

646
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,112
I wonder who they take after
to barely get Level Two in school.

647
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,574
How can I just leave them be
when they were born stupid?

648
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,368
I need to pressure them
and squeeze more out of them.

649
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,539
Honey, can you please be more tenacious?

650
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,708
Parents need to be strong-minded

651
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,461
in order to help their kids
lead successful lives.

652
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,738
I'm worried that you and the kids
might end up cutting ties

653
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,951
like Yeong-jae and his parents
as you teach them.

654
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,683
What's weird?

655
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,727
I told you something was off when that
convenience store thing happened.

656
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,854
It was so obvious. That feels nice.

657
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,855
Right?

658
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,693
Seo-jin's nothing compared to Myeong-ju.

659
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,570
She thinks she can control

660
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,780
the woman who got Myeong-ju killed.

661
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,366
She doesn't stand a chance.
I bet this will all backfire.

662
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,367
So what?

663
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,536
Are you switching sides now?

664
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,579
It depends.

665
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,957
If the timing is right,
I'll switch over quickly.

666
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,459
Why stay on a train
that might go off the rails?

667
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,544
That's stupid.

668
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,754
Jin Jin.

669
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,091
Please don't forget just one thing.

670
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,094
Kang Jun-sang lords over me.

671
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,722
He might crush me to death.

672
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,557
You're so faint-hearted.

673
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,934
-You have no guts.
-Hey.

674
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,394
Why are you so scared?

675
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:29,106
I'll tell you this again.
Don't go to Jun-sang for your surgery.

676
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,066
You got that?

677
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,027
I got it.

678
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,873
-There's a lot. I should go.
-Get going.

679
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,207
The Medics.

680
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,210
Take this with you.

681
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,047
-My gosh.
-Hey.

682
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,716
Thanks.

683
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,597
Hey. I need to ask...

684
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,808
a difficult question.

685
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,853
-What is it?
-What is it?

686
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,022
There are two doctors.

687
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,399
One is Doctor A,

688
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,610
and the other is Doctor A+.

689
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,738
Doctor A looks down on you
like you're nothing.

690
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,616
Doctor A+ is an amazingly skilled surgeon

691
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,494
and also manages to comfort his patients.

692
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:28,165
If you needed to get surgery,
who would you go to?

693
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,166
I'll choose Chief Hwang.

694
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,334
You brat, do you want to die?

695
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,461
Who said A+ was Chief Hwang?

696
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,546
Did I say I wanted to go to Chief Hwang?

697
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,342
Do you think I'm doing this
because I want him to do my surgery?

698
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,468
Hey.

699
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,721
Even if Chief Kang
looks at us like we're chewed gum,

700
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,890
we shouldn't be like that.

701
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,392
We must be loyal.

702
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,769
How can I go to Chief Hwang?

703
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,854
What if word gets out?

704
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,399
What would our department look like?

705
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,441
A mess.

706
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,402
Which idiot just said...

707
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,532
Dr. Kang.

708
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,827
Do you want Chief Hwang to operate on you?

709
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,621
No, that's nonsense. I wouldn't dare.

710
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,623
I heard he's very skilled.

711
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:13,168
The Rehabilitation Department
can't praise him enough.

712
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,463
His patients' prognoses are so good
that their jobs are made easier.

713
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,465
Go to him.

714
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,260
It's not like that.

715
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,637
I have no intention of going to him,

716
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,639
but Chief Hwang keeps sweet-talking me.

717
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,143
He sweet-talked you?

718
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,438
Hwang Chi-yeong sweet-talked you?

719
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,316
I deserve to die, Dr. Kang.

720
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,652
You don't. Well done.

721
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,656
Good luck with your surgery.

722
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,247
Dr. Kang.

723
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,292
Dr. Kang.

724
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,046
Hwang Chi-yeong, you scumbag.

725
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,883
You enticed one of my staff?

726
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,721
He dared to step up to the plate?

727
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,644
That's what I mean.

728
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,939
Dr. Kang, join us.

729
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,157
Dr. Kang.

730
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,366
Dr. Kang...

731
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,079
Hello.

732
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,962
JUNAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

733
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,549
I feel like I have a white tiger
on my right and blue dragon on my left.

734
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,469
I feel so reassured to have

735
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,346
two great doctors by my side.

736
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,473
You flatter me.

737
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,641
Thank you, sir.

738
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,393
We only just opened the spine center.

739
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,563
Dr. Kang, help out as much
as you can. Okay?

740
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,107
Yes.

741
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,400
Of course.

742
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,153
Dr. Hwang, isn't your son running

743
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,947
for the school president?

744
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,825
He can't without a running mate,
so he's busy looking for a partner.

745
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,745
Whatever it may be,
it's best to have a title.

746
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:14,164
The position makes the person, you know.

747
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,421
When Dr. Kang refused
to be the chief of the new center,

748
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,675
I was so disheartened.

749
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,136
Oh, right.

750
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,349
Didn't you say your daughter
goes to the same school as his son?

751
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,519
Yes. The prestigious Shin A High School.

752
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,312
She's the first in her...

753
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,149
In her...

754
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,069
In her year. Say it, you fool.

755
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,992
My goodness.

756
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,662
Are you okay, Dr. Woo?

757
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,956
You should be careful prior to surgery.

758
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,462
What? "Prior to surgery"?

759
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,923
He said that for me to hear, didn't he?

760
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,177
He says you should be careful
prior to surgery.

761
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,143
Poor me.

762
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,394
Dr. Kang.

763
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,443
Don't be mistaken.

764
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,154
Yeong-jae's parents are the ones
that brought about the tragedy.

765
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,865
It was Yeong-jae's parents?

766
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,869
He told me she was the only person
that he could actually talk to.

767
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,204
Was it because of the coach?

768
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,492
This was...

769
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,995
a gift Myeong-ju gave to me
shortly before she died.

770
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,581
My husband told me to throw it away,

771
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,583
so I had to leave it here.

772
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,169
How do you think a suicidal mom felt

773
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,255
when she bought a mother-and-child statue?

774
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,927
It breaks my heart.

775
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:01,206
WHO KILLED THAT WOMAN?

776
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,007
I know you desperately want
to improve your student record,

777
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,884
but you're really trying hard.

778
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,679
You study, nurse your sick mom.

779
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,140
And now you want
to become the school president too?

780
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,933
You're getting quite greedy.

781
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,226
Mr. Oh.

782
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,353
It's not greed.

783
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,565
I want to run
because there's something I want to do.

784
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,607
I see.

785
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,484
What do you want to do?

786
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,779
Abolish the elite class.

787
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:33,989
What?

788
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,702
You could get into real trouble for that.

789
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,372
We don't have an elite class.

790
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,124
It's called the intensive reading class,

791
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,876
but you know it's an elite class.

792
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:50,255
You put the smart kids
with nice backgrounds in the elite class.

793
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,466
You favor those kids
and give awards and whatnot.

794
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,426
Do you think the kids don't know?

795
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,303
My gosh.

796
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,181
You tip them off
about upcoming school competitions

797
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,932
and give them the awards.

798
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,393
Should the others just play second fiddle?

799
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,313
High schools may have become factories
churning out university students,

800
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,648
but I can't stand teachers
breaking the rules

801
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,525
so blatantly.

802
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,323
Ms. Kim, will you really
do nothing about her?

803
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,492
-What should I do then?
-What?

804
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,454
Should I blatantly break the rules
so she can't run for the election?

805
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,581
Hye-na.

806
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:25,916
You may leave.

807
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,882
Because you side with her like that,

808
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,718
that rude girl
doesn't even know her place!

809
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,597
U-ju, will you be my running mate?

810
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,477
Ye-seo. Kang Ye-se. Is he a big deal?

811
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,563
Don't be intimidated.
You can do it. Let's go.

812
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,283
Hwang U-ju!

813
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,871
Do you want to be my running mate
for the election?

814
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,790
I'll be the president,
and you can be vice-president.

815
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,796
Of course,

816
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,465
you can run for president if you'd like.

817
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,883
I can run for vice-president.

818
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,093
I'm sorry.

819
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,928
I have someone I want to run with.

820
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,764
I hope you do well in the election.

821
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,311
Hye-na!

822
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,699
How's the school president election going?

823
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,075
Is Ye-seo running for it?

824
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,036
Why do you ask?

825
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,956
-I'll take care of it, so just--
-Tell her to do it.

826
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,126
What?

827
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,836
Tell her to do it

828
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,672
and crush Hwang Chi-yeong's son.

829
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,176
Tell her she must trample all over him
and get elected no matter what.

830
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,054
What's the matter? Did something happen?

831
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,432
That scumbag.

832
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,227
Does he think I'm a big joke or what?

833
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,147
He snatched that chief position.

834
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:16,192
And now, he's stepping up
to do the surgery.

835
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,697
What do you mean
he's stepping up for the surgery?

836
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,289
Do I really have to say this?

837
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,001
You know why I asked to meet up, right?

838
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,795
I'm not sure. How would I know

839
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,756
if you don't tell me?

840
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,093
Don't you have something to say to me?

841
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,305
Then I'll think whatever I want.

842
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:50,185
Wait, did you want to see me
because of my husband's surgery?

843
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:58,693
I know that Dr. Kang thinks
of Yang-u as his brother.

844
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,779
I'm also aware that Yang-u getting surgery

845
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,739
from Chief Hwang would make him look bad.

846
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:09,245
But let's say Dr. Kang
needs surgery on his shoulder.

847
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,456
Would he get it from Yang-u
no matter what?

848
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,500
Without asking around
to find the best surgeon?

849
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,045
These days, patients look around
for the best doctor.

850
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,797
Just accept it, okay?

851
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,764
This is going to make me sound crude,
so I wasn't going to say it.

852
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,059
You know that my mother-in-law
and the chairman's wife

853
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,061
do volunteer work together, right?

854
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,479
I do, of course.

855
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,357
I also know that your father-in-law
was the chairman's doctor.

856
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,775
Listen up.

857
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,196
It takes a long time
to win someone's favor,

858
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,657
but you can lose it all in a flash.

859
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,411
Just like dust that blows away.

860
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,163
Just accept it.

861
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,047
Good night, Seo-jin.

862
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,385
I hope you get plenty of sleep!

863
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,655
Honey.

864
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,781
Honey.

865
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,491
What?

866
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,202
I think you should just

867
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,122
get the surgery from Dr. Kang.

868
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,667
He's not a quack, you know.

869
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,880
What? What are you talking about?

870
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,507
Just get the surgery from Ye-seo's dad.

871
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,093
Even if you end up like Dr. Song,

872
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,846
just accept it as your fate
and come to terms with it.

873
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,014
What?

874
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,223
"Fate"?

875
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,892
Woman, how could you say that?

876
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,853
I know that he lost the chief position,

877
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,354
but he's well-connected.

878
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,733
What if he becomes the director later?
Will you be able to work under him?

879
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,359
If you get kicked out of the hospital,

880
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,737
we'll have to leave Sky Castle.

881
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,447
You have to choose sides wisely.

882
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,325
Is that more important
than my back to you?

883
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,367
Yes, it is!

884
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,585
Hye-na, will you
really get rid of the elite class?

885
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,338
-Yes, for real.
-Is that so?

886
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,714
Then I'll vote for you.

887
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,092
I think you'll be a lot better
than a girl who has a coach,

888
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,927
whom she consults for every single thing.

889
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,887
Then I'll vote for you as well.

890
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,764
Let me know if you need help
with your campaign.

891
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,142
-Move.
-What's her problem?

892
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:39,813
Mom.

893
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,815
Seo-jun and Gi-jun.

894
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,277
-We're off.
-Bye.

895
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,907
Kim Hye-na?

896
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,267
What are you talking about now?

897
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,686
You don't even pay a penny
for the tutoring sessions

898
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,938
you're getting with Do-hoon and Seong-jae.

899
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,523
Do you know how much they cost?

900
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,650
On top of that,
I give you a million won a month.

901
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,986
And what? You want to double the money?

902
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:11,988
Then,

903
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,032
can you triple it?

904
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,742
Look at this brat.

905
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,535
I'm risking my future

906
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,287
to take the performance assessments
for him.

907
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:22,874
Do-hoon was dozing off
during the English assessment today.

908
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,586
You know that I'll also get expelled
if we get caught, right?

909
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:31,716
You want to call us even with just
a million won for such a huge risk?

910
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,468
Look at you.

911
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,637
You're so manipulative.

912
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:39,474
I'm only helping you out
because I feel bad for you.

913
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,100
How dare you try to cut a deal?

914
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,771
I didn't know that you were
such a compassionate person.

915
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,649
-Then give me three million.
-Hey!

916
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:53,947
From now on, even essay-type questions
will be included.

917
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,907
Then the assessments

918
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,243
will take up 50 percent
for Korean Literature, English, and Math.

919
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,912
Will you be okay without me?

920
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,543
Let's end this if you don't like my offer.

921
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,008
CASHIER'S CHECK, 1,000,000 WON

922
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,185
Gosh, my goodness. Hey!

923
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:25,895
That wench.

924
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:29,065
Hey! Hey, wait.

925
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,037
Okay, fine.

926
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,164
I'm sorry. I apologize.

927
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:55,842
But please do a perfect job
on Do-hoon's assessments, okay?

928
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,185
To be honest with you,

929
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,896
Ye-seo has no chance
of becoming the school president.

930
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,815
The students will be voting.

931
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,318
Do you actually think
anyone will vote for her?

932
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,155
That's why we have you.

933
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,949
Ms. Han, it's my job to come up
with the best strategy for her.

934
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,494
Obsessing over what is impossible
is simply a waste of time and energy.

935
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,624
Founding and running the school club is
enough to showcase her leadership skills.

936
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,297
Ye-seo...

937
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,966
really wants to beat Hye-na.

938
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,178
And my husband and I

939
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,722
want Ye-seo to become
the school president.

940
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,435
That's why I'm telling you this.

941
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,854
Instead of asking for a favor.

942
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,528
Understood.

943
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,823
I'll be counting on you, then.

944
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,922
Please take good care of Ye-seo.

945
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,678
I'll be off, then.

946
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,221
Goodbye.

947
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,453
What brings you here?

948
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:52,250
Seo-jin, I've come to ask you for a favor.

949
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,714
You have Coach Kim Ju-yeong's...

950
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,217
contact information, right?

951
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,688
I should've introduced myself
to you sooner, Mr. Park.

952
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,317
I'm Kim Ju-yeong.

953
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,211
CASHIER'S CHECK, 1,000,000 WON

954
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:41,007
WHO KILLED THAT WOMAN?

955
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,804
Kim Ju-yeong? Her name is Kim Ju-yeong?

956
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,473
We have to make Ye-seo
the school president.

957
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,141
Coach Kim said she'll help?

958
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,393
U-ju will be running with Hye-na.

959
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,771
I heard everyone is saying that
they'll vote for Hye-na.

960
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:55,897
Can you make her back out?

961
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:59,233
You want to meet
Coach Kim Ju-yeong in person?

962
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,611
A tragedy happened right here.

963
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,237
Someone has to ask, don't you think?

964
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,323
She's collecting information
to write a novel.

965
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,407
About Yeong-jae?

966
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,576
More than a dozen times a day,

967
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,995
I wanted to kill a woman
named Kim Ju-yeong.

968
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:14,499
This kind of misery must end with my son.

969
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,840
