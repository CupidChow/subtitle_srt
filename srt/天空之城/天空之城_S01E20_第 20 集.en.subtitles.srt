1
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,228
Were you really going to destroy

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,190
Ye-seo and me?

3
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,611
Ms. Han.

4
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,282
Will you not regret this?

5
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,670
I asked if you're sure
you won't regret this, Ms. Han.

6
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,059
I might end up

7
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,978
regretting my decision.

8
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,356
But one thing I know for certain

9
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,858
is that I'll end up

10
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,402
regretting things even more

11
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,447
if I don't stop here and wait until
Ye-seo gets into SNU's med school.

12
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,949
Even without me,

13
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,453
you and Ye-seo were already
on your path toward destruction.

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,622
Even if Ye-seo got in,

15
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,625
she wouldn't have been able to
handle her guilt.

16
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,590
I don't know

17
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,301
what drove you to ruin
all your students' families,

18
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,638
but did you really have to kill Hye-na?

19
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,975
I mean, you're a mom yourself.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,310
A mom with a daughter
who breaks your heart.

21
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,774
Do you think

22
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,694
you had nothing to do with Hye-na's death?

23
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,156
-What?
-You remember

24
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,283
what Hye-na said when she came

25
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,618
to see me, right?

26
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,415
Make sure that Ye-seo
doesn't get into SNU's med school.

27
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,002
I'll get in with my own skills.

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,628
You just have to make her fail.

29
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:56,092
If she hadn't made a request
that I absolutely couldn't accept,

30
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,721
why would I have killed that poor girl?

31
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,015
Have you wondered

32
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,184
why Hye-na made such a proposition?

33
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,189
She probably thought her dad

34
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,360
would accept her
if she got into SNU's med school.

35
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,362
That is true,

36
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,656
but the biggest reason...

37
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,577
was her anger toward you.

38
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,621
You heard why

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,290
she was hoping Ye-seo
wouldn't get accepted.

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,168
I'll get into SNU's med school
without an exam coordinator

41
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,670
and prove that I'm more competent
than Ye-seo

42
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,547
and that my mom

43
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,050
is a lot better than Ye-seo's mom.

44
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,552
You made Hye-na an outcast

45
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,347
and damaged her self-esteem.

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,350
She was a lonely girl
who wanted to be loved,

47
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,769
but you just broke her heart.

48
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,313
If he finds out you're his daughter,

49
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,190
what do you think he'll do?

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,317
He thinks the only flaw in his life

51
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,402
is that he couldn't finish his residency

52
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,571
at SNU before coming to
Junam University Hospital.

53
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,157
An illegitimate child?

54
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,452
He'll never acknowledge or accept you.

55
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,663
With his pride and ego, the likes of you

56
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,581
would be an unbearable flaw.

57
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,335
She was just a young girl who wanted
to be loved by her father.

58
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,838
Didn't you treat her like a thief
who was out to destroy your family?

59
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,676
Had the truth come out sooner,

60
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,178
it would've obviously distracted
Ye-seo from studying.

61
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,139
Should I have told Ye-seo the truth
and welcomed her

62
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,600
-with applause?
-You only cared

63
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,352
about Ye-seo getting into SNU.

64
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,646
You couldn't see anything else.

65
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,733
Did it ever occur to you
how often Hye-na cried

66
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,402
in that basement room?

67
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,404
Imagine how angry she must have been

68
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,156
to come to me in person
and propose a deal like that.

69
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,828
Your extremely selfish
maternal love for Ye-seo

70
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,291
made Hye-na come to me.

71
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,210
Hence,

72
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,130
both you and I

73
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,340
killed Hye-na.

74
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,136
That's absolutely not true.

75
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,639
I hated her to death,
but I never wanted to kill her.

76
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,101
But you killed Hye-na
as well as Myeong-ju.

77
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,854
You destroyed Yeong-jae's family
and tried to ruin mine as well.

78
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,275
I'm different
from an evil monster like you.

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,486
Did you go to the police station

80
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,656
to save U-ju because you pitied him?

81
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,826
Would you still have changed your mind

82
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,703
if Ye-seo hadn't been
falling apart mentally?

83
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,706
Right, I went to the police station
for my daughter, not for U-ju.

84
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,374
What's wrong with that?

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,252
What's wrong with putting my child first?

86
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,131
Moms do anything and everything
for their children.

87
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,725
Is that why

88
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,812
you decided to join hands with me
when I told you

89
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,439
that U-ju would end up taking the fall?

90
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,357
Because the life of someone else's son
is worth less

91
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,734
than a day of your daughter's life?

92
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,654
You're just like the moms
who were secretly glad

93
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,242
when my genius daughter
ended up like that.

94
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,786
They can't stand other kids

95
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,705
outdoing their children
and only want their kids to succeed.

96
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,916
You're just like them.

97
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,754
When I asked you if you'd be able to
put up with the tragedy

98
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,423
that Yeong-jae's family
went through, you said yes.

99
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,510
Why?

100
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,971
Because you arrogantly thought
that it would never happen to you.

101
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,889
Why?

102
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,725
Because you were blinded by your greed
to make your kid succeed.

103
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,643
Why?

104
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,770
The tragedy Yeong-jae's family experienced

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,276
was nothing more
than just a sad story to you.

106
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,371
Did you say that

107
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,998
you and I are different?

108
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,752
You're wrong.

109
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,422
You and I...

110
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,553
are exactly the same.

111
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,351
That's right.

112
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,437
I should see if you're right.

113
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,813
Let's go and find out.

114
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,989
I guess you don't want to
walk out of here in one piece.

115
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,631
Dad.

116
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,398
Mom.

117
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,775
Hye-na is acting strange.

118
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,569
She can't seem to wake up,
and she keeps saying weird things.

119
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,488
She has a fever, too.

120
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,282
Really?

121
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,623
You just told me she has a fever.
You might get sick, too.

122
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,874
Stay here.

123
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,752
Mom.

124
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,089
Mom.

125
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,927
Mom.

126
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,721
Mom.

127
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,812
My sweetheart,

128
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,647
are you sick?

129
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,775
I'm here. It's me, your mom.

130
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,030
Mom.

131
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,450
Mom.

132
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,704
Mom.

133
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,872
Mom.

134
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,667
Mom.

135
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,921
Mom.

136
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,051
Get up. Let's go to the hospital.

137
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,805
Mom.

138
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,780
You and I...

139
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,869
are exactly the same.

140
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,250
Why would you resign?

141
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,336
You're just about to reach
the top of the pyramid.

142
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,923
You're bound to become
the next hospital president.

143
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,258
So why would you resign?

144
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,968
I also thought

145
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,846
I had to become the hospital president.

146
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,766
I thought that would bring me
the utmost happiness.

147
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,811
But after going through all this,

148
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,938
I realized that it all means nothing.

149
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,236
I understand how you must feel, Dr. Kang.

150
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,614
But you should reconsider resigning.

151
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,865
He's right.

152
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,660
Dr. Kang, how about

153
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,787
applying for a sabbatical leave
instead of resigning?

154
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,331
If you take a good year's rest--

155
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,290
How do you

156
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,085
expect me to go into the OR

157
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,504
that I pushed my daughter out of?

158
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,714
Your daughter?

159
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,466
What daughter?

160
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,845
What?

161
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,768
There are so many times

162
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,729
when I just want to kill myself.

163
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,481
If I think about

164
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,024
how miserable

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,402
she and her mother
must have been because of me...

166
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,532
She and her mother?

167
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,079
Did your wife not tell you anything?

168
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,792
I can't believe she just left
without telling me anything.

169
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,169
I can't join the conversation here.

170
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,131
My heart also aches
every time I think about Hye-na.

171
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,550
So I can only imagine
how hard it must be for you.

172
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,434
Hye-na was his daughter?

173
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,939
But what can you do?

174
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,608
You should think about
the other family members.

175
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,195
Yes, of course.

176
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,614
That's why I'm going to try my best

177
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,658
to be a good dad, a good husband,

178
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,702
and a good son.

179
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,913
I don't want to end up
regretting anything in the future.

180
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,957
That's great.

181
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,336
After this incident,
I realized that being able to

182
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,506
eat together with my wife and U-ju

183
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,508
is enough to make me happy.

184
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,885
Yes, of course.

185
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,346
To be honest, there are numerous times

186
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,432
when I want to kick out my nagging wife

187
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,684
and my son who can never
seem to get good grades.

188
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,730
But happiness eventually comes from
being able to live with your family.

189
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,190
Let's all drink.

190
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,702
That doesn't seem to be the case
when it comes to my colleague.

191
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,873
His wife apparently left the house
along with the kids

192
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,667
without even saying anything to him.

193
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,552
Professor Cha's wife just took
all her stuff and left the house.

194
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,139
No, she didn't move out.

195
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,141
She just left with her kids.

196
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,228
In other words, she left Professor Cha.

197
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,856
On top of that, his son even said to him
that he likes it better

198
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,983
now that he's not living with him.

199
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,781
He said he's happy now.

200
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,783
What do you think

201
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,369
about his wife and kids?

202
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,122
If his son said that to him,
I'm definitely sure

203
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,252
that darn colleague of yours
is the one to blame.

204
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,797
What's the use of being
a good professor at school?

205
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,051
I mean, how hard has he been on his kids

206
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,386
for his wife

207
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,264
to actually leave the house?

208
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,395
From what I know,
he wasn't that hard on the kids.

209
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:20,359
The only reason I was able to live
like a decent human being

210
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,112
after I suddenly lost my parents
due to a car accident

211
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,073
was all thanks to Eden Orphanage.

212
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,828
To others, it may have been nothing
more than an ordinary orphanage.

213
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,832
But to me, it was a very
comfortable, safe,

214
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,334
and warm place.

215
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,338
Don't you think that's the kind of place
a home should be to a child?

216
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,057
Let's stop

217
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,145
wasting our lives in vain, Professor Cha.

218
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,444
Here.

219
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,213
Fine, then. Don't come back.

220
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,342
When was I so hard on them?
I don't care if they don't come.

221
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,689
Even if I'm lonely and sad
I'm not going to cry

222
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,818
I'm just going to hold it in
Why would I cry?

223
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,828
Let's smile and run

224
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,290
On that green field

225
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,504
Let's look

226
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,632
At the blue sky

227
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,554
And sing

228
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,267
What?

229
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,852
You want to

230
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,937
drop out of school?

231
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,105
U-ju,

232
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,273
you'll be

233
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,400
graduating in a few months.

234
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,110
Mom. Dad.

235
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,778
To be honest,

236
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,157
I thought everything would work out
if I studied hard.

237
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,368
I thought getting good grades
was the most important thing in life.

238
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,456
But after I unexpectedly ended up
going to jail...

239
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,459
And after Hye-na died just like that...

240
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,046
Grades and university?

241
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,507
I realized that those mean nothing.

242
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,473
When I was in prison,

243
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,143
I was hit with the realization
that the time

244
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,021
I get for free is really precious.

245
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,857
A day I get to live just by waking up

246
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,444
is a valuable day
that Hye-na never got to live.

247
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,364
I can't waste my precious time

248
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,076
solving problems to improve my grades

249
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,412
when I don't even how to live my life.

250
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,581
U-ju.

251
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,918
If it's hard for you, you don't
have to go to university this year.

252
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,838
But you should graduate
from high school first--

253
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,923
Dad.

254
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,052
Did you ever imagine
I'd be charged with murder?

255
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,222
What good is a high school diploma
in that situation?

256
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,766
I need time

257
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,018
to think about who I am

258
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,854
and how I should live my life from now on.

259
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,483
Then U-ju.

260
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,152
How about taking a break from school?

261
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,031
Take a year or so to figure yourself out.

262
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,075
While growing up in an orphanage,

263
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,827
I learned for myself

264
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,162
how cruel the world treats the powerless.

265
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,959
That's why I think that even if
it's a bit hard for you right now,

266
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,169
you should bear it.

267
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,588
Graduate from high school and

268
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,632
-go to university, and then--
-Power

269
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,468
doesn't come from
where I graduated from, Dad.

270
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,053
Who I am,

271
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,513
what kind of person I am,

272
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,056
and what I live for.

273
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,599
When all that is clear,

274
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,061
isn't that where power comes from?

275
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,068
Honey.

276
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,286
You're giving in?

277
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:08,040
Why did you start a fight you can't win?

278
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,168
Make me some honey water.

279
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,200
Where are the kids?

280
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,290
Did you drunk-text me?

281
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,583
Text?

282
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,877
What text?

283
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,005
Goodbye.

284
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,386
What text are you talking about?

285
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,689
Seung-hye.

286
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,315
Without you,

287
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:19,653
I feel like a birch tree standing alone
in a Siberian snowfield.

288
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,114
I was a fool, and it's all my fault.

289
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,907
My beautiful Seung-hye,

290
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,370
hurry back to me
and fill my heart with your warmth.

291
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,663
P.S.

292
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,249
I accept your terms.

293
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,127
Are you saying I sent this?

294
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,170
Something this corny?

295
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,175
Seung-hye.

296
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,094
Without you,

297
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:50,517
I feel like a birch tree standing alone
in a Siberian snowfield.

298
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,686
Fill my heart...

299
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,526
with your warmth.

300
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,611
P.S.

301
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,574
I accept...

302
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,036
all...

303
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,331
your terms.

304
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,843
How impressive.

305
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,264
I was really drunk
yet I spelled every word perfectly.

306
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,644
Haven't you ever heard of "drunken truth"?

307
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,404
Well, it's true that

308
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,823
I sent that text.

309
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,872
Then you promise not to interfere

310
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,333
with the kids' studies, right?

311
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,298
And

312
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,801
you'll stop telling Se-ri
to go to university

313
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,928
and let her live her own life, right?

314
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,523
You will throw the pyramid away

315
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,690
and never again

316
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,693
mention that stupid thing
around the kids, right?

317
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,821
What?

318
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,364
"That stupid thing"?

319
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,532
Yes.

320
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,242
That stupid thing.

321
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,289
They're high school seniors.
What am I to do then?

322
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,291
You can spend time with me.

323
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,670
While being a real dad
who trusts his kids and waits for them.

324
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:48,635
What are you saying?
Was I not a real dad until now?

325
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,387
You met...

326
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,348
the boys, didn't you?

327
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,394
Seo-jun said

328
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,980
that he was happy

329
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,565
without you.

330
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,945
That broke my heart so much
that I couldn't sleep.

331
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:11,283
You didn't mean to hassle the kids.
You just wanted them to do well.

332
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,372
But it got to the point
where they're happier without you.

333
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,376
What if

334
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,546
you end up living a really lonely life?

335
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,132
Do you know how sad that thought
makes me feel?

336
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,666
Do you like being away from me, too?

337
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,629
Are you happy?

338
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,382
How could I be?

339
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,886
I was worried sick

340
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,681
about how much you'd be
suffering on your own.

341
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,402
But

342
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,405
where on earth did all of you stay?

343
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,200
My hideout.

344
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,619
Your hideout?

345
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,205
I will leave again with the kids
if you don't keep your promise.

346
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,416
So you'd better stick
to the conditions, okay?

347
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,004
But...

348
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,426
I can't throw that away on my own.

349
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,638
It's awfully heavy.

350
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,497
I must say, I'm so impressed by you.

351
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,499
Ye-seo would've gotten into
SNU's med school

352
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,251
if she made it through the first semester,

353
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,628
so I thought you'd just
keep your lips sealed.

354
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,588
I never thought Ye-seo would end up

355
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,050
getting zero marks
and dropping out of school.

356
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,012
I've known Ye-seo
since she was four, you know.

357
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:41,099
I know how you and Ye-seo lived

358
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,018
for the past 15 years.

359
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,732
Now that I've let things go,

360
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,401
I wonder why I lived like that.

361
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,403
Had I been in your situation,

362
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,781
I certainly wouldn't have been
able to give it up.

363
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,784
I have huge respect
for both you and Ye-seo.

364
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,829
You would've gotten U-ju out
a lot sooner than I did.

365
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,373
-You think so?
-Yes.

366
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,083
You're honest,

367
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,711
and you're highly empathetic
toward other people's pain.

368
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,422
I know you'd put Su-han first,
but you still wouldn't have been

369
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,549
able to let U-ju suffer in there.

370
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,594
Putting myself in others' shoes.

371
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,429
That's what I'm most terrible at,
you know.

372
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,227
What's gotten into you? Why are you
suddenly complimenting me like this?

373
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,272
Seo-jin.

374
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,692
Gosh.

375
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,694
I feel so sad.

376
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,655
When I think about you leaving Sky Castle,

377
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,034
it makes this place feel empty already.

378
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,871
I feel really sad.

379
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,918
I'll visit you often.

380
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,966
Promise me, then.

381
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,721
You promised.

382
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,139
Rethink your decision.

383
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,600
I don't want you to regret this later on.

384
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,104
I've come to this decision
after long, careful consideration.

385
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,149
If you quit now,

386
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,984
-I'll end up--
-I'm sorry.

387
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,531
I mean...

388
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,740
Take care.

389
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,035
Wait, Dr. Kang.

390
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,747
Dr. Kang!

391
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,499
Dr. Kang...

392
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,751
Hey! Dr. Kang!

393
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:37,132
PLANNING MANAGER KANG JUN-SANG

394
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,576
Hey, come on in.

395
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,178
Dr. Woo, you know that you'll be in charge

396
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,139
of the Orthopedics Department, right?

397
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:34,898
Thank you

398
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,277
for putting up with me

399
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,697
all these years.

400
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,117
Dr. Kang.

401
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,416
Don't be scared.

402
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,460
Try to be more confident, okay?

403
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,755
I know you can't sleep well
thinking about patients

404
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,757
suffering from aftereffects, so I'm sure

405
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,592
that you'll become a great doctor.

406
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,969
Thank you, Dr. Kang.

407
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,763
No problem.

408
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,230
And you.

409
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,899
When you're holding a hammer,

410
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,235
everything looks like a nail.
Don't ever forget that.

411
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,153
Always be careful and thorough.

412
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,042
Dong-min, to doctors
who must wear surgical gowns,

413
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,128
skills matter more than fashion.

414
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,257
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

415
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,634
I'll keep that in mind.

416
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,011
Great, keep up the good work.

417
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,015
Gosh,

418
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,476
I know you're a busy man.
You didn't have to come.

419
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,769
You're leaving.

420
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,354
I have to at least say goodbye.

421
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,445
Thank you.

422
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,242
Please stay here until the end.

423
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,495
Regardless of where you go,

424
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,874
I hope you can be happy.

425
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,960
Thank you.

426
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,094
I hope you all get along without fighting.

427
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,805
Yes, we will.
Take care of your health, Dr. Kang.

428
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,931
All right.

429
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,851
Keep up the great work.

430
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,811
I will. Thank you for everything.

431
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,463
So what is Jun-sang

432
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,757
planning to do now?

433
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,260
He said he'll take a few months to rest
and think about it.

434
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,974
He can't be thinking of quitting
the profession altogether, right?

435
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,894
I heard that my friend's son shut down

436
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,648
his successful clinic a while ago
and opened a dumpling place.

437
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,149
A dumpling place?

438
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,277
He was always

439
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,155
immensely interested in cooking,

440
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,742
but she forced him to go
to medical school, and he eventually...

441
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,328
I see.

442
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,330
He's divorced,

443
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,124
so she even has to look after
her grandkids.

444
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,294
One day, she went to buy
dumpling ingredients with her son

445
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,964
and ended up bawling,

446
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,758
sitting on the floor at the market.

447
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,345
Don't worry, Mother.

448
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,974
I know that Jun-sang will never
want to open up a dumpling place.

449
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,351
Don't worry about him and try to relax.

450
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,019
I'll take care of everything.

451
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,411
How is Ye-seo doing?

452
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,331
She's stronger than me.

453
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,793
She's totally fine,
and seeing that gives me strength.

454
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,212
That's a relief.

455
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,167
Mom, I cleaned and organized my room.

456
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,003
I threw out all the expected
questions I got from Coach Kim,

457
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,130
and I made a new study plan as well.
Have a look.

458
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,339
-Really?
-Yes.

459
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,677
Ye-seo.

460
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,388
Don't be anxious.

461
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,265
Have you forgotten what your dad said?

462
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,225
He said you shouldn't rush.

463
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,019
He advised you to take your time.

464
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,938
Right, he did.

465
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,191
Okay, Mom.

466
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,196
How can you study
without a single day off?

467
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,365
Make a new plan.
Make sure it's not so packed.

468
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,452
Mom.

469
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,332
Starting tomorrow, I'll work on
finding a good academy

470
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,000
as well as a tutor for you.

471
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,376
No. It's okay, Mom.

472
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,463
Rumors already spread everywhere,
so I can't go to academies.

473
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,299
I think I should...

474
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,218
Is it called self-directed learning?

475
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,969
Yes, I want to give it a shot.

476
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,138
Since I have a lot of time
on my hands now,

477
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,350
I should try changing my studying method.

478
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,646
You'll study on your own?

479
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,399
Mom, you told me not to be anxious.

480
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,236
Okay.

481
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,821
You should try studying on your own.

482
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,198
You know you can tell me right away
if you find it hard, right?

483
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,033
Of course.

484
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,078
By the way,

485
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,372
I got a text from Seo-jun.

486
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,582
U-ju is dropping out, too.

487
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,210
U-ju?

488
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,629
HANG IN THERE. WE BELIEVE IN YOU.
STAY STRONG, U-JU!

489
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,613
I'm sorry, U-ju.

490
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,534
I'm really, really sorry.

491
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,121
I wish you nothing but happiness.

492
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,301
HWANG U-JU

493
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,314
INCREDIBLE VOYAGE

494
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,160
My gosh, what a lousy question.

495
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,621
Everyone, let's look
at question number 31.

496
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,206
This is...

497
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,001
a question about Newton's law.

498
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,544
Let's look at the examples.

499
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,546
-"The element..."
-You guys, U-ju's leaving.

500
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,305
Let me see.

501
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,228
Hey, go back to your seats.

502
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,230
What's the fuss about?
Go back to your seats.

503
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,483
Sit back down, you punks. My goodness.

504
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,360
Go back to your seats.

505
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,031
You guys really need to
get to your senses.

506
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,620
What's the matter?
Are you guys jealous of U-ju?

507
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,749
He'll end up regretting his choice
in just one month.

508
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,752
No, actually,
I bet it'll only take a week.

509
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,047
The fact that you're students
is more important than anything.

510
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,298
You're high school seniors!

511
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,842
You should be studying for university,
not dropping out of school.

512
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,136
Self-exploration, my foot.

513
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,932
What happens if you don't
get into the top universities?

514
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,268
-We won't be treated as humans.
-We won't be treated as humans.

515
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,269
Say it louder!

516
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,604
-We won't be treated as humans!
-We won't be treated as humans!

517
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,275
Sir.

518
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,403
Should a teacher really be saying that?

519
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,447
Does that mean people who don't
achieve that aren't humans?

520
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,701
You little punk.

521
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,079
Yes, that's right. I can already see

522
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,124
who's going to be successful,

523
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:17,712
and who's going to
end up living like trash.

524
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,592
You little punk.

525
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,261
Cha Gi-jun, come outside.

526
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,224
I said, come outside!

527
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,689
Hey, Cha Seo-jun.

528
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,319
What?

529
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,259
Cha Gi-jun, where are you going?

530
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,136
Where are you going?

531
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,096
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Why are you leaving?

532
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,514
Come back inside! Hey!

533
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,974
You punks.

534
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,281
Hey! Get back in here!

535
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,532
Are you really going to do this?

536
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,159
If you really leave, I'm going to give you

537
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,744
zero marks for your
performance assessment.

538
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,829
You won't be able to get into
the top three universities!

539
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,830
You little punks.

540
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,129
Get back here!

541
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,215
Where do you think you're going?

542
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,550
Hello.

543
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,682
Hey! Get back here!

544
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,768
U-ju!

545
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,521
-U-ju!
-U-ju!

546
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,731
Hey, U-ju!

547
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,484
-U-ju!
-Hey!

548
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,444
-Hey!
-Hey, come here.

549
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,781
-Come on.
-Hey, U-ju.

550
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,950
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in class?

551
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,743
We escaped from hell!

552
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,331
Are you guys skipping class?

553
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,333
Hey, you're dropping out of school.

554
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,919
We're just skipping class for one day.
What's going to happen?

555
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,384
Gosh, the sunlight is amazing,
and the sky is so blue.

556
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,885
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

557
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,470
Gi-jun, you're being so sentimental.

558
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,848
-Let's go.
-This is so nice.

559
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,685
Goodness, look at you.

560
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,484
What? You skipped class?

561
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,361
Did you just say you skipped class?

562
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,828
You skipped class
when you're high school seniors?

563
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,788
Honey.

564
00:40:58,831 --> 00:40:59,999
Did you forget about our hideout?

565
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,879
I guess it won't hurt
to skip class once in a while.

566
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,755
Do you guys

567
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,758
want to throw out
the pyramid with your dad?

568
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,802
The pyramid?

569
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,140
Honey, we need to get a sticker
for that. What's the rush?

570
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,350
-I'll buy one when I have time--
-I already did.

571
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,901
LARGE ITEM DISPOSAL

572
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,786
Why did you stick it at the top?

573
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,165
You should stick it at the bottom.

574
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,922
It's more visible here.

575
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,090
If they don't see the sticker,
they won't take it.

576
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,136
But still, how could you stick this
at the very top of the pyramid?

577
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,431
It won't come off.

578
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,018
Come on.

579
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,651
Okay. Move over, Dad.

580
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,361
-Move, Dad.
-Move over, Dad.

581
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,779
Watch out.

582
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,455
Thank you.

583
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,869
Here you go, my son.

584
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,206
-Does your son come first?
-No. Here.

585
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:07,751
It's so savory.

586
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,296
Su-han, doesn't it taste better
when your dad cracks it for you?

587
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,298
Yes, it's really delicious.

588
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,717
-Does it taste savory?
-Yes.

589
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,596
This is what you call happiness.
It's nothing extraordinary.

590
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,722
That's exactly my point.

591
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,309
What's the point of making such a fuss to
become the planning manager

592
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,602
when you'll just end up resigning?

593
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,770
What's the point of making their child
the top student

594
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,230
when they'll just end up dropping out?

595
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,690
Su-han,

596
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,026
you don't have to go
to a specialized high school.

597
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,154
You can quit taking
preliminary classes for that.

598
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,364
Really? Dad, do you really mean that?

599
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,241
Can I really quit the academy?

600
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,785
-Trust your dad.
-Don't be ridiculous.

601
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,746
-Honey, are you crazy?
-Come on.

602
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,707
How can you say that even after
seeing what happened to Ye-seo?

603
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,252
I mean, if I think about Ye-seo,
I do realize

604
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,463
that I shouldn't be too obsessed
with private education.

605
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,257
But to be honest,
I'm still quite confused.

606
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,178
As long as I can get
Su-han into med school,

607
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,265
I feel like I could even dance naked
at Gwanghwamun Plaza.

608
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,558
Goodness, honey.

609
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,311
If you dance naked at Gwanghwamun Plaza,

610
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,021
you'll get arrested.

611
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,487
Su-han, things are going to get intense
in high school.

612
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,613
What do we do?

613
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,615
I trusted Seo-jin until now
and followed her tracks,

614
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,492
but she ended up going off-course.

615
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,203
Stop trying to follow other people

616
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,373
and just focus on doing what you do best.

617
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,291
What I do best?

618
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,835
You're good at lying down
for just one minute.

619
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,839
From now on,

620
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,301
don't just lie down for 1 minute.
Lie down for 10 or 100 minutes.

621
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,680
Well, I am really good at lying down.

622
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,516
But then again, someone told me

623
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,851
that children who grow up
being loved by their parents

624
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,520
are able to endure the severe stress

625
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,313
that comes from all the studying.

626
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,734
We can't change this darn education system

627
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,444
of Korea.

628
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,863
So the least we can do as parents

629
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,698
is to help our son

630
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:06,245
endure the brutal system by loving him

631
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,249
-as much as we can.
-Goodness, you're so smart.

632
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,128
You're right.
Let's give him a lot of love.

633
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,546
My son,

634
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,966
come and hug your fancy and elegant mom.

635
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,510
My dear boy.

636
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,513
The best thing I did in my life

637
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,016
was to have you, my son.

638
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,017
Right.

639
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,272
Thanks for coming to me.

640
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,065
I love you, Mom.

641
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,322
-Awesome.
-What?

642
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,324
Me, too.

643
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,119
Okay, my older son, too.

644
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,038
This is the life.

645
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,416
I liked that.

646
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,214
-Get rid of the pyramid.
-Pyramid, pyramid

647
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,883
Pointy pyramid

648
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,426
How is Ye-seo?

649
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,220
She's acting strong,

650
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,681
but she seems a bit anxious.

651
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,437
She would be.

652
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,024
Not being part of any group at her age

653
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,236
would make her feel uneasy.

654
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,072
Oh, dear.

655
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,783
I'm anxious myself.

656
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,455
"Will she manage until next year's
university entrance exam?

657
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,000
Is this really the best option?"

658
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,505
I can barely sleep at night
thinking about such things.

659
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,595
We'll become good parents

660
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,515
as we fight through things together.

661
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,102
Don't worry too much.
We're doing this so that

662
00:46:55,646 --> 00:47:00,817
Ye-seo doesn't end up living
an empty life like I did.

663
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,823
Each time I waver,

664
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,952
I need you to tell me that
hundreds of times.

665
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,497
My gosh. Don't you worry.

666
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,999
I'll say it thousands of times.

667
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,752
Honey.

668
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,549
Shall we take Ye-seo and Ye-bin tomorrow

669
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,259
to see Hye-na?

670
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,573
If I'd treated Hye-na a little better...

671
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,743
I'm sorry.

672
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,664
If I'd been

673
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,333
a better husband,

674
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,379
you would have discussed it with me.

675
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,092
I'm the one

676
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,595
who made you

677
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,389
act like that.

678
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:16,893
I'm sorry.

679
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,419
Hye-na.

680
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,838
We're here.

681
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,634
You must have really resented me.

682
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,137
I'm really...

683
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,307
sorry.

684
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,612
Hye-na.

685
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,531
I came seventh in my class.

686
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:13,950
I did well, right?

687
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,788
Like I promised,

688
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,874
I study really hard now.

689
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,251
KIM HYE-NA

690
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,211
Hey.

691
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,838
I quit school, and I'm preparing
to take the GED.

692
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,341
Are you pleased?

693
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,510
I bet you are.

694
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,100
Look at you smile.

695
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,437
Hye-na.

696
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,815
Kang Hye-na.

697
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,945
I'm sorry for hating you.

698
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,339
Dad.

699
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,675
It's me, Mi-hyang.

700
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,677
Who? Mi-hyang?

701
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,055
The jerk who left with her mom
and changed her name?

702
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,933
You haven't changed.

703
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,186
How are you?

704
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,021
Why? Am I a waste of money?

705
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,981
You don't want to support me,

706
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,357
so do you want me dead?

707
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,234
Is it Mi-hyang? I'll talk to her.

708
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,863
-Hey, is that you, Mi-hyang?
-Yes.

709
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:16,990
How are you?

710
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,661
It's okay. Dad has always been like that.

711
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,207
How's So-min? Is she doing well
at the University of Sydney?

712
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,044
Well, she did graduate
from a great high school.

713
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,005
She's so smart, like me.

714
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,347
Hey, bring Dad to visit one day.

715
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,225
Nothing's wrong.

716
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,393
Jun-sang just grew up.

717
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,437
It's okay.

718
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,232
I told the kids the truth.

719
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,109
I'm sorry.

720
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,737
I was too harsh to you
in the past, wasn't I?

721
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,492
Oh, hi! How are you?

722
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,539
Yes, I'm fine.
Things must be tough for you.

723
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,749
Is Dad giving you a hard time?

724
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,966
It's what I saved up
since I came back to Korea.

725
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,846
It's nowhere nearly enough,

726
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:26,059
but I want to at least pay back
the 62,000 dollar fine myself.

727
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,022
You...

728
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,150
saved up this much money?

729
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,695
Se-ri.

730
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,655
Earning money myself made me see

731
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:42,576
how easy it was to just study
and spend what you sent me.

732
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,911
It really hit home.

733
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,747
And I feel sorry for what I did.

734
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,584
So I'm going to work harder.

735
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,879
Mom, you know Ji-min,
Jeong-ah, and Yoon-seo, right?

736
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,046
Of course, I do.

737
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,007
Ji-min's your friend
from elementary school.

738
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,551
You met Jeong-ah and Yoon-seo
in NMH School.

739
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,178
The four of us promised
to work hard with the goal

740
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,097
of opening our own club
in three years' time.

741
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,599
When we do,

742
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,560
will you come and check it out, Dad?

743
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,949
I should start taking some dance lessons.

744
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,118
You're...

745
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,329
a pretty good waltzer.

746
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,663
My goodness.

747
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,416
I should learn dance moves
for younger people.

748
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,126
Shall I teach you, Dad?

749
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,758
There was a dance academy
above your grandpa's dry-cleaner's.

750
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,885
You can learn anything
just by repetition, you know.

751
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,721
I have a great sense of rhythm.

752
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,431
Perfect.

753
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,603
Now, look.

754
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,522
-Ready?
-Yes.

755
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,741
Now spin.

756
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,201
Again.

757
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,831
And then...

758
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,083
Ta-da.

759
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,366
Kim Ju-yeong!

760
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,828
Look what you've done!

761
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,039
You said nothing would happen!

762
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,833
Keep quiet and sit down!

763
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,999
Hey, Yeong-jae.

764
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:20,919
Ms. Lee.

765
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,462
It's been quite a while.

766
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,838
How are you?

767
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,173
Yes, I've been well.

768
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,716
How have you been?

769
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,051
Good.

770
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,261
-Are you here to see my dad?
-Yes.

771
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,519
JEONGSEON MEDICAL CENTER

772
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,603
My book is out.

773
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,396
GOODBYE, SKY CASTLE
BY LEE SU-IM

774
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,065
I thought I should give you
the first copy.

775
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,485
-This one is yours, Yeong-jae.
-Thank you.

776
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,576
TO DR. PARK SU-CHANG

777
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,079
THANK YOU. THIS BOOK COULD COME
INTO THE WORLD THANKS TO YOU.

778
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,209
THANK YOU, YEONG-JAE

779
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,628
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE
THIS BOOK IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU

780
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,469
If it weren't for the two of you,

781
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,222
I would've definitely given up.

782
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,933
Thank you so much.

783
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,062
Thanks, Yeong-jae.

784
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,774
You worked so hard for this.

785
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,945
Every time you called me,
saying you were stuck,

786
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,531
I was able to reflect on myself

787
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,576
while telling you my story,
and it also gave me solace.

788
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,495
I should be the one thanking you.

789
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,540
Same here.

790
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,335
When you called me because of Ye-seo,

791
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,921
I thought hard and realized

792
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,758
that I, too, got stolen exam papers
from Kim Ju-yeong.

793
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,220
Back then, I just thought that the
expected questions were really accurate.

794
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,222
There were moments

795
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,433
when I regretted not going to SNU,

796
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,727
but looking back,

797
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,104
I know that I did the right thing.

798
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,607
I didn't achieve it

799
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,275
on my own.

800
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,032
Yeong-jae

801
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,326
wants to start studying again.

802
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,536
Really?

803
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,664
I want to go to university
and study counseling psychology.

804
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,166
For the youth.

805
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,128
I'd like to help students
who are stressed out like I was.

806
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,256
That's great.

807
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,510
I know that you'll do an amazing job.

808
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,303
Thank you.

809
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,266
-Gosh.
-My gosh.

810
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,230
I was so nervous when I first met you
at the mountain cabin.

811
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,565
I was quite intimidating, wasn't I?

812
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,985
Isn't the food here good?

813
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,320
-Eat as much as you'd like.
-Okay.

814
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,947
This is the best restaurant in this area.

815
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,157
All right.

816
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,369
Here.

817
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:02,956
Eat up, Yeong-jae.

818
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,542
Eat up, son.

819
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,382
My son, it must be so stressful for you.

820
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,842
You're almost there, though.

821
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,761
So hang in there, okay?

822
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,975
Honey, do you remember?

823
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,936
When Yeong-jae was still
crawling around as a baby,

824
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,564
he put his foot in your soup
after stepping on his poop,

825
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,315
but you still finished the entire bowl.

826
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,026
Come on.

827
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,946
That was my son's foot.
Why would I be grossed out?

828
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,119
You used to catch a cold
and run a fever so often.

829
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,747
I even had to run in the snow
to the hospital with you in my arms.

830
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:50,587
Thanks so much for growing
into such a healthy, smart boy.

831
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,401
Hey.

832
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,279
Hey, do we really have to do that, though?

833
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,656
It'll be good.
It'll be helpful for us, you know.

834
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,533
Gosh, you know what she's like.

835
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,577
She won't want to help us.
Do you think it'll work out?

836
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,624
Well, Ye-seo could say no.

837
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,125
I'll ask her.

838
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:39,886
Mom.

839
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,555
I just got a text from Seo-jun.

840
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,307
He wants to study with me every weekend.

841
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,558
Seo-jun?

842
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,227
The three of you, including Gi-jun?

843
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,354
Yes.

844
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,064
That's great.

845
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,900
I think it's a good idea.
What do you think?

846
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,027
Well...

847
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,239
I've never studied with anyone before,

848
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,284
but shall I try?

849
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,827
How about we study independently?

850
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,371
Since our study progress is different,

851
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,122
we can just get together here
every weekend

852
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,749
and keep each other in check.

853
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,920
Sounds good. How about
exchanging our notes as well?

854
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,132
Hey, you're really willing to share
your notes?

855
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,551
Yes, you'll be sharing yours, too.

856
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,595
Don't you know "give-and-take"?

857
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,015
My gosh, are you really
the Kang Ye-seo we know?

858
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,936
I'm a good person, you know.

859
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,397
Leave this study group
if you're going to keep annoying me.

860
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,235
She told you to leave.

861
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,698
What? Am I an outcast now?

862
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,329
Did you guys come up
with your study plans?

863
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,247
Shall I help you?

864
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,040
-No, thank you.
-No, it's okay.

865
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,250
Hi, Ye-seo.

866
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,963
Honey, just let them do their thing.

867
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,633
Why? I should show my support
since they're trying to study hard.

868
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,803
Don't be nosy.
Just let them study on their own.

869
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,179
How could you say that?

870
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,640
I'm trying to help
like any father would do.

871
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:12,770
The hideout.

872
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,570
Ye-seo, do you want to stay for dinner?

873
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,905
Se-ri wants to cook something nice
because you're here.

874
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,075
Sure, I will.

875
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,036
I'm sorry we interrupted you guys.

876
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,789
Honey, I have a job for you.

877
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,841
-So what? Am I an outcast?
-I told you to leave.

878
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,260
Are you going to stay here?
You just can't take a hint.

879
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,098
-Se-ri.
-Yes.

880
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,310
Dad, I'm making mille-feuille hot pot
for dinner.

881
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,230
I'll put you in charge
of the perilla leaves.

882
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,149
Rinse them thoroughly, please.

883
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,447
Sure, I'm very good at
thoroughly rinsing perilla leaves.

884
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:05,990
Oh, wait.

885
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,159
You need to do it properly.

886
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,748
Ta-da! Here's an apron for you.

887
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,500
Here.

888
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,378
Put your arms through first.

889
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,259
When did you learn how to make this?

890
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,470
There's nothing I can't do, you know.

891
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,015
All right, hand me the cabbage, too.
I'll rinse it for you.

892
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,517
Let's do it together, Dad.

893
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,230
There's a good song. Check it out.

894
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:41,025
Hang on, stay still. Okay.

895
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,236
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes.

896
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,198
One, two, three, four.

897
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,449
Stop it.

898
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,868
Dad, come on. You have to do it, too.

899
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,913
Ready, start. One, two, three, four.

900
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,416
One, two, three, four.

901
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,878
Now, the wave. One, two, three, four.

902
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,672
I haven't gotten the hang of it yet.

903
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,341
-You learned it earlier.
-My gosh.

904
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,301
I should let Seo-jin know.

905
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,679
Yes, Seung-hye.

906
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,265
Really?

907
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,226
Ye-seo loves mille-feuille hot pot.

908
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,645
Thanks so much.

909
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,566
The kids should study
at our place before we move.

910
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,693
I'd like to cook
a nice dinner for them as well.

911
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,446
All right, thanks.

912
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,994
Ye-seo will have dinner
at Seo-jun's place.

913
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,788
Ye-seo?

914
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,375
She's never eaten at someone else's place.

915
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,712
I think you can stop
worrying about her now, ma'am.

916
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,088
I know, right?

917
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,719
You're not forgetting anything, right?

918
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,179
Of course.

919
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:56,058
Take care, and don't make
Dad and I worry about you.

920
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,560
Don't worry, Mom.

921
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,228
How can I not worry?

922
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,108
-U-ju!
-U-ju!

923
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,029
My gosh.

924
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,407
-U-ju.
-Why are you running?

925
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,910
We almost missed him.

926
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,204
U-ju.

927
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:19,498
Hello.

928
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,045
Here's some pocket money for you.

929
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,505
-Gosh, it's okay.
-What are you doing? It's okay.

930
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,008
I went out of my way
to convert it to euros.

931
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,801
Let me do this as his mom's friend.

932
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,392
Thank you.

933
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:42,939
U-ju.

934
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,233
I'm really sorry.

935
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,405
Please let your guilt go.

936
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,574
I'm really okay now.

937
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,538
Thank you, U-ju. Be safe, okay?

938
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,706
I will.

939
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,460
U-ju, be safe.

940
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:07,171
Thanks.

941
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,340
I'll be rooting for you as well.

942
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,760
We got this.

943
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,180
-We should get going.
-Okay.

944
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,685
I'll get going, then.

945
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,860
Thanks, Mi-hyang.

946
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,489
Dr. Hwang is waiting. You should go.

947
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,534
-Thanks.
-No problem.

948
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,495
Thank you, Ye-seo.

949
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,250
Thank you for your concern and support.

950
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:08,149
Mom, let me go already.
I'll miss my flight.

951
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,779
You have to message me every day, okay?

952
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:15,865
I will.

953
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,534
I'll message you twice a day,
morning and night.

954
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,161
All right, U-ju.

955
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,497
You know that I'm rooting for you, right?

956
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:26,459
You know that I'm your biggest fan, right?

957
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:30,421
Honey, it's my turn now.
I want to say goodbye, too.

958
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,798
All right, it's your turn.

959
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,219
Dad.

960
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:40,848
U-ju,

961
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,433
I love you.

962
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,895
You know that, right?

963
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:50,066
Dad, I'll learn a lot while I'm there.
Don't worry about me.

964
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:51,859
All right,

965
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:52,943
I...

966
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,403
believe in you.

967
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:02,411
Gosh, Dad. I can't breathe.

968
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:06,707
Seo-jin, isn't that area too far
from the academies in Daechi-dong?

969
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,584
How will you pick Ye-bin up?

970
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,711
I'll find a different academy for her.

971
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,256
Her grades aren't good enough
for specialized high schools, anyway.

972
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,425
I don't want my greed to suffocate her.

973
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:18,636
Don't worry about Ye-bin.

974
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:21,138
I think she's extremely bright.

975
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,099
That's right. She's confident.

976
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,518
Most importantly,
she knows what she wants.

977
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,187
Most kids these days just go with
what their parents want them to do,

978
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,232
so Ye-bin is such a special gem.

979
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,526
Back in the day, I used to think

980
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:37,363
that raising her was ten times
more difficult than raising her sister,

981
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,573
but now that my mindset has changed,

982
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,450
I can see that she has so many strengths.

983
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,202
Yes, exactly.

984
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,579
Now that I've changed the way I think,

985
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,582
I'm realizing that Su-han
has so many strengths.

986
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,751
He's a good eater. He eats a lot.

987
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,797
He's kind and has many friends.
Also, he's so good at games.

988
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,882
He's good at everything but studying.

989
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,552
Studying is his mortal enemy.

990
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:02,888
Oh, right.

991
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,682
How is your book?

992
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:05,891
Is it selling well?

993
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,896
We only printed 2,000 copies
for the first edition,

994
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,108
but they haven't even been sold out yet.

995
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,617
Hey, why are you laughing?
Are you happy about that or what?

996
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:24,660
No.

997
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:28,205
I don't understand why we were
so against you writing that book.

998
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,332
Thinking back now, it's really comical.

999
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:35,254
I know, right? We even collected
signatures to petition against it.

1000
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,006
We totally overreacted.

1001
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,508
Don't you worry, Su-im.

1002
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,970
"Your beginnings will seem humble,
so prosperous will your future be."

1003
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,305
There's that saying, you know.

1004
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:46,849
That'd be great,

1005
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,644
but the fact that I wrote a book
for our kids makes me the happiest.

1006
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,315
Right, is U-ju doing well?

1007
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,360
Gosh, I got a message from him
this morning.

1008
01:09:58,986 --> 01:09:59,945
He wrote,

1009
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,615
"The greater your suffering,
the greater your enlightenment."

1010
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:07,203
Anyway, he says he's learning things
he couldn't learn stuck at his desk,

1011
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,705
so I think he's becoming
more mature by the day.

1012
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,373
I'm sure of this now.

1013
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,084
I don't know who told everyone

1014
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,838
about my dad selling offal
back in high school,

1015
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,424
but I at least know that it wasn't you.

1016
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,802
You're realizing that now?

1017
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,306
But still, thanks.

1018
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:32,269
I think we should clink our glasses now.

1019
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:36,815
All right. Here's to U-ju's safe return

1020
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,860
and Seo-jin's family
starting afresh or not.

1021
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:43,030
-My gosh, what?
-Cheers.

1022
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,157
Cheers.

1023
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,617
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1024
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,286
RESTRICTED AREA

1025
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:56,460
Mom.

1026
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,297
Let's talk quietly with your mom.

1027
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:02,758
Have a seat.

1028
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,386
Great. Good girl.

1029
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,788
Near the orphanage my mother used to run,

1030
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:35,666
there's a reputable
long-term care hospital.

1031
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:40,963
K is doing great there,
so don't worry about her.

1032
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:44,258
You said I would be punished by the gods.

1033
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,345
You try living in a hell that
you can never escape from.

1034
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,768
I said such harsh things to you.

1035
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:57,354
And...

1036
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,817
I tried to destroy your son's life.

1037
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:06,572
Why are you...

1038
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:09,325
doing this?

1039
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,827
What do you think?

1040
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:13,954
K needs

1041
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,874
someone to look after her.

1042
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,880
She even made a friend

1043
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,341
at the hospital.

1044
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,597
Don't worry about K, and be strong.

1045
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,184
You should get out of here soon
so that you can live with K.

1046
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,646
Mom.

1047
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,941
Don't cry.

1048
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,988
Mom...

1049
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,492
Yes. It's me, your mom.

1050
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:56,830
Mom, don't cry.

1051
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:01,168
Mom...

1052
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,088
Don't cry.

1053
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:12,388
Thank you.

1054
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,808
It's hot, so eat slowly.

1055
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,646
That's right.

1056
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,159
Wait, I'll open the door for you.

1057
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,913
All right, come on out.

1058
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:40,707
Slowly. Be careful. Good job.

1059
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,128
-K, you're back.
-Ga-hee!

1060
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,755
-Hello.
-Hello.

1061
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:50,008
K, I'll come back in ten days.

1062
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:51,176
Okay.

1063
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:53,512
-Get back safely.
-Please take good care of K.

1064
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,180
-Bye.
-Bye.

1065
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,684
Ga-hee!

1066
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,772
Ga-eul, hurry back.

1067
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,985
I made something delicious. Hurry up.

1068
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,529
Ga-hee, let's go eat delicious food.

1069
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,198
-Yes, let's go eat.
-She's Ga-eul, not Ga-hee.

1070
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,951
-Ga-hee.
-It's cold. Let's go inside.

1071
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,328
-I'm cold, Grandma.
-Go on in.

1072
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,107
All right, let's go.

1073
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,567
Yes, let's go.

1074
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,027
-Get in.
-Get in the car.

1075
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,777
NEW RELEASES

1076
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:34,821
GOODBYE, SKY CASTLE
BY LEE SU-IM

1077
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:36,907
LEE SU-IM

1078
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,167
Can I help you?

1079
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,713
My skin has been rough lately.

1080
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,716
I want something to make it smooth.

1081
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,310
U-JU'S MOM

1082
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,645
What could she be calling about?

1083
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,230
All right.

1084
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:10,566
Hello.

1085
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,442
What?

1086
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:14,695
They moved in already?

1087
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,573
Ye-seo's family just moved out.

1088
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,170
You should be more careful.

1089
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:36,300
Why are there so many books?

1090
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:01,700
Hello.

1091
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,912
I'm Min Ja-young and I just moved
into that house over there.

1092
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,416
Oh, I see. Nice to meet you.

1093
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,209
I came to say hello.

1094
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,629
Can I come in?

1095
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:17,132
What great timing. Everyone's here.

1096
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:19,176
Come inside.

1097
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,803
Su-han eats and poops, as usual.

1098
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:24,348
Come in.

1099
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,183
We have a guest.

1100
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,477
Hello.

1101
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,604
I'm Min Ja-young, your new neighbor.

1102
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:31,521
Hello.

1103
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:35,275
Oh, thanks.

1104
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,576
If you're a doctor,

1105
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:48,789
are you the new orthopedics doctor
at Junam University Hospital?

1106
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,125
No, that would be my husband.

1107
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,627
I was a dentist,

1108
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,129
but I quit a year ago to support the kids.

1109
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:57,756
Working moms' kids

1110
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:01,093
almost never remain
at the top of their class.

1111
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,441
By the way,

1112
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,362
have you ever heard of
an entrance exam coordinator?

1113
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,906
My older kid just started middle school

1114
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,493
and I need to start making plans
for getting him into university.

1115
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:29,329
My gosh, you're being ridiculous.

1116
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,331
You want to hire a coordinator
for a 14-year-old?

1117
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:34,126
Wait, isn't that what you all do?

1118
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,461
I moved into Sky Castle because I heard

1119
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,588
it was the best place for
the kids' education.

1120
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,341
My daughter didn't go to university.

1121
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,635
The younger twins are high school seniors,

1122
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:45,929
and they don't have a tutor.

1123
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:48,056
They just study together
with their friend.

1124
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:53,603
My son's the same age
as Seung-hye's twins.

1125
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,481
He quit school and is traveling.

1126
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,276
My son is in middle school.

1127
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:01,403
He goes to his academy
only when he wants to.

1128
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:03,655
My goodness.

1129
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,158
You people

1130
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,869
are so naive.

1131
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:11,663
Naive?

1132
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,178
Cheers.

1133
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,056
My gosh.

1134
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,199
Get in.

1135
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:57,834
I'm hungry.

1136
01:19:58,084 --> 01:19:58,960
-You're hungry?
-Yes.

1137
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,212
-Oh, dear.
-Are you?

1138
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,672
What do my princesses want to eat?

1139
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,009
YOU LOOK GREAT, U-JU!

1140
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,219
Pork ribs.

1141
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:10,013
Pork ribs? No way.

1142
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:11,139
I'm on a diet.

1143
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,725
Let's eat pasta. Pasta, Dad.

1144
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,812
No thanks. I want pork ribs.

1145
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,146
Dad, pork ribs.

1146
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,272
-Should we?
-How dare you?

1147
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:21,149
We ate what you wanted last time.

1148
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,234
Not again.

1149
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,319
Why are you two always fighting?

1150
01:20:24,402 --> 01:20:26,029
I just can't get along with her.

1151
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,657
Who eats pasta when they're on a diet?

1152
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,117
-Pork ribs.
-Let's eat pasta.

1153
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,036
Mom, Dad, pork ribs.

1154
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,038
Pork rib places don't sell pasta, do they?

1155
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:37,499
-Mom, how about pasta?
-How about pork ribs?

1156
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:39,251
-Okay?
-Let's have both.

1157
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:44,673
At a top academy that teaches math to only
the smartest students in Daechi-dong,

1158
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:49,010
this teacher taught many students
who won mathematical contests.

1159

BY LEE SU-IM

1167
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:05,832
