1
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,471
What did you just say?

2
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,765
I said you should have Hye-na
move into your place.

3
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,101
Hye-na?

4
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,061
Why?

5
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,694
Wouldn't it be wise for you to keep
the ticking bomb close by

6
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,237
while you get rid of the detonator?

7
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,655
A "ticking bomb"?

8
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,201
Not only did you make Hye-na
withdraw from the election,

9
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,912
but you also made Do-hoon's mom
stop supporting her financially.

10
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,288
On top of that,

11
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,957
she even lost her mother,
who was her only family.

12
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,085
Hye-na now has nothing to be afraid of.

13
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,007
I'm sure she knows that I have

14
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,885
firm evidence to prove that she took
Do-hoon's assessments.

15
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,180
She's a smart girl. She wouldn't do
such a reckless thing.

16
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,599
Hye-na will certainly be helpful
for Ye-bin's studies,

17
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,185
but having her around will help
Ye-seo more than anything.

18
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,770
It'll provoke her competitive spirit

19
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,606
and make sure that she can
go to university successfully.

20
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,196
If I'd have to go to such lengths,

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,451
then why did I even hire you
to coach Ye-seo?

22
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,972
Hye-na got kicked out of
the group tutoring sessions,

23
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,516
and she's now taking classes
at the academy that Ye-bin goes to.

24
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,727
Don't let her meet Ye-bin
while she's still holding a grudge.

25
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,773
I'll keep a tight rein on Ye-bin.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,694
She even lost her mother.

27
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,530
Don't you think that keeping her close by
and embracing her

28
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,408
will be better
for Ye-seo's and Ye-bin's sakes?

29
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,330
I told you that I'll keep an eye on her.

30
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,502
I urge you to reconsider my suggestion.

31
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,340
Mom, have you lost your mind?

32
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,383
Kim Hye-na?

33
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,427
You want her to move into our place? Why?

34
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,889
I never said I'd actually do it.
I'm just asking your opinion.

35
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,057
Why are you even asking about it?

36
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,392
Ye-bin said

37
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,436
she wants to study with Hye-na

38
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,229
to make sure she can pass
the level-up test.

39
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,607
This is the first time she's said
she wants to study.

40
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,693
Mom, don't you know
how I feel about Hye-na?

41
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,570
How could you say such a thing?

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,780
Okay, I heard you.

43
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,032
Don't worry about it.

44
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,159
I have no intention
of letting her move in, either.

45
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,886
Do you want this?

46
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,309
I thought it was weird.

47
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,145
Being nice to me like this
is all part of your plan, isn't it?

48
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,605
Why?

49
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,899
Do you want to live in a nice place
for once in your life?

50
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,401
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,781
You coaxed my sister so that
you can be hired as a live-in tutor.

52
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,367
What? I never did such a thing.

53
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,829
Don't even dream about it.

54
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,124
I can't live in the same house as you.

55
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,507
A live-in tutor?

56
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,788
Don't worry about Su-han.
I'll take good care of him.

57
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,164
How's Yang-u doing?

58
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,625
I practically have two sons, you know.

59
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,627
He's so nervous now.

60
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,299
He wanted me to ask you
if Dr. Kang is in a good condition.

61
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,175
He took a bath and went to bed early,

62
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,678
saying he has to do a great job
with the surgery tomorrow.

63
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,931
He'll be in his best condition.
Tell him he has nothing to worry about.

64
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:07,932
Okay.

65
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,495
Do I know you?

66
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,500
Hello, I'm Ye-seo's classmate, Kim Hye-na.

67
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,836
Hye-na?

68
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,755
Well...

69
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,132
To tell you the truth,

70
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,092
I really

71
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,386
resented you at first.

72
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,640
I know that what I did wasn't right,
even though it was for the sake

73
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,560
of earning money
for my mom's hospital's fees.

74
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,688
So I don't think
I have any right to resent you.

75
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,983
You really are a smart girl.

76
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,320
So why did you want to talk to me?

77
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,406
I heard that

78
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,242
Ye-bin is still in the beginner's class.

79
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,828
If you let me be her in-house tutor
for just three months,

80
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,830
I'll make sure she gets
into the intensive class.

81
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,083
The intensive class?

82
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,501
Skipping the intermediate class?

83
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,087
I'm not sure if Do-hoon's mom told you,

84
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,839
but I've been tutoring kids
ever since I was in middle school.

85
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,134
And all the students I taught
became top students.

86
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,678
If I fail to get her into
the intensive class in three months,

87
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,639
I'll leave your house.

88
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,433
And of course, I'll also return
the tutoring fees.

89
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,732
I was worried you might be having
a hard time after your mom passed away,

90
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,652
but I'm relieved to see
that you're pulling through.

91
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,696
But I'm sorry.

92
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,659
I can't let you become
Ye-bin's in-house tutor.

93
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,121
Instead,

94
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,124
tell me anytime you need some money.

95
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,753
I'll get going now.

96
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,948
Coach Kim, can you talk right now?

97
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,119
I gave it some thought
since you recommended it,

98
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,664
but I don't think I can let Hye-na
live in my house.

99
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,666
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

100
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,002
Please don't mention that again.

101
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,713
All right.

102
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,106
How dare she disobey me?

103
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,701
Bring Ye-seo to the meditation room
as soon as she finishes everything.

104
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,412
-But she's not scheduled to...
-Don't talk back to me!

105
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,417
Do not disobey me.

106
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,962
The finals are coming up, right?

107
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,299
Are you confident
that you'll get perfect scores this time?

108
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,052
Yes, I'm not going to
get a single question wrong.

109
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,597
You're not going to
get a single question wrong.

110
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,516
Why do you think you always end up getting

111
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,476
something wrong
even when you're so determined not to?

112
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,396
It's because you're conceited.

113
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,359
You overestimate yourself.

114
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,738
Hye-na will be more determined than ever
now that she's lost her mother.

115
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,533
Do you think you'll be able to beat her
with that mindset?

116
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,963
Don't trust yourself

117
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,757
when you take your finals this time.

118
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,803
Doubt yourself even if
you know the answer to a question.

119
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,138
Why would I, if I know the answer?

120
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,265
Kang Ye-seo!

121
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,813
Think about the speech and writing
questions you got wrong on every test.

122
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,440
Did you get them wrong
because you didn't know?

123
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,027
Keep this in mind
if you want a perfect score.

124
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,155
Don't trust yourself,
and constantly doubt yourself.

125
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,410
That's how you'll be able to beat Hye-na.

126
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,548
I'm right here. Good job, honey.

127
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,092
-Hey, Chung-seon.
-Yes?

128
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,760
Did the surgery go well?

129
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,554
The surgery went very well, Dr. Woo.

130
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,347
But why do my legs feel numb?

131
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,558
It's because the anesthesia
hasn't worn off yet.

132
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,435
-Oh, really?
-Don't worry.

133
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,438
Dr. Kang told me himself
that the surgery went well.

134
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,939
Hello, Dr. Kang.

135
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,568
My gosh. Great work, Dr. Kang.
Thank you so much.

136
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,111
It was nothing.

137
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,823
Dr. Woo's the one
who did a good job enduring the surgery.

138
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,492
How do you feel?

139
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,204
You really are the best surgeon, sir.

140
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,332
You darn punk.

141
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,335
I can't believe you snooped around
another department

142
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,670
when you're an orthopedic surgeon.

143
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,465
I would love to just break
your spine in half

144
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,050
-if I could.
-No.

145
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,218
-Well...
-By the way,

146
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,096
I guess you won't
be able to make it today, Jin-hui.

147
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,306
Today?

148
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,227
Of course, I should go.

149
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,023
He'll get better with time,
so there's no need to worry about him.

150
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,318
We should take care of the problem
that Sky Castle's facing right now.

151
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,822
Right now?

152
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,908
What's going on?

153
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,242
Didn't you hear the announcement

154
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,244
about a residents' meeting
at 8 p.m. today?

155
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,871
Get here within ten minutes.

156
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,164
It looks like the residents

157
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,875
will barge into your house
if you're even a minute late.

158
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,236
Ms. Lee,

159
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,570
please help me.

160
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,571
I want

161
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,740
to live.

162
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,826
Yeong-jae! Look at me.

163
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,328
-Are you okay? Look at me.
-Save me.

164
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,288
Yeong-jae!

165
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,642
I can't give up.

166
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,312
Such misery should never be repeated.

167
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,990
-This is unbelievable.
-Exactly.

168
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,038
It's absurd.

169
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,917
We can't just sit and watch
while something like this happens.

170
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,847
I think you should lead
the meeting, Professor Cha.

171
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,515
Me?

172
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,393
You're the one who
first brought up this issue,

173
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,729
so shouldn't you lead
the meeting, Seo-jin?

174
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,151
I'm the one who first brought it up.

175
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,070
I told everyone
after hearing about it from Su-han.

176
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,326
Whatever the case, this could
become a legal issue in the future.

177
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,745
So I think you should
take the lead, Professor Cha.

178
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,045
All right.

179
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,632
I can do that much for Sky Castle.

180
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,303
She's here.

181
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,060
It's her.

182
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,721
RESIDENTS OPPOSING
THE NOVEL ABOUT SKY CASTLE

183
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,059
The reason we're all gathered here today

184
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:16,897
is to clearly state that we,
the residents of Sky Castle,

185
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,732
strongly disapprove

186
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,110
of Ms. Lee's idea of writing a novel

187
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,362
about the misfortune that befell

188
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,573
Dr. Park and his family.

189
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,994
Aside from the residents
who are currently abroad,

190
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,080
a total of 194 residents
have signed this document.

191
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,916
SKY CASTLE RESIDENTS' SIGNATURES

192
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,044
About 99 percent of the residents
have signed this document.

193
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,798
We're all busy people.

194
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,425
We all made time to gather here

195
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,011
regardless of our busy schedule.

196
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,637
So let's hear your answer.

197
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,473
Are you going to continue
writing the novel?

198
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,654
My first book was published 15 years ago,

199
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,032
and I haven't written
anything else since then.

200
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,410
Why are you all reacting so sensitively
when I'm not even a famous writer?

201
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,455
-My gosh.
-Is she serious?

202
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,457
I don't get it, either.

203
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,334
It's not like she's trying
to publish a news article

204
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,543
about Yeong-jae and his family.

205
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,129
Is it really necessary
to go this far to stop her?

206
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,424
What are you all so scared of?

207
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,928
Why are you taking action as a group
like this? What are you all so afraid of?

208
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,097
-Is she serious?
-She's unbelievable.

209
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,977
Do you think we're doing this
because we're scared?

210
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,149
Aren't you afraid people will find out
you spend billions to send your children

211
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,901
to prestigious universities?

212
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,403
We're not afraid of that.
It's just tiresome.

213
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,281
What if people hear Yeong-jae's family
paid billions for a coordinator?

214
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,574
It'll be a huge bother.

215
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,786
People who talk about inequality
will love to talk about this.

216
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,121
We're not the only ones
living in this world.

217
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,209
We must be considerate about
the relative deprivation others will feel.

218
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,711
What?

219
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,465
That's not being considerate.
It's mocking them.

220
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,468
Mocking them?

221
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,720
Ms. Lee, why do you
misconstrue our good will?

222
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,682
How is it good will to say that
the poor have no need to know?

223
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,725
Nothing good will come from them knowing.

224
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,311
It's best off they don't know
what they can't afford to do.

225
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,231
"You can't even afford
such things, so just

226
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,941
live your lives without knowing anything"?

227
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,777
Do you have an inferiority complex?
Why are you twisting--

228
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,654
Why are you talking like that?

229
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,032
You know better than anyone
what it's like to be underprivileged.

230
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,540
So?

231
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
What exactly is it that you want to say?

232
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,045
Why are you attacking me,

233
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,880
pretending to defend the poor?

234
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,466
I know you want to hide things

235
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,593
because the coordinator
is helping your kid.

236
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,931
I get that you're encouraging others to
attack me because of your selfish love.

237
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,850
But how could you pretend

238
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,476
you're just defending the poor?

239
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,646
Have you forgotten how hard it was
when you couldn't afford your tuition?

240
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,939
Selling ox blood...

241
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,074
My gosh, what is this woman...

242
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,035
What are you saying?

243
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,579
Seo-jin.

244
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,664
What is this woman talking about?

245
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,708
Why would you

246
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,585
sell ox blood?

247
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,857
Yes.

248
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,193
I used to sell ox blood.

249
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,578
My father sold offal
next to a slaughterhouse.

250
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,208
Hey, Han Seo-jin.

251
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,251
Why not just call me Kwak Mi-hyang?

252
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,254
Why didn't you just call me
by my real name?

253
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,432
Just like how you being U-ju's
stepmother is not a problem,

254
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,102
what is wrong with me
changing my name and hiding my past?

255
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,478
This is crazy.

256
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,649
How dare you mention that
when we're here about Yeong-jae?

257
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,822
We're here because of you, not me.

258
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,241
The day we buried Myeong-ju,

259
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
I couldn't do anything.

260
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,455
Every one of us here was broken-hearted.

261
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,127
You got lucky and moved here
due to someone else's misfortune.

262
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,213
And now you want to use
her tragedy for gossip?

263
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,969
Try to calm down, Ms. Han.

264
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,600
I believe

265
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,978
we've done enough to express our opinion.

266
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,188
Ms. Lee,

267
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,690
what will you do?

268
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,618
Isn't it too harsh to demand
an answer right away?

269
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,913
We should give her some time to think.
Don't you agree, Professor Cha?

270
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,209
Then we'll give you three days to think.

271
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,920
I trust that you will give us
an answer by then.

272
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,381
Let us

273
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,049
end the meeting here.

274
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,328
Thank you, Professor Cha.

275
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,333
Seo-jin.

276
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,543
Seo-jin.

277
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,253
Seo-jin.

278
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,297
Her family sold ox blood?

279
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,801
Seo-jin.

280
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,136
Let's talk.

281
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,512
Seo-jin.

282
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,057
What was all that about?

283
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,433
It's not true,

284
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,643
right?

285
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,770
We've known each other for years.

286
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,896
That's impossible.

287
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,815
Didn't you hear me?

288
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,859
Wait.

289
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,402
Kwak Mi-hyang.

290
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,363
You're Kwak Mi-hyang?

291
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,447
Then

292
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,532
you lied about studying in Sydney?

293
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,701
And about inheriting
the expensive porcelain

294
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,911
from your mom?

295
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,537
My gosh.

296
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,414
How could you do this to me?

297
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,797
Let's talk later.

298
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,841
It's true what they say about never
knowing who people really are.

299
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,593
I really can't trust anyone!

300
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,432
Darn it, I just flinched.
It's become a habit.

301
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,103
Sure, Seo-jin. Let's talk another time.

302
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,194
Dr. Kang was in on it, too.

303
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,529
What?

304
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,781
"There are a lot of mortgage banks
in Sydney,

305
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,908
so a president of a bank
is nothing special"?

306
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,412
They both lied to us all.

307
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,967
Why didn't you just use a loudspeaker

308
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,387
to announce that
your dad was a drunk who sold offal,

309
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,682
and that he was an alcoholic
who beat his wife and daughter

310
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,684
all the time?

311
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,316
I was cornered,

312
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,277
but my husband left me alone in the room

313
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,446
because he was embarrassed.

314
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,907
There's no need to tell the others
that I had a bad father as well.

315
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,825
What?

316
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,951
I'm saying

317
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,162
that if you'd escorted me out of there,

318
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,456
we'd have felt less ashamed.

319
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,501
Those people would have gossiped anyway.

320
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,712
You just encouraged them even more.

321
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,465
So what?

322
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,508
Are you saying it's my fault?

323
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,427
It wasn't my fault that I was born

324
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,887
into such a family.

325
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,680
Even you and your mother

326
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,183
are ashamed of my father.

327
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,978
I played the role you wanted me to.

328
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,065
When I pretended to be
a bank president's daughter,

329
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,025
you played along.

330
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,445
You helped me keep up the act.

331
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,073
So when the truth came out,

332
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,950
you could've at least
pretended to support me in public.

333
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,790
You could have just yelled at me
later in private.

334
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,503
Who is she?

335
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,631
How does she know your past?

336
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,968
-We went to high school together.
-What?

337
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,970
From the same hometown?

338
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,723
And you started all this
with someone like her?

339
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,141
Did you gather signatures

340
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,811
not knowing it could blow up in your face?

341
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,646
I didn't know she'd expose me like this.

342
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,939
How could you not know?

343
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,859
Did your brilliant mind
not see that coming?

344
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,028
Ye-seo's celebration party

345
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,823
was an excuse to pressure her
to give up her story, too!

346
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,078
You're such an embarrassment.

347
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,206
My gosh.

348
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,043
She must've been so amused,
knowing you're Kwak Mi-hyang.

349
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,881
Hwang Chi-yeong must have totally
looked down on me!

350
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,384
Keep your voice down.
Ye-seo will be home soon.

351
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,010
Are you afraid the kids will hear?

352
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,930
Then you shouldn't have started this
in the first place!

353
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,602
Would you feel better
if our kids found out?

354
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,606
Haven't you yelled at me enough now?

355
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,282
Ye-seo.

356
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,498
Ye-seo.

357
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,792
Ye-seo, hear me out.

358
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,627
I'll explain everything.

359
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,511
Ye-seo. Open the door.

360
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,180
Let's talk about this.

361
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,559
My grandparents I met in Australia,
who were they?

362
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,480
They've been sending me gifts
every year on my birthday.

363
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,065
Are they...

364
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,527
fake?

365
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,992
I did it for you.
For your and Ye-bin's sakes.

366
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,663
How can that be for my sake?

367
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,249
Don't use me as your excuse.

368
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,715
I...

369
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,678
grew up under terrible parents.

370
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,351
Your grandmother tore up all my books,
saying girls don't need to study,

371
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,811
and your grandfather took
the money I earned

372
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,897
from my part-time job
and spent it on alcohol.

373
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,942
Despite that, I studied very hard
and received scholarships

374
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,402
during my years at university.

375
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,988
I suffered because of my poor,
incompetent, and ignorant parents,

376
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,698
and I don't want you to experience that.

377
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,954
Having parents like them is my flaw,
and I didn't want it

378
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,956
to become your flaw as well.

379
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,291
You said I'm bound to do well

380
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,293
because I got superb genes
from you and Dad.

381
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,340
"Superb genes."
You always went on and on about it.

382
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,217
But you were born

383
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,178
with genes like that?

384
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,642
-What?
-You're the daughter

385
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,853
of a poor, ignorant, incompetent,
and shameless drunkard.

386
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,982
You're saying I have
those inferior genes as well!

387
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,650
That's why I've done my very best

388
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,360
and even told such lies.

389
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,363
I raised you so you'd be
proud and confident!

390
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,956
Nothing's going to change.

391
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,251
You're still Kang Ye-seo,
and I'm still Han Seo-jin.

392
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,879
Pick up your bag.

393
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,426
Now!

394
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,268
A mob lynching?

395
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,190
You even had a dream about being lynched?

396
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,985
Gosh, you must be
under a lot of stress these days.

397
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,195
I've only heard about
collective selfishness.

398
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,906
Now that I've experienced it,
I realize that it's a nightmare.

399
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:03,908
Honey,

400
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,952
I obviously don't want to stop you

401
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,912
if you really want to write
a book about it,

402
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,290
but I'm worried about you getting hurt.

403
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,041
You shouldn't underestimate

404
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,252
Dr. Kang's wife.

405
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,257
She's the one who started it all,
but she distanced herself from it

406
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,050
and acted as she cares about the poor.

407
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,677
She was being so selfish.

408
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,142
I brought up her past
without even meaning to.

409
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,813
In front of all those people?

410
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,914
Even though he pretended to be modest,
he always bragged subtly

411
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,333
about his family and background.

412
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,001
Did you see Dr. Kang's face yesterday?

413
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,337
He looked mortified.

414
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,963
Honey.

415
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,341
Okay, all right.

416
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,551
Boys.

417
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,514
Don't you think your mom
is the most elegant lady in Sky Castle?

418
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,265
You can just tell she's a classy lady.

419
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,727
That's enough.

420
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,229
Eat your breakfast, okay?

421
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,731
You know that your mom's father

422
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,942
was the Army Chief of Staff
and a congressman, right?

423
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,736
Be proud, boys. You deserve to be proud.

424
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,197
-Honey.
-All right, I heard you.

425
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,575
You're working on the questions
that I gave you, right?

426
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,370
Yes, we're practically memorizing
all of them.

427
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,289
Thanks for breakfast.

428
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,084
All right. Get ready and come back down.

429
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,252
Okay.

430
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,425
What will you do
if the boys figure it out?

431
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,469
Oh, it's fine.

432
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,680
They'll find out soon anyway.

433
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,932
As they say, you can't hide
where you come from.

434
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:55,103
Look at Ye-seo. She's fixated
on being number one. How crude.

435
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,188
She's just like her mom.

436
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:01,025
Didn't you say you wanted our boys
to be like Ye-seo?

437
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,238
I never said that. I said they need
to get good grades like her.

438
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,158
I feel bad for Ye-seo's mom.

439
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,954
Now I understand why
she's so obsessed with her kids

440
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,415
getting good grades.

441
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,295
I bet Jun-sang has been hounding her.

442
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,297
He's a second-generation doctor

443
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,299
who got the highest score
on the college entrance exam.

444
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,051
That proud, arrogant jerk
must've been harassing her about it.

445
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,346
How did that show-off end up with...

446
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,643
Ox blood? My goodness.

447
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,899
Kwak Mi-hyang!

448
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,905
They're perfect for each other.

449
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,700
Even after the truth came out,
she held her head up high

450
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,201
and glared at me.

451
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,413
She totally acted like she was
from a noble family. I'm so baffled.

452
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,583
For 16 long years, for goodness' sake.
She fooled me for 16 years.

453
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,711
She deserves to win
the Cannes Best Actress Award.

454
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,381
It really is amazing.

455
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,509
It's really hard to come up
with perfectly believable lies.

456
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,720
She must have a high IQ,
200 at the very least.

457
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,307
The more I think about it,
the more upset I get.

458
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,268
Who is she to tell me
not to cross the line?

459
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,145
Don't think like that, please.

460
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,606
Regardless of her family background,

461
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,609
she is my boss' wife,
and that's what matters.

462
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,279
Don't show her that you're upset,
and be good to her.

463
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,074
I feel so betrayed
that I don't even want to see her.

464
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,033
How can I hide it?

465
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,952
-Jin Jin.
-What?

466
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,328
Come in!

467
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,288
Dr. Woo Yang-u?

468
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,539
-Yes.
-All right.

469
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,168
Oh, my goodness. What is this?

470
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,212
-I need your signature here.
-Sure.

471
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,797
My signature.

472
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,341
-Here you go. Thank you.
-Thank you.

473
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,095
My gosh, who sent this? There's a card.

474
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,013
Let's see.

475
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,268
"Wishing you a fast recovery,
from Han Seo-jin."

476
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,854
"Han Seo-jin"?

477
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,273
She can't give up on that name, can she?

478
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,608
It's from Ye-seo's mom?

479
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,152
Ms. Kwak Mi-hyang wishes you
a fast recovery.

480
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,239
Call her now and thank her.

481
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,991
No way. I can't even stand her voice.

482
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,492
Then text her.

483
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,702
I don't want to.

484
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,537
She can't visit
because she's too embarrassed.

485
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,288
That's why she sent this instead.

486
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,000
Think about it. If that hadn't happened,
she would have visited.

487
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,459
She'd have come already.

488
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,502
Jin Jin,

489
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,213
you have to be good to her now
to completely win her favor.

490
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,008
What you do when things are good
doesn't really account for much.

491
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,634
Oh, gosh.

492
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,511
Then you text her.

493
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,512
What?

494
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,813
What should I write?

495
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,662
Thank you, Seo-jin.

496
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,664
You know that I'm always
on your side, right?

497
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,917
Thanks for the fruit.
They'll help my husband recover quickly!

498
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,887
"Thank you, Professor Cha."

499
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,728
What? Ye-seo's mom is Kwak Mi-hyang?

500
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,105
I think it was a big shock to Ye-seo.

501
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,149
She can't focus at all.

502
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,280
Then her graduating from
the University of Sydney was...

503
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,450
It was a lie.

504
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,725
Kwak Mi-hyang is Han Seo-jin?

505
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,185
Han Seo-jin?

506
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,396
Kwak Mi-hyang is Han Seo-jin?

507
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,125
You know what you have to do, right?

508
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,586
Make sure Ye-seo

509
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,549
tells you everything she's feeling.

510
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,136
That way, she'll feel a little upbeat.

511
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,265
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,166
So that proud woman

513
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,668
had a huge inferiority complex?

514
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,801
Thanks to her,
everything will go as planned.

515
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,022
SONG YEON-DU

516
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,052
I can't believe I was so indifferent.

517
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,888
I forgot about
the anniversary of her death,

518
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,475
but I was reminded of it after I met you.

519
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,313
Would you like a cup of tea?

520
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,816
How's the novel going?

521
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,902
Is there anything I can help you with?

522
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,906
I'm trying to censor myself.

523
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,700
What do you mean by that?

524
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,703
Maybe I'm trying to write this novel

525
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,665
as a means to get rid of my guilt

526
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,959
about what happened with Yeon-du.

527
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,086
Or maybe it's just my greed

528
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,380
of wanting to become
a famous writer with this

529
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,091
since it'll be my first novel in 15 years.

530
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,801
To be honest,

531
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,095
I thought you were at the center

532
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,849
of the tragic event
that happened to Yeong-jae's family.

533
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,477
I thought I was a rational person.

534
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,647
But I found out I was very biased.

535
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,484
They say that humans are
not rational beings,

536
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,569
and they only tend to rationalize things.

537
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,155
Don't be too hard on yourself.

538
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,950
Anybody would've thought the same
if they were in your shoes.

539
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,916
Thank you.

540
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,378
Ye-seo has told me a lot about U-ju.

541
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,922
You raised your son very well.

542
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,799
U-ju?

543
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,594
He's like...

544
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,431
a gift from heaven.

545
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,683
I'm always grateful
that I have a son like that

546
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,977
beside me.

547
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,772
I used to have a kid

548
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,902
who was like a blessing to me as well.

549
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,994
What do you mean by "used to"?

550
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,912
I lost my child

551
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,417
in an accident.

552
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,118
I'll do your dressing.

553
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,578
Okay.

554
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,955
Dong-Hyuk,

555
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,166
my legs still feel numb.

556
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,876
Is there any bleeding?

557
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,878
Did he cut my blood vessel?

558
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,713
Why do I feel so dizzy?

559
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,049
It's because you got an injection
to relieve your back pain.

560
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,675
An injection?

561
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,053
Are you done with the dressing...

562
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,224
Oh...

563
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,558
Dr. Kang.

564
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,478
Gosh, you weakhearted punk.

565
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,647
Can't you trust me
even after taking an MRI?

566
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,981
It's clean.

567
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,441
No, it's...

568
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,819
It's not because I can't trust you.

569
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,612
Dong-hyuk,

570
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,906
will you wash Dr. Woo's hair?

571
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,367
He stinks.

572
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,701
He's taking antibiotics,

573
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,286
-so don't give him any laxatives.
-Okay.

574
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,831
This man has a very weak stomach.

575
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,380
Dr. Kang, thank you!

576
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,215
Wow.

577
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,343
I can't believe Dr. Kang
did your dressing himself.

578
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,387
He must care about you a lot.

579
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,516
Just wash my hair for me.

580
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,518
Gosh, it's killing me.

581
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,979
My goodness.

582
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,860
Oh, Dr. Hwang. Come on in.

583
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,904
Come here and sit down.

584
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,826
So...

585
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,995
have you given it some thought?

586
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,707
Like I told you already,

587
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,167
I don't think...

588
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,170
My gosh, look at you.

589
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,882
I just want to play golf with you
and some others on the weekend.

590
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,467
What's so hard about that?

591
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,594
It's not hard.

592
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,971
However, not only am I bad at
playing golf,

593
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,639
but I also haven't contacted Mr. Kim

594
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,309
ever since he got elected
as the party representative.

595
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,019
I felt that

596
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,854
that was the right thing to do.

597
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,231
My gosh.

598
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,027
I only asked because I heard
you two were close.

599
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,696
Forget about it.

600
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,658
I'll get going then.

601
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,789
Dr. Hwang.

602
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,416
Yes, sir?

603
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,585
It's great to walk the right path,

604
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,754
but you know what they say
about clear water.

605
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,465
"There aren't any big fish

606
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,717
if the water's too clear."

607
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,851
I have no intention of
living as muddy water

608
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,645
just because I miss the fish.

609
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,195
Go ahead.

610
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,949
Hello.

611
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,038
According to Mr. Lim,
the relationship between

612
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:25,167
the thousand-year-old
tortoise and Dr. Hwang is falling apart.

613
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,752
They seemed to be on great terms to me.

614
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,797
The tortoise scouted Dr. Hwang
so that he could use him

615
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,715
as a stepping stone for his success.

616
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,802
A stepping stone for his success?

617
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,303
According to Mr. Lim's hunch,

618
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,431
it looks like he wants to become
the Minister of Health and Welfare.

619
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,395
He's just the president of a hospital,

620
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,981
and he wants to become
the control tower of a department

621
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,774
that takes up 40 percent
of our country's budget?

622
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,025
I know, right?

623
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,069
What does he know about
pensions or welfare?

624
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,655
He must think he can get anything
by lobbying people.

625
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,116
By the way,

626
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,369
how does Dr. Hwang know
the leader of the ruling party?

627
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,081
When Sungjoo Medical Center
was being closed down,

628
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,749
he apparently protested until the end

629
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,251
and took care of the patients there.

630
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,671
And Kim Hyeok-jae, a member of
the Health and Social Affairs Committee,

631
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,966
was also against it,
and he even went on a hunger strike.

632
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,135
So because of that, they're really close.

633
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,264
He wanted to use that dull prick
as a stepping-stone to success?

634
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,600
It was a very bad choice.

635
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,353
Dr. Kang.

636
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,940
The Planning Manager position is vacant.

637
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,400
So don't you think

638
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,945
you should win the Director's favor?

639
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,825
What's the point in trying to win
that useless man's favor?

640
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,438
If I become the Planning Manager,

641
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,445
becoming the chief
of the center will be easy.

642
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,698
KIM HYEOK-JAE

643
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,951
KIM HYEOK-JAE

644
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,372
He graduated from Namseok High School.

645
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,999
And majored in public administration
at Hanguk University.

646
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,170
Gosh, we didn't go to
any of the same school.

647
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,472
It's me.

648
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,891
Did anyone

649
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,060
in Sky Castle go to Namseok High?

650
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:49,895
Who?

651
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,313
Professor Cha?

652
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,442
Why that jerk of all people?

653
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,805
Professor Cha?

654
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,641
Hello, this is Kang Jun-sang.

655
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,981
We're the dads of
the student body presidents.

656
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,066
We've been too distant.

657
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,570
I would like to buy you a drink.

658
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,239
Are you free this evening?

659
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,740
Today?

660
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,951
I'm not sure.

661
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,787
I'll check my schedule first.

662
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,080
All right.

663
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,542
What's this sneaky fool up to?

664
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,420
Since when were we close enough
to drink together?

665
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,504
Hello.

666
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,218
I'm sorry, I have other plans today.

667
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,053
Oh, do you?

668
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,389
That's a shame.

669
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,726
I was hoping we could meet

670
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,479
and discuss our children's education.

671
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,067
Thank you for canceling your plans

672
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,861
to meet with me.

673
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,867
I must push everything aside
if it's about our kids' education.

674
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,412
Everyone just tends to get greedy.

675
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,665
It's hard to meet someone who truly cares.

676
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:37,628
It's an honor to have a neighbor like you.

677
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,550
People

678
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:47,554
used to say that an uninterested dad
was a prerequisite to a good education.

679
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,932
That's not true anymore.

680
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,559
University admission processes
are so complicated now,

681
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,811
and rather than an attentive mom,

682
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,690
they say an attentive dad
is ten times more effective.

683
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,150
The time has come

684
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,694
for the dads to get involved.

685
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,737
That's correct.

686
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,781
The dads' time has come.

687
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,370
You are

688
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,123
different because you're from
the great Namseok High.

689
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,877
I heard that

690
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,672
many great people graduated
from that school.

691
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:22,923
Of course.

692
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,968
During my time, over 150 students a year
got into Seoul National University.

693
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,389
The previous Prosecutor General
was an alumnus.

694
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,934
Supreme Court Justice Park
is seven years my senior.

695
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,147
And Kim Hyeok-jae,
the party representative...

696
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,906
Hyeok-jae?

697
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,076
We grew up in the same neighborhood.

698
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,205
Did you?

699
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,751
But...

700
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,171
what about him?

701
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:10,470
Well, why don't we drink some more first?

702
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,111
All right.

703
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,615
Let's drink.

704
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,201
Can we talk?

705
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,413
It'll only take five minutes.

706
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,509
I shouldn't have gotten emotional.

707
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:31,927
Even if I did,

708
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,554
I shouldn't have blurted that out.

709
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,848
It was careless of me

710
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,352
to bring up the ox blood.

711
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,438
I'm so sorry.

712
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,732
Just tell me if you'll write
about Yeong-jae or not.

713
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,448
I also apologize
for getting Coach Kim wrong.

714
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,327
It turns out that she and I
have a connection.

715
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,166
-A connection?
-She taught a student

716
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,545
I met while I was a student teacher
during my university days.

717
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,132
The student died after arguing
with her family about her grades.

718
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,009
She still remembers that girl
after 19 years.

719
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,762
She wouldn't have used
Yeong-jae's vengeful spirit.

720
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,725
I was narrow-minded.

721
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,103
You suspected Coach Kim
for being at the center of the tragedy.

722
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,731
You must have lost
your motivation to write, then.

723
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,275
You're right.

724
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,903
But like you said,

725
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,656
I can focus on
Yeong-jae's parents instead.

726
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,867
What do you know about his parents?

727
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
Coach Kim said she would help.

728
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,705
She said that?

729
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,627
I'd like to prevent the tragedy
that befell Yeong-jae's family

730
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,672
from becoming some kind of gossip
that people talk about over drinks.

731
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,300
I really

732
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,594
wanted to apologize to you about this.

733
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,845
Are we done?

734
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:15,989
Coach Kim.

735
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,493
Did you say you'd help
U-ju's mom with her novel?

736
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,787
I'm meeting her to stop her.

737
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,956
You collected signatures
and said you'd sue her.

738
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,250
Couldn't that also become a scandal?

739
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,377
You must be careful.

740
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,755
Nothing good will come from
starting a scandal

741
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,507
before Ye-seo gets into university.

742
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,467
Right. I see that.

743
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,261
Then I'll let you deal with U-ju's mom.

744
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,263
Yes, I'll deal with her.

745
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,724
Oh, right.

746
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,644
Is there a problem at home?

747
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,022
A problem?

748
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,607
What kind of problem could there be?

749
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,235
Ye-seo is unusually antsy and sensitive.

750
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,029
Please ensure she's in good health
and spirits before her exams.

751
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,992
She'll ace her finals as well, right?

752
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,874
Don't talk to anyone
and pass the papers back.

753
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:26,726
Number two?

754
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,478
Number three?

755
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,398
Three?

756
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,483
Keep this in mind
if you want a perfect score.

757
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,862
Don't trust yourself,
and constantly doubt yourself.

758
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,823
That's how you'll be able to beat Hye-na.

759
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,511
Darn it, number two.

760
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,399
How many did you get wrong?

761
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,859
Three in Korean.

762
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,322
What do I do?

763
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,532
Three?

764
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,827
That's just three wrong in total.

765
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,455
The results aren't even out yet.
When you got one wrong last time,

766
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,415
you said you wouldn't come first.

767
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,751
Hye-na got perfect scores
in every subject.

768
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,590
She got every single question right
in every single subject!

769
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,635
She outdid me in the assessments as well.
What should I do?

770
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,262
What do I do now?

771
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,307
What do I do now?

772
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,502
Let's see.

773
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,004
How much did their ranks go up this time?

774
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,297
Report card.

775
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,465
Cha Seo-jun.

776
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,050
CHA SEO-JUN, SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL

777
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,594
LEVEL, RANK, TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS

778
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,845
Level two?

779
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,057
Cha Gi-jun.

780
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,775
Level two?

781
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,071
What happened?

782
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,115
I gave you boys
all the expected exam questions.

783
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,617
They covered most of the questions
on your actual exams.

784
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,328
Why did your grades drop?

785
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,372
I guess many other students
did well this time too.

786
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,707
You stay out of this.

787
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,253
Cha Seo-jun.

788
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,259
Cha Gi-jun.

789
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,761
Are you not going to answer me?

790
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,733
Our friends

791
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,610
were really worried about their grades,

792
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,405
so we shared the questions with them.

793
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,284
Share?

794
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,411
Do you even know how much...

795
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,169
I gave them to you so that
you two could study them.

796
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,795
Why share them with your competitors?

797
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,423
Our friends were so stressed out
about their grades.

798
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,716
What's wrong with sharing them?

799
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,509
You mindless idiot.

800
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,511
They're your competitors.

801
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,930
It's the same thing as sharing
your bullets with your enemies.

802
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,641
Didn't I tell you to think of
your school as a battlefield?

803
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,477
Everyone beside yourself is the enemy!

804
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,520
If you don't kill them, you will die.

805
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,981
Do you boys want to die? Do you?

806
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,743
-Do you want a glass of water?
-That's not important right now.

807
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,709
Do you boys want to go
to university or not?

808
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,922
Everyone is trying their best
to get into a good university.

809
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,549
Do you think you can beat them
with that kind of mindset?

810
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,927
You told us to compete in good faith.

811
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,555
We can't compete in good faith
if we consider our friends as enemies.

812
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,726
Boys, you're old enough to understand
what I really meant by that.

813
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,645
In any competition,
you either win or lose.

814
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,438
There are only two outcomes.

815
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,775
Only when you win can you say that
you competed in good faith.

816
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,110
Don't you get it?

817
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,699
I'm telling you to win. To win!

818
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:52,784
Boys.

819
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,037
You understand what your dad
is trying to tell you, right?

820
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:57,747
Yes.

821
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,083
Yes, we'll get better grades next time.

822
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,001
Good.

823
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,586
Now, go and study.

824
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,971
Those clueless losers.

825
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,057
Those questions cost me so much.
I can't believe they shared them.

826
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,725
Honey.

827
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,979
Do you realize you're being
overly anxious about their grades?

828
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,022
As they say, what kills you in the desert

829
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,900
isn't the heat or your thirst,
but your anxiety.

830
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:26,860
You should...

831
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,654
believe in them and be supportive.

832
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,498
That's why the boys can't do better.

833
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,844
I don't agree with your dad.

834
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,637
You did the right thing.

835
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,265
You should only compete with yourself.

836
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,768
Competing with others makes you lonely.

837
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,647
I believe true success is living
a life that's not lonely.

838
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,066
-Do you agree?
-Agreed.

839
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,236
-Great. Let's eat, boys.
-It looks so good.

840
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,072
Mom, let's clink our glasses first.

841
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,616
Shall we?

842
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,994
Here's to lives that are not lonely.

843
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,162
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

844
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,082
I heard you came in first place
on the finals.

845
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,876
It made me so happy.

846
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,338
Yes. That news made me
incredibly happy as well, Hye-na.

847
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,173
Thank you.

848
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,718
My sincere congratulations to you, Hye-na.

849
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,095
You're really cool. I admit it.

850
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,725
People will think that he's the one
with the highest score.

851
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,685
Come on.

852
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,979
My grades have improved as well.

853
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,814
Second place in our year.

854
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,234
U-ju has a great personality.

855
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,569
I guess he takes after the two of you.

856
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,113
Who? Him?

857
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,782
You think he has a good personality?

858
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,908
My goodness.

859
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,330
When Ye-seo got the highest score
and I only came in second,

860
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,332
I couldn't congratulate her.

861
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,168
"I have to do better next time.
I must beat her."

862
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,920
That was the only thought I had.

863
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,131
By the way,

864
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,800
I wonder if Ye-seo is okay.

865
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,593
She must be so upset now.

866
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:19,889
I don't want to eat.

867
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,766
I said I won't eat anything.

868
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:26,521
You're the one who messed up on your
exams. Why are you taking it out on us?

869
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,399
Whose fault is it that I messed up
on my exams?

870
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,026
It's all your fault, Mom.

871
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,696
I couldn't focus on studying
because of you.

872
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,199
Hey, how could you mess up on your exam
just because Mom lied?

873
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,076
Get lost!

874
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:48,585
Ye-seo, doing badly on your exams once
doesn't mean it's the end of the world.

875
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,837
What will you do if I can't get into
SNU's med school?

876
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,214
Will you take responsibility for it?

877
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,134
Are you going to blame
every single thing on me?

878
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,385
Why are you being so pathetic?

879
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,348
Yes,

880
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,349
I'm pathetic.

881
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,811
It's because I'm your daughter.
Didn't you know?

882
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,406
Ye-seo.

883
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:19,616
Ye-seo.

884
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,337
She came in fourth?

885
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,174
You know who's responsible
for the drop in her grades, right?

886
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,302
Answer me.

887
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,262
Where's that woman who confidently said

888
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,931
she's Kwak Mi-hyang
in front of all those people?

889
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:48,353
Where's that arrogant woman
who lectured me for not siding with her?

890
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,446
Ye-seo.

891
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,834
Do you want to join us?

892
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,378
It's so refreshing.

893
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,382
Hey.

894
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,218
Are you still against me
moving in as a live-in tutor?

895
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,679
I can be a great tutor to Ye-bin.

896
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,057
-Hey, Kim Hye-na.
-To be honest,

897
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,393
my lease is up, so I'll have to find

898
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,436
a small room somewhere for the time being.

899
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,147
I'm a little scared though.

900
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:36,359
And it's not like the rooms are all cheap.

901
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,277
You should've told me sooner.

902
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:41,114
I can talk to my mom about it
if you're okay with it.

903
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,122
Thank you,

904
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,208
but I don't want to
inconvenience her any further.

905
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,547
Ye-seo, I just need a place
to sleep in and some food to live on.

906
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,924
I can be an excellent tutor to Ye-bin.

907
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,968
Can you please help me out?

908
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,058
Ye-seo.

909
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,395
Grandma.

910
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,649
Ye-seo told me everything.

911
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,069
I heard about her grades dropping,
so I came by to see her.

912
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,821
I guess I made the right decision.

913
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,115
You should've been careful.

914
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,326
How could you let such a thing happen?

915
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,871
-I'm sorry.
-You told all those lies,

916
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,206
so you should've made sure
not to get caught.

917
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,624
Now, everyone knows that you lied.

918
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,169
Think about how embarrassed
your kids and Jun-sang must be.

919
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,006
Even I'm this upset.

920
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,759
No wonder Ye-seo did badly on her exam.

921
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,011
Sure, your background is a problem,

922
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,971
but the bigger problem
is your incessant lying.

923
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,348
You lie without even batting an eye.

924
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,142
Do you know how scary that is?

925
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:52,351
I wanted to spare her life.

926
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,148
I lied to you because I wanted
to save Ye-seo's life.

927
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,400
-What did you say?
-Had I told you the truth,

928
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,903
you would've made me get an abortion.

929
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,491
I did everything I could
to save my daughter's life.

930
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,452
So you dared to hire people
to act like your parents

931
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,245
and fool me as well as my son?

932
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,247
Have you forgotten what you did

933
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,666
to Eun-hye for her family
not being up to your standards?

934
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,834
I witnessed all of it.

935
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,462
I wasn't dumb enough
to tell you the truth after that.

936
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,299
I'll make sure Ye-seo gets into
SNU's med school. Don't worry.

937
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,885
After all,
that's the give-and-take between us.

938
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:26,844
So?

939
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,013
Are you telling me to stay out of it?

940
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,098
I'd appreciate that.

941
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,350
What?

942
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,144
Ye-seo's grades dropped because of you.

943
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,980
How can you have the audacity
to talk back to my mother?

944
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,233
Can she even get into
SNU with those grades?

945
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,109
We paid that coordinator billions of won.

946
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,820
What has she been doing?

947
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,579
These are the candidate profiles
for the Korean instructor position.

948
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,137
Hello.

949
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,474
Let's go inside.

950
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,562
Mr. Jo, please bring out some tea.
I'll have an espresso.

951
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,605
I'll just have a glass of cold water.

952
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,441
Sure, no problem.

953
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,570
She has always been the top student,

954
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,738
but she came in fourth this time.

955
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,202
Why did Ye-seo's grades drop?

956
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,207
Are you sure there's no problem at home?

957
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,585
I clearly told you that there aren't
any problems at home.

958
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:43,921
My teaching methods
haven't changed at all.

959
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:46,299
But Ye-seo's grades suddenly dropped,

960
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,468
so I simply wanted to ask
if everything is okay at home.

961
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,473
Ms. Han, Ye-seo is mentally weak.

962
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,184
Even a small stimulus
can make her shatter like glass.

963
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,644
Why are you saying that she's weak?

964
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,439
Ye-seo is very competitive
and extremely goal-oriented.

965
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,983
Sure, maybe in the cushy environment
you've created for her.

966
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,193
But once she steps out of that bubble,

967
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,070
she won't survive
even the smallest hardship.

968
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,451
I'm trying to make her stronger
through mind-control training,

969
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:16,621
but I don't know what else
will make her falter down the road.

970
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:20,499
Do you realize how irresponsible
you sound right now?

971
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,635
I'm suggesting an alternative, Ms. Han.

972
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,470
An alternative?

973
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,430
Have Hye-na move into your place.

974
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:41,187
I clearly told you
not to bring that up ever again.

975
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,445
You must be aware of how unstable
Ye-seo is at the moment.

976
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,075
She'll fall apart
if you don't take drastic measures.

977
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:57,161
For someone who is mentally fragile
like her, nothing's more effective

978
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,080
than having a competitor
right before her eyes.

979
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:03,125
Ye-seo really hates Hye-na.

980
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,418
What if it backfires?

981
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,379
Who will take responsibility for that?

982
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,715
Ms. Han, I'm trying
to sort things out here.

983
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,092
If you miss the timing,

984
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,511
Ye-seo will have to give up
on SNU's medical school.

985
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,346
If that damages my reputation,

986
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,016
will you take responsibility for it?

987
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:33,030
Create an environment where
she can solely focus on her grades.

988
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,241
And I'm saying you can use Hye-na
to achieve just that.

989
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:36,951
Hye-na

990
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:41,414
is the best pacemaker
who can toughen up Ye-seo.

991
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,034
Seeing Ye-bin this excited

992
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:02,036
makes me look forward to the results.

993
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,038
You think you can get Ye-bin
into the intensive class?

994
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,290
How are you going to do
what the top teachers failed to do?

995
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:09,043
Can Hye-na tutor Su-han as well?

996
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,669
Shouldn't you know better?

997
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,963
You're acting just like a Kwak Mi-hyang.

998
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,007
-Dad!
-My gosh.

999
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,759
Se-ri!

1000
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,719
She's going to quit writing
about Yeong-jae?

1001
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,763
How did you manage
to convince that stubborn woman?

1002
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,556
You shouldn't worry about that anymore.

1003
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,475
Her new Korean teacher
used to make questions

1004
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,227
for the CSATs. You know that, right?

1005
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,812
I was taken aback as well.

1006
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,897
She threw a total fit.

1007
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,441
She won't let me go into her room.

1008
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,780
