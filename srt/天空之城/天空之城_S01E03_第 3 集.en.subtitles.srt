1
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,756
I don't want to live in hell anymore.

2
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,633
My life as your son...

3
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,219
was a living hell for me.

4
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,789
Ms. Han.

5
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,542
What brings you here at this hour?

6
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,972
You knew, didn't you?

7
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,808
Myeong-ju died because of you.

8
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,726
Yeong-jae's mom is dead.

9
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,728
Because of you.

10
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,981
You completely destroyed
that family, and what?

11
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,817
Your relationship with your clients
ends as soon as they get accepted?

12
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,361
It sounds like
there's been a misunderstanding.

13
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,071
You told him to get his revenge!

14
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,656
"Like Coach Kim told me,

15
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,242
I'll put up with this
just until I get accepted.

16
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,328
And I'll throw my acceptance letter
at her and leave."

17
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,831
It's all written in Yeong-jae's diary.

18
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,834
No teacher wants their students to fail.

19
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,920
I simply used Yeong-jae's desires

20
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,883
in order to make sure he can obtain
the best results possible.

21
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,595
"The best results possible"?

22
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,640
And you do that by urging students
to get back at their parents?

23
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,434
That's your secret
to a perfect acceptance rate?

24
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,769
The one who wanted
to make him the top student at all cost

25
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,855
was his mother, Ms. Lee Myeong-ju.

26
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,274
How dare you! Shall I rip your jaw open?

27
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,028
-What mom in the world--
-No matter what.

28
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,533
She wanted him to be the top
of his class at all costs.

29
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,534
So?

30
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,995
Were you going to make my daughter

31
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,789
turn out like Yeong-jae at all costs?

32
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,084
Were you going to see me
end up like Myeong-ju?

33
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,545
You're...

34
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,673
not a coach. You're guilty
of solicitation to commit murder.

35
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,137
What did you...

36
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,599
-just say?
-You killed her.

37
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,561
The person who drove Myeong-ju
to commit suicide was you, not Yeong-jae.

38
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,319
Let me make one thing clear to you.

39
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,280
Sorting out family problems
isn't my responsibility.

40
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,743
That family's misfortune
was caused by their own actions.

41
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,162
As an admission expert,
I hold no responsibility for it.

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,792
So you've done nothing wrong.

43
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,878
He got into SNU's med school.

44
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,047
It adds to your track record,

45
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,383
and you can wash your hands off
after getting paid.

46
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,513
-Then you can end it.
-Of course, I'll end it.

47
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,598
Do you think I can trust you
to coach my daughter?

48
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,934
I'll give you a refund.
Send me your account number.

49
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,644
Make sure you send the full amount.

50
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,480
How did I trust a piece of trash like you?

51
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,024
Frankly, I want to sue you
for compensation.

52
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,239
For this accident,
let's sort it out on our own.

53
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,264
Mom!

54
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,267
I'm starving.

55
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,438
Ye-seo, I can't pick you up anymore.

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,982
Ask your mother for the details.

57
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,695
How shameless and brazen.

58
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,823
Leave my daughter to her?

59
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,783
I avoided a disaster.

60
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,454
MY PRINCESS

61
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,582
Hello sweetie, are you done?

62
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,917
Mom, Mr. Jo won't pick me up.

63
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:37,754
What?

64
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,631
Those jerks.

65
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,592
They should at least bring her home.

66
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,676
What?

67
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,428
Nothing. I'll come and get you.

68
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,305
I'll be there. Wait just a bit.

69
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,974
Yes, ten minutes. I'll be there in ten.

70
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,984
Were you going to make my daughter
turn out like Yeong-jae?

71
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,820
Were you going to see me
end up like Myeong-ju?

72
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,864
You killed her.

73
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,117
The person who drove Myeong-ju
to commit suicide was you, not Yeong-jae.

74
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,431
Call the insurance company.

75
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,849
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,143
Goodnight.

77
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,853
Ms. Kim.

78
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,482
Did Ye-seo's mother find out?

79
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,905
Mr. Jo. We did our best for our client.

80
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,782
We got him into SNU Medical School.

81
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,742
That concluded our mission.

82
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,245
But Yeong-jae didn't register--

83
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,996
Don't mind whether he did or not.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,333
We get them in.
We don't teach or guide children.

85
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,044
Don't think you're a teacher
just because you're called that.

86
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,839
-I apologize.
-Ye-seo will call.

87
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,006
Don't ever answer.

88
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,049
Okay.

89
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,961
Do you not want to study again?

90
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,551
Isn't it even worse
because your mother tells you to?

91
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,890
Then shall I tell you
an interesting story?

92
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,436
Once upon a time,

93
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,731
there was an elderly couple
with three sons.

94
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,276
All three passed the state exam

95
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,320
and returned to their hometown
as officials.

96
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,657
The overjoyed parents
hosted a party for the villagers

97
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,784
and danced all over the place.

98
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:59,038
But all three sons fell from their horses
and died on the spot.

99
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,125
The mother felt so wronged
that she visited the underworld

100
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,962
and wailed as she asked
the king of the underworld.

101
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,297
"Why did you take my sons?

102
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,717
And why did you take all three together?"

103
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,637
Then

104
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,807
the king of the underworld
put a mirror before her

105
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,184
that showed her past.

106
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,979
The couple owned an inn
when they were younger.

107
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,314
They wanted their customers' money,

108
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,983
so they killed them

109
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,944
and buried them
underneath the kitchen floor.

110
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,862
The three men they'd killed

111
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,073
were reincarnated
as the couple's three sons.

112
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,617
They were called child geniuses
as they grew up,

113
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,121
and the couple loved them
more than anything.

114
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,791
They passed the state exam

115
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,419
and made their parents happier
than ever before,

116
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,213
and then died that very instant.

117
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,096
That's how they got their revenge.

118
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,767
They obeyed their parents
and lived the lives expected of them,

119
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,562
and when their parents
were at their happiest,

120
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,814
they crushed it in one go.

121
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,528
Because that is true revenge.

122
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,638
PARK YEONG-JAE

COACH KIM JU-YEONG

126
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,590
Something is strange?

127
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,427
What do you mean?

128
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,890
When I was out exercising...

129
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,851
About the family who lived
in your house before.

130
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,478
Do you know why they moved?

131
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,772
No. Why did they move?

132
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,275
The mom...

133
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,027
killed herself.

134
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,239
So everyone left.
Her husband and Yeong-jae.

135
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,950
But everyone pretends
as if they never existed.

136
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,368
It's so irritating.

137
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,088
A person who lived
in this house killed herself.

138
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,715
It bothers me.

139
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,634
There must've been a reason.

140
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,635
Don't let it get to you.

141
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,596
You're right.

142
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,642
But I feel bad because we got this lucky

143
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,354
at the expense
of the previous residents' misfortune.

144
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,607
That's it?

145
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,069
I thought you felt jinxed or something.

146
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,321
Why would I?

147
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,616
Let's pray for the deceased

148
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,702
and the remaining family.

149
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,662
Yes, sure, madam.

150
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,707
Come on, don't brush me off.

151
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,917
Okay, I won't.

152
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:35,713
I swear I married a great woman.

153
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,632
Now you know?

154
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,969
Isn't it a relief I even found out?

155
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,264
Keep reminding me
every now and then, Su-im.

156
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,391
Do I have to remind you?

157
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,476
Of course.

158
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,353
I won't know if you don't tell me.

159
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,063
Shall I remind you now then?

160
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,357
How? Like this? How's this?

161
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,193
-Yes, like that.
-Is this working?

162
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,081
Mom, do you hear that? Dad's laughing.

163
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,460
You don't have to worry now.

164
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,880
Both Dad and I are doing well.

165
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,134
Good morning.

166
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,137
Hi, hello.

167
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,805
-Welcome.
-Hello.

168
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,058
-Where is the director?
-Come this way.

169
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,851
We're here.

170
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,353
-Help me out.
-Okay.

171
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,230
-Come this way.
-Okay.

172
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,607
Isn't that a celebrity?

173
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,484
Chan-mi?

174
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,694
-It hurts.
-Are you sleepy?

175
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,613
-If you're sleepy--
-My back hurts.

176
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,781
Okay.

177
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,284
I'll talk to the director
about your surgery.

178
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,662
-My hair.
-Keep it on.

179
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,372
Don't take any photos.

180
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,831
-Coming through.
-Let us through.

181
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,333
AOA's Chan-mi?

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,460
She hurt her back.

183
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,338
Her back? Hey, just a moment.

184
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,132
She came to our hospital?

185
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,262
The director's best friend's son
is her agency's representative.

186
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,514
What?

187
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,141
Her back...

188
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,226
Orthopedics...

189
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,104
Wow. Let's put on some makeup.

190
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,899
Good news. I bring good news.

191
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,359
What is it this morning?

192
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,027
It's fresh from the oven.

193
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,614
AOA's Chan-mi came to our hospital
for her back surgery.

194
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,783
A-what?

195
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,538
Shake your hips

196
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,003
You don't know the song?

197
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,255
It's really popular.

198
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,633
You're a professor.

199
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,595
Can't you stay classy
regardless of who the patient is?

200
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,181
The thing is,
her agency's representative...

201
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,311
is the director's best friend's son.

202
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,771
What does that have to do with anything?

203
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,106
All patients are the same.

204
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,566
Don't be like that.

205
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,777
The two old men are such good friends

206
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,615
that I heard the director adores him
like his own son.

207
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,074
So what?

208
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,786
If you do an excellent job
with the surgery,

209
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,829
who knows?

210
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:18,751
We might be able to win Director Choi over
and make him favor our department.

211
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,211
Make him favor us? As if.

212
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,380
Are we his court ladies or what?

213
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,758
Well, that's not what I meant.

214
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,265
Yes, Kang Jun-sang speaking.

215
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,185
Right now?

216
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,562
Sure, I'll be right there.

217
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,608
Nice. That must've been his secretary.

218
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,734
Right?

219
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,153
Who is this girl
that I'm being summoned for?

220
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,530
I bet Director Choi wants
to ask you himself.

221
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,241
You're the best spine specialist
at our hospital.

222
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,827
He should show you
at least this much respect

223
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,081
for you to gladly show off your skills.

224
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,208
Sir.

225
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,417
Sir!

226
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,753
You have nothing to worry
about the surgery.

227
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,421
Yes, come in.

228
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,257
Hey.

229
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,927
Welcome, Dr. Kang.

230
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,055
You have surgery scheduled
for next Monday morning, right?

231
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,182
Yes, I do. From 10 a.m.

232
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,350
Really?

233
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,061
Let's see. Let me have a look.

234
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,272
Operating Room 10, 11, and 12?

235
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,150
You're doing three operations at once?

236
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,068
No,

237
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,655
I booked Operating Room 12 just in case.

238
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,532
Goodness.

239
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,284
Why are you so greedy
when it comes to operations?

240
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,413
You are to blame
for the shortage of operating rooms.

241
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,707
Both operations are simple discectomy,

242
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,042
so if it's done in Operating Room 12,

243
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,711
it'll certainly be doable.

244
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,795
Is that right?

245
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,213
Come in.

246
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,552
Dr. Hwang.

247
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,557
Come join us. Have a seat here.

248
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,642
Sure.

249
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,358
Dr. Kang said that he had booked
Room 12 just in case.

250
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,609
So don't worry,

251
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,487
and take care of the surgery
Monday morning.

252
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,532
-Please take good care of her.
-Yes, he will.

253
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,034
Oh, of course.

254
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,667
You're still here?
You should get back to work.

255
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,753
You must be busy. Get going.

256
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,050
Sure.

257
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,559
This is Dr. Hwang.

258
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,354
It'll be much better
than orthopedic surgery,

259
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,232
where the surgeon wears magnifying glasses

260
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,318
and drills screws into the bones.

261
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,112
Dr. Hwang will use the microscope

262
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,615
to minimize the possibility
of nerve damage.

263
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,785
Dr. Hwang's papers
are highly acclaimed internationally,

264
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,287
and the way he performs surgery
is like art.

265
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:04,166
Oh, my. I'll trust
that she's in good hands.

266
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,752
Where's the report
that was approved this morning?

267
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,170
-Oh, that.
-Right, it's here.

268
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,713
JUNAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

269
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,507
My gosh, don't you worry.

270
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,727
What's going on?

271
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,272
Gosh, who knows? What exactly is going on?

272
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,608
-Shake your hips
-Shake your hips

273
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,407
-Shake your hips
-Shake your hips

274
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,619
My, look at that waist.

275
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,330
Gosh. They are so hot.

276
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,041
Hey, guys.

277
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,503
Listen. I'll take the surgery consent form
to Chan-mi, okay?

278
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,504
Hey.

279
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,965
That's what first-year staffs do.

280
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,801
You'll take the consent form to her
when you're in your fourth year?

281
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,011
Gosh, you're such a punk.

282
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,475
Shall I take it to her?

283
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,438
It will be an honor for Chan-mi.

284
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,235
-Right?
-Yes.

285
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,404
-She'll be honored, right?
-Of course, she'd be thrilled.

286
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,282
-Shake your hips
-Shake your hips

287
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,745
What in the world are you doing?

288
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,040
Don't you have work to do?

289
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,627
Oh, yes.

290
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,505
Hey, what happened
to the patient in Room 402?

291
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,432
Is she not having the surgery?

292
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,810
You little...

293
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:05,204
WALNUT TREE GARDEN

294
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,420
Who is it?

295
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,885
What brings you here?

296
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,346
Do you want to go for a picnic?

297
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,639
I made some sandwiches.

298
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,683
That'd be great. It's a lovely day.

299
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,853
It's so nice here.

300
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,606
This beautiful park
is right in front of my place.

301
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,485
The view is breathtaking indeed.

302
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,695
The people who live here are the problem.

303
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,242
Well, if you don't mind,

304
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,454
can you tell me about the people
who used to live at my place?

305
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,167
What exactly happened to them?

306
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,171
I guess life...

307
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,091
isn't much different for everyone.

308
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,718
Every woman in Sky Castle

309
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,930
envied Myeong-ju,
who used to live in that house.

310
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,891
Her husband was very successful.

311
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,185
He was going to be Junam University
Hospital's next director.

312
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,520
Her son got into SNU's med school,

313
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,605
which meant that he'll become
a third-generation doctor.

314
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,608
So she went on a cruise
to reward herself for her hard work.

315
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,819
Then why did she...

316
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,072
Who knows?

317
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,493
I'm not sure why Myeong-ju
made such a decision.

318
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,080
But that night,

319
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,041
I happened to see her
and her husband fighting.

320
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,085
That really shocked me

321
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,463
because they were known
as a loving couple.

322
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,008
I was a fool. Only then did I realize

323
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,593
what you see isn't always the whole truth.

324
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,512
All the women in Sky Castle...

325
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,513
I mean,

326
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,057
even I am no different.

327
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,020
Everyone tries so hard
to only show each other good things.

328
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,772
All the moms here pretend
they don't do anything extra,

329
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,524
but they're all experts
in private education.

330
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,403
Now, you probably know
what you've stirred up here.

331
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,532
They must all hate me.

332
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,117
I bet Ye-seo's mom

333
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,453
is looking for an opportunity
to teach you a lesson.

334
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,080
Both Ye-seo and U-ju
got in as number one, you know.

335
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:13,957
Oh, right.

336
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,210
About U-ju...

337
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,342
What's his secret
to getting such good grades?

338
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,930
I'm just so curious.

339
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,932
What do you do for him?

340
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,602
How could he get such good grades
without any private education?

341
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,896
If I could forgo
private education altogether...

342
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,108
I'd really love to not worry about it.

343
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,322
I don't do anything special.

344
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,034
I just try to understand what U-ju wants

345
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,913
and do my best to think
from his perspective.

346
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,042
From his perspective?

347
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:04,007
Su-im, I'm starting
to dislike you a little.

348
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,426
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,972
I struggle with even just being a mom.

350
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,683
Do you work?

351
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,560
You don't look like a stay-at-home mom.

352
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,687
I don't really have a job,

353
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,898
but I've written a children's book.

354
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,109
I haven't published anything
in ten years though.

355
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,070
Gosh, you're an author?

356
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,115
That's great. You must like to read.

357
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,618
Would you like to join our book club?

358
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,122
Book club?

359
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,585
These days, everyone is glued
to their phones even at home.

360
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,505
It's so nice to read together
and have discussions about books.

361
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,466
Yes, the intent itself is great.

362
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:50,846
Let's see.

363
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,640
"Crowd Psychology, The Spirit of the Laws,

364
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,934
The Prince, The Selfish Gene,

365
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,270
and Republic by Plato"?

366
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,816
Gosh, the kids have read these books?

367
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,194
Who decides what we read?

368
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,571
My husband.

369
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,739
He started Omphalos and led it ever since.

370
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,616
I see.

371
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,203
But instead of it being a discussion,
it's now more like...

372
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,667
Anyway, it's great.

373
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,628
Apply for the membership on the website.

374
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,674
What are you reading this month?

375
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,052
You know that Yeong-jae
didn't register at SNU, don't you?

376
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,182
I thought about it and I think

377
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,810
what Yeong-jae's doing
and what happened to his mom

378
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,147
isn't entirely unrelated
with Coach Kim Ju-yeong.

379
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,274
That's why you fired her?

380
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,735
You trust me, don't you?

381
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,404
Would I have fired her for no reason?

382
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,948
I worked so hard to hire her.

383
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,784
Why do you think I fired her
without even talking to you?

384
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,536
What's the reason?

385
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,705
What good is an admission slip?

386
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,832
The end result was terrible.

387
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,043
Not just terrible. A whole family...

388
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,173
We have to think very carefully right now.

389
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,675
We're putting her in charge
for three years.

390
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,221
It's not like you're struggling.
Why should we take such a risk?

391
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,306
But if Coach Kim looks after me,

392
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,184
-the chances of getting into SNU--
-Will be more likely, yes.

393
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,560
But who are you?

394
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,855
I believe you can get in
without Coach Kim's help.

395
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,401
In just a few days,

396
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,614
I'll arrange for a set of tutors
more perfectly than her.

397
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,117
You know my mid-terms
are coming up, right?

398
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,327
Don't worry.

399
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,789
I'll hire the aces
from Shin A High School's tutor circuit.

400
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,092
The best institute in Daechi-dong
doesn't have a class for Shin A students?

401
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,845
Shin A's so prestigious
that no teacher can keep up.

402
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,055
I apologize.

403
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,642
If we just try and the grades
aren't satisfactory,

404
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,019
we'd never survive the backlash.

405
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,437
Sorry.

406
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,461
DAECHI ACADEMY, MIN JI-HYE

407
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,173
Mother, I'm really sorry

408
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,509
but I can't spare time just for Ye-seo.

409
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,470
If you need me, call me
when you've put together a team.

410
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,607
THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

411
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,900
They're reading this?

412
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,986
Ye-bin and Su-han are reading this?

413
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,279
They're in seventh grade.

414
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,780
Isn't it unbelievable?

415
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:00,285
I like the intent of reading and
discussing together in search of truth.

416
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,121
That's all a lie.

417
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,248
They're doing it to get into university.

418
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,167
So they'd have an impressive reading list.

419
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,255
They read such difficult books
each month and write a book report.

420
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,174
The poor kids.

421
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,468
They started two years ago.

422
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,929
Since fifth grade?

423
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,723
Goodness.

424
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,184
What are they doing with the poor kids?

425
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,311
It looks like I have to read this.

426
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,105
You're going to attend the discussion too.

427
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,275
Do you want to join too?

428
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,944
-You bet.
-Okay.

429
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,154
Okay.

430
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,952
Zarathust...

431
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,162
Zara..."

432
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,872
Darn it. It's a tongue-twister.

433
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,002
I'm getting through at an amazing pace,

434
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,254
but I don't understand a word.

435
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,136
What if Ye-seo's the only one
who gets the story again?

436
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,931
I hate the brat.

437
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,850
She'll have written...

438
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,313
No, I can't let that happen. I just can't.

439
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,904
NEW POST

440
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,574
"Hello.

441
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm U-ju's mom. We just moved in.

442
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,537
I'd like to become a member."

443
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,831
Oh, my goodness.

444
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,337
DO-HOON'S MOM

445
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,220
SU-HAN'S MOM

446
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,682
-What is it?
-Seo-jin.

447
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:49,519
That woman, U-ju's mom,
applied to join Omphalos.

448
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,479
It seems she wants to be on the book club.

449
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,234
She blocked our numbers,
but she wants to join the club?

450
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,653
Who told her about Omphalos?

451
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,988
Isn't it obvious?

452
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,364
Professor Cha's wife.

453
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,118
How could she let her apply
without asking the existing members?

454
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,537
Isn't she crossing the line
because her husband leads the group?

455
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,122
My point exactly.

456
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,250
Can a woman who cooks
ox blood soup even keep up?

457
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,169
She wasn't accepted yet, was she?

458
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,714
If she's allowed to join,
Ye-seo and I will drop out.

459
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,884
Tell Professor Cha's wife that
very clearly, okay?

460
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,720
I just got another call. Bye.

461
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,140
Hello.

462
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,017
Are you free today?

463
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,226
I can't do that.

464
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,105
The rule says that
anyone who lives here is allowed to join.

465
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,608
Anyway, if U-ju's mom is allowed in,

466
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,401
Seo-jin, Ye-seo, Ye-bin,

467
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,445
and my family will quit the club.

468
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,529
Very well then.

469
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,697
That was...

470
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,241
Seo-jin's message.

471
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,203
I think differently, of course.

472
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:54,334
Don't you think
the group's dynamic is ruined?

473
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,669
-What?
-Ye-seo works so hard

474
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,255
and always voices her opinion.

475
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,633
But she practically
dictates the group and--

476
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,634
Gosh.

477
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,262
That's exactly I've been thinking.

478
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,432
It's nice to see her do well,
but it's just too much.

479
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,518
She hogs the spotlight and never stops.

480
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,064
Each time she raises her hand,

481
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,108
I want to hit her head like whack-a-mole.

482
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:25,031
U-ju gets good grades without tutoring.
That means he's a smart kid.

483
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:27,784
And his mom writes books for children.

484
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,620
-She's an author?
-Yes.

485
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,413
The ox blood soup woman?

486
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,548
Hi, son.

487
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,842
Are you enjoying the book?

488
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,885
I don't understand a word.

489
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,515
There are so many easy and fun books.

490
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,934
Why did they pick something so difficult?

491
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,275
Try reading this first.

492
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,028
That's Nietzsche's autobiography
written by himself.

493
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,073
If you read the chapter
on Thus Spoke Zarathustra,

494
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,492
it might help you understand the book.

495
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,829
Thanks, Mom.

496
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,747
If you still think it's boring,

497
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,458
don't read it. Just forget it.

498
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,337
It's good to have discussions,
but the book should be fun.

499
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,842
I want to give it a try first.

500
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,970
Kang Ye-seo will be there, won't she?

501
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,639
She's no joke.

502
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,683
What about her?

503
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,977
You won't be able to handle her either.

504
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,604
Really?

505
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,357
I heard her mom's a real veteran
when it comes to education.

506
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,775
No way.

507
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,987
Would I ask for your help
if she had a coordinator?

508
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,114
When you refused to put a team together,

509
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,491
I thought Ye-seo
was getting some special care.

510
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,912
She insisted on giving it a go on her own,

511
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,122
but now that the mid-terms
are coming up, she's anxious.

512
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,708
No way.

513
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,793
Not the great Kang Ye-seo.

514
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,757
Anyway, I called to make a team together.
It's good that you've already made one.

515
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,676
It'll be good for the others
if Ye-seo joins, right?

516
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,895
That's what you think.

517
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,563
As you know,

518
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,441
my Do-hoon's a very quiet kid.

519
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:27,153
The silly boy recently told me something.

520
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,822
Whenever Ye-seo's in his team,
she's the only one

521
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,617
who talks and asks questions.

522
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,704
Do-hoon can ask questions if he wants to.

523
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,958
I said something like that at first.

524
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,086
"Why did you keep quiet like an idiot?"

525
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,173
He said he tried.

526
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,425
When he plucked up the courage
to ask something,

527
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,719
Ye-seo never failed to say this.

528
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,892
"Do you have to ask?
Are you really that stupid?"

529
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,857
I'd like Ye-seo to join,

530
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,651
but my son doesn't.

531
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,614
It can't be helped if he's against it.

532
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,455
By the way,

533
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,791
Do-hoon wants to study medicine, right?

534
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,085
To get him into medical school,

535
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,587
with all the reports and volunteer work,

536
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,299
wouldn't it help to know
a university hospital professor?

537
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,143
That is true.

538
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,732
I wonder what Hye-na and Seong-jae

539
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,276
will say about Ye-seo joining the group.

540
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,236
I should at least ask.

541
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,781
If they say yes,

542
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,908
mild-mannered Do-hoon won't object.

543
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,744
Thank you.

544
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,080
I'll make sure Ye-seo stays in line.

545
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,675
What did I do wrong?

546
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,470
Would you be happy
if someone called you stupid?

547
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,181
You should try to be
more considerate of your friends.

548
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,266
He kept asking stupid questions.

549
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,977
But why are you bringing this up now?

550
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,439
Are you going to form a team with Do-hoon?

551
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,525
I looked into every famous academy
in Daechi-dong,

552
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,444
but there's no special class
for Shin A High.

553
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,238
Do-hoon got a team together recently,
and the instructors are top-notch.

554
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,531
There are only three students now.

555
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,201
Do-hoon, Seong-jae. And was it Hye-na?

556
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,621
Hye-na? Hye-na is in that team?

557
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,122
Mom, have you lost your mind?

558
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,332
No way. I won't join!

559
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,627
The midterm is around the corner,
so I can't find good private tutors--

560
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,462
So why did you fire her?

561
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,422
You said you would
set up everything perfectly.

562
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,549
I was counting on you.
What are we going to do now?

563
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,259
Call her now.

564
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,303
Call Coach Kim right now!

565
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,556
Ye-seo, I explained everything to you.

566
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,933
Am I Yeong-jae?

567
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,351
You know I'm not like Yeong-jae.

568
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,602
I know he's totally doomed,

569
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,437
but how could you think
I'd turn out like him?

570
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,982
Fine. If you refuse to call her,
I'll call her myself.

571
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,317
Hey!

572
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,194
What are you doing now? Hang up!

573
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,362
Hang up!

574
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,572
The analysis shows that Seo-jun and Gi-jun

575
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,450
are more likely
to get accepted than Seon-kyu.

576
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,372
You said those twins attend
the same school as Ye-seo, right?

577
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,625
Yes, ma'am. They also live
in the same neighborhood.

578
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,503
KANG YE-SEO

579
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,929
-It's Ye-seo.
-Don't answer it.

580
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,681
Will you really...

581
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,182
end it like this?

582
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,524
She's ignoring my calls too!

583
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,110
What will you do
if I don't get accepted to SNU?

584
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,737
Mom, how could you do this to me?

585
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,537
Hye-na really gets on my nerves.

586
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,081
How could you think I'd be okay
with being in the same team as her?

587
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,292
Hye-na gets good grades too, you know.

588
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,918
It's nice to study
with another good student.

589
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,503
No! I said I don't want to!

590
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,131
I'm the one that has to study.
Why fire her without asking me?

591
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,841
Call her this instant.

592
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,677
Bring Coach Kim back!

593
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,150
Ms. Han, I'll give you a refund.

594
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,484
Send me your account detail.

595
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,446
This is driving me crazy.

596
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,242
What? What's that? Hey! Move.

597
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,703
Look at that. Come on!

598
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,414
All right, keep driving.

599
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,416
All right, this way.

600
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,627
-Move back!
-Gosh, be careful.

601
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,295
Goodness,

602
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,422
-you little...
-Hello.

603
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,175
You are killing me.
Do you have to drink every single day?

604
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,218
-Who are you?
-It's Ms. Jin.

605
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,637
-Your wife.
-Well, you see...

606
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:09,143
Something humiliating happened
to Dr. Kang.

607
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,811
That's why we had to drink.

608
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,689
-Right.
-How dare they belittle us?

609
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,942
Come here! You, tortoise!

610
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,693
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

611
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,529
Dr. Lee, I have to go pick up my kids.

612
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,740
Our housekeeper is inside,
so just take him to his room.

613
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,575
-Sure, no problem.
-Who is that woman?

614
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,035
We'll take him to his room, Ms. Jin.

615
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,787
-Hey.
-Yang-u, it's this way.

616
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,538
-She's no good.
-Hey, hold him.

617
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,748
-Hey, she's no good.
-Sorry?

618
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,709
Bring in another girl.
Replace her with a pretty one.

619
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,173
We'll take care of him.
You should get going.

620
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,425
-Bye.
-See you next time.

621
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,843
-I'm so sick of this.
-It's this way.

622
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,388
-Hey.
-He's driving me crazy.

623
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,889
-This house is nice, huh?
-Please.

624
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,391
-That ugly woman!
-Gosh.

625
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,821
Ye-seo.

626
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,657
That rude brat.

627
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,787
Seo-jin.

628
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,123
Hey, you're going now?

629
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,000
Seo-jin, what should we do?

630
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,544
Professor Cha upgraded her membership.

631
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,628
What?

632
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,012
Did you tell Seung-hye what I said?

633
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,681
Of course, I told her.

634
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,476
Any resident can participate.
She said that's the rule,

635
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,644
so I couldn't do anything.

636
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,940
What will you do now?
Are you going to drop out?

637
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,985
Why should I?
I should make sure she can't join.

638
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,611
Exactly.

639
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,656
We should make sure she can't join.
Why would you drop out?

640
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,617
Without you and Ye-seo,
there will be no point.

641
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,287
All right, get going now.

642
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,831
Seo-jin, what's going on with Ye-seo?

643
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,167
Where's Mr. Jo?
Why did you have to pick her up?

644
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,671
I fired the coordinator.

645
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,089
You fired her?

646
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,549
Why?

647
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,677
You said you'd try it out
and give me all the information.

648
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,306
What happened with Yeong-jae
kept bothering me.

649
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,142
She coached him for three years,
so I kept getting a bad feeling.

650
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,352
Why would you?

651
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,021
Did she instigate Myeong-ju
to take her own life or what?

652
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,398
Or did she pray
that Yeong-jae wouldn't be accepted?

653
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,109
She got him into SNU's med school,
for goodness' sake.

654
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,280
Fine, let's say
there was an issue with her.

655
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,032
Yeong-jae and Ye-seo aren't the same,

656
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,451
just like how you and Myeong-ju
aren't the same.

657
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,038
What should I do now?
I was totally counting on you.

658
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,456
What am I supposed to do?

659
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,000
Let's talk about it another time.
You should get going.

660
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,043
Seo-jin,

661
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,294
you have to reconsider.

662
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,547
You have to take her back.
You're making a big mistake.

663
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,266
HUSBAND

664
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,354
Yes, I'm parking now.
I'll be home in a minute.

665
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,565
What have you been doing?

666
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,820
How have you been educating our kids?

667
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,405
Ye-seo is a hot mess.

668
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,824
Yes, she gets good grades,
but what's the point?

669
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,618
Gosh, I'm so darn annoyed.

670
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,788
What? "So darn annoyed"?

671
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,915
Hey, stop right there.

672
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,083
Get back down here now.

673
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,085
-Get back here!
-Honey, please.

674
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,504
Ye-seo is having a bad day.

675
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,591
She's such a brat
because you always coddle her like this.

676
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,387
Does she think her dad
is a big joke or what?

677
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,306
I'm Kang Jun-sang, okay?

678
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,852
I got the highest score
in the country on the entrance exam!

679
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:43,232
How dare she treat me like dirt?

680
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,651
-All right, let's go to our room.
-Goodness.

681
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,027
Let go!

682
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:52,575
Whether I'm at home or at work,
everyone gets on my nerves.

683
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,326
Darn it.

684
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,677
ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALITY

685
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,975
Did you see the book Ye-seo was holding?

686
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,727
Isn't she such a genius?

687
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,061
Everyone knows that she's a genius.

688
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,814
Dad always hounds us because of her.
Gosh, how obnoxious.

689
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,277
-Seo-jun.
-Hey, don't.

690
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,528
Don't do it!

691
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,875
Hey!

692
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,752
Gosh, seriously.

693
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,672
THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

694
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,890
Are you all right?

695
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,602
Whatever!

696
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,355
What a mess.

697
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,401
NIETZSCHE'S ZEROGRAPHY:
THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

698
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,363
Have you finished reading this book?

699
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,783
It's not even the original version.

700
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,461
She really is a genius.

701
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,130
She sure is an obnoxious brat.

702
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,842
Welcome to this hellhole.

703
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,765
-Hellhole?
-Yes.

704
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,475
Are you referring to the book club?

705
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,228
I envy you. You can back out if you want.

706
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,896
Why don't you quit if you hate it so much?

707
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:46,855
Me?

708
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,193
Never, even if the sky falls.

709
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,073
-It was difficult.
-It wasn't easy for me either.

710
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,159
Hello.

711
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,745
I heard you write children's books.

712
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,291
I'm looking forward
to having the discussion with you.

713
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,002
U-ju must do so well
since his mom's a writer.

714
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,920
My point exactly.

715
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,591
You wouldn't have had to send him
to essay classes.

716
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,593
Since his mom's a writer.

717
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,555
U-ju and I consider this as a hobby--

718
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,514
What?

719
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,474
You can read this just as a hobby?

720
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,019
Authors are something else.

721
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,105
We'll see you later then. Let's go, Su-im.

722
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,990
An author?

723
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,618
She's not an author
if she doesn't show up on the Internet.

724
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,829
She thinks we're all crazy
about tutors and extra classes.

725
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,000
Why are you out here?

726
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,668
Professor Cha.

727
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,879
We owe you so much for your hard work.

728
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,088
Thank you very much.

729
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,256
You're welcome.

730
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,008
When it comes to education,

731
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,844
the only goal in this country
is to get the kids into university.

732
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,680
To make sure our kids are upright
and have a strong character,

733
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,057
this must be done.

734
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,683
You're so right.

735
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,185
-Let's go inside.
-Sure.

736
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,064
What would we have done without you?

737
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,025
Thank you so, so much, Professor Cha.

738
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,238
I think that Nietzsche is
the master of self-appreciation.

739
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,407
He was proud enough to say

740
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,827
his book is the greatest gift
in history to mankind.

741
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,289
"Why am I so wise? Why am I so clever?

742
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,375
How do I write such great books?"

743
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,168
That's how he introduced his works.

744
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,088
That's self-appreciation
on a whole new level.

745
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,343
Nietzsche's attitude is just...

746
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,595
It's so, so refreshing.

747
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,223
I also realized
that self-appreciation isn't bad at all.

748
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,059
The power of self-appreciation
in which you believe you're good!

749
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,190
To do so, Nietzsche said

750
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,193
one should only have enemies
worth resenting.

751
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,696
There's this girl in school
that I just can't stand.

752
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,948
I realized...

753
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,618
that she is my true friend.

754
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,620
Through her,

755
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:09,248
I will become positive,
I will excel and I will overcome.

756
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,417
I will accomplish Ubermensch.

757
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,673
Seo-jun, what were your thoughts?

758
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,841
Pardon?

759
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:26,181
Nietzsche said the progress
of the human mind has three stages.

760
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,560
The first is the camel, carrying a load

761
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,562
that isn't its own across a desert.

762
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,105
I thought...

763
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,901
that was a lot like us students,
and it made me a bit sad.

764
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,028
Sad?

765
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,872
Every modern man
has their own goal and will.

766
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,166
You must eliminate weak thoughts

767
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,169
and go from "I should" to "I will."

768
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,212
That's why the next stage is the lion.

769
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,089
Why couldn't you understand that?

770
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,302
Answer me.

771
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,517
Excuse me, Professor Cha?

772
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:14,938
How about we take a three-minute break?
I could use a drink.

773
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,071
Do you want something to drink?
How about you, Professor Cha?

774
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,158
Give me that. Hey.

775
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,160
Come on.

776
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,161
What?

777
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,621
What would you like to have?

778
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,293
Yes, Mother.

779
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,754
Is Ye-seo doing well with her coach?

780
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,796
Pardon?

781
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,091
Yes, she is, Mother.

782
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,470
You knelt before me
when you needed my help.

783
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,680
Why haven't I heard from you since?

784
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,517
I should know if it's happening or not.

785
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:55,062
I apologize, Mother.
I've been distracted lately.

786
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,690
You've been distracted?
What has been distracting you?

787
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,527
Don't think they'll do their job
because you paid them.

788
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,696
You must check every detail,
from one to ten and more

789
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,490
to keep the teachers in line.

790
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,326
Okay. I'll remember that, Mother.

791
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,827
I'll call you often from now--

792
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,880
I find this a bit perplexing.

793
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,384
It's my first day, so I'll just observe.

794
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,471
Okay.

795
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,432
Everyone finds it perplexing at first.

796
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,643
A family book discussion
is an unfamiliar thing.

797
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,104
But in this beautiful castle,

798
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,399
we get to pass our children
a spiritual heritage.

799
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,484
How meaningful is that?

800
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,071
He called it a discussion,
but now it's a heritage?

801
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,532
You write children's books.

802
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,077
Please don't hesitate to share your views.

803
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,246
Sure.

804
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,252
It's your first time, U-ju.

805
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,256
What do you think of the book?

806
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,386
To be honest, it was too difficult,
so I only read parts of it.

807
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,389
It would be difficult
if you lack understanding of the classics.

808
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,560
Just share how you felt
about the parts you did read.

809
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,938
Thugs usually fight in alleyways,

810
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,773
and boxers fight in rings.

811
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,860
Nietzsche didn't differentiate alleys,
rings or sandboxes.

812
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,738
I think he's a philosopher
who served an uppercut

813
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,323
to all fields of human existence.

814
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:33,410
If you love your fate as it is
and think positively, then...

815
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,539
even without thinking
of using a friend to improve yourself,

816
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,500
you can overcome your boundaries
and become someone amazing.

817
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,836
That's the notion of Ubermensch.

818
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,798
That's what I got from what I read.

819
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,802
U-ju, I think you misunderstood me.

820
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,640
Ye-seo's attitude
of making a friend out of a rival

821
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:59,394
is a very natural
and commendable will of power.

822
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,272
There are those who rule
and those who are ruled over.

823
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,484
Those who give orders and those who obey.

824
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,735
That's very true.

825
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,528
Even between two people, power--

826
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:14,618
The weak always found power uncomfortable,
which is why it was considered evil.

827
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,705
But power is good.

828
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,462
This is such a joke.

829
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,930
What did you just say?

830
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,599
Oh, I'm sorry.

831
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,269
Professor Cha, I have a question.

832
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,397
Why did you select this book?

833
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,734
You don't seem to know.

834
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,487
It's a required reading
for middle and high school students.

835
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,825
That's why our education system
is nonsensical.

836
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,661
Carl Gustav Jung,
the creator of analytical psychology,

837
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,789
studied this book with scholars
for six years and still called it cryptic.

838
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,792
How was the book? Ye-bin, was it fun?

839
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,044
No. It was freakishly boring.

840
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,214
Don't you think it's too much
to make teens read a book that even adults

841
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,799
find difficult?

842
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,552
What's more serious
is that this isn't a discussion.

843
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,888
It feels more like a lecture
where you force your ideas.

844
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,564
On what grounds do you say that?

845
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,192
I deeply empathized
with what Seo-jun said.

846
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,778
But you called his sentiments weak,

847
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,239
as if he had no will for power.

848
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,074
Are you saying I'm wrong?

849
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,117
I think

850
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,328
you want to tell the kids
to think everyone else is a rival

851
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,872
and that they must come first,

852
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,499
and that's why you brought up
Nietzsche's will of power.

853
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,168
You're going too far.

854
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,712
Professor Cha got that Ye-seo

855
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:52,174
accepted the will of power
to improve herself

856
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,259
and only commended that.

857
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,261
-No.
-Lady.

858
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,555
Are you attacking our group?

859
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,308
I'm not attacking anything.
I'm saying there's a problem.

860
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,559
What problem?

861
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:06,605
Thanks to Professor Cha,
our kids are getting higher essay scores.

862
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,150
Do the kids...

863
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,569
really want this group discussion?

864
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,780
Aren't you just giving them a hard time

865
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,907
out of your own greed?

866
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,325
My goodness.

867
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,786
You're really meddlesome
for someone who just joined.

868
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:25,207
I guess you really don't suit
our group discussion.

869
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,500
Why not, Mom?

870
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,045
Isn't a discussion
about sharing one's views freely?

871
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,464
This is the best one we've ever had.

872
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,965
Hey. What do you know about discussions?

873
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,009
I do know that everyone
but you hates this.

874
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:36,927
Ye-bin.

875
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,386
This is unbelievable.

876
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,515
If you dislike it that much,
you don't have to attend.

877
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,600
You can leave right now if you want.

878
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,730
U-ju and I can leave, but the other kids--

879
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,317
Why use the other kids as an excuse
when they're doing just fine?

880
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,820
Right? No? Right?

881
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,447
Who are you to use the kids as an excuse?

882
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,075
Calm down, please.

883
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,786
Since there are various opinions...

884
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,541
How about putting it to a vote?

885
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,961
We'll vote on whether or not
to continue this group.

886
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,171
-No, Professor Cha.
-Professor.

887
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,423
If more than half vote

888
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,009
that the group should continue to meet,

889
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,804
those who voiced their displeasure

890
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:25,058
will be requested never
to return to the gathering.

891
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,561
How about that?

892
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,191
Very well.

893
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,777
I'll agree to those terms.

894
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,659
Very well then. Preparations must be made,

895
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,619
so the voting can take place
at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

896
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,081
Agree, agree, agree, object,

897
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,584
agree, agree, agree...

898
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,586
What's there to prepare?

899
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,005
Everyone is here,
so we should just do it now.

900
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,925
At times like this, we must try
to be as rational as possible.

901
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,721
If you cast your vote
after pondering on it for a day,

902
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,598
I will humbly...

903
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,809
follow the decision.

904
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,686
Got it.

905
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:13,023
Since this will be irreversible,
I will think carefully about it.

906
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,121
You signed her up, didn't you?

907
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,041
Why did you bring a woman like that
to our book club?

908
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,502
You're the one who approved her request
to join the book club.

909
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,257
Boys, what is your problem?
Are you two dumb?

910
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,093
She said it's not even a discussion.

911
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,095
How could you just sit there
and not say a thing?

912
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,308
Go upstairs. I'll fix dinner quickly.

913
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:01,821
What?

914
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,156
"A joke"?

915
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,325
How dare she.

916
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,744
Which university did she go to?

917
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,830
Professor Cha graduated from SNU
Law School with a doctoral degree.

918
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,124
How dare she try to lecture him?

919
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,919
Is she an expert on Nietzsche or what?

920
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,088
Anyhow, she won't be able
to set a foot again.

921
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,385
Hi. Have you had a chance to ask them?

922
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,552
I'm sorry.

923
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,721
Do-hoon is actually fine with it,

924
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,723
but Seong-jae's mom is totally against it.

925
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,933
Really?

926
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,893
Then shall I meet with Seong-jae's mom?

927
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,187
I actually organized something already.

928
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,522
Seong-jae's mom as well as

929
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,607
all the moms of Shin A High's top students
will be there.

930
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,359
So you'll easily find good team members.

931
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,236
You have some time now, right?

932
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,946
Yes, of course.

933
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,490
Thank you so much. I owe you one.

934
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,075
Where should I meet you, then?

935
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,827
There's a study group

936
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,037
called Sky Group,
which only accepts ten students.

937
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:54,165
You may not get in
even if you wait for a year.

938
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,626
-Ye-seo's mom. We're here.
-Hello.

939
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,839
Oh, I guess you
haven't ordered anything yet.

940
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,966
Coffee is on me. What would you like?

941
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,760
Oh, really? The Vienna coffee here
is really good.

942
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,887
-Okay, I'll be right back.
-All right.

943
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,226
Do-hoon's mom, how could you do this?

944
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,936
You should've given us a heads-up.

945
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,274
Totally. I didn't know
that Ye-seo's mom was joining us.

946
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,662
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

947
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,209
Please stay.

948
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,462
I told you
that she makes me uncomfortable.

949
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,130
-But it's--
-How many times must I tell you?

950
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,974
Seo-jin, I wasn't going to say this,

951
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,436
but Seong-jae thinks Ye-seo
is too self-centered and bullheaded.

952
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,022
And because of it,
he doesn't want to study with her.

953
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,607
I'm sorry.

954
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,906
There's nothing more I can do.

955
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,824
I'm sorry about this. I'll be in touch.

956
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,497
Wait up!

957
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,068
I'm lousy?

958
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,112
Who are you to call me lousy?

959
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,198
-That's not what I meant.
-Are you done?

960
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,492
Hey,

961
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,035
take a good look at yourself now.

962
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,703
How could you talk
to an adult in this manner?

963
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,457
Stop talking like such a fossil.

964
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,794
What will you do if the book club
disbands because of you?

965
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,296
Whether I can get into university
or not depends on this.

966
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,382
Will you take responsibility
if I don't get accepted?

967
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,008
You obviously only think about yourself.

968
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,635
Do you not care about other kids at all?

969
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,971
They're participating
for the exact same reason!

970
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,516
That's what you think.

971
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,894
Anyway, we'll find out
after we vote tomorrow.

972
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,959
Mom, that woman called me lousy.

973
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,920
Ye-seo, go inside.

974
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,090
I just told you that she called me lousy.

975
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,425
Didn't you hear me?

976
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,801
Go inside.

977
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,075
I guess my daughter looks lousy to you.

978
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,161
She's already so anxious

979
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:20,580
about the possibility
of the book club disbanding.

980
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:22,874
Did you really have to argue with her?

981
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,167
And what?

982
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,044
You called her lousy?

983
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,757
You probably can't see it
because you're her mom,

984
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,550
but she's selfish and narrow-minded--

985
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,468
What?

986
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,263
"Selfish and narrow-minded"?

987
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,350
I get that she gets great grades
and reads a lot,

988
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,769
but she doesn't live alone in this world.

989
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,021
Who are you to judge my daughter?

990
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,814
You think you're that special?

991
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,859
She talked to me very rudely
and called me a fossil.

992
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,611
Was I supposed to let it slide?

993
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,363
You want to talk about manners?

994
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,115
You belittled our book club
by saying it's a joke.

995
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,117
Do you think
that was a polite thing to do?

996
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,498
I get that you're angry,
but you should watch--

997
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,666
Who do you think you are?

998
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,502
Who are you to stir up so much trouble?

999
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,630
You said you're against private education.

1000
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,217
Then why must you meddle
in what we do and cause trouble?

1001
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,264
You keep talking down to me.

1002
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,432
Should I do the same?

1003
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,145
Fine, I will.

1004
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,981
And let me give you a piece of advice.

1005
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,441
Raise your daughter right.

1006
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,695
What are you going to do
with that rude and selfish child?

1007
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,866
How dare you... Shall I rip your jaw open?

1008
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,497
Unbelievable?

1009
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,292
How dare you... Shall I rip your jaw open?

1010
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,092
Did you laugh?

1011
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,136
Did you just laugh?

1012
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:08,938
You...

1013
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,274
It's you, isn't it?

1014
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,184
She's figured it out.

1015
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,685
What should I do now?

1016
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,437
What if the word gets out?

1017
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,022
What's the matter with you?

1018
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,982
-What?
-Do you know something that I don't?

1019
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,734
What? I don't know anything.

1020
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,737
Right, Yeong-jae's family
ended up like that

1021
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,530
because of their own problems.

1022
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,158
-Can you do it or not?
-I...

1023
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,618
I can do it.

1024
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,579
-Louder!
-I can do it.

1025
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,498
Please coach Ye-seo again.

1026
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,543
I must make sure she becomes a doctor!

1027
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,338
So even if something like that happens,

1028
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,840
will you put up with it?

1029
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,760
