1
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,265
You must have been surprised
by that unexpected call from me.

2
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,311
I called you because
there's something I must tell you.

3
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,522
You have...

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,191
a daughter.

5
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,370
KANG YE-SEO, SCHOOL PRESIDENT

6
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,371
A party?

7
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,498
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT

8
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,126
Treat other families to celebrate
Ye-seo becoming school president?

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,463
We used to gather very often
when Yeong-jae's family was here.

10
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,966
But since U-ju's family moved here,
the families have never gathered.

11
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,846
Come to think of it,
the families have never had

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,766
a gathering
since U-ju's family moved here.

13
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,894
And we never threw
a welcoming party for them.

14
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,395
How inconsiderate of us.

15
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,441
Make sure you invite Dr. Hwang's family.

16
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,902
I will, of course.

17
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,280
It'll wash away your resentment.

18
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,116
Resentment? There's no such thing.

19
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,792
Shall we have a glass of wine?

20
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,585
I'll go take Ye-seo's snack to her first.

21
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,255
No, I'll do it. Give it to me.

22
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,881
-You'll do it?
-Yes.

23
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,111
Take it easy.

24
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,574
-I was getting a little hungry.
-Really?

25
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,200
Here.

26
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,287
I'll frame the certificate of appointment

27
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,165
and hang it right there for you.

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,086
Hye-na withdrew her candidacy,
so I never got to compete with her.

29
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,964
Would someone with the confidence to win
withdraw from the election?

30
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,966
She obviously did that
because she knew she'd lose.

31
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,093
As stated in Sun Tzu on the Art of War,

32
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,597
"The supreme art of war
is to subdue the enemy without fighting."

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,514
Really?

34
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,227
Frankly, I haven't been feeling
so great about it.

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,979
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,398
You're the true winner.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,152
Here. Drink it before it gets cold.

38
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,719
I CALLED YOU BECAUSE
THERE'S SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU

39
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,803
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER

40
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,640
Hello?

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,144
Hello?

42
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,943
Is it you, Eun-hye?

43
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,075
You're Kim Eun-hye, right?

44
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,416
What do you want now?

45
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,501
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,255
But our relationship
already ended 18 years ago.

47
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,549
Don't ever call me again.

48
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,608
Honey.

49
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,694
Was Ye-seo happy?

50
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,820
Hey.

51
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,613
No, she was nonchalant about it.

52
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,658
She's not exactly the warm-hearted type,

53
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,618
but deep down, I bet she was really happy.

54
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,706
She might even write in her diary
that her dad brought her snacks today.

55
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,249
You should do this more often.

56
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,418
Okay, sure. It's not a difficult task.

57
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,460
Thank you.

58
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,343
Imagine what would've happened
if you had disapproved of Coach Kim.

59
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,056
I sincerely thank you
for having faith in me.

60
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,309
There's no need to thank me.

61
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,228
You did well.

62
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,868
He'll take revenge
saying I ruined his reputation.

63
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,203
I'll be under anesthesia,
lying on the operating table.

64
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,539
Who knows what he might do to me?

65
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,790
My gosh.

66
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,085
He tends to hold a huge grudge.

67
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,712
No one knows what he might do.

68
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,714
What if he makes a mistake on purpose and

69
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,092
says it was because he had VIP syndrome
and was only trying to do a good job?

70
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,928
My gosh, stop whining.

71
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,972
Will you please let me sleep?

72
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,557
You're so cold-hearted.

73
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,727
Your husband could meet his death
on the operating table tomorrow.

74
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,686
So how...

75
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,354
How can you sleep?

76
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,483
You're not Jun-sang's favorite person
right now, but do you really think

77
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,984
he'd mess up the surgery?

78
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,029
Do I think he'd mess up the surgery?

79
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:15,286
If he drills the wrong area,
I might get an infection.

80
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,580
If he cuts the wrong nerve,
my ankle might get paralyzed.

81
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,750
If he cuts an artery or vein,
I might die from excessive--

82
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,751
Repeat after me.

83
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,837
Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries.

84
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,047
What?

85
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,884
Your body doesn't belong to yourself only.

86
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:33,513
Su-han and I are practically
getting the surgery with you.

87
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,807
How will you push through
if you can't trust your doctor?

88
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,727
Pull yourself together. Okay?

89
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,022
You need to believe it
with your entire body.

90
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,192
Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries.

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,443
Say it.

92
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,988
Gosh, say it already.

93
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,325
"Dr. Kang is..."

94
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,535
Must I do this?

95
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,161
Just say it. My goodness.

96
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,790
"Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries."

97
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,375
-Louder!
-"Dr. Kang

98
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,293
is the god of back surgeries."

99
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,216
Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries.

100
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,593
Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries.

101
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,393
-Hey.
-Yes?

102
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,437
How many rounds of alcohol
did Dr. Kang have last night?

103
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,855
I'm not sure.

104
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,482
I went home after the third round.

105
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,317
But he probably drank a lot more.

106
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,902
He...

107
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,363
He can't be drunk right now, right?

108
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,407
Honey, did you forget?

109
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,368
Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries!

110
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,078
-Yes, he is.
-Everyone, repeat after me.

111
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,497
Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries!

112
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,707
-He's the god.
-"He's the god."

113
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,375
-He's the god.
-Su-han, say it!

114
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,376
"He's the god!"

115
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,586
Good luck, honey!

116
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,672
Okay. Don't worry, my son.

117
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,342
-Honey, good luck. Bye.
-Okay.

118
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,803
Honey. Stay strong.

119
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,471
Jin Jin...

120
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,518
Dr. Kang is the god of back surgeries.

121
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,520
Dr. Kang is...

122
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,108
Did you make the cut?

123
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,152
-Yes, Dr. Kang.
-I made a nice and clean cut.

124
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,862
What's this?

125
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,947
Why did you make such a big cut?

126
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,825
-Pardon?
-It's over 10cm!

127
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,621
And why did you use huge forceps?

128
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,914
You asked me

129
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,208
to make a nice and big cut.

130
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,168
What?

131
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,338
What's this?

132
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,637
Have you gone mad?

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,430
You just cut his nerve.

134
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,390
What? Did...

135
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,642
Did I do that?

136
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,518
Of course, it was you.
Do you think it was me?

137
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,228
How could you make the same mistake again?

138
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,439
Then...

139
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,775
will Dr. Woo...

140
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,361
Are you asking because you don't know?

141
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,450
His ankles will get paralyzed,
so he won't be able to run,

142
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,494
and he won't be able
to walk properly either.

143
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,123
What should we do, Dr. Kang?

144
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,125
Is there no way to fix this?

145
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,835
I'm sorry, Dr. Woo.

146
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,629
-What am I going to do?
-Pass me that.

147
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,297
Here you go.

148
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,843
You little punk. How dare you backstab me?

149
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,391
My legs...

150
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,101
-My legs...
-What's wrong?

151
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,019
-What is it?
-My legs...

152
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,189
What's the matter?

153
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,441
Did you have another nightmare?

154
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,652
No.

155
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,404
It was just a weird dream.

156
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,656
Gosh, you really drive me crazy.

157
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,699
You're such a coward.

158
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,244
You even ran to the ER because
the cotton part of the swab fell off

159
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,495
while you were picking your ears.

160
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,038
It was just a weird dream!

161
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,124
Sleep!

162
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,917
My gosh.

163
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,589
Gosh, my back.

164
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,260
She was in Department of Korean Language
Education of Sungjoo University in 1996.

165
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,512
But she failed to complete
her teaching practice hours

166
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,931
during her senior year,
so she couldn't graduate.

167
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,310
She failed to complete
her teaching practice hours?

168
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,187
It was essential to teach
for at least 16 days

169
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,898
out of the four week period,
but she failed to do so.

170
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,650
She apparently quit after 15 days.

171
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,611
She only had to teach one more day,
but she quit?

172
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,449
I'm sure she knew she had
to complete that to graduate.

173
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,871
I'm sure she had a reason behind that.

174
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,790
I want you to find out.

175
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,916
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,084
What's her job?

177
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,548
She's a children's book author
who started her career 15 years ago

178
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,675
by winning a competition
with Walnut Tree Garden.

179
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,261
However, she hasn't published
any books since then.

180
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,138
She hasn't written
another book for 15 years?

181
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,599
What's the story about?

182
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,602
A mother who was living happily
with her 12 kids in a house

183
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,228
that had a garden with walnut trees

184
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,689
one day finds out
that her youngest child went missing.

185
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,275
So she crosses over nine paths
and fights all sorts of monsters.

186
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,694
And in the end,
she finds her missing child.

187
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,573
What about her personal life?

188
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,366
She got remarried to her current husband?

189
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,285
Gosh, I had no idea.

190
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,746
They say you need
to know your enemy in order to win.

191
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,915
I thought it'd be better for you to know.

192
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,333
Thanks to you,

193
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,627
I'm holding a winning hand now.

194
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,463
Anyway,

195
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,050
as a coach who used
to take care of Yeong-jae,

196
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,761
I want to prevent the unfortunate
happening of Yeong-jae's family

197
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,847
from becoming some kind of gossip
that people talk about over drinks.

198
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,768
Yes, of course.

199
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,272
I'm going to stop that
from happening for Myeong-ju's sake.

200
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,699
My goodness, that's unbelievable.

201
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,827
That divorcee got lucky
after she remarried her current husband.

202
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,207
Getting a divorce and remarrying
isn't seen as a flaw these days.

203
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,125
I know it's not a flaw,
but it's just funny.

204
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,086
The only reason she's not obsessed

205
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,547
with U-ju's studies
is that he's not her actual son.

206
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,131
But she acted so refined and laid back.

207
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,970
"U-ju got tutoring lessons for math
because he wanted to,

208
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,097
but I never made him do anything else."

209
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,099
What a joke.

210
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,104
It is upsetting that she looked down on us
for being so obsessed

211
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,189
with private education
for the sake of our kids.

212
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,233
She acted like she cared for the kids

213
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,943
and even got rid of the book club.

214
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,571
It turns out, she's a stepmother
who never had a child of her own.

215
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,155
She keeps calling herself a writer

216
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,783
and saying she wants
to turn Yeong-jae's story into a novel.

217
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,869
Seo-jin, will you let her do it?

218
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,208
Can you give this to her?

219
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,752
It's an invitation for a party
we're throwing for Ye-seo.

220
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,920
And this is yours.

221
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,715
Will you teach her a lesson then?

222
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,386
Sounds good, Seo-jin. This time,
let's teach her a serious lesson.

223
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,810
Let's eat! Let's go.

224
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,103
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

225
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,523
Here's a slice for my daughter.

226
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,240
KANG YE-SEO

227
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,868
Do you want to have lunch with me?

228
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,246
HWANG U-JU

229
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,794
My, Mr. Vice President.

230
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,171
Is everything going well?

231
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,014
Can I join you?

232
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,612
I guess you don't like eggplant either.

233
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,197
Same here.

234
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,784
Now that you're the school president,

235
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,620
you should work on changing the menu
to suit our taste.

236
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,041
U-ju!

237
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,634
Anyhow, Ye-seo,

238
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,720
congratulations on becoming
the school president.

239
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,434
Thanks.

240
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,772
Are you congratulating her?

241
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,400
Ye-seo,

242
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,277
congratulations.

243
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,864
Thanks.

244
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,128
I heard why you had
to withdraw your candidacy.

245
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,841
What do you mean?

246
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,552
I heard your mom passed away.

247
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,226
Hye-na is strong. She'll get through it.

248
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,481
Sure thing. I'm very tough, you know.

249
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,192
I'm proud of you.

250
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,778
On that note, I'll give you
a piece of my pork cutlet.

251
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,578
Hey, Ye-seo is the one
who needs to eat more and power up.

252
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,748
She's the school president now.

253
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,132
Eat up.

254
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,224
Hye-na?

255
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,226
She congratulated you?

256
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,103
Yes. Isn't it weird?

257
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,481
She's changed a little
since her mom passed away.

258
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,066
How has she changed?

259
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,110
I mean, she wanted
to have lunch with me today.

260
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,612
And she gave me
the pork cutlet U-ju gave her...

261
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,158
Anyway, she's been acting
a little strange.

262
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,954
Really? Hye-na did that?

263
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:42,871
Yes.

264
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,124
But I must say, she's impressive.

265
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,417
I don't think I can even live a day
without you, Mom.

266
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,257
I heard that I'm going to Onjungwon
for volunteering activities tomorrow.

267
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,426
Onjungwon?
Your grandma volunteers there too.

268
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:02,850
The son grew up into a brave mole.

269
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,896
He could even lift
a huge boulder so easily.

270
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,608
"What? This is as light as a feather."

271
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:16,613
He grew up into
such a confident, strong mole.

272
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:22,536
His mom and dad decided to find

273
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:28,667
the most wonderful bride
in the world for their son.

274
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,839
I heard you're now the school president.

275
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,133
You get good grades,
and you're pretty as well.

276
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,676
Your mom must be so proud of you.

277
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,221
Your daughter got
into a good university as well.

278
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,806
I wouldn't say that.

279
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,976
I regret sending her to a school abroad
at such a young age.

280
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,478
I really have to do a better job
with my younger kid.

281
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,855
Ye-seo,

282
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,815
what's it like to study with the coach?

283
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,025
Is it helpful?

284
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,904
She goes to the same church as me.

285
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,656
-Don't worry.
-I see.

286
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,410
Yes, it's certainly helpful
for college admissions.

287
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,621
Right? Then...

288
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,460
Grandma, I have to go.
Mr. Jo is here to pick me up.

289
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,503
All right. Will you volunteer
here again next week?

290
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,798
No, I'll go back to the nursing home
where I usually volunteer.

291
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,592
-I'll be off, then.
-Okay.

292
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,220
-Take care.
-Bye, Ye-seo.

293
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,975
How convenient. She even arranges
all the volunteering activities.

294
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,727
Ms. Yoon,

295
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,105
I'd love to hire this coach too.
Can I meet your daughter-in-law?

296
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,357
Please?

297
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,109
Your tea will get cold. Drink up.

298
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,111
This coach must be very special.

299
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,739
I've used all my connections,
but I still don't know who she is.

300
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,378
WALNUT TREE GARDEN

301
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,677
"You evil monster, who makes soup

302
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,720
with children's souls to fill yourself up.

303
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,101
I will puncture your heart
and save all the children.

304
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,439
Byeol.

305
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,149
Even if I have to

306
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,986
walk through a field of snakes,

307
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,488
mountains of blades, and the utter abyss,

308
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,573
I will never give up on you.

309
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,911
Because...

310
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,913
I'm your mom, Byeol."

311
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,800
Mom.

312
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,055
No.

313
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,975
That's not my child.

314
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,061
No way.

315
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:36,980
No.

316
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,609
She's not my daughter.

317
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,230
Did you find out
about Su-im's teaching practice?

318
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,774
Are you still looking into it?

319
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,909
-Honey, shouldn't you get ready?
-What?

320
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,623
We should go.

321
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,625
Shall we skip it if you're not up for it?

322
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,669
Even at the party
celebrating my promotion,

323
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,087
you ended up getting upset.

324
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,172
No, let's go.

325
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,968
But don't be surprised, honey.

326
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,264
You might see my turning kick today.

327
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,932
What?

328
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,476
Let's just hope

329
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,895
I don't have to put
my taekwondo skills to use.

330
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,195
What's taking you so long? We'll be late.

331
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,530
I'm coming!

332
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,449
I'm coming.

333
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,161
Why are they throwing a party?

334
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,620
What's going on this time?

335
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,581
What are you mumbling about?

336
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,249
Ye-seo's mom.

337
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:22,377
When she throws a party like this,
there's always a reason.

338
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,379
And I'm just wondering.

339
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,381
She just wants to have a good time
with everyone.

340
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,008
What other reason could there be?

341
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,218
Next time, we should
treat everyone to dinner.

342
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,762
Tell Se-ri to visit during the holidays.

343
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:36,016
"Welcoming party for Harvard
University student, Cha Se-ri."

344
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,643
It's such a nice reason
to gather everyone.

345
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,939
Does he want to show her off that much?

346
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,404
Excuse me.

347
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,490
Everyone,

348
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,576
thank you for coming.

349
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,620
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

350
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,371
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

351
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,165
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

352
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,583
Congratulations, Ms. Han.

353
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:06,129
My goodness.
Seo-jin, your necklace is so pretty.

354
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,631
It looks so elegant.

355
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,673
Really?

356
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,717
Gosh, this is such an honorable event.

357
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,387
The fact that Ye-seo and Seo-jun
became the leaders of Shin A High

358
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,431
is not only an honor for their families,

359
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,309
but it's also an honor
for Sky Castle, Dr. Kang.

360
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,604
That's too grand of a speech.

361
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,356
Of course, it's an honor.

362
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,649
If our kids grow up

363
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,443
and become competent enough
to live in Sky Castle after us,

364
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,321
it would be very honorable
in preserving Sky Castle's tradition.

365
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:35,158
Yes, of course.
Sky Castle's honorable tradition

366
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:38,495
would be the best heritage
we can pass on to our kids.

367
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,004
Su-im, Su-han told me

368
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,632
that you're currently writing
a novel about Yeong-jae.

369
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,108
You're going to write a book
about Yeong-jae?

370
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,069
You didn't set the setting
as Sky Castle, did you?

371
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,116
She wouldn't have done that.
Jin-hui's probably mistaken.

372
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,659
Right, Su-im?

373
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,544
You're free to write
whatever you wish as a writer.

374
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:32,716
But did you get permission
from Dr. Park Su-chang?

375
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,513
I don't write reportage.
I write children's books.

376
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,932
I'm not going to write factual events

377
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,101
about what happened
to Yeong-jae and his family.

378
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,188
The background setting
is Sky Castle, but--

379
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,940
The background setting is Sky Castle?

380
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,193
Then that will obviously
damage Sky Castle's honor

381
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,529
and ruin its reputation as well.

382
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,741
Is that what you're worried about
right now, Professor Cha?

383
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,202
What's important isn't Sky Castle.

384
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,747
I'm worried about Yeong-jae and Su-chang.

385
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,457
But still,

386
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,083
it won't be good for people to find out

387
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,877
that something like that
happened in Sky Castle.

388
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,628
Yes, that's exactly my point.

389
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,548
If this was an apartment, the property
value would go down in instantly.

390
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,883
The price will drop first.

391
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,051
Did you...

392
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,054
seriously just say that?

393
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,099
Did I say anything wrong?

394
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,520
There are so many kids
like Yeong-jae these days.

395
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,273
It should be the happiest moment
of their lives,

396
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,776
but the adults are ruining everything.

397
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,614
Don't you think people should
find out about it through books?

398
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,115
Why don't you stay out of it, honey?

399
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,910
Emile Zola accused the Dreyfus Affair.

400
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,162
You know him, right?

401
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,163
No, I don't.

402
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,041
If he hadn't mustered up his courage,

403
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,044
do you think it would've been possible
to tear down

404
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,047
the French people's crazy behavior
of trying to frame and kill Alfred Dreyfus

405
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,800
just because he was Jewish?

406
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,551
You're absolutely right.

407
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,222
A writer has a duty
to accuse social problems of the era--

408
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,932
I don't care if it's their duty or not.

409
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:08,395
Why does she have to write
about Sky Castle of all places? Why?

410
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,399
The fact that none of you
were affected by the tragic event

411
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:16,069
of Yeong-jae's family
made me feel miserable.

412
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,865
The competition to get into college
ends up killing so many kids every year.

413
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,951
But our society isn't changing at all.

414
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,703
And that made me feel sad and miserable.

415
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,001
Do you feel as miserable as Su-chang?

416
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,130
I'm asking if you feel
as miserable as Su-chang.

417
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,882
That's why she wishes to write that novel.

418
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,635
She wants to make sure nothing like that
ever happens again.

419
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,054
A doctor who used to save people
with a scalpel

420
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,682
is hunting animals
and barely managing to get by each day.

421
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,809
But you're going to use his misery

422
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,728
just so you could earn money?

423
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,979
What are you talking about?

424
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,273
Don't you think
you're crossing the line here?

425
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,566
Crossing the line?

426
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,068
Let's be honest.
Because of what happened to Su-chang,

427
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,945
you were able to get
your current job and house

428
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,573
and live a comfortable life.
How much more brazen can you get?

429
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,241
Dr. Kang!

430
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,036
Can we talk for a moment?

431
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,750
Honey.

432
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,877
Don't worry.

433
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,840
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

434
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,015
What kind of attitude is this
in the middle of a meal?

435
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,441
Dr. Kang.

436
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,029
My gosh.

437
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,948
They say, "One rotten apple
spoils the barrel."

438
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,116
This is unbelievable.

439
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,578
If you must write that book
regardless of everyone's disapproval,

440
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,664
I'm going to hold you responsible
until the end

441
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,709
as an attorney,
and not as a resident of Sky Castle.

442
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,005
Come on, honey. Let's go.

443
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,175
You can go first.

444
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,274
Please give us our dessert.

445
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,110
Seung-hye. Ms. Jin.

446
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,323
I'm sorry, but can you please
excuse us for a minute?

447
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,159
I have something to say to Ms. Han.

448
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,290
Jin-hui, we should go.

449
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,967
You heard Professor Cha, right?

450
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,469
I'll keep my eyes on you.

451
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,638
I'll sue you for libel.

452
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,269
Please give us our dessert.

453
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:59,065
Can you also excuse us for a while?

454
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,038
I want you to apologize.

455
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,585
You shouldn't have called us
brazen earlier.

456
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,545
You're the one who should apologize.

457
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,505
You are the one who started the fight.

458
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,259
It's hard to have a conversation with you.

459
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,430
You stepped up to do surgery on my people.

460
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,895
And you even made me seem
like a shameless doctor

461
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,355
who only cares about making money.

462
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,982
Let's drop that subject.

463
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,484
I thought you were already done
with your self-justification.

464
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,237
So we won't reach a conclusion
even if we talk more about it.

465
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,156
"Self-justification"?

466
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,117
What did you just say?

467
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,829
Are you calling me ignorant?

468
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,998
Dr. Kang, why are you doing this?

469
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,791
Please calm down. Dr. Kang.

470
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,376
Let go.

471
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,130
If you keep doing this,
I won't hold back either.

472
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,008
You won't hold back? What else can you do?

473
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,802
Are you not scared of anything
because you've gained

474
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,304
Director Choi's favor?

475
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,222
How dare you act so cocky?

476
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,310
Let go of this while I'm being nice.
Stop acting like a loser.

477
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,814
What did you say? "Loser"?

478
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,193
You little jerk. Hey!

479
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:30,740
You dodged?

480
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,118
Well, that's not very polite. You jerk.

481
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,706
-Hey, that hurts.
-No, his arm...

482
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,167
-That hurts.
-I need to get surgery, sir.

483
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,962
-Hey, it hurts.
-Please forgive him.

484
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,838
Forgive me for what? You punk.

485
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,590
What's wrong with you guys?

486
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,175
Please let go of his arm.

487
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,221
His arm...

488
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,790
Hey, asshole!

489
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,333
-Get back here!
-Dr. Kang.

490
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,751
Hey!

491
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,840
Dr. Kang! My gosh. Hold on.

492
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,176
-Hey, don't press down my back.
-Okay, sorry.

493
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,928
-Don't press down my back.
-Call an ambulance.

494
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,513
-Gosh...
-My back. Could you please...

495
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,265
Jin Jin!

496
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,434
Gosh, call an ambulance.

497
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,476
-Hurry.
-How could I...

498
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,270
Dr. Kang, help me here.

499
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,857
Let me ask you a favor for one last time.

500
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,400
I can't...

501
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,987
give up on Yeong-jae's story.

502
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,281
I will write about it.

503
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,574
Don't stop me.

504
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,411
Don't you see what's going on?

505
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,997
This isn't a fight between the two of us.

506
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,583
It'll be everyone
in Sky Castle against you.

507
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,460
How could I stop it?

508
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,131
So you'll just watch
after starting a fire.

509
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,675
Fine.

510
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,429
I'll finish the story
no matter what you do.

511
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,976
While disguising your desire
for fame and success

512
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,395
as your duty as a writer, right?

513
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,982
What did you just say?

514
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,653
You're sad about how the competition
surrounding college admissions

515
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,946
is killing so many students?

516
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,325
Do you even understand
what it feels like to lose a child?

517
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,411
Can you even fathom
the depth of their pain?

518
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,959
You've never even given birth.

519
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,924
Hey!

520
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,805
Mi-hyang,

521
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,182
you know that I've been
going easy on you, right?

522
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,270
What? Will you tell everyone
that I'm actually Kwak Mi-hyang?

523
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,321
You think I'm as low as you?

524
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,243
You keep provoking me,
but I've been patient with you.

525
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,999
Next time, I'll actually kick your ass.

526
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,571
WHO KILLED THAT WOMAN?

527
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,880
SKY CASTLE

528
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,548
Get a signature from every family.

529
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,758
We must fight as a group to stop her.

530
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,469
Seo-jin, don't you think
we're blowing it out of proportion?

531
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,680
I mean, I did as you said,

532
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,016
but it's not like
her book has been published.

533
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,768
It's a fiction,
and it won't have real names.

534
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,645
Aside from other things,

535
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,065
she'll describe it as a castle
where doctors' families live.

536
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,776
With a few minutes on the Internet,
people will find out that it's here.

537
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,738
Besides, what will happen
if people find out

538
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,449
that those of us here spend
billions of won on an admission coach?

539
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,659
College admission
is such a sensitive topic.

540
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,453
We'll become everyone's enemy.

541
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,455
Yes, you're totally right.

542
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,708
My friends already envy me so much
for living here.

543
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,835
What if they find out
about the admission coach?

544
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,712
It'll give them another reason to hate me.

545
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,965
Anyway, if we get
everyone's signature and show her,

546
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,800
it'll make her feel overwhelmed, right?

547
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,093
Of course.

548
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,346
Didn't you hear what Professor Cha said?

549
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,056
He said he'd sue her for defamation.

550
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,601
Okay. I'll work on collecting signatures
starting tomorrow.

551
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,686
All right, thanks.

552
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:22,114
Honk, honk. I stepped aside
upon hearing the car honk.

553
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,451
A new family must be moving
into the house next door.

554
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,620
I wonder if they know

555
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,288
someone died in that house.

556
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,086
You're still awake?

557
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,214
Oh, boy. I can't fall asleep.

558
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,425
Honey,

559
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,052
are you all right?

560
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,055
I felt daunted as I wasn't sure
what the first sentence should be,

561
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,515
but everything's coming together now.

562
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,433
You should go to bed first.

563
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,356
IT'S BEEN A MONTH SINCE SU-MIN'S MOM DIED

564
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,200
-Honey.
-Yes.

565
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,494
By any chance,

566
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,788
is this because of Yeon-du?

567
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,877
It seemed like you were looking
at Yeon-du's photo earlier.

568
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:21,090
I'm wondering
if you still haven't moved on.

569
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,054
I shouldn't move on.

570
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,725
How could I forget that?

571
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,597
During Lee Su-im's teaching practice,

572
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,600
a student in her class
was stressed out about her grades.

573
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,893
Apparently, she locked horns

574
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,771
with the girl's homeroom teacher
who wanted to turn a blind eye.

575
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,564
The teacher wanted to turn a blind eye?

576
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:20,941
Why?

577
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,291
What happened? Did you get hurt?

578
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,836
Can't you just pretend you saw nothing?

579
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,506
Yeon-du.

580
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,299
Yeon-du!

581
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,385
Yeon-du.

582
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,261
Yeon-du!

583
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,515
I told you not to mind her.

584
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,476
Even her parents have given up.
What can a mere trainee teacher do?

585
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,937
Just complete your teaching practice
and leave, okay?

586
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,524
How could you say that
as her homeroom teacher?

587
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,318
They say stupidity is a dangerous thing.

588
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,904
Her father is a university professor.

589
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,656
A professor of psychology at that.

590
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,491
Even when someone like him gave up on her,

591
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,201
who are you to intervene?

592
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,747
If her parents have given up,
you have to help her as her teacher.

593
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,500
You just don't get it, do you?

594
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,669
She hurts herself all the time.

595
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,337
Everyone from her parents

596
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,381
to her psychiatrist has given up.

597
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,883
You say she keeps hurting herself,
and yet you still don't see it.

598
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,302
She's telling you she wants to live.
She's screaming for help.

599
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,846
You have to hold her hand.

600
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,515
She needs someone she can confide in
to get through this!

601
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,725
She just keeps saying
she wants to be alone.

602
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,603
Gosh, seriously. Get out. Get out already!

603
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,980
Yeon-du. Yeon-du!

604
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,816
Call me. You have my number, right?

605
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,611
-Gosh, get out!
-Yeon-du!

606
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,536
I don't think she'll give up easily.

607
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:59,206
I think it's more than
just an interesting story to her.

608
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,917
-What do we do?
-What do you think?

609
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,628
We must stop her.

610
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,685
Ms. Lee Su-im?

611
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,770
Hello, this is Kim Ju-yeong.

612
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,938
Hello.

613
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,650
I was thinking of visiting you again
as I didn't hear from you.

614
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,278
Thank you for calling.

615
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,281
I heard you have questions
about Yeong-jae.

616
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,577
May I decide on the time and location?

617
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,829
Yes, by all means.

618
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,543
You want to meet there?

619
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,898
LOVE ONE ANOTHER

620
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,526
AS I HAVE LOVED YOU,
SO YOU MUST LOVE ONE ANOTHER

621
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,944
GOSPEL OF JOHN 13:34

622
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,136
Can you guess the reason...

623
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,015
why I wanted to meet here?

624
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,895
I thought it's because

625
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,107
you'd like to tell me only the truth.

626
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,901
When I heard you're writing a book
about Yeong-jae's story,

627
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,364
I wanted to do everything
in my power to help you.

628
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,037
Tell me if there's anything
you'd like to know.

629
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,834
Can I be straightforward with you?

630
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,254
Yes, go ahead.

631
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,047
I briefly read

632
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,466
Yeong-jae's diary.

633
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,971
Why did you incite him to take revenge

634
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,515
on his parents?

635
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,605
I'm sorry

636
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,941
I didn't tell you beforehand that
he had received psychological therapy.

637
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,944
But he's all better now.

638
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,947
The doctor even told me that
it won't be a problem for his studies.

639
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,952
Ms. Lee, Yeong-jae has no will
to study whatsoever.

640
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,538
You can take someone to the riverside,

641
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,749
but you can't force them
to drink the water.

642
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,752
No, Coach Kim.

643
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,881
Make him drink the water
even if you have to force him.

644
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,595
I'm sorry. That's not something I can do.

645
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,600
Coach Kim,

646
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,352
please.

647
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:08,479
Please...

648
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,231
just get him accepted.

649
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,068
I know you can do it.

650
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,072
I'll do anything you want me to do

651
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,740
as long as

652
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,951
you can get him accepted.

653
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,329
Yeong-jae hates me.

654
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,624
He hates me for kicking Ga-eul
out of the house.

655
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,379
You can use Ga-eul
or his hatred toward me.

656
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,922
Is there really no way?

657
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,007
You want me to provoke his hatred

658
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,926
and thirst for revenge
toward his own mother?

659
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,349
Will you be okay with that?

660
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,271
Yes.

661
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,817
Yes, I'll be fine.

662
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,988
I'm sure everything will turn out
for the better once he gets accepted.

663
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,075
I'm sure his thirst for revenge
will disappear.

664
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,704
He'll eventually understand
that everything was for his own good.

665
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,207
After all, he's my son.

666
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,342
I was foolish enough to agree with her.

667
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,720
I thought he'd no longer want
to take revenge once he got accepted

668
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,391
and believed that his relationship
with his parents would get better.

669
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,397
It was all my fault. It was because of me.

670
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,360
I told myself

671
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,946
I'd never let another student
end up like Yeon-du.

672
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,365
Did...

673
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,117
Did you just say...

674
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,205
Yeon-du by any chance?

675
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,790
No, never mind.

676
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,625
It's nothing.

677
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,127
Are you talking...

678
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,797
about Song Yeon-du of Jisuh Middle School?

679
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,342
Do you know Yeon-du?

680
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,349
I'm sorry,

681
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,852
but how do you know her?

682
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,189
I was her private tutor
until that accident.

683
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,776
But how do you know her, Ms. Lee?

684
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,320
What?

685
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,490
I also...

686
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,117
taught her for a while in the past.

687
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,329
I see.

688
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,334
Her family became a wreck
after what happened.

689
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,170
In the end, they immigrated to Canada

690
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,255
along with their other kids.

691
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,595
I'm sorry.

692
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,263
I should go.

693
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,600
Thank you for making time to meet me.

694
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,497
I'll do anything you want me to do

695
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,165
as long as

696
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,252
you can get him accepted.

697
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,640
Does that mean you will...

698
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,936
bear with everything
regardless of the consequences?

699
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,484
I'm asking if you are willing
to put up with everything.

700
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,033
Yes.

701
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:51,994
Yes,

702
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:53,787
I will.

703
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,539
I'll bear with it.

704
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,624
Of course, I'll put up with it.

705
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,198
Drive properly! Okay?

706
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,450
My goodness.

707
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,669
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

708
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,338
Are you okay?

709
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,548
Have you gone mad?

710
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,717
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

711
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,469
Yeon-du.

712
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,265
Yeon-du. Wait.

713
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,726
Yeon-du. Yeon-du!

714
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,606
Ms. Lee.

715
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,074
Sir, can you stop the car for a second?

716
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,668
Yeon-du!

717
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,461
Yeon-du!

718
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,630
Yeon-du. Yeon-du...

719
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,299
Yeon-du.

720
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,761
Yeon-du.

721
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,728
Yeon-du!

722
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,365
Ms. Lee,

723
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,409
please help me.

724
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,535
I want...

725
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,787
to live.

726
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,222
Help yourself.

727
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,483
You can manage the work regarding PTA.

728
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,360
I'll just follow your lead.

729
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,821
That's right.

730
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,741
We need to support and lead each other

731
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,534
as a team now.

732
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,871
But it's a problem
that we think so differently.

733
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,500
What do you mean we think differently?

734
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,085
How is the Dreyfus Affair

735
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,463
any similar to what happened to Yeong-jae?

736
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,715
The mad Frenchmen

737
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,717
who framed Dreyfus of being a spy

738
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,511
are not the same as us
who loved Yeong-jae and Myeong-ju

739
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,763
as our neighbors, are we?

740
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,767
Do you think we're different?

741
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,727
The crazy hatred toward the Jews

742
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,688
and the collectivism of the residents
who only care about Sky Castle's honor.

743
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,107
I think they're both the same.

744
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,323
Seung-hye.

745
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,951
I think it's time you chose your path.

746
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,829
What path?

747
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,040
Either focus your energy
on your kids' grades like me

748
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,543
or be like Su-im and
pursue that ridiculous morality of yours.

749
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,378
You want to send your kids to SNU,

750
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,922
but you also want to be a good mom.

751
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,382
If you try to kill two birds
with one stone,

752
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,343
you might end up losing both of them.

753
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,973
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

754
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,352
I've never chased after you
who only cares about the kids' grades.

755
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:55,070
I must've been mistaken for thinking
that you'd be like your husband.

756
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,746
Please give this to Professor Cha.

757
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,625
And I'm guessing
I don't have to remind you

758
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,627
no one should find out about this, right?

759
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,630
Was this the reason

760
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,258
why you let Ye-seo
take the president position?

761
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,722
Korean Literature. English.

762
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,016
Math. Economics.

763
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:26,893
Korean History.

764
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,396
What about the other subjects? Is this it?

765
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,730
Why are you asking me?

766
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,607
Ask her yourself.
You're the one who made the deal.

767
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,234
Do you even know how much this is worth?

768
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,278
There are five semesters left
until college.

769
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,029
And that's ten tests in total.

770
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,447
Imagine how much Kim Ju-yeong gets

771
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,992
after she gives out
expected questions ten times.

772
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,910
This is practically a heap of money.

773
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,288
It costs more than 100 million won.

774
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,416
Are you happy
that you got that expensive book

775
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,834
of expected questions for free?

776
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,918
At times,

777
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,296
you went a little overboard,
but you still wanted

778
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,881
to educate our kids the right way.

779
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,842
You were never the type
who'd use tricks to enhance their grades.

780
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,936
You need to face reality.

781
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,939
Do you know what the purpose
of education is in Korea?

782
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,858
It's to help students
be good at taking tests.

783
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,820
-What?
-Once they get good grades,

784
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,488
they'll end up studying harder.

785
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,073
The memory of success

786
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,451
will act as their motivation.

787
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,870
And it's a parent's role
to give them that memory.

788
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,251
You just wait and see.

789
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:37,213
Our kids will get Level One
this time no matter what.

790
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:02,739
Eat up.

791
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,950
My wife worries about you a lot.

792
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,746
I tell myself that you'll be fine
since you're strong and smart,

793
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:13,124
but then I find myself wondering
if you've eaten or not.

794
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,129
I'm doing well.

795
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,592
I know my mom will feel upset
if she sees me having a hard time,

796
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,053
so I never skip my meals.

797
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,596
Don't worry, Ms. Lee.

798
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,015
Yes, that's good.

799
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,019
Should I show you around
the neighborhood after we eat?

800
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,688
Sure.

801
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,525
-This question's really hard.
-Let me see.

802
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,071
It's "C."

803
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,699
Because...

804
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,410
You don't know either.

805
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,246
We're always the only ones
in the beginner's class.

806
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,164
This is freaking annoying.

807
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,959
If we fail again, we'll have to study
with elementary school kids.

808
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,211
-What is this? Gosh.
-My gosh.

809
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,588
How embarrassing.

810
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,133
It's a quadratic equation.

811
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,011
Should I solve the question for you?

812
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,722
Consider yourselves lucky.

813
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,598
She's really good at math.

814
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,434
In order to measure this line,

815
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,686
you need the coordinates of both A and B.

816
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,522
Now, you need to multiply four,
the bottom line,

817
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,067
by four, the height,
then divide that by two.

818
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,611
-What would be the answer?
-Eight.

819
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,533
Ye-bin, you're really smart.

820
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,619
Ye-bin, if you manage
to meet the right teacher,

821
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,163
your level will rise in no time.

822
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,166
You teach so well.

823
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,043
I want you to become my tutor.

824
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,255
Oh, really?

825
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,175
But I also need to study,

826
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,636
so I can only teach one person.

827
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,430
One person?

828
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,228
I'll see you.

829
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,775
Hey, where are you going?

830
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,912
I got everyone's signature
apart from the ones who are abroad.

831
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,705
It's a real hot potato.

832
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,124
They all think we should stop her
from writing the book.

833
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,252
-Seung-hye didn't sign.
-Exactly.

834
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:24,089
Out of all the women here,
she was the only one.

835
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,924
She's the only one who didn't sign.

836
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:29,385
Since we're on the subject,
I really don't like her.

837
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,805
She's the backstabbing type.

838
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,140
She's already played her role
as the obsessive mom

839
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,725
and sent Se-ri to Harvard.

840
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,018
Now, she acts all noble.

841
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,021
"Don't you know Emile Zola?"

842
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,024
No, I don't. So what?

843
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,819
Send out an announcement
to all the residents.

844
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,654
Let's get started.

845
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,200
Mom.

846
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,829
-Hello.
-My goodness.

847
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,207
Why were you calling out
for your mom like that?

848
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,376
Ye-bin, what's the matter?

849
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,677
That's where Gi-jun and Seo-jun live.

850
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,597
This is where Su-han lives.

851
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,683
And this is where Ye-seo lives.

852
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,902
You want to get private lessons
from Hye-na?

853
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,655
Yes.

854
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,157
I'm so proud of you.

855
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,993
I can't believe you're voluntarily asking
to get private lessons.

856
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,495
Was it Hye-na?

857
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,997
Who's Hye-na?

858
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,917
Did she offer to give you private lessons?

859
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,336
No, Su-han...

860
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,967
She said she can only teach one person.

861
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,136
I want to pass the level test.

862
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,638
It's embarrassing to study
with elementary school kids.

863
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,558
So who's this Hye-na girl?

864
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,226
She's Ye-seo's classmate.

865
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,936
Classmate? Goodness.

866
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,481
How can a high school kid
do private lessons?

867
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,690
Exactly.

868
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,277
Ye-bin, I'll find a better teacher--

869
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,113
No, I enjoy being taught by Hye-na.

870
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,241
Forget it.

871
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,580
She must really like Hye-na.

872
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,290
How did she get her so hooked?

873
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:25,752
Hye-na?

874
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,754
She congratulated you?

875
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,714
Yes. Isn't it weird?

876
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,801
She's changed a little
since her mom passed away.

877
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,182
Hey, I need to make a phone call.

878
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,273
Let me ask you something.

879
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,944
I know you wouldn't do that,

880
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,445
but did you tell Hye-na that I asked you

881
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,405
to make her give up
on becoming the school president?

882
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,782
Do you think I'm crazy?

883
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,034
My son's future depends on you.

884
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,956
She got the message
as soon as I told her to give up.

885
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,875
Seo-jin, you really should
be careful of Hye-na.

886
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,628
She's really something, you know.
She's not scared of adults.

887
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,757
She even managed to threaten me
and took three million won from me.

888
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,842
Really?

889
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,471
Okay, thank you.

890
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,650
Coach Kim,

891
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,860
I called because I got worried.

892
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,070
I think Hye-na found out

893
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,073
that I was the one who made her
give up on the election.

894
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,077
And it bothers me that she keeps
roaming around Ye-seo and Ye-bin.

895
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,955
Don't worry, Ms. Han.

896
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,457
Okay, bye.

897
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,346
Mr. Jo.

898
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,682
Keep an eye on Hye-na.

899
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:11,941
Kim Hye-na.

900
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,069
Kim Hye-na.

901
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:17,614
Is Kim Hye-na here?

902
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,283
I want you to check this again.

903
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,701
Is Kim Hye-na here?

904
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,204
Kim Hye-na.

905
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,621
YOU MUST'VE BEEN SURPRISED

906
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,683
THERE'S SOMETHING I MUST TELL YOU.
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER.

907
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,246
What did you just say?

908
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,458
I said you should have Hye-na
move into your place.

909
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,129
Hye-na? Why?

910
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:09,016
Wouldn't it be wise for you
to keep the ticking bomb close by

911
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,685
while you get rid of the detonator?

912
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:11,978
"Ticking bomb"?

913
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,273
Not only did you make Hye-na
withdraw from the election,

914
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:18,359
but you also made Do-hoon's mom
stop supporting her financially.

915
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,444
On top of that,

916
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,363
she even lost her mother,
who was her only family.

917
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,033
Hye-na now has nothing to be afraid of.

918
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,478
Do I know you?

919
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:59,358
Hello, I'm Ye-seo's classmate, Kim Hye-na.

920
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:42,527
Frankly, this is my first time
making this kind of proposition.

921
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,153
Why did Ye-seo's grades drop?

922
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,947
Whose fault is it that I bombed the exam?

923
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,657
It's all your fault, Mom.

924
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,410
Hye-na is the best pacemaker
who can toughen up Ye-seo.

925
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,121
Did you say you'd help
U-ju's mom with her novel?

926
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,792
I used to have a kid
who was like a blessing to me as well.

927
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,710
Are you going to continue
writing the novel?

928
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,505
Why are you taking action as a group
like this? What are you so afraid of?

929
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,632
Do you have an inferiority complex?
Why are you twisting--

930
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,050
Why are you talking like that?

931
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,177
You understand how it's like
to be underprivileged.

932
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,345
So?

933
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,390
What is it that you want to say?

934
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,435
