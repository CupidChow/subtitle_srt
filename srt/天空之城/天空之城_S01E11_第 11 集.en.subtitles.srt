00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,531
WELCOME
TUTOR KIM HYE-NA

2
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,585
It's okay. I'll get the door.

3
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,045
Please tidy up.

4
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:38,848
Hye-na.

5
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,770
Come on, Ye-bin. She's your tutor now.

6
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,775
Hello, Tutor Hye-na.

7
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,362
Thank you for hiring me.

8
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,114
I should thank you.

9
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,907
Please take good care of Ye-bin.

10
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,660
By the way,

11
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,788
can I really get into the intensive class?

12
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:02,914
Of course.

13
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,707
You're super smart, you know.

14
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,543
This is so great.

15
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,922
See? I told you that you just have
to trust her and do as she says.

16
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,757
Come on in.

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,261
I'll carry this for you.

18
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,388
It's okay, Ye-bin. I got this. It's heavy.

19
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,430
Ye-bin.

20
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,267
-Yes?
-I have to talk to Hye-na about something.

21
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,476
What?

22
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,860
All right.

23
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,763
Your goal is to get Ye-seo
into SNU's med school.

24
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,682
So?

25
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,019
Hye-na knows
that she is Dr. Kang's daughter.

26
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,980
If Ye-seo or her mom finds out,
she'll fail to get into med school,

27
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,441
-and it'll ruin her family--
-There's no need to worry about that.

28
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,865
Ye-seo will get accepted.

29
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,455
I'll make sure of it.

30
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,706
But Ms. Kim,

31
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,834
Hye-na is a daring
and unpredictable child.

32
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,920
If you let someone like her
live with Ye-seo,

33
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,840
it'll be like installing a ticking bomb
beneath Ye-seo's desk.

34
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,595
We'll have to see if she'll turn out
to be a ticking bomb or a firecracker.

35
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,688
Ye-bin comes home
from her academy at 10 p.m.

36
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,523
You can teach her for two hours then.

37
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,775
School break starts soon,

38
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,861
so you can teach her
according to her new academy schedule.

39
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,579
I made a lesson plan for Ye-bin.

40
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,374
In order to get her
into the intensive class in three months,

41
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,000
it'll be better to cover a chapter a day

42
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,628
instead of teaching her
for a set amount of time each day.

43
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,424
You pick her up from school
and from the academy, right?

44
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,718
Would it be okay if I went with you?

45
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,763
You want to come with me?

46
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,224
I don't mind riding the bus.

47
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,893
But commuting to and from school
takes me about an hour in total.

48
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,396
So I thought I could teach her
some mathematical formulae

49
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,648
and briefly cover the concepts
during that time.

50
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,442
Sure, that's a good idea.

51
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,655
Anyway, I'm counting on you
to get Ye-bin into the intensive class.

52
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,366
Yes, I'll try my best.

53
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,451
Then shall I show you your room?

54
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,458
Ye-seo's a little sensitive these days.

55
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,002
You know why, right?

56
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,837
Don't worry.

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,505
I'll make sure I don't bother her.

58
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,173
Okay, thanks.

59
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,176
I'm not sure
if your room will be to your liking.

60
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,139
I used to live in a place
that didn't get any sunlight.

61
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,390
Really?

62
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,518
This may be the basement,
but you'll get plenty of sunlight.

63
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,426
My gosh, I love it.

64
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,219
Is this my room?

65
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,847
I'm glad you like it.

66
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,183
Let's eat dinner
once my husband and Ye-seo come home.

67
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,060
Could you tell her about the other things?

68
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,227
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,354
Thank you.

70
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,190
I'll see you later then.

71
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,372
Listen carefully, kid.

72
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,667
You can use the bathroom
that's across from this room.

73
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,461
You can only leave the house
on the weekends.

74
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,046
The same applies during school break.

75
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,006
And you can never go upstairs

76
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,217
apart from when you go up to teach Ye-bin.

77
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,680
So you're telling me not to be seen
by anyone in this family.

78
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,684
I'm telling you to be careful.

79
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,646
You should be grateful.

80
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,024
Today's your first day here,
so you'll be eating with the family.

81
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,902
But you'll have to eat with me
starting from tomorrow. Okay?

82
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,612
Please

83
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,323
send my meals to my room.

84
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,325
I'll eat by myself.

85
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,870
-What?
-I'll clean my own room

86
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,206
and do my own laundry.

87
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,417
So don't come into my room from now on.

88
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,340
You're unbelievable.

89
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,693
Mom.

90
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,946
I've finally made it into this house.

91
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,658
This is only the beginning.

92
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,217
If you hadn't revealed your past,

93
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,887
we wouldn't have had to take in
some stranger.

94
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,140
Things have turned out this way now.
There's no point in talking about--

95
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,349
Do you think I don't know that?

96
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,311
I'm only saying this
because Ye-seo's grades went down.

97
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,565
She'll end up helping out our kids,
just like Coach Kim said.

98
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,692
So don't be too cold toward her.

99
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,737
Cut the nonsense.

100
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,573
Do you think I'll make it obvious
that I don't want her here?

101
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,386
My goodness, how gorgeous.
Gosh, my little baby.

102
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,683
-Mom!
-My goodness, gracious!

103
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,936
Gosh.

104
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,814
You punk.

105
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,901
Didn't I tell you to not talk to me
when I'm taking care of my babies?

106
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,528
How many times do I have to tell you?

107
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,739
If I don't get accepted to into the
more advanced class, it's all your fault.

108
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,698
What?

109
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,367
My goodness.

110
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,288
That little punk. What did you
just say? Come over here.

111
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,415
What did you say?

112
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,792
What?

113
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,878
If I fail my assessment test again,
it's all your fault.

114
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,506
Are you being serious?
Why is that my fault?

115
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,509
Hye-na moved into Ye-bin's place. Darn it.

116
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,719
I told her first
that I wanted her to tutor me.

117
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,097
She moved into her house?

118
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,723
As a live-in tutor?

119
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,601
If Ye-bin moves up into a better class
and I fail, it'll be so humiliating.

120
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,728
That's why I told you
to get private tutoring lessons.

121
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,814
You even said no to a student from SNU.

122
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,315
But you want a high school kid?

123
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,609
I told you already
that Hye-na's a great teacher!

124
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,902
Why don't you believe me?

125
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,738
Why do you do things your way
when I'm the student?

126
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,865
You're going to scold me if I fail again.

127
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,576
-My goodness.
-It's so unfair.

128
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,745
Where are you going?
You should be studying! My gosh.

129
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,541
Why are you being so harsh
on my precious son?

130
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,459
I'm not being harsh on him.

131
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,752
He's just laying the groundwork

132
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,629
because he thinks
he's going to fail the test again.

133
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,257
Gosh, that punk. He's so smart.

134
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,762
But it is strange.

135
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,641
Why would she hire
a high school student as a live-in tutor?

136
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,270
WELCOME
TUTOR KIM HYE-NA

137
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,446
You even baked a cake for Hye-na?

138
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,239
You agreed to her moving in.

139
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,741
Do you think I liked the idea?

140
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,159
I only agreed because of Coach Kim.

141
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,495
Whatever the case, just be on good terms
with her while she's here.

142
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,665
She's right. You could actually
become really good friends

143
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,250
if you befriend your rival.

144
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,502
You should get along with her.

145
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,755
Hye-na's here, Mom.

146
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,341
Okay. Come here, Hye-na.

147
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,098
You must be Hye-na.

148
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,060
Hello.

149
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,479
Hi. Take a seat.

150
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,314
Let's all sit down.

151
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,696
Nice.

152
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,035
Welcome.

153
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,749
I'll trust you with Ye-bin.

154
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,502
Okay, I'll do my best.

155
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,879
She's a great teacher, Dad.

156
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,382
She explains things much better
and is more fun than academy teachers.

157
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,217
My gosh, really?

158
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,011
Seeing Ye-bin this excited

159
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,347
makes me look forward to the results.

160
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,724
You think you can get Ye-bin
into the intensive class?

161
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,893
Isn't that too ambitious?

162
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,479
What if I get in?

163
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,648
Stop it.

164
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,402
Don't worry, Ye-seo.
Ye-bin will get into that class.

165
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,987
My gosh, you're way too confident
about yourself.

166
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,490
How are you going to do
what the top teachers

167
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,950
in Daechi-dong failed to do?

168
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,618
Ye-bin's smart,

169
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,996
so she'll catch up
once she learns all the concepts.

170
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,251
I tested Ye-bin yesterday at the academy

171
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,877
in order to come up with a study plan.

172
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh, really?

173
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,630
Once I taught her the principles,

174
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,133
she managed to solve the hard questions
quite easily.

175
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,927
I think Ye-bin lost interest in studying

176
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,597
because she wasn't fully aware
of the basic concepts but had to catch up

177
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,891
with studying ahead of her grade.

178
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,104
Do you think the academy wouldn't
have taught her the basic concepts?

179
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,398
Don't you know how good that academy is?

180
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,441
Even you go there.

181
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,317
Regardless of how good an academy may be,

182
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,696
they have a limit to teaching students
based on their individual levels.

183
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,948
They can teach know-how
about how to solve questions

184
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,033
in order to improve our grades
in a short period of time.

185
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,453
But they can't get students
interested in mathematics.

186
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,079
Ultimately,

187
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,415
an academy's purpose is to earn a profit.

188
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,465
Hye-na, you're very smart.

189
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,802
Gosh.

190
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,054
-Wow.
-Ye-seo.

191
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,639
How's your new Korean teacher?

192
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,391
Just so-so.

193
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,810
A bit better, I guess.

194
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,687
He'd better be better.

195
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,024
You got full marks on everything
but got three wrong in Korean.

196
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,194
That means the teaching method
was the problem.

197
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,904
Exactly.

198
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,698
She'd have gotten full marks
if the new teacher had come sooner.

199
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,867
She can get full marks next time.

200
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,952
My daughter can do anything.

201
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,204
Right, Ye-seo?

202
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,580
You bet.

203
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,041
I'll go to SNU med school's
alumni meeting with you when I'm older.

204
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,209
Yes, of course.

205
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,170
Let's walk in together arm-in-arm.

206
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,507
Eat up.

207
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,509
What an idea.

208
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,265
That's great.

209
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,726
I was so worried about her.

210
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,854
I know I suggested
that we let Hye-na move in with us,

211
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,439
but I was a bit worried.

212
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,732
You too?

213
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,526
We thought

214
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,654
you'd insist that we let Hye-na stay.

215
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,030
Come on, Dad.

216
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,990
I'm a grown man.

217
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,409
A grown man living with a female friend

218
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,953
is a very touchy issue.

219
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,543
You're so good at reading your mom's mind.

220
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm pretty good at reading your mind too.

221
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,804
Hurry up and do the dishes, honey.

222
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,430
Your mom's slaps really hurt.

223
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,937
-Hello?
-Ms. Lee?

224
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,981
This is Cha Min-hyeok.

225
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,149
Hello, Professor Cha.

226
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,944
I called to check because you seemed
to have forgotten your promise

227
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,571
to give us an answer within three days.

228
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,740
It's been over ten days already.

229
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm sorry, but...

230
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,162
I never said I'd give you an answer
within three days.

231
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,083
What a pity.

232
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,004
Do you still not understand
how serious this issue is?

233
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
Professor Cha, it's Hwang Chi-yeong.

234
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,847
I wasn't able to attend the meeting,

235
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,557
but I heard what happened.

236
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,475
Then you must understand

237
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,937
that I called because the residents
kept calling me about it.

238
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,398
I'd like you to make up your mind,
and soon.

239
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,818
I thought you'd approach the issue
more rationally than anyone.

240
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,237
I find it very regrettable that you defend

241
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,323
only one party.

242
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,202
You may consider this
the tyranny of the majority,

243
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,122
but when the interests
are so deeply opposed,

244
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,333
isn't it the rule of democracy

245
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,168
to follow what the majority wants?

246
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,586
Of course, it is.

247
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,173
But if the majority vote is abused
in the name of democracy,

248
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,301
isn't it the case
that the few become victims?

249
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,846
I can't just watch my wife
become a victim.

250
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,182
I believe you can understand that.

251
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,892
Goodbye, then.

252
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,021
He's just like his wife.

253
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,815
Is she insisting
on writing the book or what?

254
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,989
You were really cool, Dad.

255
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,539
Seo-jin's the ringleader.

256
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,960
Why take the lead
when she's not doing anything?

257
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,295
Didn't you hear the residents' calls?

258
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,255
I got three just today.

259
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,884
That's why she put you in charge.

260
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,554
You're never satisfied
until you handle things on your own,

261
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,431
and she is using that to her advantage.

262
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,352
What do you take me for?

263
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,562
Do you think I'll let myself be used?

264
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,733
Gosh, I'm jealous.

265
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,945
If that friend of yours could help,

266
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,364
nothing in the world would be impossible.

267
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,492
If your hospital director is promoted,

268
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,703
that would be good
for your career as well.

269
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,746
It'd be killing two birds with one stone.

270
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,289
Yes, it would.

271
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,166
If only that were possible.

272
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,627
I can have my cake and eat it too,

273
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,213
or clean a stream and catch the fish.

274
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,969
You can sweep a yard and find a penny,

275
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,097
or find your love and get lucky.

276
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,107
I'm using Kang Jun-sang.

277
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,360
He looked down on me
because his family is powerful,

278
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,280
but this time he came to me
groveling for a favor.

279
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,783
He's just a butcher with a scalpel
and yet he pretends

280
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,702
to be a scholar who knows literature.

281
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,372
But deep inside him,
he has great ambitions.

282
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,291
Dr. Kang?

283
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,751
I thought

284
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,420
he was far from being ambitious.

285
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,255
You're a terrible judge of character.

286
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,841
If he doesn't have ambition,

287
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,260
why would he be trying
to get Director Choi

288
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,473
what he wants
when he should be gnashing his teeth?

289
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,392
What are you saying?
What does the director want?

290
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,020
Wait and see.

291
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,522
Jun-sang will become the planning manager,

292
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,816
the second most powerful man
of Junam University Hospital.

293
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,860
That's it?

294
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,155
Is that why you told me
to appease his wife,

295
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,157
whether she's Han Seo-jin
or Kwak Mi-hyang?

296
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,492
Of course.

297
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,578
Why else would I help Kang Jun-sang?

298
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,791
I'm doing this to better our future.

299
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,502
Our future.

300
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,058
THE FAMILY WHO LIVED IN YOUR HOUSE BEFORE.
DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY MOVED?

301
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,311
No. Why did they move?

302
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,813
The mom...

303
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,481
killed herself.

304
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,901
So everyone left.
Her husband and Yeong-jae.

305
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,765
Now that I gave her
SNU's med school acceptance letter,

306
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,392
I've fulfilled my duties as a son.

307
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,185
I, Park Yeong-jae,

308
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,729
am not your son anymore.

309
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,575
"I got in for you, now leave me alone"?

310
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,369
Should I let that punk be?

311
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,789
He wants to take revenge on us.

312
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,878
Must we leave this jerk alone?

313
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,423
If he disappears on us,
we'll never find him again.

314
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,885
I can't give up on Yeong-jae.

315
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,055
I can't give up on my son!

316
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,790
COACH KIM JU-YEONG

317
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,224
I'm sorry. You must be busy.

318
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,270
It's fine.

319
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,023
I was wondering
how you were doing with your book.

320
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,734
That's actually
what I wanted to see you about.

321
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,236
I had no intention

322
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,197
of writing a story literally
based on Yeong-jae's family.

323
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,369
But I think I should still ask
his father for permission.

324
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,329
I was wondering

325
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,623
if you had Mr. Park's number.

326
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,420
I can help you locate him,

327
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,214
but even if you do get to meet him,

328
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,674
do you think he will

329
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,342
give you his permission?

330
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,434
Locate Yeong-jae's father.

331
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,019
What for?

332
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,608
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,288
Lee Su-im meeting Park Su-chang?

334
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,585
Why didn't I think of that?

335
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,509
If they just meet...

336
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,888
Of course.

337
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,182
If you become the planning manager,

338
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,267
wouldn't our department

339
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,228
become the most powerful one
in Junam University Hospital?

340
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,605
-Right?
-Yes, of course.

341
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,024
You bet.

342
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,319
Powerful? As if.

343
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,487
Not when there's
the Spine and Joint Center.

344
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,407
Their profits are terrible these days.

345
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,200
Everything that Hwang Chi-yeong

346
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,369
gets into doesn't make money.

347
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,079
It's terrible.

348
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,542
This could be...

349
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,588
the perfect opportunity to ride on
the thousand-year-old tortoise's back.

350
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,089
Don't you think?

351
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,555
By the way,

352
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,266
did you know that, Dr. Woo?

353
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,559
What?

354
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,021
You know the party representative
Kim Hyeok-jae.

355
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,774
Both he and Professor Cha
graduated from Namseok High.

356
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,734
Then...

357
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,736
That's how they know each other?

358
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,196
Apparently,

359
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,199
they grew up like brothers
in the same neighborhood.

360
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,747
Then...

361
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,543
how about I ask Mr. Im
to arrange something

362
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,129
so that you, Professor Cha,
and the Tortoise can

363
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,464
play golf together?

364
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,055
KIM HYEOK-JAE

365
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,852
What's going on?

366
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,109
Dr. Kang has a connection
with the representative of the party.

367
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,532
Oh, boy.

368
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,244
It's been a while
since I last saw Dr. Kang.

369
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,788
Shall I meet him for some tea?

370
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,165
Yes. I'll give him a call, sir.

371
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,383
MR. IM

372
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,020
I told you to take about ten days off
and get some rest.

373
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,982
Why are you already back at work?

374
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,610
Since you did such a perfect job
with the surgery,

375
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,613
I can handle this much work.

376
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,657
Right,

377
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,493
this place felt so empty

378
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,912
without you, Dr. Woo.

379
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,706
Pardon? Oh, I see.

380
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,750
Just a moment, please.

381
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,676
Dr. Kang.

382
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,808
Yes, Kang Jun-sang speaking.

383
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,270
Director Choi would like to see me?

384
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:41,813
Now?

385
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,445
Well, I'm with a guest at the moment.

386
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,575
Yes, let him know I'll stop by
in about 30 to 40 minutes.

387
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,368
Okay.

388
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,042
That's not enough.

389
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,960
You should keep the Tortoise on his toes

390
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,963
by making him wait longer, Dr. Kang.

391
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,300
As if.

392
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,847
I could've gone by myself.
You didn't have to come with me.

393
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,807
You two have never met before.

394
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,519
It'll be easier to get his permission

395
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,355
if I come along.

396
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,357
Thank you so much.

397
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,234
How can I repay you?

398
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,572
You can repay me by writing a great book.

399
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,925
I told you not to,
but you keep doing it all day long.

400
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,430
You'll hurt your shoulders
if you keep this up, Dr. Park.

401
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,829
Are you the person who called?

402
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,289
Yes, sir.

403
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,168
Mr. Park.

404
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,006
It's me, Kim Ju-yeong.

405
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,357
I've been thinking about...

406
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,901
what you said to me.

407
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,615
I, too, hope no one else experiences
what Yeong-jae went through.

408
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,327
That's why I brought someone
who's been wanting to meet you,

409
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,498
even knowing that it could come across
as discourteous.

410
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,095
Get lost at once.

411
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,474
I'll make sure my book

412
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,018
doesn't harm you or Yeong-jae in any way.

413
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,566
You.

414
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,777
Don't you get it?

415
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,366
I told you to make sure
that such a tragedy doesn't happen again.

416
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,410
Because you ruined my son's life...

417
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,330
and killed my wife.

418
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,377
Yes,

419
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,254
I ruined his life and killed her.

420
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,131
Blame me all you want.

421
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,843
Will you blame others
and stay resentful forever?

422
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,972
You said you wanted to be
a decent father to Yeong-jae now.

423
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,058
Will chopping wood all day long...

424
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,478
help you be a decent father to him?

425
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,913
Oh, boy.

426
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,875
He chops wood nonstop all day long

427
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,045
because waiting for his son
makes him anxious.

428
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,382
Sir.

429
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,135
He's waiting for his son?

430
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,262
What do you mean by that?

431
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,980
MY SON

432
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,481
You know the mountain cabin

433
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,859
we used to go together often
when you were little, right?

434
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,069
I'll wait for you there.

435
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,601
I heard you're waiting

436
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,644
for Yeong-jae.

437
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,690
Telling me what you've been
bottling up inside

438
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,442
might help you

439
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,069
feel a little less anxious.

440
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,951
I met a student...

441
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,747
during my teacher training 20 years ago.

442
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,751
She also had a problem
with her parents due to her grades.

443
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,505
Back then,

444
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,634
I just stood by and watched like a coward.

445
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,473
But I don't want to repeat
the same mistake, so I came to see you.

446
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,766
Do you know...

447
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,103
what thought crossed my mind first
when I heard about my friend's son

448
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,065
who took his own life a while back?

449
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,027
"What did his parents do
for him to take his own life?"

450
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,238
I blamed the parents first.

451
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,158
If people find out about
what happened to my wife,

452
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,201
they will

453
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,620
blame us, her family, first.

454
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,498
Yeong-jae must be...

455
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,209
beating himself up over his mom's death,

456
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,002
and...

457
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,922
I'm sure the guilt is suffocating him.

458
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,927
I can't let people point their fingers
at him on top of that.

459
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,304
I must...

460
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,975
protect my son.

461
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,234
I didn't think that far.

462
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,283
But Dr. Park...

463
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,536
we should make sure
this tragedy doesn't repeat--

464
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,787
Do you think...

465
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,624
people will change
after learning about my family's tragedy?

466
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,587
Do you think they'll sympathize deeply
with my son's pain

467
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,880
and change as a result?

468
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,178
Dr. Park.

469
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,224
Every year, young students die
because of their grades

470
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,644
or the stress of getting into college,

471
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,231
but the world isn't changing at all.

472
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,442
Until when do we need to watch those kids

473
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,111
suffer from such wrongful and sad deaths?

474
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,285
So are you saying you believe

475
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,662
that you can change the world
by writing a book?

476
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,248
It won't change right away,
but someone must step up.

477
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,085
-If we keep trying--
-Get rid of that false hope.

478
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,796
I was like everyone else.

479
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,884
Even when I heard that
my friend's son committed suicide,

480
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,552
I only blamed his parents.

481
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,473
And I said that the kid was
too weakhearted to be a man.

482
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,186
This is something
no one will ever understand

483
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,229
unless they experience it themselves.

484
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,575
I understand your sincerity,
but it'll all be useless.

485
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,954
It'll only end up ruining...

486
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,499
Yeong-jae's and my life.

487
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,143
-Hello.
-Welcome.

488
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,185
Have you been well?

489
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,813
Yes, it's been a while
since you last came.

490
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,628
She's going to quit writing
about Yeong-jae?

491
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,090
How did you manage
to convince that stubborn woman?

492
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,843
You shouldn't worry about that anymore.

493
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,471
How's Hye-na?

494
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,392
Ye-bin is

495
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,770
starting to enjoy studying.

496
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,439
More importantly, she hasn't caused
any problems with Ye-seo.

497
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,608
She's a smart kid,

498
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,569
so she's behaving a lot better
than I expected. But...

499
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,493
Never mind. It's nothing.

500
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,787
Winter break is coming up.

501
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,705
How is Ye-seo's schedule going to change?

502
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,918
You know she needs to study harder
during the break, right?

503
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,589
You just need to create
a comfortable environment

504
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,050
and make sure Ye-seo doesn't get stressed.

505
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,636
Yes, of course. I know that's my job.

506
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,682
She keeps making mistakes in Korean.

507
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,726
Shouldn't you come up with a solution?

508
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,689
She could actually use this chance
to her advantage.

509
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,109
She'll be able to come up with a story

510
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,028
about how she managed to increase
her grades even during a crisis.

511
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,489
That can only happen
if she actually manages to overcome it.

512
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,867
I'd like to hear how you're going
to help her overcome it.

513
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,289
I'll help her overcome her weakness

514
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,916
by making her divide each sentence

515
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,751
and practice analyzing
the meaning behind it.

516
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,878
Her new Korean teacher
used to make questions

517
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,256
for the CSATs. You know that, right?

518
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,926
There's no point

519
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,554
in shutting the stable door
after the horse has bolted.

520
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,973
You need to prepare her
for the worst-case scenario

521
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,308
so that she doesn't make
the same mistake again.

522
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,396
She might have to take a different
approach without a good school record.

523
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,273
As I've always told you,

524
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,733
there's not a single error in my plan

525
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,278
to get Ye-seo accepted
to SNU's med school.

526
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,529
Of course,

527
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,492
that will be based on the fact
that she doesn't get stressed at home.

528
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,629
Yes, of course. That's a given.

529
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,346
Of course,

530
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:26,392
that will be based on the fact
that she doesn't get stressed at home.

531
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,230
It seems like she knows something.

532
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,483
Did Ye-seo tell her?

533
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,405
No, Ye-seo's too proud to tell anyone.

534
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,242
MR. JO

535
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,537
Yes, Mr. Jo.

536
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,164
Ye-seo won't eat dinner?

537
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,624
I said, no.

538
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,876
I don't want to eat.
I have indigestion anyway.

539
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,253
You didn't eat lunch,
and you want to skip dinner too?

540
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,424
Have some.

541
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,092
You need to eat in order to study.

542
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,428
You can't study on an empty stomach.
Hurry up and eat.

543
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,683
I need to feel at ease in order to study.

544
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,393
What's wrong?

545
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,354
Did something happen?

546
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,732
Don't you get it?

547
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,859
I hate Hye-na,
but I have to see her face all day.

548
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,486
And my own mom lied...

549
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,991
How do you expect me to eat?

550
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,369
Okay, fine.

551
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,789
By the way,

552
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,209
did you tell anyone about me?

553
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,756
Why would I
when it's nothing to be proud of?

554
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,133
Gi-jun and Seo-jun knew already
even though I never told them.

555
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,427
So?

556
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,973
Are you always going to get angry,
refuse to eat,

557
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,558
and act out every time
something like this happens?

558
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,270
-It'll only be your loss.
-Do you think I don't know that?

559
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,188
I don't want to think about it,
but I can't help it.

560
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,815
I should be studying
every second of the day.

561
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,025
I'm so angry that it's driving me nuts.

562
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,738
I'm asking you like this.

563
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,156
Please try to concentrate.

564
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,909
If you fail to get into
to SNU's med school--

565
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,287
Why wouldn't I get in?

566
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,790
I have Coach Kim.

567
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,640
If I exchange this with this,

568
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,643
this will become 288

569
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,771
minus 72 pi.

570
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,232
The answer is...

571
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,902
ANSWER: NUMBER 5

572
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,195
Number five.

573
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,614
You got it right. Good job, Ye-bin.

574
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,826
How was it? Do you understand it now?

575
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,913
Yes, I understand it completely
now that I tried explaining it.

576
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,625
That means you didn't
get this question wrong.

577
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,087
Let's make it a star.

578
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,006
A star? Really?

579
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,137
I'm so happy!

580
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,514
My gosh!

581
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,559
-It's a doctor's gown!
-Yes.

582
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,269
-Awesome! It even has my name on it.
-Dad.

583
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,187
Dad.

584
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,563
Hey, Dad.

585
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,939
Hey.

586
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,150
Just a second. What's up?

587
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,486
I got into the basics class.

588
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,654
I got into a higher class, Dad.

589
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,947
-Really?
-Yes.

590
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,617
You're incredible, Ye-bin.
You finally got in.

591
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,411
Yes, I'm confident about getting
into the intensive class as well.

592
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,749
I should give you a reward.

593
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,418
What would you like? Do you want anything?

594
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,547
I don't need anything.
You should reward Hye-na instead.

595
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,007
-Shall I?
-Yes.

596
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,967
Hye-na, come here.

597
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,101
Tell me if you want anything.
I'll buy it for you.

598
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,563
No, it's okay. I only did my job.

599
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,110
Then how about I give you a bonus?

600
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,821
No, thank you for the offer.

601
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,115
But I'm already getting paid to teach.

602
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,741
That's more than enough.

603
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,288
Your mom raised you very well.

604
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,168
Thank you.

605
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,423
90% OF THE WORK TO GET A KID
INTO COLLEGE IS DONE BY THE MOM

606
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,967
I think

607
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,678
Hye-na's a really decent girl.

608
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,014
She teaches Ye-bin really well.

609
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,642
And she's humble and polite.

610
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,477
My gosh.

611
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,480
She's doing better than I expected.

612
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,942
But she's too mature for a kid,
and that makes me feel uneasy.

613
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,194
It's hard to be like that at her age.

614
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,405
Plus, she's not causing
any trouble with Ye-seo.

615
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,283
That's because she knows
no good will come from that.

616
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,703
She's a poor kid
who doesn't have any parents.

617
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,204
My goodness,

618
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,123
you're unbelievable.

619
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,334
You tend to see the worst in people.

620
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,711
My gosh.

621
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,466
Raise your arms.

622
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,635
Look. Look at this.

623
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,596
You drive me crazy.

624
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,473
How do you always get 60?

625
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,433
When will you get better?

626
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,477
How will you get
into a specialized high school?

627
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,562
How will you get accepted
to medical school?

628
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,355
My gosh.

629
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,984
What about Ye-bin?

630
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,694
Did she pass the test?

631
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,199
-Yes.
-She passed? She really passed?

632
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,325
You little...

633
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,078
That's why I said
I wanted to learn from Hye-na.

634
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,331
When did you ever hear me ask
for a private tutor?

635
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,457
Wait.

636
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,459
Her grades improved because of Hye-na?

637
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,377
She's a really awesome tutor.

638
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,672
Ye-bin said studying is fun.

639
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,675
-She did?
-Yes.

640
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,555
You stupid idiot.

641
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,519
Seo-jin wouldn't let a high school student
stay for no reason.

642
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:02,978
You.

643
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,397
Do you still want to learn from Hye-na?

644
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,775
Yes. With Ye-bin.

645
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,237
Okay. I'll sort it out tomorrow.

646
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,781
Don't grin.

647
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,336
I haven't called her once
since we found out she's Kwak Mi-hyang.

648
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,839
It's best I pretend we met by chance
at the kids' academy.

649
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,052
No.

650
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,429
Why should I tiptoe around Kwak Mi-hyang?

651
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,353
Where's Seo-jin?

652
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,397
Upstairs. I'll get her for you.

653
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,067
-Hello.
-Why are you here?

654
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,694
I haven't been around lately.

655
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:55,155
I got really sick
after sorting out my dish collection.

656
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,740
Bring us some tea.

657
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,244
Darn you.

658
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,588
Dr. Kang worked wonders
on my husband's back.

659
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,965
We might have another child at this rate.

660
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,092
What do you want?

661
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,514
I heard that Ye-bin went up
to the basics class.

662
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,975
I'm so jealous. You must be pleased.

663
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,685
So what?

664
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,771
Since winter break has started,

665
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,858
can Hye-na tutor Su-han as well?

666
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,443
With Ye-bin.

667
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,279
Those two always studied together.

668
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,325
It's true what they say about never
knowing who people really are.

669
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,993
I really can't trust anyone!

670
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,580
Shouldn't you know better?

671
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,583
They need to be on similar levels.

672
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,586
How can people in different classes
study together?

673
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,964
Are we done?

674
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,591
I'm a bit busy.

675
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,511
This is unbelievable.

676
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,348
You're acting just like a Kwak Mi-hyang.

677
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,482
What did you just say?

678
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,693
Su-han and Ye-bin.

679
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,237
They've done everything together
since they were three.

680
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,448
Did you tell me you'd get a live-in tutor?

681
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,325
You never mentioned it.

682
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,410
Like how you hid you're Kwak Mi-hyang.

683
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,747
Did you know that you have a habit
of stabbing people in the back?

684
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,461
-Say that again.
-What are you doing?

685
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,588
Hey, Kwak Mi-hyang!

686
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,216
Let go!

687
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,135
Let go. Why are you being so unrefined?

688
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,637
"Unrefined"? I'm being unrefined?

689
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,598
Shall I show you the real Kwak Mi-hyang?

690
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,769
I dare you to say that again.

691
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,063
I'll rip your jaw open.

692
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,359
She'll rip

693
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,194
my jaw open?

694
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,766
I'm telling the truth.

695
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,018
I asked her so nicely.

696
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,940
She suddenly grabbed my hair
so that my eyes went like this.

697
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,693
I could even see behind me.

698
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,196
She's a mad psycho.

699
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,365
She is Kwak Mi-hyang, isn't she?

700
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,825
You're right.

701
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,579
I told you to forget about Kwak Mi-hyang.

702
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,665
What's more important is
that she's my boss's wife.

703
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,292
You coward.

704
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,587
Your wife got her hair pulled out,
but you're defending her?

705
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,632
Then shall I quit my job
and move us out of here?

706
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,136
I'll quit if you want me to.

707
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,723
I'll quit and go
to that Kwak Mi-hyang woman

708
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:13,103
who touched your lovely hair
and pull out all of hers.

709
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,814
I'd rather kill myself.

710
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,107
Right?

711
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,192
Just wait and see.

712
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,695
I'll get Su-han
into the intensive class first.

713
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,823
I'll find a tutor a thousand times
better than Hye-na

714
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:28,410
and rip Kwak Mi-hyang's jaw open.

715
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,914
-Honey.
-My poor Jin Jin.

716
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:36,210
I've never heard such curses
since high school.

717
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,836
That's harsh.

718
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,546
How's your hair?

719
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,924
I think I'm going bald here.

720
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,342
I think so too.

721
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,261
Mom, let's decorate the Christmas tree.

722
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,263
The tree?

723
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,973
Are you kidding me?

724
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,435
You idiot. Do you know
what I went through for you?

725
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,437
I'll kill you today.

726
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,736
-Hang it up there.
-Okay.

727
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,446
-That's it.
-It's up.

728
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,782
-Do you think it's done?
-Yes.

729
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,034
It's beautiful.

730
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,624
Your dad must be in a good mood.

731
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,459
He's decorating the tree.

732
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,211
Of course I'm happy.

733
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,755
My daughter Se-ri's coming home.

734
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,840
Not just anyone gets into Harvard.

735
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,760
That's right. She got in
because she's our sister.

736
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,011
That's right.

737
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,393
When she arrives,
let's throw a lavish party for her.

738
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:38,105
What for, when we had a huge one
when she got into Harvard?

739
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,275
I'll just prepare
a simple Christmas party at home.

740
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,779
My goodness.

741
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,739
Se-ri.

742
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,241
-It's her?
-Se-ri?

743
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,452
Have you eaten?

744
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,830
-Isn't it breakfast--
-Give me that.

745
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,250
Se-ri, it's Dad.

746
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,043
Me too.

747
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:04,047
I'm dying to see you too, my baby.

748
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,757
My gosh, someone please save me.

749
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,302
Okay, 5:30 p.m. tomorrow?

750
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,387
Of course, I'll be there.

751
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,598
My amazing daughter's coming home.

752
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,726
Se-ri, get me a Harvard jacket!

753
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,144
Me too!

754
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,562
And a cap.

755
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,772
-A jacket.
-A cap.

756
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,610
Me too.

757
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,991
Her plane landed 30 minutes ago.
Why isn't she here yet?

758
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,535
She must be waiting for her luggage.

759
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,704
Why can't she hurry?

760
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,749
It's not her.

761
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,412
Dad!

762
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,289
Hey, Se-ri.

763
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,208
Se-ri!

764
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,555
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

765
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,145
My goodness.

766
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,523
Mom.

767
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,650
-Let's go home.
-Okay.

768
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:52,698
Se-ri, what kind of friends
do you have at Harvard?

769
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:59,371
To be honest, everyone there thinks
they'll become world leaders.

770
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,790
Their dreams and ambitions
are on another level.

771
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,127
My closest friends
are Neesha from New Delhi

772
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,712
and Fujiwara from Tokyo.

773
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,380
They both want to be prime ministers.

774
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,511
Se-ri, is it true that Harvard libraries
are open for 24 hours?

775
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,765
I once studied for three days and nights
at Widener Library.

776
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,475
-Three days and nights?
-Three days and nights?

777
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,352
You just have to.

778
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,604
We have exams and papers every day.

779
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,693
Oh, my roommate Julie once
went a week without sleeping.

780
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,154
She took 15-minute naps
and used six alarm clocks.

781
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,699
-Wow.
-Can you do that?

782
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,327
My university is famous worldwide
for a reason.

783
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,747
All the professors and students
are outstanding,

784
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,458
but it's mainly because
of our 24-hour libraries.

785
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:45,959
I see.

786
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:46,918
Then,

787
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,838
what do you want to do
after you graduate, Se-ri?

788
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,715
I want to work in the US government.

789
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,592
At the White House, if possible.

790
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,641
In the States, competition among

791
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,685
different ethnic communities is prevalent.

792
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,854
So I want to be the voice
for Korean Americans

793
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,939
who are still considered
to be a minority there.

794
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,525
My, you're so impressive.

795
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,904
Seung-hye, you must be so proud of her.

796
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,781
I envy you so much.

797
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,371
Se-ri, how about you give us
our gifts now?

798
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,209
Twins, follow me with my suitcase.

799
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,336
Seo-jun, bring her suitcase. Let's go!

800
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,213
-Su-han.
-Hurry.

801
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,631
Be good to Seo-jun and Gi-jun.

802
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,632
Go on.

803
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,175
-U-ju, go on.
-Don't fight.

804
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,510
Hurry up.

805
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,317
I must say
you have such incredible foresight.

806
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,404
Sending Se-ri abroad at a young age
was a very wise decision.

807
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,199
The education system here
is all about college admission.

808
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,951
I figured it wouldn't be right

809
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,037
for a prodigy like Se-ri,
who's a free, creative spirit.

810
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,413
Let's be honest.

811
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,958
Even International
Mathematical Olympiad winners

812
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,835
mostly end up going to medical school.

813
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,670
An environment like this

814
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,422
can't produce talented people
who can make a difference in the world.

815
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,221
I wanted Su-han to go to medical school,
but I should change the way I think.

816
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,099
It's foolish to be fixated
on medical school.

817
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,187
Yes, there's no need to be fixated
on medical school.

818
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,148
As for Ye-seo, she really wants
to go to med school,

819
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,567
so I have no choice.

820
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:34,985
But in Su-han's case...

821
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,903
Yes, Harvard is great.

822
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,533
Shouldn't he pass
the level-up test first though?

823
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,410
What? My goodness.

824
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,459
Would you like more dessert?

825
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,503
-Sure, that'd be great.
-Shall we?

826
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,005
Yes.

827
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,216
-That little...
-Hey.

828
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,677
-Don't.
-Let go. I got this.

829
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,098
-Let's go smoke some cigars.
-Sure.

830
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,142
I quit smoking though.

831
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,145
All right. Dr. Kang, let's go.

832
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,823
Can I have some maple syrup?

833
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,408
Ms. Kwak Mi-hyang.

834
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,330
Jin-hui, I told you not to cross the line.

835
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,331
"The line"?

836
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,875
Who are you to keep telling me
not to cross the line?

837
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,209
Is this the 38th parallel?

838
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,212
Who's the one that grabbed my hair
and crossed the line first?

839
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,547
Jin-hui, please.

840
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,925
Do you want me to pull your hair again?

841
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,635
Or shall I pull it all out this time?

842
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,471
Why don't you just go ahead
and rip my jaw open?

843
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,438
Jin-hui, don't get cheeky with me.

844
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,025
Whether I'm Kwak Mi-hyang or Han Seo-jin,

845
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,027
you're still beneath me.

846
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,363
Do you think I'm a total loser?

847
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,074
Why must I be Kwak Mi-hyang's minion?

848
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,701
I asked for maple syrup!

849
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,524
I'm so sorry.

850
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,987
Seung-hye, give her some wet wipes.

851
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,657
You crazy psycho.

852
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,370
Oh, my goodness.

853
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,289
Gosh!

854
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,092
Gosh, I can't even open my eyes.

855
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,053
-Everyone, come here.
-Move!

856
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,931
Quick! Come here.
Is everyone in the frame?

857
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,559
-Just take it, will you?
-What? No, no. Okay.

858
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,060
All right, one, two.

859
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,277
-Okay, I'll send this photo to everyone.
-Okay.

860
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,780
You even got one for me. Thank you, Se-ri.

861
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,868
Gi-jun kept telling me to get one
for you and U-ju as well.

862
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,455
Hey, Ye-bin!

863
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,040
Don't you have to study?

864
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,875
Hey, why should I study
on a day like today?

865
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,002
-You can study if you want to.
-You little...

866
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,880
Ye-bin, you can have fun
for 30 more minutes.

867
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,882
We should finish off the rest, you know.

868
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,925
I'll go and get ready for our session.

869
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,428
I'll walk you there.

870
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,974
It's okay. I'll just go alone.

871
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,727
Yes, it's just a few steps away.
Don't go overboard.

872
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,312
Your parents aren't even home.

873
00:55:57,395 --> 00:56:00,023
-We should have fun today, right?
-Totally.

874
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,984
Thanks to Se-ri,
I can take it easy all day long.

875
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,736
It's the first time this year.

876
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,238
Hey, we should take another photo
since Se-ri is here.

877
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,324
-Good idea. Gather, everyone.
-Okay.

878
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,619
-Can I stand here?
-This isn't a good spot.

879
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,912
Can't we go over there?

880
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,122
-I think this spot is better.
-Just take it.

881
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,083
-Everyone's here, right?
-Yes.

882
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,279
-Hye-na, come on in.
-Hurry, Hye-na.

883
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,322
Ye-bin!

884
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,824
Have a seat.

885
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,450
-You must be hungry.
-Yours isn't mixed yet.

886
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,451
-Yes.
-Okay.

887
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,662
-It looks good.
-It's so good.

888
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,039
Hye-na, you should try this too.

889
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,208
-I want one too.
-How is it?

890
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,668
-Is it good?
-Hye-na.

891
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,794
Give me one too.

892
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,871
Hye-na, let's take a selfie together.

893
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,581
-Hurry.
-Hye-na, come join us.

894
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,584
All right, a selfie.

895
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,003
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

896
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,471
-What's this?
-Oh, my.

897
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,599
-Will this be like a treasure hunt?
-Yes.

898
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,102
-Try it on.
-It's my turn now.

899
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,271
-Okay.
-I'll open it.

900
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,149
What could it be?

901
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,818
-My gosh!
-What is it?

902
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,363
-It's a doctor's gown!
-Yes.

903
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,490
Awesome! It even has my name on it.

904
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,325
-Seriously?
-My gosh.

905
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,494
-Shall I put it on for you?
-Yes.

906
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,164
My, this will look great on you.

907
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,332
Here.

908
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,253
Here, let's do this with your hair.

909
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,130
-Oh, my.
-Do I look like a doctor?

910
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,174
My darling daughter, you look stunning.

911
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,180
All right.

912
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,060
-There.
-Thank you, Dad!

913
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,480
My, it looks great on you.

914
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,899
-It's so nice!
-I know, right?

915
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,276
What are you doing here?

916
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:34,988
The doctor's gown...

917
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,032
I'm sorry.

918
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,370
I came in here to check out
a few books on medical science.

919
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:44,622
Didn't the housekeeper tell you the rules?

920
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm sorry.

921
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,460
I'll be careful from now on.

922
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,308
-Have a good day.
-Thanks.

923
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,749
I was so taken aback as well.

924
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,002
She walks around as if it were
her own place when you aren't home.

925
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,759
What are you doing here?

926
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,351
Once, I went into her room
to bring her food.

927
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,729
Hye-na.

928
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,731
What do you think you're doing?

929
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,822
I told you not to come in here.

930
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,658
Don't you remember what I said?
Don't come into my room!

931
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,826
-Get out.
-Hye-na.

932
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,953
Get out at once. Now!

933
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,748
She threw a total fit.

934
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:55,253
Does she keep gold in there or what?
She won't let me go into her room.

935
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,422
Kim Eun-hye?

936
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,638
Could Hye-na be...

937
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,157
No.

938
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:49,784
No way.

939
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:51,869
That's impossible.

940
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,372
If Eun-hye had given birth
to Jun-sang's child,

941
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,833
she wouldn't have been quiet
all these years.

942
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:29,949
Do I know you?

943
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,953
Hello, I'm Ye-seo's classmate, Kim Hye-na.

944
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,456
If you let me be her in-house tutor
for just three months,

945
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,458
I'll make sure she gets
into the intensive class.

946
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,545
Thank you for hiring me.

947
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,340
You pick her up from school
and from the academy, right?

948
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,467
Would it be okay if I went with you?

949
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,804
Hye-na, you're very smart.

950
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,434
My gosh.

951
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,352
I think

952
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,439
Hye-na's a really decent girl.

953
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,817
And she's humble and polite.

954
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,654
She's a poor kid
who doesn't have any parents.

955
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,948
You're unbelievable.

956
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,826
You tend to see the worst in people.

957
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,538
PROBABILITY OF PARENTAGE: 99.99%

958
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,535
This fancy room could've been my mom's.

959
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,288
I found this in Se-ri's closet.

960
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,041
You see, brainiacs also know
how to have fun.

961
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,501
To Mom and Dad.

962
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,211
Thanks for raising me until now.

963
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,170
Goodbye.

964
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,047
That woman, Kim Ju-yeong, is dangerous.

965
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,423
It was all a lie.

966
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,425
I've never done it, so I don't know.

967
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,219
But I heard
unrequited love is pretty tough.

968
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,389
My mom had unrequited love
for someone all her life.

969
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,765
What are you planning?

970
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,392
You obviously know he's your dad.

971
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,560
Why did you move into our place?

972
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,896
Do you really not know?

973
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,861
