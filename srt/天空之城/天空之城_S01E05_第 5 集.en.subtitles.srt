1
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,089
PREVIOUSLY ON SKY CASTLE

2
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,763
Do you think Yeong-jae's portfolio
is something you can buy?

3
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,182
Will doing everything Yeong-jae did
guarantee entry?

4
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,684
How can you not have a strategy
to get into the best medical school?

5
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,813
Is that strategy to just throw a party
to get Yeong-jae's portfolio?

6
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,107
It's a vicious fight for information.

7
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,526
Didn't you see Professor Cha's face?
He thought I beat him to it.

8
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,528
I won't share Yeong-jae's portfolio.

9
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,823
But instead, I'll tell you my secrets
to getting Yeong-jae into SNU.

10
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,533
Around this time of year,

11
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,411
the bank sends out invitation cards
to the VVIP customers.

12
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,498
It's actually a very secret gathering
where they connect the VVIP customers

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,416
with the best entrance exam coordinators.

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,293
She accepts no more than two clients
every year,

15
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,295
which means you have to pay her a lot.

16
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,631
But every kid she coaches
gets in 100 percent.

17
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,258
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Ju-yeong.

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,636
Ye-seo can be the third-generation doctor.

19
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,804
If you help me out,

20
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,764
I can get her into SNU Medical School.

21
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,308
This is the last chance
to make me acknowledge you.

22
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,309
Do you understand?

23
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,686
She was in joint first place
with a student named Hwang U-ju.

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,189
I'll send you his mom's phone number.

25
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,316
Being friendly with her will help you out.

26
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,152
Did you hear what happened
to Yeong-jae's mom?

27
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,696
My relationship with my clients
ends as soon as they get accepted.

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,365
The same will happen with Ye-seo.

29
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,991
They're moving into Yeong-jae's old house.

30
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,869
Isn't that the doctor
the hospital director hired?

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,871
I found this in this room.

32
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,624
I think the person
who used to live here left this behind.

33
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:05,792
That's mine.

34
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,419
-Pardon?
-I lent this to the previous owner.

35
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,755
What's this?

36
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,715
I'm going to get out of this house
no matter what.

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,717
Let's study hard until then.

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,845
That way, I'll be able to get my revenge.

39
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,513
It was a living hell for me!

40
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,431
I couldn't have survived
if it weren't for Ga-eul.

41
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,392
We took you and your mother in
when you were homeless

42
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,061
and this is how you pay us back for
feeding, clothing and educating you?

43
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,479
Did they eat for free?

44
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,690
Her mom did the washing
and cleaning since I was three!

45
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,942
How dare you lust after my son?

46
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,570
Leave. And don't ever come here again.

47
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,113
My life as your son

48
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,157
was a living hell for me.

49
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,702
Myeong-ju died because of you.

50
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,787
Yeong-jae's mom is dead.

51
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,206
It sounds like
there's been a misunderstanding.

52
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,708
You told him to get his revenge!

53
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,586
When their parents were at their happiest,

54
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,379
they crushed it in one go.

55
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,464
Because that is true revenge.

56
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,300
This is such a joke.

57
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,885
What did you just say?

58
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,219
This isn't a discussion.

59
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,306
It feels more like a lecture
where you force your ideas.

60
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,225
Do the kids really want
this group discussion?

61
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,394
How about putting it to a vote?

62
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,604
You're going to vote?

63
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,523
Yes. On whether or not
to continue the book club.

64
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,900
-"No."
-"No."

65
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,319
-"No."
-"No."

66
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,904
"No."

67
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,908
I announce that Omphalos
is now officially disbanded.

68
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,160
Who are you to stir up so much trouble?

69
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,661
You keep talking down to me.

70
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,747
Should I do the same?

71
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,458
How dare you... Shall I rip your jaw open?

72
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,793
How dare you... Shall I rip your jaw open?

73
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,211
It's you, isn't it?

74
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,504
What should I do now, Mom?

75
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,423
Even the book club is gone.

76
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,800
What will you do
if I don't get accepted to SNU?

77
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,220
Bring Coach Kim back!

78
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,889
That's right, Yeong-jae
and Ye-seo aren't the same.

79
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,558
Yeong-jae's family ended up that way
because of Ga-eul.

80
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,394
No. It was because of their own problems.

81
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,898
Coach Kim, I was too rash last time.

82
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,775
Please forgive me.

83
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,028
Would you please coach Ye-seo again?

84
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,407
I thought our discussion
was over, Ms. Han.

85
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,825
I sincerely apologize.

86
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,661
I must've lost my mind for a little while.

87
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,038
Coach Kim, I beg you.

88
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,792
I have to make sure
she gets into SNU's med school.

89
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,169
I must make sure she becomes a doctor.

90
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,903
Even if the same kind of tragedy
befalls your family,

91
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,615
will you accept it?

92
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,455
I'm asking if you are willing
to put up with everything.

93
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,710
Yes,

94
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,169
I will.

95
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,713
I certainly will.

96
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,047
I'll put up with everything.

97
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,437
Starting this evening,
Mr. Jo will pick Ye-seo up every day.

98
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,277
She'll be home later than usual
for a while.

99
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,863
She has to catch up on
the classes she has missed.

100
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,785
Thank you, Coach Kim.

101
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,985
Yeong-jae.

102
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,653
Yeong-jae.

103
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,864
-Yeong-jae.
-Yeong-jae!

104
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,704
Ms. Kim, are you okay?

105
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,628
Yeong-jae.

106
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,421
Yeong-jae,

107
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,924
I know how you feel.

108
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,509
I really do.

109
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,844
Move, Ms. Han.
I'm here to kill that woman.

110
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,431
Yeong-jae, that won't make your mom
come back to life.

111
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,349
Exactly!

112
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,559
That's why she and I should both die.

113
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,686
My mom died because of you.

114
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,980
If only you didn't incite me
to take revenge...

115
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,526
Yeong-jae, please. You shouldn't do this.

116
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,777
Coach Kim...

117
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,904
She was just trying...

118
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,240
to make sure you get
the best results possible

119
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,367
by using your feelings.

120
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,328
That's right.

121
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,331
All I did was do my best
to get you into that school.

122
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,332
Your best?

123
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,504
You call that your best?

124
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,339
That's what you think.

125
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,341
But you were the worst
for both me and my mom.

126
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,426
You knew this was going to happen,
but you did nothing!

127
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,845
Is that what you really think?

128
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,389
Not a single teacher in this world

129
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,266
would sit back and do nothing
if they have known.

130
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,559
Don't lie to me.

131
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,186
I know you felt guilty.
That's why you didn't answer my calls!

132
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,897
I didn't answer your calls because
that's my rule. I told you already.

133
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,734
It's my rule to cut ties with my students
the moment they get accepted.

134
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,902
Your rule?

135
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,113
Your rule?

136
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,073
Yeong-jae.

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,825
Even when my mom died?

138
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,829
Even when I've become like this?

139
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,831
You shouldn't have left your mom!

140
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,167
She's right, Yeong-jae.

141
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,670
You shouldn't have left your mom
regardless of how much you hated her.

142
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,382
Mothers can be cold for the sake
of their children's success,

143
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,176
but they all cry
behind their children's backs.

144
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:53,097
Imagine how upset she must've been
to have made that kind of decision.

145
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,642
She must've felt so miserable and futile

146
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,561
to have done something like that.

147
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,689
Your mom...

148
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,151
loved you more than she loved herself.

149
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,278
Do you know that?

150
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
Yeong-jae.

151
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,034
Don't do this, for your mother's sake.

152
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,287
She loved me?

153
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,623
You're lying.

154
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,625
That's a lie.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,085
She killed herself
because I didn't go to the university,

156
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,087
and that I didn't live
the way she wanted me to.

157
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,466
How is that love? How could she die
like that if she really loved me?

158
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,468
Do you think that's why she died?

159
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,803
How could you be so clueless
about your own mom?

160
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,473
You weren't going to see her again.

161
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,394
You said you're going
to cut ties with her!

162
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,987
That was all because of her.

163
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,907
It's all because of that woman.

164
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,867
Move.

165
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:55,993
Move!

166
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,746
-Yeong-jae, please. Stop.
-I said, move!

167
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,834
Ms. Han, are you okay? Are you all right?

168
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,674
Are you okay?

169
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,637
Move!

170
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,891
Ms. Han.

171
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,769
Ms. Han.

172
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,617
It's all done.

173
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,244
Okay, thank you.

174
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,012
I'm glad the wound wasn't any deeper.

175
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm just relieved that you're okay.

176
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,226
What happened to Yeong-jae?
Did they catch him?

177
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,021
No, they lost him.

178
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,273
What if he comes back?

179
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,858
Shouldn't you report him to the police?

180
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,192
I don't intend on doing that.

181
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:14,238
He probably wanted to blame it on someone
because he couldn't stand feeling guilty.

182
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,908
It's my duty as his teacher
to hope that he'll overcome this.

183
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,745
You care for him so much.

184
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,998
I'm so sorry I misunderstood you.

185
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,084
No, I'm indebted to you now.

186
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,170
Coach Kim.

187
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,674
I hope Ye-seo doesn't have
to go through what Yeong-jae--

188
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,800
Ms. Han.

189
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,720
Ye-seo and Yeong-jae are different.

190
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,305
Don't worry.

191
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,434
Thank you, Coach Kim.

192
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,602
I'll do my best

193
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,271
to guide her through her studies.

194
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,440
I'll trust you unconditionally.

195
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,364
"The fact that they gathered together

196
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,658
and planned on stealing beforehand

197
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,244
proves that they had intended
on committing a crime.

198
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,121
Immediate restrictions should be imposed

199
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,916
the moment they get caught
to prevent it from reoccurring.

200
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,794
Their parents should give them
an adequate amount of love and..."

201
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,966
In the end, it all comes down to parents.

202
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,510
What should I do?

203
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,221
I also stole something once back
when I was young.

204
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,558
You did?

205
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,811
It was around
when I started middle school.

206
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,896
It would've been

207
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,941
about two years after my parents had died,

208
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,027
and I went to the orphanage
your parents ran.

209
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,739
I really wanted a new pair of sneakers.

210
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,117
I thought about it for days

211
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,327
then stole a pair from my friend.

212
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,163
Your mom found out,

213
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,207
took me over to his place,

214
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,835
and asked for his mother's forgiveness

215
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,045
for not raising me properly.

216
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,424
She pleaded so earnestly.

217
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,303
After that day, I told myself
I'd never steal from anyone again.

218
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,392
I guess a parent's role
is really important.

219
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,146
I should tell the moms, shouldn't I?

220
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,566
What if the other moms
give you a hard time again?

221
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,986
They think you're responsible
for disbanding the book club.

222
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,281
I feel sorry for the kids.

223
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,284
How stressed must they be to do that?

224
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,411
Don't you know dinner break is 30 minutes?

225
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,331
What were you up to
that you got back ten minutes late?

226
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,668
You should be back in your seat
ten minutes before the other kids.

227
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,295
You were ten minutes late?

228
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,131
How many problems
can you solve in ten minutes?

229
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,674
Woo Su-han!

230
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,134
I'm asking what you did.

231
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,222
We waited for Ms. Lee.

232
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,765
Hey.

233
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,933
Ms. Lee?

234
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,228
What Ms. Lee? Who's that, Ye-bin?

235
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,147
Don't lie.

236
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,566
That was yesterday.
And she even texted to say she couldn't.

237
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,568
Woo Su-han!

238
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,445
Are you going to make me furious?

239
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,239
It's true.

240
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,117
We were late waiting for the author lady.

241
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,495
I'll kill you.

242
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,455
Don't lie.

243
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,666
The author lady? U-ju's mom?

244
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,377
Why would she meet you?

245
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,465
Does this make sense?
Does it make sense, Seo-jin?

246
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,135
She arranged to meet the kids
at dinner break for an interview,

247
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,470
but she didn't show up.

248
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,224
The kids were ten minutes late
for class waiting for her.

249
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,394
She arranged to meet our kids
without talking to us first?

250
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,938
That's what I'm saying.

251
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,023
How dare she meet our kids as she wants?

252
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,025
And then she didn't even show up.

253
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,110
Isn't she completely crazy?

254
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,989
Wasn't it enough for her
to disband the book club?

255
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,449
My point exactly.

256
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,410
I won't let it go this time.
Get her out here.

257
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,913
No, no. You're too worked up right now.

258
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,040
She'll take advantage of that.

259
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,377
I'll make sure
the kids are never late again.

260
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,378
Leave it to me.

261
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,088
You should leave a woman like her to me.

262
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,590
An elegant woman like you
will never get through to her.

263
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,217
I used to be a bully in school

264
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,594
-so I should teach her a lesson...
-We'll win!

265
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,097
My gosh.

266
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,558
Leave her to me and go home.

267
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,226
That idiot.

268
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,563
-Grab him properly.
-Crush her for good.

269
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,940
Make sure she never pretends
to look out for the kids again.

270
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,775
Let's have another drink at yours.

271
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,318
What should I do with him?

272
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,280
How come he gets drunk all the time?

273
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,658
Do you like me that much? Do you?

274
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,578
-Darling!
-Be quiet!

275
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,873
Your husband's home.

276
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,543
Hello.

277
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,962
Perhaps,

278
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,548
my mom will go to you.

279
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,091
Your mom?

280
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,342
Why?

281
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,636
Su-han, that idiot, lied.

282
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,598
That we were ten minutes late
waiting for you.

283
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:51,974
Did he?

284
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,311
You got worried about me?

285
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,937
How sweet of you.

286
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,397
But,

287
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,691
why were you late for class?

288
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,151
What?

289
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,361
You see,

290
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,114
we met a friend.

291
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,286
I see.

292
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,246
Okay, don't worry.

293
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,583
I'll talk it out with your mom.

294
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,046
Okay. When will you interview us?

295
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,590
Why not?

296
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,342
I want to help you.

297
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,136
That's too bad.

298
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,680
Okay then.

299
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,642
You sleep well too.

300
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,239
Kang Ye-bin.

301
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,159
Did you have plans with U-ju's mom?

302
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,207
She did nothing wrong.
I offered to help her first.

303
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,335
Did you?

304
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,628
Okay.

305
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,297
Ye-bin.

306
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,725
I'll pick you up myself from now on.

307
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,270
What about Ye-seo? She has no coach.

308
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,189
She does now, so don't worry.

309
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:28,696
Starting tomorrow, scan your thumb
when you go for dinner

310
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,072
and also when you come back.

311
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,074
You'll spy on me in real time?

312
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,993
Am I a prisoner or something?

313
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,622
I'm not spying on you.
I'm worried about you.

314
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,876
Do you know how afraid I am
each time your teacher says you're late?

315
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,339
It's so annoying.
How can I do everything in 30 minutes?

316
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:49,967
Right?

317
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,679
You have 30 minutes to eat and play,
but that's not enough, right?

318
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,556
Then should I...

319
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,517
pack your dinner now?

320
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,396
So you don't have to go out?

321
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,567
No.

322
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,693
It's okay.

323
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:11,238
I'll make you a packed dinner
and deliver it on time.

324
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,531
I said no.

325
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,657
I'll scan my thumb.

326
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,075
Will that do?

327
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,245
Will you do that?

328
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,247
Okay then.

329
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,084
She's so annoying.

330
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,811
She tried to meet my daughter in secret?

331
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,534
Can we meet right now?

332
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,286
I'll be waiting in the library.

333
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,644
If you wanted to meet the kids,

334
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,480
shouldn't you have asked the moms first?

335
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,982
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,818
I didn't think of that.

337
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,902
Ms. Lee.

338
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,531
I'm here to see you as a mother.

339
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,120
It's just us two.

340
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,623
Can't we speak freely and honestly?

341
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,709
You might not know
because you let U-ju do as he pleased,

342
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,295
but I impeccably manage
my daughters' timetables.

343
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,132
I can't accept them
being a second late to class.

344
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,220
I won't let them spare you any time,

345
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,264
so don't contact either of them

346
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,432
in any way from now on.

347
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,186
Whether it be text messages,
calls or any other way.

348
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,775
-Okay.
-Thanks.

349
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,903
I have something to say too.

350
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,659
I feel very hesitant about saying this,

351
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,663
but yesterday I saw Ye-bin and Su-han--

352
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,706
Ms. Lee.

353
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,208
Didn't you get my point?

354
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,002
Mind your own business.

355
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,421
Why do you care so much about other kids?

356
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,797
Hear me out--

357
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,800
Focus on your own kid and stop being nosy.

358
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,888
I assume you understood what I just said.

359
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,066
I really...

360
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,319
don't know what to say.

361
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,779
I hoped and trusted
Coach Kim would say yes.

362
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,198
My husband said...

363
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,659
he wouldn't interfere
with her coaching at all.

364
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm only relaying Ms. Kim's message.

365
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,663
What's the reason?

366
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,916
Why won't she take on my sons?

367
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,417
I don't know,

368
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,213
but she has chosen someone
with bigger potential than them.

369
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,049
Someone with bigger potential?

370
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,602
Then, did she agree to coach Ye-seo...

371
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,730
-Are you kidding me?
-Give me that.

372
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,358
You rile me all up just to say no?

373
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,860
You people are so arrogant.

374
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,362
Put Kim Ju-yeong on.

375
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,364
She's out on personal business.

376
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,076
She went out and got a minion
to inform us?

377
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,078
Give me her number right now.

378
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,038
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

379
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,790
Who do you think you are?

380
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,584
How dare a lowly tutor toy with us?

381
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,669
Mr. Jo.

382
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,712
Do you know who I...

383
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,630
Hello?

384
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,589
Hello?

385
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,757
Hey!

386
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,767
Those nobodies
act like they're better than us.

387
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,728
Korea's going down the drain.

388
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,523
They became complacent
because they make easy money.

389
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,941
"Rear them like animals"?

390
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,777
Does she even know what that means?

391
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,571
That kind of a crude witch
dare calls herself an expert?

392
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,371
We don't have a choice.

393
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,543
I'll just have to teach them myself.

394
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,628
I was willing
to sell the apartment in Banpo,

395
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,588
but it's for the better
since I won't have to anymore.

396
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,427
I should come up with a new schedule
for the kids.

397
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,389
There's no certificate
to be an entrance exam coordinator.

398
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,725
I'm sure I can do better than her.

399
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,436
Just wait and see.

400
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,795
SOFT CRAYONS

401
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,017
Do you think I'm joking?

402
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,479
Bring me the doctor!
Bring him to me right now!

403
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,688
Sir, please calm down.

404
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,982
Where's the doctor? Where is he?

405
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:41,902
Was it you?

406
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,111
Was it you?

407
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,993
I'll help you out.

408
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,834
The operating surgeon
was Dr. Kang Jun-sang?

409
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:58,835
Yes.

410
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,962
I heard there's been

411
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,382
a lot of complaints in the ER
regarding his surgeries.

412
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,561
Ma'am, your surgery went well.

413
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,730
But the nerve
between your third and fourth vertebrae

414
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,858
isn't in the right place, so that's
probably why you feel uncomfortable.

415
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,611
It's not a difficult surgery.

416
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,697
I'll take responsibility
and make sure you fully recover.

417
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,537
I've been working here for five years,

418
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,705
and I've never seen anyone
like our professor.

419
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,706
Why?

420
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,208
A patient suddenly went wild in the ER,

421
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,085
and he managed to calm him down
in an instant.

422
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,878
On top of that, he has
such a great personality.

423
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,172
All the patients in our department
have smiles on their faces.

424
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,050
Even when his intern
accidentally shaved the idol star's head,

425
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,094
he bowed down and apologized
to the patient's guardian.

426
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,805
He bowed down completely to apologize.

427
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,014
-Dr. Hwang?
-Yes.

428
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,891
-He apologized himself?
-Yes.

429
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,562
All the other professors
would've stepped behind

430
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,021
and made us take all the blame.

431
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,982
Of course, they would've done that.

432
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,984
They only get involved
with what benefits them.

433
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,945
By the way, I heard the frog
came again yesterday.

434
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,490
Gosh, don't even get me started.
It's the fourth time this month.

435
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,743
Let's be honest. Dr. Kang
should be taking care of him.

436
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,204
Why does Dr. Lee
always have to take care of him?

437
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,588
What? What is it?

438
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,885
My gosh, who the heck...

439
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,514
Do you take care of everything?

440
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,600
We only get involved
with what benefits us?

441
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,268
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,563
You just sat there and listened to them
badmouth your own boss?

443
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,525
Eat up.

444
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,703
I'm sorry.

445
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,997
Those jerks.

446
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,999
Hwang Chi-yeong is the reason

447
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,709
why everyone from Neurosurgery
is acting cocky.

448
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,670
His first-year interns
get three days off a week. It's absurd.

449
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,923
-He's crazy.
-He's completely nuts.

450
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,258
How can he let first-year interns
take three days off?

451
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,052
Our interns can't say anything

452
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,929
because his interns
keep bragging and boasting.

453
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,057
I knew he'd be trouble the moment
I heard him talk about the new law.

454
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,228
By the way, he's been quiet for a while.

455
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,898
But the frog's been acting up again.
Will you be okay?

456
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,442
-Do you want a bodyguard?
-Forget it.

457
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,861
A doctor shouldn't be scared
of their patient.

458
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,821
We just need to do our job...

459
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,743
But he goes crazy
and threatens people with a knife.

460
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,664
So in order to keep you safe,
I really think...

461
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,166
Dr. Kang?

462
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,337
Dr. Kang?

463
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,633
What?

464
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,456
I heard there's been

465
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,252
a lot of complaints in the ER
regarding his surgeries.

466
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,301
Hey, it's me.

467
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,262
About Dr. Kang's patients
that filed complaints against him,

468
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,180
can I take a look at their MRIs?

469
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,062
Su-im.

470
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,316
You should take a break.

471
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,403
My goodness.

472
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,323
That's unbelievable.

473
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,367
I know college is important,

474
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,954
but I can't believe you pay
that much for their private education.

475
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:07,250
It's because they want their kids
to have the jobs they have.

476
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,378
To be honest, I can't really
blame them for that

477
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,255
because I also feel the same way.

478
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,052
The problem is that my husband's way
of educating them is wrong.

479
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,346
Even I start to feel suffocated
the moment my kids

480
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,389
enter the study room.

481
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,267
I don't know how they're going
to put up with it until they graduate.

482
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,978
What would you do if you were me?

483
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,111
Start out with something you can do.

484
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,030
Something...

485
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,157
I can do?

486
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,244
You can't just sit back and do nothing
when your kids are being tormented.

487
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,499
You have to protect your kids.

488
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,877
You're their mom.

489
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,299
Yes, you're right. I'm their mom.

490
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,259
So I should fight.

491
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,808
I should also start out
with things I can do.

492
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,313
I also have homework of my own.

493
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,457
Ye-bin.

494
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,462
Ms. Lee, what brings you here
without calling?

495
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,308
Ye-bin.

496
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,644
Did you pay for this?

497
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,148
Yes, I did. I paid for it.

498
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,358
Are you suspecting me?

499
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,985
I saw everything.

500
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,737
You also came here two days ago.

501
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,321
I was so startled that day,

502
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,407
so I went back home
instead of meeting you.

503
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,202
Ye-bin, you know
what you're doing is bad, right?

504
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,998
Let's pay for this
and apologize to the owner.

505
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,500
Apologize for what?
I told you that I paid for it.

506
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,757
Ye-bin, I'm really fond of you.

507
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,467
So I can't just let this pass.

508
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,927
Let's go inside.

509
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,472
What? Let go of me. My gosh.

510
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,348
-Come inside.
-You're so annoying. Let me go.

511
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,142
Why do you even care?

512
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,771
What's going on?

513
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,689
Sir.

514
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,234
My kid has something to say to you.

515
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,782
Hurry up and tell him.

516
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,743
Aren't you going to say anything?

517
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,912
Then I'll tell him.

518
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,206
I'm sorry, sir.

519
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,459
My kid didn't pay for this--

520
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,544
She already paid.

521
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,254
You paid.

522
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,256
Pardon?

523
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,675
It was 1,500 won. She already paid.

524
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,305
You're so annoying.

525
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,808
I'll ring you up.

526
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,191
Let's go.

527
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,339
Hello.

528
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,259
I'm not in the mood to greet you.

529
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,177
Pardon?

530
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,556
You met Seo-jin a few days ago,
didn't you?

531
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,644
I'm sure she worded it very nicely
since she's a very elegant person.

532
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,399
Anyway, she told you not to be nosy
about our kids, right?

533
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,404
-Yes. So?
-What?

534
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,155
"Yes. So?"

535
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,490
I knew it.

536
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,117
I knew you couldn't care less.

537
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,619
Ye-seo's mom already told me everything,

538
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,581
so let's not fight on a nice morning.

539
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,708
Hey.

540
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,793
Even when you got rid of the book club,

541
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,546
I really tried hard to hold back my anger.

542
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,176
I used to be a really famous bully
in the entire Gangnam district.

543
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,096
I can't stand
how you're ruining this place.

544
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,348
Once you cross me,
my reputation won't matter.

545
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,601
I'll show you what Short Shorts
of Cheongdam-dong is made of.

546
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,560
So...

547
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,605
you better keep that in mind.

548
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,441
What was that?

549
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,696
Hey, you didn't even flinch.

550
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,533
What was that? Where is it coming from?

551
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:55,288
Please don't tell my husband
or my kids about this wound.

552
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,664
Yes, ma'am.

553
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,358
Start out with something you can do.

554
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,234
Something...

555
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,236
I can do?

556
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,155
You can't just sit back and do nothing

557
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,407
when your kids are being tormented.

558
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,662
You have to protect your kids.

559
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,581
You're their mom.

560
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,903
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

561
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,448
Can you please lend me that?

562
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,408
This?

563
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,701
Yes, sure.

564
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,827
-Thank you.
-No problem.

565
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,173
SHIN A HIGH SCHOOL

566
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,426
Korean History is an easy subject
for you guys.

567
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,889
Both the mock exams and the college
entrance exam all base their questions

568
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:03,392
on only the basic things
Koreans should know.

569
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:07,021
Therefore, I'm pretty sure
you all studied ahead.

570
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,357
So let's skip this part.

571
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:13,820
And watch the internet lecture
for Unified Silla and Balhae.

572
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,576
Who was that?

573
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,620
Another internet lecture?

574
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,584
Starting from March,
we had to watch internet lectures

575
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,336
three times a week,
which means you made us

576
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,339
watch internet lectures 17 times
out of a total of 30 lectures.

577
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,302
That internet lecture prepares you
for the school test.

578
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,762
The questions will be based on those.

579
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,807
You don't even let us ask questions.
Do you find it hard to teach?

580
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,101
Isn't that why you keep making us
watch internet lectures?

581
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,937
Hey, be quiet.

582
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,982
Hye-na, what's your problem?

583
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,900
The test questions will be based on those.

584
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,860
Stay out of it.

585
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,362
You don't even study for this,
so why do you even care?

586
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,659
Everyone else seems okay with it.
Why are you being so negative?

587
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,662
Are you guys fine with this?

588
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,372
We already watch
internet lectures at home.

589
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,208
It's absurd to watch one in class
considering how much we pay for tuition.

590
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,127
-I also have a problem with that.
-Kim Hye-na!

591
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,088
Why do you get your monthly paycheck?

592
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,428
-What did you just say?
-You get paid for doing your job.

593
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,347
Follow me outside.

594
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,560
You're really acting out, Hye-na.

595
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,688
Your attitude also gets reflected
in your performance assessment.

596
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,315
Is your attitude any better?

597
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,775
You're solving math questions
during Korean History class.

598
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,945
The performance assessment system

599
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,658
was made so that students
will actively participate in class.

600
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,329
And all I did was point out a problem
with the class.

601
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,705
Get it?

602
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,002
Nice. Winner, Hye-na.

603
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,511
You really need to learn your manners.

604
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,889
Did you seriously ask me
why I get my paycheck?

605
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,642
Hey, don't you know who I am?

606
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,518
You're the chairman's nephew.

607
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,103
What? What did you just say?

608
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,606
Are you out of your mind?

609
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,858
You only pay half the tuition.

610
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,526
Don't you know who pays
for the other half?

611
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,028
Do you want to pay the entire tuition?

612
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,529
One word from me and you'll...

613
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,156
-Come on.
-Let's go.

614
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,991
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

615
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,802
U-ju.

616
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,746
I want you guys to eat dinner
with me instead of eating at school.

617
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,164
I have an announcement.

618
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,959
-The study room?
-My goodness.

619
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,045
Did I do a good job?

620
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,426
It's okay.

621
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,679
More I think about it,
I think I did the right thing.

622
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,306
So your dad will eventually understand.

623
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,729
I said, he'll understand.

624
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,523
Mom, can you do me a favor

625
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,567
and go on a trip
for about two to three days?

626
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,737
I don't think you should come home
at least for today.

627
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,739
No,

628
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,198
I'm confident.

629
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,950
But I need your help.

630
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,703
-Our help?
-With what?

631
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,998
Just be honest and tell him
how much it stresses you out

632
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,125
to study in that room with your dad.

633
00:38:56,208 --> 00:39:00,212
I'd rather have you cause trouble
than to see you guys

634
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,048
be overly obedient to your dad.

635
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,137
We're doing that for you.

636
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,431
If he gets angry at us,
he goes and takes it out on you.

637
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,475
Gi-jun, don't say that.

638
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,393
Don't talk like that about your dad.

639
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,478
Your dad...

640
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,233
does tend to lose his temper
when he's angry, but he's still rational.

641
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,903
I'm sure he'll change his mind
if you guys tell him how you feel.

642
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,112
Understood?

643
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,241
-Okay.
-We will tell him.

644
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,829
Okay. You promised, okay?

645
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:34,997
-Yes.
-Yes.

646
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,083
Shall we raise our glasses to it?

647
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,045
Cheers to our victory.

648
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:42,630
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

649
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,192
The kids and I will be home
after we have dinner outside.

650
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,444
I made your favorite dish,
soy sauce marinated crabs.

651
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,987
Enjoy your dinner.

652
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,866
By the way, I made some changes
to the study room.

653
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,243
The study room?

654
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,996
There's nothing to change there.

655
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,397
Ye-seo.

656
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,483
You don't look very happy today.

657
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,943
Is something wrong?

658
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,654
No.

659
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,075
-Hey.
-Ouch!

660
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,201
I'm sorry.

661
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,294
Kim Hye-na.

662
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,383
Here.

663
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,718
It's yours.

664
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,566
Hwang U-ju.

665
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,651
Do you have a crush on her?

666
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,988
What's wrong with you? What did you say?

667
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,489
Just say no then.

668
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,868
Ye-seo likes U-ju?

669
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,412
Are you sure?

670
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,538
I'm positive.

671
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,206
And U-ju?

672
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,374
He seems

673
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,668
to have feelings for Kim Hye-na.

674
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,841
Her puberty's kicking in.

675
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,176
Hwang U-ju and Kim Hye-na...

676
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,597
Look into Kim Hye-na.

677
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,640
Yes, ma'am.

678
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,523
It all hangs on Kim Hye-na.

679
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,580
Here.

680
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,082
It's yours.

681
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,574
Mom.

682
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,888
You're home.

683
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,724
Did you all enjoy dinner with Mom?

684
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,643
Yes.

685
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,324
You're eating your dinner now?

686
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:45,909
Yes.

687
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,038
The crab's perfectly seasoned.
It's not too salty at all.

688
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,416
It's really good.

689
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,044
It's going to make me overeat.

690
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,720
Go on upstairs and get washed.

691
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,108
I enjoyed that.

692
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,319
Pass me the scissors.

693
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,823
The scissors?

694
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,380
What's wrong with the old man?

695
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,632
I don't know.

696
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,308
Hey.

697
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,352
What are you doing?

698
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,081
I thought about it in detail.

699
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,459
"She's always a step too slow,

700
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,503
but she was obedient.

701
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,797
Why does she keep defying me?"

702
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,341
I'm defying you?

703
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,302
Is that what you think I'm doing?

704
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,596
If you respect me
as the head of the household,

705
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,349
you would never go against my will.

706
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,351
I'm not challenging your authority.

707
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,061
The kids are stressed--

708
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,273
What should I do with a wife
who shows no respect?

709
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,817
I should change the environment...

710
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,070
so that she has to.

711
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,993
Give me your credit cards.

712
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,372
Come on.

713
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,896
The living expenses that are wired
to your account regularly...

714
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,565
From now on,

715
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,737
I will pay you in person every week.

716
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,532
-What?
-Four times a month.

717
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,369
Each time I pay you,
submit a ledger for me to check.

718
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,623
-Honey.
-And about the study room,

719
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,542
I'll give you three days...

720
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,964
to change it back to how it was before.

721
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,261
I can't do that. No.

722
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,639
I won't do it.

723
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:58,935
You won't?

724
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:04,775
Without discussing it with me,
you ignored all process and procedure

725
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,028
and made sure that my authority
has fallen to the ground.

726
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,613
And you won't do it?

727
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,784
Go upstairs.

728
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,702
The study room is suffocating!

729
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,454
Don't you remember what Coach Kim said?

730
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:20,624
Who cares what that stupid bitch said?

731
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,465
I do things

732
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,759
my way.

733
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,638
You have three days.

734
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,099
Remember that.

735
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,026
JUNAM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

736
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,362
Did you think about it?

737
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,656
You said you'd give your answer today.

738
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,990
Will you do it or not?

739
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,828
I'll do it.

740
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,287
You will?

741
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,624
You were so reluctant about it.
What changed your mind?

742
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,418
I thought it would be too much

743
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,670
to accept such an important title
so soon after I joined.

744
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,673
Our country has the highest spine
surgery rate per population.

745
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:10,966
That's right.

746
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,969
I thought I shouldn't
just sit by and do nothing.

747
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,387
That's why I...

748
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,891
Have some tea.

749
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,234
That's why I want you
to be the chief of Spine and Joint Center.

750
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,111
We're a university hospital.

751
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,364
We can't trust someone
who puts his track record before patients.

752
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,705
Okay, I get it.

753
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:42,914
What?

754
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:44,958
Really?

755
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,376
NEWS FLASH

756
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,378
HWANG CHI-YEONG ACCEPTED
THE CHIEF POSITION

757
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,589
You need to exercise regularly.

758
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,425
Yes, doctor. Thank you.

759
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,385
Just a moment.

760
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,391
HWANG CHI-YEONG ACCEPTED
THE CHIEF POSITION

761
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,903
I'll pay. Let's hurry.

762
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,848
You made the right decision.

763
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,684
You'll do well. Congratulations.

764
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,205
My gosh.

765
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,210
Oh, dear.

766
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,739
What do you think you're doing?

767
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,117
-You almost--
-Did you call my daughter a thief?

768
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,537
I warned you not
to make any contact with her at all.

769
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,207
I wanted to tell you first.

770
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,084
You wouldn't listen.

771
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,919
Ye-bin's my daughter.

772
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,213
How dare you get involved
and treat her like a thief?

773
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,424
You may think I was being nosy,

774
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,050
but I couldn't let it go.

775
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:01,595
If you let a child steal from others--

776
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,721
My Ye-bin...

777
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,391
did not steal anything.
She just vented some stress.

778
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,228
What?

779
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,651
For her, that's just a game.

780
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,030
Are you listening to yourself?

781
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:20,947
Hey.

782
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,782
Of course she's stressed out.

783
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,578
She's up from dawn until late at night
at school, and also has extra classes.

784
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,080
If you had your way,
she'd have to quit extra classes.

785
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:30,999
I can't allow that.

786
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,919
Not in a competitive society like ours.

787
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,926
I'll manage my child my own way.

788
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,599
You know the drill.
Delete the footage of my kid.

789
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,517
Don't you worry.

790
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,730
April 8, 6:05 p.m.

791
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:54,731
Delete.

792
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,943
April 9, 6:08 p.m. Delete.

793
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,903
Delete this too.

794
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,738
-Delete.
-Wait.

795
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:02,989
Yes?

796
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,578
Who are you?

797
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,331
How dare you meddle in
when you know nothing?

798
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,630
If you raise her like that,

799
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,924
will she be okay?

800
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,093
What if she ends up
stealing bigger things?

801
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,887
Do you think your son
will be okay with you as a mom?

802
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,514
U-ju doesn't steal.

803
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,349
It's not stealing. It's a game.

804
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,560
It's a game she'll lose interest in
once she's in university.

805
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,771
The stress will disappear
when she's where she wants to be.

806
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,648
Yes.

807
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,109
This is what I'll do
to send her to a good university.

808
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,694
Do you have to go that far?

809
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:41,653
Yes.

810
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,571
I can do worse things

811
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,992
to make sure my daughters
can at least live a good life like me.

812
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,710
Your husband grew up
in an orphanage, didn't he?

813
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:58,837
Hey.

814
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,588
You married a rare case
of a successful orphan.

815
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,716
You should know your place.

816
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,720
What if your son can't enter
a good university because he's let loose?

817
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,014
In this competitive society,

818
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,100
do you think he'll amount
to his dad's level?

819
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,022
Even if he isn't as successful as his dad,

820
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,691
I'm okay as long as U-ju's happy.

821
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,443
Don't be such a hypocrite.

822
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,029
Even if your husband's successful,

823
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,156
even if you're successful,

824
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,617
if your son's a failure, so is your life.

825
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:37,167
You'd better not step out
of line ever again.

826
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,003
Or I'll kill you.

827
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,582
Why isn't she picking up?

828
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,836
Hey.

829
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,303
Go, go.

830
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,308
Seo-jin.

831
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,186
Seo-jin, lower the window.

832
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:40,897
What is it?

833
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,691
I have terrible news. It's bad.

834
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,987
The department is in an uproar.

835
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,364
Why wouldn't it be?

836
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,783
Everyone believed
your husband would get the position.

837
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,285
What will you do now?

838
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,747
What else? I'll send him
a flower basket or something.

839
00:56:58,873 --> 00:56:59,833
Are you crazy?

840
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,168
It's all good to save face and be elegant,

841
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,462
but how can you think of propriety
at a time like this?

842
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,383
An outsider is about to replace a local.

843
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,844
Everything's been a disaster
since they moved in

844
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,053
and you'll send flowers?

845
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,306
You make me feel sick sometimes.

846
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,101
You speak too freely.

847
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,525
I'm just worried about Dr. Kang.

848
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,945
I'll worry about my husband.
You look after yours.

849
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,203
Okay.

850
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,805
I heard the rumor.

851
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,349
Dr. Hwang's a likely candidate.

852
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,101
Yes.

853
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,770
He's a nobody compared to Jun-sang

854
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,148
in terms of skill and background.

855
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,235
Could you talk
to the chairman of the board...

856
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,115
If you want your husband to be the chief,

857
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,742
why don't you step in?

858
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:19,329
Packaging a fake like the real thing
is your specialty.

859
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,419
Do your castle residents

860
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,088
still think your dad was a bank president?

861
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,840
Ye-seo and Ye-bin

862
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,884
still think you studied in Sydney, right?

863
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,803
You lie so meticulously.

864
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,097
Yet you can't make your husband
a road to success?

865
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,851
You got rid of Jun-sang's first love
that even I couldn't handle

866
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,061
and replaced her.

867
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,523
Why would you ask for help
when you're so capable?

868
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,901
My late husband might have been

869
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,569
the board chairman's doctor,

870
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,030
but I can't ask for favors
in a time like this.

871
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,282
Must I beg him to appoint my son

872
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,284
when his competitor is nothing
compared to him

873
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,703
in terms of skill and background?

874
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,082
I'm sorry, Mother.

875
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,917
Don't do something you'll be sorry for.

876
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,272
You got rid of Jun-sang's first love
that even I couldn't handle

877
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,690
and replaced her.

878
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,110
Why would you ask for help
when you're so capable?

879
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,846
-Hello.
-Hi.

880
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,389
-Hi, lovely Hye-na.
-Hi.

881
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,599
-Hello.
-Hello.

882
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,559
Thanks, Hye-na.

883
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,227
Mom.

884
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,278
I got you a red bean bread. Your favorite.

885
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,240
Thank you.

886
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,368
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

887
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,046
Why did you tell my mother such a thing?

888
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,589
Do I look like a child?

889
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,591
I don't need her help at my age.

890
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,219
She wanted you to be the chief too.

891
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,972
You just made me look worse.

892
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,183
Who cares? She's your mother.

893
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,685
Saving face just got you nowhere.

894
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,125
Shouldn't you take that?

895
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,756
Hello?

896
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,467
Hello?

897
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,637
Dr. Kang Jun-sang?

898
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,222
Who's this?

899
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,936
Who are you?

900
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,188
It's...

901
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,399
Eun-hye.

902
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,317
Kim Eun-hye.

903
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,575
I need to ask you for a favor.

904
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,689
A favor?

905
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,441
Eun-hye, Eun-hye, Eun-hye!

906
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,484
When will you stop yearning for her?

907
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:22,321
How can they talk someone down
while pretending to be so elegant?

908
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:26,284
I might really turn everything upside-down
if they keep this up.

909
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,703
Let's decide when
the midterm exam results are out.

910
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,873
If their grades improve by even just one
point, put it back to how it was.

911
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,124
It's not your fault?

912
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,959
You ruined my life,
but it's not your fault?

913
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,253
What about K? How is K?

914
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:42,717
She's not interested
in knowing why I shoplifted.

915
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,428
Yeong-jae's tablet PC...

916
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,391
