4
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,660
Chen Jialan?

5
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,700
Chen Jialan!

6
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,380
Did you drink?

7
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,180
It's none

8
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,210
of your business.

9
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,580
You can do whatever you want.

10
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,370
But can you please

11
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,830
don't mess up this place?

12
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,690
This is my home.

13
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,250
I can do whatever I want.

14
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,000
Also,

15
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,460
I would like to set a new rule.

16
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,540
You are not allowed to date other women

17
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,760
or bring them back when time-space overlap happens.

18
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,490
Chen Jialan,

19
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,900
you are drunk

20
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,940
and start talking nonsense.

21
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,730
Listen.

22
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,660
Alcohol could cause the worst damage to the brain.

23
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,900
You'd better pay attention to it.

24
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,300
Stop hurting your brain.

25
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm serious.

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,950
I don't want to see you date Chen Kexin

27
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,420
when time-space overlap happens.

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,860
Me and Chen Kexin?

29
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,420
Why should I date her?

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,579
She came to my company today to thank me

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,070
and brought me a gift.

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Doesn't that mean you are together?

33
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,800
I asked you to interfere with her

34
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,150
and distract her,

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,940
not to actually be with her.

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,050
Chen Jialan,

37
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,740
I really don't know

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,870
what's in your mind.

39
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,750
Or are you actually brainless?

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,260
Who told you that

41
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,460
I'm with Chen Kexin?

42
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,690
Didn't you?

43
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,270
Mr. He,

44
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,190
I know a nice restaurant.

45
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,050
Let's try it sometime.

46
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,190
Sorry, Ms. Chen.

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,800
There's no next time.

48
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,940
What do you mean?

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,550
What's this?

50
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,640
Ms. Chen.

51
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,380
We're adults.

52
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,540
Let me be straight with you.

53
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,860
It is normal

54
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,740
to seek a better material life.

55
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,899
I can understand that.

56
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,850
But once

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,540
the boundaries of law and morality are crossed,

58
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,350
it will be a different story.

59
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,090
It should be clear to you

60
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,740
whether these transfers

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,220
were given to you by others in the name of love

62
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,970
or deceived by you in the name of love.

63
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,500
Besides,

64
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,660
these people who you are dating

65
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,659
probably don't know that

66
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,390
you're dating multiple people

67
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,260
at the same time, right?

68
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,860
Once this matter is exposed,

69
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,659
I am afraid it will have a big impact

70
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,790
on your reputation.

71
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,900
It will become difficult for you

72
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,800
to find a suitable husband

73
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,100
in the future.

74
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,540
Am I right?

75
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,850
So you didn't sacrifice yourself?

76
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,380
Of course I didn't.

77
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,150
Besides, I've told you

78
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,120
that Chen Kexin is not my type.

79
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,070
I don't care what type of girl you like.

80
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,010
Chen Jialan,

81
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,640
I find you are really fickle.

82
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,980
Why? Why are you nervous?

83
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,390
I'm going to get

84
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,790
the macarons that Chen Kexin bought for me.

85
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,230
Why are there two boxes?

86
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,660
Did you buy them?

87
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,420
These were given to me by the supermarket for a promotion.

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,490
What promotion

89
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,060
would give away such beautiful macarons?

90
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,820
They already gave it to me anyway.

91
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,700
I don't like macarons.

92
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
You can have them.

93
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,190
Let's share together.

94
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,390
And,

95
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,250
you can eat those produced in 2021.

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,570
I'll eat those produced in 2022.

97
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,100
None of us will gain weight.

98
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,550
Here.

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Yours are all strawberry flavored.

100
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,380
Strawberry flavor is the best.

101
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,300
Don't think about it.

102
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,540
These were produced in 2021.

103
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,540
You'll gain weight if you eat these.

104
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,170
Eat it.

105
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,180
Try it for me.

106
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,710
She said this is delicious.

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,820
How is it? Is it good?

108
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,300
Not bad.

109
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,860
Anyway,

110
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,490
at least Chen Kexin promised to stay away from Jiang Shenghao.

111
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,500
This can be considered a phased victory.

112
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,900
It's worth celebrating.

113
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,310
You'd better

114
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,930
not be too happy about this.

115
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,590
What do you mean?

116
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,220
It's not that simple.

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,420
And we may have thought wrong

118
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,580
in the beginning.

119
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,430
Think about it.

120
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,340
It was Jiang Shenghao who cheated.

121
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,200
Only his mistress was Chen Kexin.

122
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,270
Even if it was not Chen Kexin,

123
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,210
it would be someone else.

124
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,860
So

125
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,140
you might as well

126
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,090
mind your own friend first.

127
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,500
You're actually right.

128
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,110
They won't get divorced

129
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,670
if I help them solve the hidden crisis.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,050
I'll go find Rat

131
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,160
to tell him that tomorrow.

132
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,630
Chen Jialan,

133
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,960
you're acting strange today.

134
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,510
Why don't you refute me?

135
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,300
Why should I refute you

136
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,430
when you are right?

137
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,310
I was always right.

138
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,540
Didn't you also keep refuting me?

139
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,470
No way.

140
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,450
I have always been a person who knows right from wrong.

141
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,130
You must have updated your memory so many times

142
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,600
that you got confused.

143
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,340
You...

144
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,870
Chen Jialan?

145
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,220
What are you doing here?

146
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,860
Didn't you already send us a bridal gift?

147
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,990
I'm here to teach you some love skills.

148
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,960
What skills?

149
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,300
Just get to the point.

150
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,270
Go back if you have nothing to say.

151
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't have time to talk to you.

152
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,870
Are you just going to ignore me?

153
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,490
Yep.

154
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,620
Very good. Keep it.

155
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,940
Hi, Jirong.

156
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,780
This is my second bridal gift to you.

157
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,409
It's the secret to a happy marriage.

158
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,000
Honey.

159
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,070
She sent me a bunch of books.

160
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,539
Jirong,

161
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,470
you should read these books

162
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,740
with Jiang Shenghao sometime.

163
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,600
[Happy Marriage]

164
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,400
Happy Marriage.

165
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,800
We are good.

166
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,140
Shenghao has been very nice to me.

167
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,250
I know.

168
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,560
But marriage also needs management.

169
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,750
You will be together for a long time.

170
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:55,890
Chen Jialan.

171
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,900
We don't need you to teach us.

172
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,400
I have solid theoretical knowledge.

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
What do you think of Zhengyu?

174
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,010

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,120
since I knew something would happen to Jirong.

346
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,980
It shows that you are kind.

347
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,820
People cannot always control their emotions.

348
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,900
It's normal

349
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,210
to lose control of your emotions

350
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,710
when something happens to someone you're close to.

351
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,370
Don't be too hard on yourself.

352
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,740
I can recommend a stress reduction center to you

353
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,070
if you really can't relieve the pressure.

354
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,150
What stress reduction center?

355
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm worried that you have too many negative emotions.

356
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,780
There is a stress reduction center on Huaibei Road.

357
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,030
You can try it.

358
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,110
You can get a discount if you tell them my name.

359
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,350
He Zhengyu.

360
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,160
Are you caring about me?

361
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,210
I'm just solving the problem.

362
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,870
But I'm stressful right now.

363
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,750
How are you feeling? Are you done?

364
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,600
I just got warmed up.

365
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,590
Thank you.

366
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,200
I feel much better.

367
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,400
No need to thank me.

368
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,180
Just remember how good I am to you

369
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,970
the next time you get angry.

370
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,500
He Zhengyu.

371
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,670
Why are you so nice to me?

372
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,330
Do you have a crush on me?

373
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,930
And why did you hug me?

374
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,690
What reason could it be?

375
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,080
Because I love you.

376
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,630
How could I dream about him?

377
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:07,830
Here.

378
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,280
How did you become

379
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,040
the heroine of a rich family?

380
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,100
I took a look at the news this morning

381
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,700
and found out that you are famous now.

382
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,470
That's all made up by them.

383
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,780
Just ignore that.

384
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,760
You don't understand.

385
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,250
Who cares if it's made up now?

386
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,700
They'll just scold people together.

387
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,180
I just commented

388
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,140
with a speechless expression for you.

389
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,560
Then they started scolding me.

390
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,800
Just ignore them.

391
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,670
Anyway, people won't remember it tomorrow.

392
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,000
Manman.

393
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,240
Let's not talk about that.

394
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,040
Please help me analyze my dream.

395
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,480
Tell me.

396
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,350
If...

397
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,260
I mean if...

398
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,880
I often dream about someone

399
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,640
I quite hate.

400
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,920
What does it mean?

401
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,250
A male?

402
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,830
How did you meet him?

403
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,560
By work, sort of.

404
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,700
Congratulations, Chen Jialan.

405
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,250
You have someone you love.

406
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,260
How is that possible?

407
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,690
I really hate him.

408
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,450
And he's

409
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,610
a very mean and unsympathetic person.

410
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,280
Love and hate

411
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,210
are two sides of the same coin.

412
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,230
You

413
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,180
are still stuck in the first stage of a relationship.

414
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,980
That is to show annoyance to the person you love.

415
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,670
You are morally corrupt,

416
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,120
greedy, and helping the bad guys.

417
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,300
Chen Jialan, let me tell you.

418
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,380
You certainly can't beat me

419
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,510
at speaking idioms.

420
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,480
You forced me to fix the light.

You're so short.

423

When it's cold, you should wear more clothes.

424
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,240
You don't even know that?

425
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,880

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,370
Who are you eating with then?

458
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,690
Jiang Shenghao and his wife.

459
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,490
I have to prove my innocence.

460
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,050
Otherwise, how can I live on with it?

461
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,780
I'm off to go.

462
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,130
Brother.

463
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,500
There is a wonderful gossip.

464
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
[Wu Jirong's husband openly took his mistress out in public]

465
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,470
Jiang Shenghao cheated?

466
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,950
Look who his mistress is.

467
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,300
Chen Jialan?

468
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,110
Fantastic?

469
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,710
She's Jiang Shenghao's mistress?

470
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,610
No way.

471
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,880
Everyone is talking about it.

472
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,650
Such parties are usually invitation-only.

473
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,380
There were many people who are more famous than Jiang Shenghao.

474
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,270
Was it too much for those reporters

475
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,000
to keep taking pictures of him?

476
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,240
He just got married to a female celebrity.

477
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,610
So I suspect they did it because of Jirong.

478
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,310
Where are you going?

479
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,510
To meet Chen Jialan.

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,880

482
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,510
Have a seat, Jialan.

Let's eat.

484

You guys eat first. I'll post it on Weibo.

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,300
Look.

487
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,420
Jirong,

488
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,000
I will save you.

489
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,300
I can do it.

490
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Let's eat, honey.

491
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,320
I'll go.

492
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,480
Honey, I'll go.

493
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,580
You can try some chicken wings, Jialan.

494
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,780
These are delicious.

495
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,290
Okay.

496
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,750
Honey.

497
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,000
What a coincidence.

498
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,970
Look who's here.

499
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,260
Zhengyu?

500
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,740
Jirong.

501
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,390
Why are you here?

502
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,110
I came here on a whim.

503
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,040
I want to see if you're okay.

504
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,180
It's because of that gossip, right?

505
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,540
Why are you so vulnerable now?

506
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,800
You even believe that?

507
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,150
Would I be so calm now

508
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,770
if I really believed it?

509
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,030
Jialan is here too.

510
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,100
Let's eat together.

511
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,620
Have a seat.

512
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay.

513
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,970
Ms. Chen.

514
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,670
What a coincidence.

515
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,790
You're here too.

516
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,390
I'm just hungry.

517
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,570
Jirong,

518
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,660
I'm full.

519
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,980
I'm off to work now.

520
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,100
You guys go ahead.

521
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,600
You must not be full yet, Jialan.

522
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,250
Ms. Chen,

523
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,870
what would you do

524
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,900
if someone blacklisted you for no reason?

525
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,020
Then... Then of course I'll pretend I don't know

526
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,300
and let this go.

527
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,250
Didn't you want to interview me?

528
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,100
I happen to have time today.

529
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:33,890
Honey.

530
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,060
What's going on with them?

531
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,700
There are secrets between them.

532
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,410
Chen Jialan, stop!

533
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,180
Don't you need to give me an explanation about

534
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,120
Chen Kexin knowing all my whereabouts

535
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,780
and my personal preferences?

536
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,740
How would I know?

537
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,880
I have nothing to explain.

538
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,900
Okay, I'll go back and draft the indictment.

539
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,580
You're going to sue me

540
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
for such a thing?

541
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,700
As a lawyer,

542
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,210
if I can't even protect

543
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,240
my own legal rights,

544
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,980
how can I make my clients trust me?

545
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,900
But... He Zhengyu.

546
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,020
If you can't give me

547
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
a reasonable explanation now,

548
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,380
you can go back and wait for a court summons.

549
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,340
Okay, see you in court.

550
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,620
Stop...

551
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,580
I can get to know you in many ways.

552
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,460
I've seen a lot of news

553
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,860
and interviews about you.

554
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,560
I also talked to Jirong and Mu Shiming

555
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,430
about you.

556
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,760
There are some personal hobbies

557
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,020
I haven't told anyone.

558
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,310
How did you know?

559
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,660
I guessed.

560
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,390
Impossible.

561
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,030
You said you didn't tell anyone,

562
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,860
so how could I possibly inquire about it?

563
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,090
Or did you tell me that yourself?

564
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,950
You are unreasonable.

565
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,840
I'll leave you to it.

566
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,530
Wait.

567
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,310
Hello?

568
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,270
I can't go back now.

569
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,880
Take them to the stress reduction center first.

570
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,210
Yes.

571
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm worried that you have too many negative emotions.

572
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,610
There is a stress reduction center on Huaibei Road.

573
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,840
You can try it.

574
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,960
You can get a discount if you tell them my name.

575
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,270
He Zhengyu.

576
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,060
Are you caring about me?

577
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,310
It's in the desk drawer.

578
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,470
Just take it.

579
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,840
I'm hanging up.

580
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,170
What stress reduction center?

581
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,490
What does it have to do with you?

582
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,130
Is it the one on Huaibei Road?

583
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,880
How did you know that?

584
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,870
Chen Jialan!

585
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,200
You haven't answered my question.

586
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,200
It's all a trick.

587
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,640
I really see through you, He Zhengyu.

588
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,110
Chen Jialan.

589
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:16,780
Chen Jialan!

590
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,480
Chen...

591
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,460
Excuse me.

592
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,120
I have a case here that

593
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,620
was commissioned by a group of community owners.

594
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,100
They said your company had a survey interview about this

595
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,020
two years ago.

596
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,920
But I couldn't find it online.

597
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,380
[Specific time and location.]

598
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,980
It was about two years ago in the summer.

599
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,380
It was a sewer problem.

600
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,110
Both the developers and property management company of the community

601
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,170
shied away their responsibilities.

602
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,920
[What show?]

603
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,660
A show of people's livelihood investigation.

604
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,930
It's One on One with Fu Xing

605
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,790
or Probe & Investigation, right?

606
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,890
[I'll go to the company and check it for you tomorrow.]

607
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,530
I got it. Thank you.

608
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,020
But is there something wrong

609
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,280
with your voice today?

610
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,640
We're not just roommates.

611
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,040
We are secret roommates.

612
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,480
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

613
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,340
Answer me.

614
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,580
How many people have you actually recommended

615
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,640
to go to that stress reduction center?

616
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
I don't remember.

617
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,070
I really don't remember.

618
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,420
But the feedback they gave me was all good.

619
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,540
It is because there can help people to reduce stress effectively,

620
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,890
so I recommend it to you.

621
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,100
Thank you. No need.

622
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,490
I'm not your client.

623
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,780
I need to work. Don't disturb me.

624
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,740
Chen...

625
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,240
She's angry?

626
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,210
[2022]

627
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,080
Are you okay?

628
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,470
Are you

629
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,000
a heartless person?

630
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,590
Don't you have any worries?

631
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
You have worries?

632
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,770
I just couldn't figure out

633
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,670
what exactly Chen Jialan

634
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,830
is angry with me for.

635
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,750
Ms. Chen is mad at you?

636
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,600
Then you must have done something wrong.

637
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,340
Impossible.

638
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,280
It must not be because of me.

639
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,340
How is she more difficult to understand

640
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,280
than my most difficult client?

641
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,350
Brother,

642
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,830
what you should care about now

643
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,320
is not why she's angry,

644
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,050
but why would you care that she's angry.

645
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,430
Let me put it this way.

646
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,300
If you don't care about her,

647
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,960
then what does it matter to you if she's angry or not?

648
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,410
Right?

649
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,630
You have a crush on her?

650
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,760
Are you serious?

651
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,530
Do you have nothing to do?

652
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,920
Your perfect assistant who combines the duties of investigator,

653

00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,680
Okay.

660
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,450
What's matter with Chen Kexin?

661
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,420
She betrayed me.

I'm sorry.

667
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,190
Okay.

Okay.

671
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,030
We can't do so much legal aid anymore.

672
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,610
We have to make money.

673
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,320
Our balance is only 2.3 yuan left.

674
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,470
We're fine as long as we don't lose money.

675
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,840
I paid 20,000.

676
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,550
Da...

677
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,380
Hello, Anwen.

678
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,900
Jiang Shenghao may escape.

679
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,000
His car was seen

680
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,320
driving towards the airport highway.

681
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
Is it easy to find?

682
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:13,909
Yep.

683
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,860
What are they doing?

684
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,750
He can't escape.

685
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,960
We may have overreacted a bit.

686
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,389
He would get the death penalty

687
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,590
for killing someone.

688
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,060
People are likely to do anything to escape.

689
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,659
Anwen.

690
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,320
Don't be so excited when you're driving.

691
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,870
I just can't calm down.

692
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,530
Is it his car?

693
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,780
How dare you run away!

694
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:19,590
Get off!

695
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,970
Why are you here?

696
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,840
You're going to run away if we don't come.

697
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,460
Run away?

698
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,060
Why should I run away?

699
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,130
This is the way to the airport.

700
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,180
You're trying to abscond from the crime.

701
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,100
Something happened to my grandma.

702
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,060
I'm going to see my grandma.

703
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,880
Why did this happen to your grandmother

704
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,690
just now?

You want to see me?

718
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,410
Jirong came home to make up with me that day.

719
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,580
We have made up.

720
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,460
I was so happy.

721
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,560
Why would I kill her?

722
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,910
Because you cheated on her

723
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,010
and she caught you.

724
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,710
You killed her to silence her.

725
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,960
Jirong knew I didn't cheat on her.

726
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,090
She told me herself.

727
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,410
Now Jirong has passed away.

728
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,420
You can say anything

729
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,350
you want.

730
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,590
You're the last person who met Jirong.

731
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,380
I woke up and Jirong was gone.

732
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,970
I wanted to ask you.

733
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,450
What do you mean?

734
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,870
Are you trying to frame me for killing my own sister?

735
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,130
Half an hour

736
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,380
after I left your house,

737
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,650
Jirong sent me a message.

738
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,220
The police have confirmed it.

739
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,940
What happened

740
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,100
between you two after I left?

741
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,140
What did you do to her?

742
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,980
Tell me now.

743
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,960
Wu Anwen!

744
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,600
How did Chen Kexin find my apartment?

745
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,480
How did I get drunk and photographed?

746
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,960
They all said that I was a scumbag

747
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,770
and that I cheated in marriage.

748
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,180
Who did these?

749
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,480
You should know, right?

750
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,020
You're talking about another thing.

751
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
That's your ex-girlfriend.

752
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,900
I don't know her well.

753
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,510
You don't deserve to be Jirong's brother!

754
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,170
-You have no right to say that. -Enough! Stop arguing.

755
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:17,970
Stop arguing.

756
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,680
Calm down

757
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,130
and listen to me.

758
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,110
Since you two show up here

759
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,800
and argue with each other.

760
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,580
That means

761
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:30,870
the police have ruled you out for now.

762
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,590
There's no point in arguing right now.

763
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,780
Just leave now, Shenghao.

764
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:53,890

765
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,150
He was so arrogant even after he killed someone!

766
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,650
Anwen,

767
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,960
the most important thing now is to find Chen Kexin.

768
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,160
It will come to light.

769
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,200
What could they be talking about for so long?

770
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,770
It's been two hours.

771
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,420
Dajun.

772
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Come with me to Chen Jialan's house.

773
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,750
Really?

774
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,830
Why do you want to take me with you?

775
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,370
I at least have to figure out

776
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,970
what their relationship is,

777
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,700
and whether Sun Defeng

778
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,200
tell her about my information or not.

779
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,220
In case I get into a confrontation with her,

780
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,680
you're at least a witness.

781
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,440
How do you know where her house is?

782
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,260
I'm worried that you have too many negative emotions.

783
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,900
There is a stress reduction center on Huaibei Road.

784
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,310
You can try it.

785
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,680
You can get a discount if you tell them my name.

786
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,630
Take them to the stress reduction center first.

787
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,360
What stress reduction center?

788
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,190
What does it have to do with you?

789
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,460
It really pisses me off!

790
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,030
Whether it was four months ago or four months later,

791
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,430
he's always so annoying.

792
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,100
Are you sure this is the right place?

793
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
This place is quite old school.

794
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,620
So there is no security here.

795
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,620

He just loves to use these tricks.

What are you laughing at?

805
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,160
I now seriously suspect that it was you who leaked the secret.

806

I won't.

807

I won't laugh in a year.

808

What are we doing here?

809
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Drive to the back of this building and take a look

810
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,540
to see if her house is lit.

811
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,150
Let's go.

Her house is lit.

822

Get in the car and chase her.
