00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,230
Jialan.

5
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,240
Jialan!

6
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,250
Jialan.

7
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,860
Why didn't time and space overlap?

8
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,000
Why didn't he come to me?

9
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,090
Time and space

10
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,320
may

11
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,060
not overlap anymore.

12
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,350
Did he...

13
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,950
did he disappear, just like the increase of entropy?

14
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,480
Jialan.

15
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,280

Jialan.

18
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,070
I'm always here.

19
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,290
You...

20
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,310
Why are you awake?

21
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,730
Tell me.

22
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,270
What happened?

23
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,020
I really don't know.

24
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,500
You know the abandoned car factory in the western suburb.

25
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,760
How could you not know?

26
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,120
I only know the location

27
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,990
and that this is related to Sun Defeng.

28
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,220
As for what happened

29
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,150
after they left,

30
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,690
I have no idea.

31
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,780
I'm sorry, Jialan.

32
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,940
How can I tell you the truth now?

33
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,350
I'll make you something to eat.

34
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,930
You like it, so I‘ll have a try.

35
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,270
But this...

36
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,090
I still need some time to adapt to it.

37
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,860
I know you like Liuzhou river snails rice noodles,

38
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,810
but I don't know

39
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,510
if it's appropriate to eat Liuzhou river snails rice noodles in the morning.

40
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,670
So I made a bowl of noodles too.

41
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,960
How about this?

42
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,590
You can eat whichever you like.

43
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,650
Pick one yourself.

44
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,200
No, thanks.

45
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,110
Have some.

46
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,690
I know you like "La La Land".

47
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,860
We happen to have it in our television database.

48
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,860
Let me look for it.

49
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,850
I found it.

50
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,330
It's an old movie anyway.

51
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,990
Let's start with the classic episode.

52
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,300
Excuse me.

53
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,180
Can you leave my house first?

54
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:49,840
Because...

55
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
you and him...

56
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,860
I understand.

57
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,610
I'm leaving.

58
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,580
Eat it while it's hot.

59
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,420
If anything happens,

60
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,080
call me immediately.

61
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,150
Mr. Sun,

62
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,310
we have investigated this case.

63
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,540
We have told the people involved

64
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,110
the details.

65
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,700
But it may take two or three days to get the evidence.

66
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,030
Mr. Sun, Mr. Sun.

67
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,100
Are you a human or a ghost?

68
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,750
I see.

69
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,760
You set me up that night.

70
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,010
What are you waiting for?

71
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,850
Get out!

72
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
Let's go.

73
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,070
Listen,

74
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,250
you livestreamed yesterday,

75
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,250
and I have recorded the screen.

76
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,510
I've got the evidence.

77
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,540
What are you doing? Don't come over.

78
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,900
I'll call the police if you come any closer.

79
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm here to tell you that

80
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,990
you have to pay for your mistakes.

81
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
You can't escape.

82
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,690
You know clearly

83
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,090
what you did to me that night.

84
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,440
If you want to call the police,

85
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,630
call the police now.

86
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,570
I don't understand what you're talking about.

87
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
You were fine

88
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,770
during the live stream, right?

89
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,030
Yes, you're fine now.

90
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,180
Aren't you curious

91
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,060
why there are two of me at the same time?

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,990
Think about it.

93
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,550
I want you to tell the truth in public in the company.

94
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,980
I'll keep an eye on you.

95
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,810
It's over.

96
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,710
I'll get going then.

97
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,070
Why does he know everything?

98
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,700
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

99
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,330
After he found

100
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,600
the evidence of Gao Ming sexually assaulting Zhang Xiaojiang...

101
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,560
Mr. Sun, look.

102
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,710
He submitted it to the police immediately.

103
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,080
He is also a victim.

104
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,820
To stop him

105
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,410
from taking over Zhang Xiaojiang's case,

106
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,860
Gao Ming cooperated with Mr. Sun

107
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,290
from Fengyu Law Firm.

108
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,380
-Mr. Sun. -Sun Defeng and Zhang Hui...

109
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,450
Isn't He Zhengyu livestreaming here?

110
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,250
Who was the person here just now?

111
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,280
Why?

112
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Why are there two He Zhengyus?

113
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,600
Why?

114
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,490
I know. I know.

115
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,420
How can the real He Zhengyu

116
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,520
lower his head to me?

117
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,700
You drive

118
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,770
to the main road

119
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,550
and stop him!

120
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,390
Zhengyu,

121
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,580
I know a lot has happened to you recently.

122
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,790
Those things are not simple.

123
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
I just want to tell you

124
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,190
no matter what happened to you,

125
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,880
I will help you if I can.

126
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,830
Thank you, Dajun.

127
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,780
Thank you.

128
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,660
Zhengyu,

129
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
what happened on earth?

130
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,470
I died once.

131
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,890
Just kidding.

132
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,970
I experienced something I haven't experienced

133
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,270
in a second.

134
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm no longer myself.

135
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,910
I don't understand what you're talking about.

136
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,650
Don't worry. I'm fine.

137
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,020
There is something

138
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,480
I can't tell you now.

139
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,510
But I'm still me.

140
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,400
I haven't changed.

141
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,930
You just met me a few months earlier.

142
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,550
Chen Jialan,

143
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,160
what did you and He Zhengyu do to Sun Defeng?

144
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,790
He just said everything.

145
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,820
The night before yesterday, after he saw you,

146
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,860
he was insane when he was back

147
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,120
as if he was possessed.

148
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,260
I don't understand what you're saying.

149
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,920
Where are they?

150
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,220
You're innocent now.

151
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,050
I've returned the investment in the law firm to you,

152
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,420
and I have apologized to you in front of everyone.

153
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,100
I admit that I am defeated.

154
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,230
I won't fight with you anymore.

155
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,490
I beg you

156
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,010
to let me go.

157
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,080
Let you go?

158
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,780
That's impossible.

159
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,860
A life for a life!

160
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,900
What?

161
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,090
I didn't kill anyone.

162
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,340
I didn't.

163
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,200
I didn't do anything that night.

164
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,120
I didn't.

165
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,020
Your stone hit me so hard.

166
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,090
Who are you?

167
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,120
Tell me who you are.

168
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,880
Are you a stand-in?

169
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,420
Here.

170
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,680
Look.

171
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,260
Why are you broadcasting on the phone?

172
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,870
Why?

173
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,350
Why are there two He Zhengyus?

174
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,020
Why?

175
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,480
Say something!

176
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,940
Say something! I want you to say something!

177
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,990
Say something!

178
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,940
Didn't you tell me that

179
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,140
without me, Sun Defeng,

180
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,620
you will not become what you are?

181
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,900
Why don't you say anything?

182
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,110
Are you tricking me?

183
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,720
Fine, I'll play with you.

184
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,070
I'll kill you.

185
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,690
Say something.

186
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,400
Jia...

187
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,830
Jia...

188
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,570
Lan...

189
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,580
How is that possible?

190
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,550
Aren't you alive now?

191
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,230
Aren't you still here?

192
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,250
Yes, I'm not dead,

193
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,800
but he died.

194
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,369
You have seen two He Zhengyus.

195
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
One is me now,

196
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,940
and the other was killed by you.

197
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,069
He is me coming from four months later.

198
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,990
I have all his memories now.

199
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,880
How is that possible?

200
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,970
It's impossible.

201
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,660
Yes. You didn't believe me,

202
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,570
and then you killed me.

203
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,850
I didn't kill you.

204
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,240
As long as you are alive,

205
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,290
you don't have evidence

206
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,750
to prove that I killed you.

207
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,450
Although the law in reality can't convict you,

208
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,530
since you and I are both lawyers,

209
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,900
you must know that justice may be late,

210
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,330
but it won't be absent.

211
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,850
You got it wrong.

212
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,940
I didn't kill anyone.

213
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,950
I'm not a murderer.

214
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,410
I'm not.

215
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,120
I'm not.

216
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:13,780
I'm not.

217
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm not.

218
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,350
I'm not.

219
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,250
I'm not a murderer.

220
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,480
I'm not.

221
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,370
I'm not.

222
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,380
I'm not.

223
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,680
You said that you had all of his memories just now.

224
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
What did you mean?

225
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,580
Jialan.

I'm here to bring you food.

284
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,490
It is your favorite Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

I won't eat it. I don't like it anymore.

But you have said that

287
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,970
you would always love your favorite book and your favorite river snail rice noodles,

288

no matter how many years have passed.

289
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,030
It is the same as loving a man.

290
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,340
You won't change either.

291

293
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,370
I have all his memories.

294
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,870
I can feel all his emotions.

295
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,620
In a way, he hasn't disappeared,

296
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,770
and he's still here.

297
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,370
Jialan.

298
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,540
I know you have all his memories.

299
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,630
But in my heart,

300
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,220
you two are not the same person.

301
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,200
You're not him.

302
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,070
Thank you. Don't come to me.

303
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,860
Jialan,

304
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,380
open the door.

305
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,730
I'm your grandma.

306
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,970

308

Jialan, open the door!

309
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,750
Grandma?

310
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,270
Why are you here?

311
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,470
Look at you.

312
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,010
It isn't long since you left my home,

313
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,470
but you've become so thin.

314
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,380
Luckily, Zhengyu has told me.

315
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,200
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known it.

316
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,100
Look at you.

317
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,790
How did you become like this?

318
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,050
Come and sit, Grandma.

319
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Look at you.

320
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,530
You must have no appetite for carry-out.

321
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,780
Zhengyu, hurry up.

322
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,310
This is the porridge

323
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,640
I made for you in person.

324
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,730
Hurry up. Bring her a spoon.

325
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,460
Come on.

326
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,230
Here you are.

327
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,100
Thank you.

328
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,010
Have a try.

329
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,400
See if it tastes the same as what you ate when you were young.

330
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,420
How is it?

331
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,470
It's delicious.

332
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,790
Eat more. Hurry up.

333
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,500
Look how skinny you are.

334
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,020
It's still a little hot, right?

335
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:52,660
Blow it.

336
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,260
It's good.

337
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,670
I know that

338
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,470
you just lost

339
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,110
a very important person in your life.

340
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,960
You feel sad,

341
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,590
and you can't get out of that in a while.

342
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,690
I can understand this feeling.

343
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
When your grandpa passed away,

344
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,720
I was just like you.

345
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,790
But then I remembered what your grandpa said to me

346
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,380
before he died,

347
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,010
I gradually learned to let it go.

348
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,790
What did my grandpa say?

349
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,860
Your grandpa

350
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,670
held my hand and said before he died,

351
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
"Granny,

352
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,580
you have to be sad after I die.

353
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,190
Otherwise, I'll be sad."

354
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,140
He kept saying,

355
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,190
"But don't always be sad.

356
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,400
Otherwise, I'll be sad too."

357
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,980
He said,

358
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,040
"Granny,

359
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,420
if you're too sad,

360
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,220
find a place

361
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,190
to cry as you like.

362
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,570
Then you should cheer up,

363
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,550
eat well, sleep well,

364
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,160
and live well.

365
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,840
Only then

366
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,740
can I die in peace."

367
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,490
Jialan,

368
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,070
you should learn to say goodbye to those who passed away,

369
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,600
let it go,

370
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,140
and get rid of the bad mood.

371
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,120
That’s what your grandpa taught me.

372
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,730
Today,

373
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,700
I teach you the same thing

374
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,840
because you're not alone.

375
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,570
Those who love you will be sad with you.

376
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,420
If you are sad for some time,

377
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,130
he will be sad for some time.

378
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,300
I will die too one day.

379
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,230
But Jialan,

380
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,370
you must make it.

381
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,620
After I die,

382
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,980
you still need to eat well,

383
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,250
sleep well,

384
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,850
and live well.

385
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,800
All right, my baby.

386
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,730
Don't cry.

387
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,520
Grandma.

388
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,020
I promise you.

389
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,440
From now on, I will eat well,

390
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,510
sleep well,

391
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,410
and live well.

392
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,850
I believe Jialan will make it.

393
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,370
It's okay.

394
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,870
Alright, give me a hug.

395
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,690
Darling.

396
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,840
Grandma.

397
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,230
Thank you.

398
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,130
Jialan.

399
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,410
I'm always here.

400
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm always by your side.

401
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,670
As long as you are willing,

402
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,220
you can see me by your side

403
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,570
when you open your eyes every day.

404
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,480
When you need me,

405
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,370
I will always be there.

406
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,040
So don't be sad anymore.

407
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,180
Cheer up.

408
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,700
Remember.

409
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,510
If you are happy,

410
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,100
I will be happy.

411
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,970
I will be happy.

412
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,100
I'll try my best.

413
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,510
I'll work hard,

414
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,060
eat well,

415
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,270
and sleep well.

416
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,540
You're awake.

417
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,100
You cried all night last night.

418
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,910
Then you slept on my shoulder,

419
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,390
so I stayed here.

420
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,560
Thank you for

421
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,390
what you've done for me these days.

422
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,660
Don't worry.

423
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,370
I'll try to pull myself together.

424
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,210
Then you have to keep your words.

425
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,990
Eat well

426
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,910
and sleep well.

427
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,780
This is iNEWS reporting.

428
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,620
I'm a journalist from iNEWS, Chen Jialan.

429
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,650
There was a gas explosion

430
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,710
in this hot pot restaurant behind me.

431
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,670
Zhengyu,

432
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,670
we don't have enough time for big cases,

433
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,710
but you still take divorce and domestic violence cases.

434
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,370
Now I take cases regardless of their scales or customers' status.

435
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,560
Mr. Mu,

436
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,140
in terms of the explosion incident of the hot pot restaurant,

437
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,040
I want to focus on

438
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,970
the compensation for the victims.

439
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,550
The three injured

440
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,510
are the owner,

441
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,850
an employee and a customer.

442
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,260
When the accident happened,

443
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,300
the employee and the customer were quarreling.

444
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,230
So this time, you need to figure out

445
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,200
the main cause of this accident first.

446
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,600
Okay.

447
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,550
Thank you.

448
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,150
Thank you.

449
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,940
Good morning.

450
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,320
Good morning, Mr. He.

451
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,120
Good morning.

452
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,650
Good morning, Mr. He.

453
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,260
Good morning.

454
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,060
Good morning.

455
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:55,860
Zhengyu, you never

456
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,060
greeted them before.

457
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,760
You said that it was in the past.

458
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,630
How are the people

459
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,210
that I asked you to follow?

460
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,850
Sun Defeng had mental problems.

461
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,820
He couldn't sleep.

462
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,900
He had nightmares when he was asleep.

463
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,920
Later, Zhang Hui resigned and took care of him for a while.

464
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,780
Then I don't know where they went.

465
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,940
What about Gao Ming?

466
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,199
I just received the news that

467
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,460
Gao Ming was arrested.

468
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,130
Did you inform Ms. Zhang?

469
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:17,600
Yes.

470
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,139
She wants to treat you to dinner

471
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:19,940
to celebrate.

472
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,020
Ask her to meet at Manman Cafe.

473
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,900
Tonight is New Year's Eve.

474
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,780
Let's have dinner together.

475
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,170
Okay.

476
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,650
There are a lot of dishes, right?

477
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,580
It feels good.

478
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,159
You're all here.

479
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:33,820
Jialan,

480
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,670
come here.

481
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,850
Sorry, I had some work to do,

482
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,510
so I am late.

483
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,250
It's okay. I just arrived.

484
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,520
You look good.

485
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,560
You've let it go, right?

486
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,120
It is all thanks to you.

487
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,659
What are you two doing there?

488
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,449
You are so strange.

489
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,120
Did you two fight with each other or break up?

490
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,219
No, no.

491
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,460
Who said that?

492
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,360
Have a seat.

493
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,000
Come on.

494
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,750
Have a seat.

495
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,880
Thank you.

496
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:04,960
Well,

497
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,280
let's have a toast

498
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,310
to celebrate Zhang Xiaojiang’s success in the lawsuit.

499
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,030
OK?

500
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,800
Come on.

501
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,170
Congratulations. Come on.

502
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:15,910
Congratulations.

503
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,550
Thank you.

504
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,310
Thank you.

505
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,980
Sit down and eat.

506
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,530
Come on.

507
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,580
Mr. He,

508
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,820
I think you've changed a lot.

509
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,000
Really?

510
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,410
When I first met you,

511
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,970
I thought you were very cold and serious.

512
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,100
When you talked, you didn't care about others.

513
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,760
Now I think you are much easier to get along with.

514
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,450
There's nothing wrong with you.

515
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,290
At first,

516
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,550
when facing Jialan,

517
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,840
he was superior and aggressive.
