♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

177
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,590
♫We♫

178
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,720
♫Are like hour hands embracing and talking♫

179
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,030
♫How can I stop flipping?♫

180
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,750
♫You are the light shining♫

181
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,030
I thought the surprise was He Zhengyu's confession.

182
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,670
♫And warming my eyes♫

183
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,200
But unexpectedly, it's just a lollipop.

♫You are the light halting♫

187
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,060
♫And staying in my heart♫

188
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,110
♫Spend dust and dawn with you♫

189
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
What's your name?

190
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,810
Wu Anwen.

191
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,350
Chen Kexin is accusing you of

192
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,180
forcibly taking her to the abandoned car factory

193
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,440
and trying to kill her.

194
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,700
Do you admit it?

195
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,570
No.

196
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,330
I didn't mean to kill her.

197
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,000
But you brought a girl to a car factory abandoned years ago

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,020
in the middle of the night.

199
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,420
What is your motive?

200
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,830
I want to scare her.

201
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,000
Scare her?

202
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,320
Do you know why we can find you?

203
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,100
We've been watching you for a long time.

204
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,670
If you tell us the truth now,

205
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,720
you can get

206
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,350
some leniency.

207
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,210
Officer,

208
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,090
I have nothing to say.

209
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,110
You are still dishonest, right?

210
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,890
Listen.

211
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,450
Chen Kexin has confessed that

212
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,060
she framed Jiang Shenghao

213
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,820
with you.

214
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,690
She is a swindler.

215
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,310
You can't believe her.

216
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,660
She hates Jiang Shenghao and envies Jirong.

217
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,020
She wants to ruin their marriage.

218
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,480
I have worked as a detective for years,

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,100
I've seen a lot of people like you.

220
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,360
Can I keep an eye on you without evidence?

221
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,920
Let me ask you again.

222
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,620
What did you want to do

223
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,630
when you took Chen Kexin to the car factory in the western suburb?

224
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,020
I just want to scare her.

225
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,580
Let me analyze it for you.

226
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,290
Chen Kexin asked you for money. But you didn't have the money.

227
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,370
But you were afraid that

228
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,900
she would tell others about your conspiracy.

229
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,340
So you took her to the factory in the suburb

230
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,640
and wanted to kill her, right?

231
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,080
Let me tell you.

232
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,430
The maximum sentence for intentional murder is death penalty.

233
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,930
I couldn't pay the gambling debt I owed.

234
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,570
The creditors pushed me so hard.

235
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,110
My income is from

236
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,550
being my sister's agent.

237
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,750
She wants to quit the entertainment industry after getting married,

238
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,370
I have no hope at all.

239
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,020
So you asked Chen Kexin

240
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,550
to destroy your sister's marriage together.

241
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,850
My sister married Jiang Shenghao.

242
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,380
I never thought Jiang Shenghao was a good choice.

243
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,300
They have signed a marriage agreement.

244
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,230
I thought if the thing went well,

245
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,280
my sister can get out of this bad marriage,

246
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,070
and I can pay all my gambling debts.

247
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,400
We will achieve many things at one stroke.

248
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,850
Fine.

249
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,670
Tell me about you and your sister.

250
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,800
Anwen.

251
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,700
[January 6th, 2022]

252
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,700
[9:58 p.m.]

253
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,280
Anwen.

254
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,040
The cause of the matter

255
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,300
-was the night before Jirong's divorce. -It's so messy.

256
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,500
I forgot to close my WeChat on my computer when I went out,

257
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,230
so she saw my chatting records.

258
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,380
Don't go back on your word after you get the money.

259
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,010
I won't give you a penny less.

260
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,900
Is the money ready?

261
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,110
I'll be rich soon.

262
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,980
Jirong saw the records.

263
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,820
She said that she could pay the money back for me,

264
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,420
but she would never divorce.

265
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,800
So that night,

266
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,340
when I heard that she went back to the Jiang family,

267
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,600
I went after her after I got off the plane.

268
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm in front of your house.

269
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,080
Is Jiang Shenghao asleep?

270
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,140
Anwen, I have something to say to you.

271
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,200
Listen to me first.

272
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,290
About what I did,

273
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,350
how much did you tell

274
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,100
Zhengyu and Jiang Shenghao?

275
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,220
I was going to tell them everything,

276
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,010
so I asked Zhengyu to pick me up.

277
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,920
I can't stand it anymore.

278
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,080
It's really harder than being in jail.

279
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,960
But when I received the photo you sent me,

280
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,460
I hesitated.

281
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,510
Jirong!

282
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,760
Jirong!

283
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,849
What's wrong? Who is it?

284
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,990
A nurse from the nursing home.

285
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,250
She urged me to go back.

286
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,069
That photo

287
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,720
was taken on the day you graduated from university.

288
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,590
All your classmates had parents

289
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,070
who sent them flowers,

290
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,360
except for you.

291
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,140
It was so important in your life.

292
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,270
How could I let you down?

293
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,700
I was a part-time deliveryman that day.

294
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,550
I bought a bunch of flowers and sent them over.

295
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,120
You lied to me.

296
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,160
You told me that you asked your colleague to send it to me.

297
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,090
You were wearing a helmet and refused to take it off.

298
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,940
You were afraid that I would recognize you.

299
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,870
I was afraid that your classmates would laugh at you.

300
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,410
You are the campus belle.

301
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,340
How could you have a brother

302
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,600
who was a delivery man?

303
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,140
But you recognized me right away.

304
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,460
No matter what others thought of you,

305
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,580
you insisted on taking photos with me.

306
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,880
You are my brother.

307
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,870
How could I not recognize you?

308
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,170
At that time, to support my study,

309
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,880
you worked during the day

310
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,540
and worked part-time when you were free.

311
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,790
When you don't have time to have meals, you eat some dry bread.

312
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,500
You've been wearing the same clothes for years,

313
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
and you refused to buy some new ones.

314
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,690
Anwen,

315
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,110
without you, I couldn't have survived,

316
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,610
and I couldn't have grown up.

317
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
I wouldn't have become the Wu Jirong today.

318
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,160
Anwen,

319
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,430
I owe you all my life.

320
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,340
Don't be silly.

321
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,130
Our parents passed away early.

322
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,960
You are my only family in this world.

323
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,120
If I didn't treat you well,

324
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,920
who else would be nice to you?

325
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
So when I saw the photo,

326
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,650
I hesitated.

327
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,820
I asked Zhengyu to go back.

328
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,910
I really can't say anything about what you did.

329
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,190
It's good that you didn't say anything.

330
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,390
It's good that you didn't say anything.

331
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,550
Jirong,

332
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,740
I did do many wrong things.

333
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,340
I know.

334
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,080
Forgive me this time.

335
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
I promise you that

336
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,440
I will make up for it and repent.

337
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,700
Come home with me, okay?

338
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,000
Why?

339
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,290
Why won't you go back with me

340
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,690
just because of a cheater?

341
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,510
Shenghao didn't cheat on me.

342
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,260
He said that I was his only woman.

343
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,780
I love him.

344
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,490
I don't want to leave him.

345
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,790
He just didn't have sex with Chen Kexin.

346
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,500
He has done a lot of these kinds of things.

347
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,600
Since you two started dating,

348
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,200
are his scandals few

349
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,770
on the Internet?

350
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,780
Do you know how many people are laughing at you?

351
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,050
This is my own business.

352
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,580
It's none of your business.

353
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,290
Have you thought about it?

354
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,730
If the Jiang family finds out that

355
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,890
I asked Chen Kexin

356
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,780
to frame Jiang Shenghao,

357
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,060
can you still stay in the Jiang's house?

358
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,530
The Jiang family has always looked down on us.

359
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,930
You must go with me today.

360
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,190
-No, I won't. -Be good. Let's go.

361
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,190
I don't want to go.

362
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:44,980
Go.

363
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,980
-No! -Go!

364
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:57,990
Jirong!

365
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,810
What's that sound?

366
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,560
I went down immediately

367
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,170
and found that she wasn't breathing.

368
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,970
I panicked.

369
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,030
My first reaction was to escape.

370
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,270
It's okay.

371
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,780
It's okay.

372
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,650
Anwen,

373
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,780
where are you?

[Jiang Shenghao]

375
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,580
Hello?

376
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,700
Anwen,

377
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,540
something happened to Jirong.

378
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,400
What happened?

379
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,270
I found her in the swimming pool this morning.

380
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,490
She...

381
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,530
Jirong passed away.

382
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,380
Anwen,

383
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,580
where are you?

384
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,370
If I had calmed down at that time,

385
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,210
and had called the police or 911,

386
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,770
my sister wouldn't have died.

387
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,200
Let him sign it.

[2021]

389
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,540
Last night,

390
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,110
I went to the convenience store in 2022 to look for you last night.

391
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,040
You didn't come.

392
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,170
Sorry, Jialan.

393
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,980
Wu Anwen was arrested yesterday.

394
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,780
I was in the police station all the time.

395
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,810
When I came back,

396
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,670
the time-space overlap was over.

397
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,840
Did Wu Anwen

398
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,970
confess to his crime?

399
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,180
Yes.

400
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,460
But he didn't kill Jirong himself.

401
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,810
What do you mean?

402
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,130
Wu Anwen thought he killed Jirong by mistake,

403
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,390
so he chose to run away.

404
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,060
Later, Jirong woke up.

405
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,590
Because of her head injury,

406
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,640
she couldn't stand steadily,

407
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,970
so she fell into the pool

408
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,990
and died.

409
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,400
The truth is finally revealed.

410
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,620
But even if Wu Anwen

411
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,960
is duly punished,

412
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,750
even if we know the truth,

413
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,900
we still can't save Jirong.

414
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,970
Don't let Jirong find it out.

415
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,180
They are newlyweds. They are happy.

416
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,310
They invited a group of friends today.

417
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,820
Yes.

418
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,050
But that's why I'm sad.

419
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,250
Rat and Jirong are so happy now.

420
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,940
They don't know

421
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,140
what will happen to them in four months.

422
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,430
And Wu Anwen is here tonight.

423
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,380
I know. I know.

424
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
Hello, everyone.

425
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,170
I have something to say.

426
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,810
Yes.

427
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,720
First of all, welcome to my house.

428
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,980
Jirong and I have been looking for a chance

429
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,010
to thank you.

430
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,410
You have been our friends for years.

431
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,400
We've formed a new family,

432
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,050
so it's not a bad thing

433
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,610
for us to merge our friends.

434
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,150
Most importantly,

435
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,530
Jirong and I are legally married.

436
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,100
So we want to find a chance to show our affection.

437
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,620
I can't stand you anymore.

438
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,950
I can't take it anymore.

439
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,590
Chen Jialan,

440
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,620
why are you

441
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,280
looking at my wife adoringly?

442
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,470
I think Jirong is pretty.

443
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,310
Jialan, ignore him.

444
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,130
Besides, everyone here

445
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,200
is excellent single man

446
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,120
or woman.

447
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,180
So I give you a chance

448
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,580
to get to know each other.

449
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,640
My childhood friend Chen Jialan

450
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,420
and Jirong's childhood friend He Zhengyu

451
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,680
are already together.

452
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,240
So, for this good thing,

453
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,690
cheers.

454
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,360
Come on.

455
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,870
Cheers.

456
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,140
They look so good.

457
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,250
Look.

458
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,400
So cheesy.

459
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,560
I wish they would always be like this.

460
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,690
Let's take a photo.

461
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,760
Sure.

462
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,020
It makes your face look smaller.

463
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,620
Take a look.

464
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,990
My face is so big.

465
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,500
You are very handsome.

466
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,100
Why are you so handsome, honey?

467
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,430
Let's take another one.

468
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,950
The cakes are ready.

469
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,050
Anwen,

470
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,410
Anwen, your cakes

471
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,790
look delicious.

472
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,920
I'll give the cakes to them.

473
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,250
Okay.

474
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,180
Come on. Try it.

475
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,700
I dare not eat it.

476
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,410
Why not? You have retired from the entertainment industry.

477
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,350
Hold it and eat it.

478
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,880
How is it?

479
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,720
The cakes you made are the best.

480
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,120
Try this flavor. Come on.

481
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,240
I'll give the cakes to them.

482
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,960
Okay.

483
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,960
Can you make it?

484
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,780
Slow down.

485
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,220
Come on. Have some cakes.

486
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,060
My brother made them.

487
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,860
Try it.

488
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,290
Okay.

489
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,670
Okay.

490
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,240
Shenghao, well...

491
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,520
My brother talked to me last night.

492
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,450
He agreed with my decision to quit my entertainment industry.

493
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,410
But he said he didn't want to be free.

494
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,460
He wanted to work at Shenghao's company.

495
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Shenghao agreed.

496
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,540
They are reconciled.

497
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,210
Right?

498
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,400
That's right.

499
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,040
Honey.

500
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,090
I'll go over first.

501
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,420
Okay.

502
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,100
Let's take a photo with Anwen.

503
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,540
Okay.

504
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,340
Great!

505
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,100
Use my phone.

506
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,750
Okay.

507
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,920
If what she said is true,

508
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,310
does that mean

509
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,600
Jirong will be fine?

510
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,960
If Anwen were an actor,

511
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,800
he could be the best actor.

512
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,100
He has confessed in 2022 that

513
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,160
he owed more than eight million yuan.

514
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,830
The two million I lent him

515
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,310
is nothing.

516
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,440
So he's just acting in front of you,

517
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,650
pretending to be a good brother

518
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,880
in order to

519
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,730
let you

520
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,340
keep his secret.

521
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,290
I didn't expect that

522
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,340
he would work in the Jiang Family's company.

523
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,040
What I'm worried about now

524
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,470
is not that he wants to act in front of me,

525
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,430
but what he's up to.

526
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,740
What can he do?

527
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,630
I'll go to see him tomorrow night.

528
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,860
It's almost the time.

529
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,110
Is our time so limited?

530
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,130
Our time is indeed limited.

531
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,220
But fortunately,

532
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,480
today, we have finished all we should do.

533
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,200
There is still one more thing.

534
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,310
The most important thing.

535
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,690
I know

536
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,940
this is not the right time,

537
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,770
but I must say it today.

538
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,710
What is it?

539
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,590
Jialan,

540
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,820
I thought you could understand it

541
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,040
because of what I have done these days.

542
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,500
I thought that after I kissed you that night,

543
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,890
you would know my heart.

544
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,310
But when you got angry later, I realized that

545
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,740
I was wrong.

546
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,990
How would you know it if I didn't tell you?

547
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,080
So, Jialan,

548
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,620
I'm telling you seriously today.

549
00:29:54,050 --> 00:30:01,040
♫A dream within reach♫

550
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,420
Chen Jialan,

551
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,520
I like you.

552
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,910
♫Arises because of you♫

553
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,910
I kissed you not because I acted on impulse,

554
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,510
but because I really like you

555
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,460
♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

556
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,100
I thought

557
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,780
♫We♫

558
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,030
I will never hear your confession.

559
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:19,030
♫Are like hour hands embracing and talking♫

560
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,510
Jialan,

561
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,180
to be honest,

562
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,230
♫How can I stop flipping?♫

563
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,770
I still can't figure out

564
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,400
what girls think.

565
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,340
But I'll try my best to learn it.

566
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,740
♫You are the light shining♫

567
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,730
So Jialan,

568
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,360
will you forgive me

569
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,660
♫And warming my eyes♫

570
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,700

♫Hug with you♫

573
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,900
He Zhengyu,

574
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,650
you didn't confess your love for me when I was ready.

575
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,800
♫You are the light halting♫

576
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,640
I didn't prepare anything today,

577
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,130
and you suddenly confess your love for me.

578
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,050
♫And staying in my heart♫

579
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:48,600
I...

580
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,230
I know that

581
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,010
this is not the best time.

582
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,160
But every time I think that

583
00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:00,220
♫Spend dust and dawn with you♫

584
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,780
we don't have much time together,

585
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,440
I don't want to waste a second.

586
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,870
We are different from others,

587
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,720
so every minute and every second we are together

588
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:05,560
♫Say out I miss you♫

589
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,970

590
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,250
♫You will know that♫

591
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,010
But your confession is too hasty.

592
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,960
Is this all you have?

593
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,600
I didn't have time to prepare for it today.

594
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,450
But next time,

595
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,910
I will find the right time.

596
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,540
Trust me

597
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:32,490
♫A dream within reach♫

599

♫Arises because of you♫

601
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,220
Actually I don't like the big scene

602
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,820
with flowers and candles.

603

♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

604
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,710

♫We♫

606
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,460
I like small warmth

607
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,580

♫Are like hour hands embracing and talking♫

610
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,290
I can receive a small lollipop

643

Mr. Jiang. Mr. Jiang.

644
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,560
Look at my contract.

645
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,780
Fire fighting. Fire fighting.

646
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,739
How many times have I told you?

647
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,540
Why didn't you write it?

648
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,179
Take it back and redo it.

649
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,440
Okay, I'll do it again.

650
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,310
Mr. Jiang, I haven't finished it yet.

651
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,400
This is your fault.

652
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,020
How can you see me more frequently than

653
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,570
meeting He Zhengyu?

654
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,590
I am on my way to work.

655
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,739
I suddenly remembered something,

656
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,020
and I wanted to tell you.

657
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,820
Why are you so serious?

658
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,179
I'm afraid of you now.

659
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,420
If you didn't do anything wrong,

660
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,750
why are you afraid of me?

661
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,950
Anyway,

662
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,740
I hope you don't think that

663
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,090
I'm nosy.

664
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,180
Everything I said

665
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,620
is for you and Jirong.

666
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,520
Don't worry. We're fine.

667
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,860
But for you...

668
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,390
This is your first time in a relationship.

669
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,950
If He Zhengyu wants to bully you,

670
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,740
I will hit him

671
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:13,500
in the way you hit me.

672
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm talking about something very important.

673
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Don't interrupt.

674
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,600
Jirong's brother can work here,

675
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,020
but don't let him take charge of

676
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,350
money or projects.

677
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,650
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

678
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,780
Just listen to me.

679
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,860
I want to give him

680
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,910
some small real estate projects to let him practice,

681
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,310
but he doesn't want them at all.

682
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,580
He said that he didn't know real estate,

683
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,240
so he wanted to start with something he could do.

684
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,240
I see.

685
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,190
I just thought that he changed a lot.

686
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,820
He lived luxuriously

687
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,450
with Jirong before.

688
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,160
Now, he suddenly became an ordinary employee.

689
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,170
I worried if he could accept it,

690
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,430
so I came to remind you.

691
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Don't worry. I'm not a fool.

692
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,660
Go back to work.

693
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,190
Let's go. I'll walk you out.

694
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:00,940
Besides,

695
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,370
don't worry and enjoy your dating.

696
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,220
Did you hear me?

697
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,900
I know, boss.

698
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,900
Did you hear what I said?

699
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,700
Yes.

700
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,500
Do you remember it?

701
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,470
Yes.

702
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,170
Jialan is Shenghao's best friend.

703
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,520
She's just worried about Shenghao.

704
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,330
Nothing else.

705
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,170
Don't think too much.

706
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,190
Anwen, why are you sleeping here?

707
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,590
It's afternoon.

708
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,510
Why are you back?

709
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,840
I had nothing to do,

710
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,480
so I just got some sleep.

711
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,940
You're going to go to work soon.

712
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,740
Can you adjust your schedule?

713
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,160
Yes. I will go to work soon.,

714
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,820
but I haven't gone to work yet.

715
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,060
Anwen, can you not be so casual

716
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,460
in the company?

717
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,590
People will gossip.

718
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,380
What do you mean, Jirong?

719
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,570
Did you

720
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,750
hear anything from someone?

721
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,780
No one said anything.

722
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,220
I just wanted to remind you.

723
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,380
You should be careful with your words and actions at work.

724
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,340
The group companies

725
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,980
are different from the entertainment industry.

726
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,300
Besides, my relationship with Shenghao...

727
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:06,760
Jirong,

728
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,740
did Jiang Shenghao's parents say anything?

729
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,940
I knew it.

730
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,980
The Jiang family has always looked down on us.

731
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,710
They must have said something.

732
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,300
Don't relate everything

733
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
to Shenghao's parents.

734
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,520
No, it's me.

735
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,230
I care about what others think of you and me.

736
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,070
Anwen,

737
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,110
you have to work hard in the company.

738
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,800
Do it for my sake, okay?

739
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,230
OK.

740
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,410
I...

741
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,190
I won't embarrass you.

742
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,590
I will work hard in the company.

743
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,530
Don't worry.

744
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,660
We were hard in the past, and we went through the difficulties.

745
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,860
We will have better lives in the future.

746
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,400
Anwen,

747
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,250
I'm sorry.

748
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,410
I'm in a bad mood today.

749
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,600
Don't say sorry.

750
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Don't worry.

751
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,850
I will work hard

752
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,380
and support you.

753
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,140
[Jialan, I'll go to meet Wu Anwen in 2021 tonight.]

754
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,140
[I will try to get back.]

755
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,850
I'll go to meet

756
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,250
Wu Anwen in 2021 tonight.

757
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,480
I will try to get back.

758
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,990
[I'm out for work. Sorry.]

759
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,710
I'm out for work.

760
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,680
Sorry.

761
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,060
It is late. Why did you come here?

762
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,490
Sit down.

763
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,690
Sit down first before you say anything.

764
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,590
Anwen,

765
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,530
I'll make it short.

766
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,580
I know your gambling debt is over 8 million.

767
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,240
Is it right?

768
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,730
What are you talking about?

769
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,500
I saw your gambling records.

770
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,960
There's more than six million left.

771
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,690
How are you going to pay it back?

772
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,030
We can't hide this for long.

773
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,610
It's useless to rely on you and me alone.

774
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,240
Your only choice

775
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,830
is to tell Jirong

776
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,700
Only she will help you.

777
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,420
If you don't want to say it, I'll say it for you.

778
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:31,850
No.

779
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,530
I can't let Jirong know this.

780
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,610
She should know it.

781
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,360
There's still room

782
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,690
if we tell her now.

783
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,270
If we delay it any longer,

784
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,650
you will make many mistakes.

785
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,940
In the end, you may make some big mistakes

786
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,480
that you haven't expected.

787
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,940
What mistake can I make, Zhengyu?

788
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,820
It's just a debt.

789
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:51,800
I'll pay it back.

790
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,030
I'm thinking of solutions.

791
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,760
It will be fine if I pay the debt.

792
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,970
Yes.

793
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,020
But where can you get the money?

794
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,340
Anwen,

795
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,360
all these years,

796
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,060
I've seen so many families torn apart and people get killed

797
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,650
because of gambling.

798
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,140
Why do you think

799
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,410
you are an exception?

800
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,190
I know I was wrong.

801
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,910
I regret it.

802
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,160
And I haven't been to a casino for over a year.

803
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,310
I know you're worried about me.

804
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:26,430
Well,

805
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,700
I will tell Jirong,

806
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,740
but you have to give me some time.

807
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,020
I need to think about how to say it, right?

808
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,590
Okay, I promise you.

809
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,280
One day is enough.

810
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,620
The place where I'm standing now

811
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,940
is 2000 Wenyu Road.

812
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,560
A few days ago, someone was stabbed.

813
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,900
The criminal has been arrested by the SWAT.

814
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,700
The three injured

815
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,420
were sent to the hospital by an ambulance.

816
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,900
A woman who was slightly injured

817
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,790
has been treated in an ambulance.

818
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,350
All three victims are safe.

819
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,360
Chen Jialan, a journalist from iNEWS,

820
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,790
is reporting on spot.

821
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,380
Sir,

822
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,750
this is the place where it is livestreamed on the phone.

823
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,500
A few days ago,

824
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,490
someone was stabbed.

825
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,940
The criminal has been arrested by the SWAT.

826
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,870
Okay, thank you.

827
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,260
You're welcome.

828
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,190
Keep the change.

829
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,420
Thank you.

830
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,370
Here.

831
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

832
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,980
You are very calm in the live stream today,

833
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,180
and your rhythm is very good.

834
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,710
I'll tell Wen Yiru tomorrow

835
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,920
Ms. Chen

836
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,030
can report alone.

837
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,230
No, Mr. Mu.

838
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,220
I'm flattered.

839
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,880
I need to learn more from you.

840
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,590
Jialan,

841
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,030
actually,

842
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,440
you can just call me by my name.

843
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,590
I don't want to be your teacher.

844
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,630
You are my teacher.

845
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,510
You've always been my teacher.

846
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,390
All right, Mr. Mu.

847
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,380
I'll go home now.

848
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,060
Let's have supper together.

849
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,720
Thank you, but I won't have it.

850
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm leaving. Bye.

851
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,960
Jialan, your umbrella.

852
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:15,970
Give it to me.

853
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,310
Okay.

854
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,050
Jialan.

855
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,290
He Zhengyu?

856
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,360
I thought I wouldn't see you today.

857
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,990
I saw your live stream,

858
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,270
so I came to see you.

859
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,130
Take a walk with me

860
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,860
♫All for love. When I come across you♫

861
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,560
♫Just for love. I am waiting for you♫

862
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,700
♫Go for love♫

863
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:17,340
♫Everything is for love♫

864
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,870
♫It's like something has changed♫

865
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,100
So this is how it feels to walk with a lover.

866
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,220
If I had known I was so happy,

867
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,520
I should have dated earlier.

868
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,490
What are you saying?

869
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,380
I should have confessed my love for you earlier.

870
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,430
We'll go to your place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

871
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,350
And you come to me on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

872
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:42,890
Okay?

873
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:43,980
Sure.

874
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,880
Is there anything you want to do?

875
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,470
We need to make a plan

876
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,000
and finish one every night.

877
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,710
Yes, there are many.

878
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,040
We can...

879
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,240
It's raining.

880
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,720
I have definitely brought an umbrella.

881
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,550
Stop looking for it.

882
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,460
There's a convenience store across the street.

883
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,190
I'll buy one.

884
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,300
No need.

885
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,570
Let's wait here for a while.

886
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,950
Maybe it will stop soon.

887
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,580
No.

888
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,590
When the time-space overlap is over,

889
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,170
I'm afraid you won't have an umbrella to go back.

890
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,420
No, He Zhengyu.

891
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,580
Take it.

892
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:39,510
Hello.

893
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,150
That was the last umbrella.

894
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,500
Hello,

895
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,990
-did anyone come to buy an umbrella? -Hello.

896
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,500
A lot of people came to buy umbrellas.

897
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,030
There were too many people. I can't remember.

898
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,630
Where did he go?

899
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,750
Did he go there?

900
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,300
Did she go to look for me?

901
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:53,480
Jialan.

902
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,040
Jialan!

903
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,500
Jialan!

904
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,200
Jialan!

905
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:22,490
♫A dream within reach♫

906
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,960
♫Arises because of you♫

907
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,220
♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

908
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,640
♫We♫

909
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,450
♫Are like hour hands embracing and talking♫

910
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,890
[Sweet ON]

911
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,890
[Love in Time]

912
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,890
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

913
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,800
It's raining.

914
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,530
[Where is the rain?]

915
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,530
[Where is the rain?]

916
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,430
[Let's cooperate.]

917
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,760
Hide from the rain. Where can we hide from the rain?

918
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,290
[So happy]

919
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,740
Talking is a waste of time.

920
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,120
[The first kiss]

921
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,570
[The second kiss]

922
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,530
[The third kiss]

923
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,870
[Holding tightly]

924
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,090
I'm dizzy because of the kissing.
