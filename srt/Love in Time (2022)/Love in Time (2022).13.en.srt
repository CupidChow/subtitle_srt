Mr. He,

132
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,580
how did you persuade the two parties to reconcile?

133
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,350
It's simple.

134
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,340
Because I know both sides well.

135
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,640
Lanyou's technology

136
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,930
is still far from being put

137
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,930
into production.

138
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,450
But Fan Ke's new technology can.

139
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,650
However, Fan Ke lacks funds,

140
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,260
and he doesn't know about the commercial operation.

141
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,320
So, I convinced Lanyou Technology

142
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,120
to cooperate with Fan Ke in the way of investment and becoming a shareholder.

143
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
Also, they fired Wang.

144
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,940
They've given Fan Ke enough respect.

145
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,250
The reconciliation

146
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,600
is only normal to reach.

147
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,240
I found that

148
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,220
Mr. He is no longer

149
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,720

150
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,100
You seem to be more humane now.

153
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,700
Being a humane lawyer or a legal machine

154
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,420
is meaningless.

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,190

Maybe since you went on a business trip,

175
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,970
it didn't change that fast.

176

Mr. Sun's style has changed today.

this lawsuit.

188

Why?

189
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,360
Obviously, the other party is already weak.

190
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,450
Does the judge make his decision

191
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,190
based on the attorneys' vigor?

192

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,700
how can Jirong live in their family in the future?

245
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,030
So you plan on keeping it a secret forever?

246
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,120
No, I'm trying to find a way.

247
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,970
The two million you lent me.

248
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,580
Someone guided me to buy a stock with it.

249
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,240
What?

250
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,040
Let me show you.

251
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,550
This stock is looking good. See?

252
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,420
I lent you money to pay your gambling debt,

253
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
not to buy stocks.

254
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,490
It has hit daily limit several times.

Sell it to pay the gambling debt right now.

256

Over two million has become nearly four million.

Zhengyu.

258
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,930
I still have over four million.

259
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,540
The money you lent me

260
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,840
is all you have.

261
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,080
Jirong quit the industry.

262
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,650
I have no job and no income.

263
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,770
How can I pay the other millions back?

264
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,040
How can I fill this gap?

265
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,400
Right?

266
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,900
The person who recommended this stock to me

267
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,950
is very reliable.

268
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,380
He promised me that

269
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,210
the stock will hit daily limit at least 20 more times.

270
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,610
Give me two more months.

271
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
One and a half months will do.

272
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,300
If I can't pay the money back,

273
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,380
I will tell Jirong

274
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,330
everything.

275
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,080
OK?

276
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,620
I have no choice.

277
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,260
You don't have other ways

278
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,800
to solve the problem once and for all as well, right?

279
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,730
I can't ask Jirong for money again.

280
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,010
She has quit the industry.

281
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,180
Her savings

282
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,320
are the guarantee of her retirement.

283
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,760
As her brother,

284
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,110
I can't take that money

285
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,290
from my sister.

286
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,810
OK.

287
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:56,840
OK.

00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,010
Thank you, Zhengyu.

289
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,130
Thank you for understanding me.

290
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:00,700
Well...

291
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,410
I'm leaving.

292
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,320
Don't walk me out. Just sit here.

293
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
Let me remind you.

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,700
Be mentally prepared.

295
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:16,920
For what?

296
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,880
For meeting that you from four months later.

297
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,410
Alright.

298
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
I know you're with Chen Jialan.

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,180
Didn't you tell me the day before yesterday

300
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,580
to tell Jirong the truth?

301
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,080
Is there really

302
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,310
another me in this world?

303
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,030
Is there really

304
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,020
another me in this world?

305
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,640
What's wrong, Zhengyu?

306
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,370
Are you okay?

307
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,230
I'm fine. I just had a headache.

308
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,200
Are you hiding something from me?

309
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,590
No.

310
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,950
Where's the two million yuan?

311
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,220
I bought stocks.

312
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,060
I remember showing you.

313
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,010
I've seen this stock.

314
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,330
It's tripled now.

315
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,590
I'm not a fool.

316
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,140
If you invested the entire two million in it,

317
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,400
it's been four months.

318
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,810
Then how much should it be now?

319
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,340
You know better about the due date of the gambling debt than I do.

320
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,240
Why haven't you paid it off yet?

321
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,540
Tell me the truth.

322
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,800
Where did the money go?

323
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,580
You did so much for that money.

324
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,720
You must have embezzled the money.

325
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
You can't fill such a big gap.

326
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,690
Yes.

327
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,080
I met a few friends

328
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,210
who used to play cards with me in Macau.

329
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,310
They opened a new place in the suburbs.

330
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,710
They invited me to go

331
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,340
and gave me a batch of chips for free.

332
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,880
I lost all the free chips.

333
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,840
So I took some more.

334
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,900
They forced me to pay at the scene.

335
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,360
I didn't have other money,

336
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,960
so I sold the stock.

337
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,240
When?

338
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,400
The day when we played cards.

339
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,000
I meant when did you gamble all your money away?

340
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,390
Last December.

341
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,520
Early in December.

342
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,070
Where?

343
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,160
A villa in the suburbs.

344
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
After that, they ran away with the money.

345
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,270
I heard the villa was transformed into a guesthouse.

346
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,020
What do you want me to say?

347
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,580
Did I come to see you today?

348
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,050
It's been two days. Why?

349
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,120
That's a question for you.

350
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,540
I swear.

351
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm loyal to you.

352
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,290
And I don't love Mr. Mu.

353
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,610
This is the gesture for swearing.

354
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,550
No, this is.

355
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,390
Alright.

356
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,160
Just wait.

357
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,920
We will definitely meet.

358
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,000
No matter in which time or space.

359
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,380
By the way,

360
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,190
I almost forgot to tell you.

361
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,470
I met Wu Anwen today.

362
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,800
I may have found a chance

363
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,590
to change everything.

364
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,300
What?

365
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,640
Wu Anwen told me everything today.

366
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,240
Last year,

367
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,650
in December 2021,

368
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,849
he lost several million yuan

369
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,500
in a casino in the suburbs.

370
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,319
If we keep an eye on him now,

371
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,510
and report the illegal casino to the police,

372
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,839
Wu Anwen might be taken away by the police.

373
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,089
You mean

374
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,240
if Wu Anwen is arrested,

375
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,160
he won't be able to play tricks in the middle.

376
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,359
Jirong's marriage and Jirong's death.

377
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,740
Everything that happened will change?

378
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,140
Yes.

379
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,710
If he is convicted of gambling,

380
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,700
he won't be able to get out soon.

381
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,610
He deserves it.

382
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,470
At least he has a chance to turn over a new leaf.

383
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,690
Alright, enough about him.

384
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,290
What are we going to do today?

385
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,790
How about having noodles?

386
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,320
Let's go.

387
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:44,980
Let's go.

388
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,450
Do you think we should eat noodles from 2021

389
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,400
or 2022?

390
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,060
Of course 2022.

391
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,750
This way you won't gain weight.

392
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,000
But I have crab roe noodles in my time.

393
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
Crab roe noodles.

394
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,900
You're giving up on losing weight again?

395
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,830
Seafood won't make me gain weight.

396
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,220
Then crab roe noodles.

397
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,750
Let's go.

398
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,540
What's wrong?

399
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,110
That me from four months ago

400
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,100
is at the door.

401
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,600
What?

402
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,530
I...

403
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,980
No, he...

404
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,450
He is knocking at the door of 2021.

405
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,810
Today, Mu Shiming and Wu Anwen

406
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,940
both went to see him.

407
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,900
He has confirmed

408
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,720
there is another me in the world.

409
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,840
Let him knock.

410
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,500
He's knocking at the door of 2021 anyway.

411
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,430
We can't hear it.

412
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,530
Based on my understanding of myself,

413
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,790
I won't give up easily.

414
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,740
He will definitely find

415
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,330
the back balcony.

416
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,740
Then I'll go stall him

417
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,190
until the time-space overlap is over.

418
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
See you tomorrow.

419
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,090
He just went downstairs.

420
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,520
It takes three minutes

421
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,440
to walk from the door to the back balcony.

422
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,220
So clingy.

423
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,070
Can I go up?

424
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,060
No.

425
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,130
Why?

426
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,860
I think the air out here is fresh.

427
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,340
Are we going to keep talking like this?

428
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,030
Yes.

429
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,670
Isn't it good to talk like this?

430
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,950
I'm afraid it might affect the neighbors.

431
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,750
It's not good.

432
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,910
Then why are you still making a noise?

433
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,570
You knew it would affect us, and you kept on talking.

434
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,370
Stop talking.

435
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,920
You invited me in yourself last time,

436
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,160
but you don't want me to go in this time.

437
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,710
Could it be that

438
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,150
there's a big secret in your house?

439
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,890
It's because you've missed the chance.

440
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,450
What happened last time

441
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,090
is true?

442
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,150
What?

443
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,510
Don't play dumb.

444
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,020
Is that me from four months later

445
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,000
inside right now?

446
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,030
He Zhengyu.

447
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,110
When did you become so addled?

448
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,700
You were quite reasonable before.

449
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,700
I was joking back then.

450
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,280
How about this?

451
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,050
Seeing is believing. Talking without evidence is untrustworthy.

452
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,040
If you really want to know the secret,

453
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,440
go in and check yourself.

454
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,130
I think it's dangerous to climb the stairs.

455
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,590
Let's take the front door.

456
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,080
Where is he?

457
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,540
I don't understand what you're talking about.

458
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,430
I didn't take a good look last time.

459
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,200
This time, I'll make up for it.

460
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,140
This is a lady's room.

461
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,780
Are you done? I'm sleepy.

462
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,320
He Zhengyu.

463
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,910
Where is he?

464
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,320
It's right here. Go find him.

465
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,290
To be honest, I know everything.

466
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,500
That's why I followed him here.

467
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,320
I'll also be honest with you too.

468
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,790
It's already 11 o'clock,

469
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,880
and I need to sleep.

470
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,140
Besides, you've come to this room twice.

471
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,220
Mr. He,

472
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,540
if you don't leave,

473
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,590
I'll really think that you are in love with me

474
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,520
and you are just making up excuses.

475
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,300
How can I be in love with you?

476
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,930
You are not?

477
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,460
That's good. You can go now.

478
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,760
Men and women are different.

479
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,450
Even if it's not a feudal society anymore,

480
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,850
there must be a boundary.

481
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,860
I'll call the police if you don't leave.

482
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,860
Is the coffee okay?

483
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,450
It's good.

484
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,750
-I also drink this kind of black coffee. -Hurry.

485
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,940
How much? I'll transfer the money to you.

486
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,470
Manager.

487
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,110
Will there be many stars

488
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,880
at the Star Awards Ceremony?

489
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,790
Can't you see it on the Internet?

490
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Who can believe what's said online?

491
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,910
Manager,

492
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,510
I saw on Tiktok that

493
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,880
actors there

494
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,320
don't memorize lines.

495
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,210
They only count one, two, three, four, five.

496
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,940
Is that true?

497
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,620
Is there anyone who can breathe?

498
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,460
I'm the property manager here.

499
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,590
Who are you? My coat.

500
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,050
Hurry up.

501
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,100
My pipe is leaking.

502
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,820
I've been complaining in the WeChat group for a whole day.

503
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,280
Why has there been no reply in the group chat?

504
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,660
Aren't you all

505
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,950
alive?

506
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,670
Can't you say a word?

507
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,380
Sir, based on your tone,

508
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,120
it doesn't seem like the pipe leaked.

509
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,990
It's more like your house was robbed.

510
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,070
We have been really

511
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,210
busy today.

512
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,750
It's our fault that we didn't see the message in time.

You're just chit-chatting here.

514
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,500
Busy?

515
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,910
I pay the property fee for eight yuan per square meter.

516
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,500
Your service is not even worth two yuan.

517
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,710
Let me tell you.

518
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,380
If you keep on slacking off like this,

519
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,510
I'll call for a householders' meeting

520
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,740
to fire you.

521
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,640
Dude, just talk about the problem.

522
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,170
Stop pointing your finger.

523
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,500
The water pipe is leaking, right?

524
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,490
We'll send someone right away

525
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,900
to get it fixed for you, okay?

526
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,300
Calm down. Being angry is bad for your health.

527
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,270
I don't even bother to be mad at you.

528
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,980
Manager.

529

You're a good man.

530
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,090
I feel sorry for you

531
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,700
that you have to work here.

532
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,340
Exactly.

533
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,210
As the saying goes, even a shrimp dares to dupe the dragon when it is in the shallow water.

Mr. Wu has experienced a lot, okay?

536
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,170
Is it funny?

537
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,650
If you have time to talk nonsense here,

538
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,690
don't you have time to check the WeChat group?

539

Yes, we do.

540

Don't point your finger at me when you talk next time.

541
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,590
OK.

542
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,180
Contact the handyman and get it done.

543
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:49,940

Mr. He.

546
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,500
You went to my house to block me after work.

547
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,930
And you came to my office again at work?

548
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,040
Are you my fan?

549
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,930
Yesterday at your place,

550
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,850
you tried so hard not to let me in

551
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,860
to prevent me from seeing him, right?

552
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,750
Where did you get this?

553
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,790
This was taken by Jirong that day.

554
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,500
Jirong sent it to me.

555
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,100
There are many more.

556
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,860
Now I believe in the time-space overlap.

557
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,350
Tell me.

558

I want to know everything.

559
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,290
You didn't believe me when I told you.

560
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,170
Now you believe me even if I don't tell you.

561
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,280
Why are you so fickle?

562
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,380
Now I believe it.

563
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,180
Ms. Wen.

564
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,260
Meeting now?

565
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,380
I'm downstairs.

566
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,550
I'll be right there.

567

He Zhengyu.

568
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,100
What should we do?

569
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,260
He saw the photo of us

570
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,450
sent by Jirong.

571
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,440
You know yourself best.

572
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,190
I've seen what you can do

573
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,990
to get to the root

574
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,160
of the matter.

575
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,830
I got lucky and escaped today.

576
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,420
What should I do in the future?

577
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,340
Don't hide it if we can't.

578
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,460
Tell him.

579

Tell him everything?

Talk about Jirong first.

581
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,900
Right.

582
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,780
I can ask the old Zhengyu to tell Jirong

583
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,640
about Wu Anwen's gambling debts.

584
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,080
Let me think.

585

No.

586

No, no, no.

587
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,340
I've been to 2021

588
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,230
to see Wu Anwen.

589
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,840
If that me from four months ago come out now

590
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,690
to meddle with things,

591
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,850
based on his personality,

592
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,960
he'll get even with Wu Anwen immediately.

593
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,760
I'm afraid

594
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,860
Wu Anwen will do something impulsive immediately.

595
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
Are you sure?

596
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,500
We know exactly what has changed

597
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,830
in the past four months.

598
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,540
All we need to do now is to wait until December.

599
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,660
When Wu Anwen

600

gambles again,

601
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,980
we'll report it to the police.

602
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,580
That will change the future.

603
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,420
As for saving Jirong,

604
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,780
leave it to us.

605
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,270
What should I tell him then?

00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,940

607
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,020

608

about our relationship.

Should I tell him that?

612
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,290
It's so embarrassing.

613

I just want him to envy me.

614
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,000

615

be like,

"You?"

"How could I fall in love with a girl like you?"

619

No, don't laugh.

Don't laugh.

It's my fault.

735
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,860
I asked her to do the interview late at night.

736
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,270
And that place was so remote.

737
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,160
There's even no CCTV there.

738
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,740
I shouldn't have asked her to go.

739
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,430
She had already got off work,

740
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,830

Why was the access card not working?

748
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,180
He Zhengyu.

749
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,140
Do you know the biggest difference

750
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,200
between you and the other He Zhengyu?

751
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,980
What is it?

752
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,150
He likes to disappear and you like to appear suddenly.

753
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,790
It sounds like I'm better.

754
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,390
Hey.

755
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,740
Can you stop being so spontaneous every time?

756
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,260
It's late at night.

757
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,730
Are you trying to scare me to death?

758
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,250
At least give me a call.

759
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,410
I called you several times.

760
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,610
I couldn't reach you.

761
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,900
Time-space overlap.

762
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,880
Can you tell me about it now?

763
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,690
What's in it for me?

764
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,900
I can give you the chance

765
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,560
to interview me exclusively.

766
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,970
That's the punishment, then.

767
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,300
What about the benefit?

768
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,470
The other He Zhengyu

769
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,400
wouldn't treat girls like you do.

770
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,490
Environment builds personality.

771
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,730
Who knows

772
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,110
what kind of life he's living now.

773
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,510
Don't say that about him.

774
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,560
Fine.

775
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,950
It's not a big deal.

776
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,340
Your apartment and mine

777
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,100
merge together each night

778
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,100
just like this.

779
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,830
The overlapping time is 46 minutes.

780
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,820
The two selves

781
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,080
can't meet each other.

782
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,170
Otherwise, if we meet once, time and space will collapse once.

783
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,960
You two have met twice.

784
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,190
Time and space have collapsed twice.

785
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,250
It's not a big deal?

786
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,600
We're used to it.

787
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,330
The two of us

788
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,380
have been in the same space twice?

789
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,660
Yes.

790
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,620
The first time was when I invited you to my house

791
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,850
to watch the time-space overlap.

792
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,350
But it didn't happen.

793
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,340
The second time was when we followed Wu Anwen.

794
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,540
But the you from four months later also went there.

795
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,940
So,

796
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,730
the two of you can't be together.

797
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,550
Understand?

798
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,890
Anything else?

799
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,240
What's else...

800
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,340
He told me not to tell you.

801
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,840
You two seem to be

802
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,860
very close.

803
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,550
Anyway,

804
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,560
we've had great dates.

805
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,290
What do you mean

806
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,370
by having great "dates"?

807
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,570
You two...

808
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,470
Why are you hiding?

809
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,850
I'm dating the He Zhengyu from four months later,

810
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,660
not you.

811
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,190
Dating you?

812
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,740
Is my taste that bad？

813
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,240
Is my taste that bad?

814
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,340
No image.

815
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,730
How could I fall in love with someone like you?

816
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,010
Chen Jialan, stop laughing.

817
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,810
Wait for me.

818
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,360
Are you done laughing?

819
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,020
Chen Jialan.

820
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,340
Why does he live here?

821
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:15,960
I mean,

822
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,890
I can't possibly live in a place like this.

823
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,210
Something must have happened.

824
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,090
How would I know?

825
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,150
Maybe it's

826
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,380
fate.

827
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,130
Nonsense.

828
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,780
How could I let you...

829
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,630
How could I let a girl

830
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,470
live in such a remote place with me?

831
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,810
Alright, I'm leaving.

832
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,330
I'm going back to our slum.

833
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,080
Bye.

834
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,910
If the time-space overlap collapses,

835
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,860
is there any other way to contact?

836
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,590
I don't know.

837
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,140
It seems Jialan's accident happened here.

838
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,700
I think I've been here before.

839
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,030
Jialan's accident happened on January 7.

840
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,080
That was the night of the trial court of Jirong's divorce case.

841
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,990
You can't say that, Jirong.

842
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,940
The evidence can prove

843
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,860
there's been marital infidelity within marriage.

844
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,200
The evidence is fake. I want to withdraw my accusation.

845
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,930
-I'm done. -I don't know why Chen Kexin said that.

846
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:48,160
So...

847
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,790
That night,

848
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,990
that person was Jialan.

849
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,300
It was Jialan.
