the investigation of the recent well-publicized

40

sexual harassment in the workplace at Gao's Group,

41
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,670

Ms. Zhang, the person involved in the incident,

and her lawyer

44
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,220
have brought new evidence

45
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,150
to the police station.

46
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,150
They are out now.

47
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
I'll interview them.

48
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,180
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

49
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,540
It is said that you have submitted

50
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,090
new evidence to the police.

51
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,659
Yes.

52
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,470
Can you tell us what the new evidence is?

53
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,570
We can't reveal this yet.

54
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,050
But I'm sure

55
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,140
the evidence this time

56
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,060
will prove my client's innocence.

57
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,060
As for the details,

58
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,240
we need to wait for further investigation.

59
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,330
So please wait patiently.

60
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,510

62
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,790
Zhengyu.

63
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,060
Don't worry.

64
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,860
This is what the Lawyers Association wants.

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,780
I really have no choice.

66
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,780
The Lawyers Association

67
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,420
received evidence

68
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,530
from a man named Meng Jianguo.

69
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,180
He seems to be Gao Ming's driver.

70
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,820
The evidence shows that

71
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,800
you bribed Gao Ming through this driver and conspired with him.

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,520
So the Lawyers Association issued a notice

73
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,110
to investigate whether you have

74
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,710
improper exchange of interests with Gao Ming.

75
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,000
In order to prevent information leakage,

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you'd better not enter your office.

77
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,580
Why did you receive the notice

78
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,410
before me?

79
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,420
Ask the Law Association.

80
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,350
How would I know?

81
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,820
The notice should arrive soon.

82
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,570
Zhengyu,

83
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,300
there are posts denouncing you

84
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,560
all over the Internet.

85
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,670
I immediately

86
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,680
issued an official statement to support you

87
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,360
in the name of Fengyu Law Firm.

88
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,340
But the influence of the public opinion

89
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,700
about Zhang Xiaojiang is too big.

90
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,110
Many netizens said

91
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,330
they will boycott Fengyu because they hate her.

92
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:27,780
Also.

93
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,260
You paid the forum posters yourself, right?

94
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,690
What do you mean?

95
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,650
I paid people to smear you and smear myself?

96
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,290
No.

97
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,220
Someone will come out soon

98
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,500
and urge not to hurt the innocent.

99
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
Their hate can't hurt us.

100
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,420
Fengyu is also a victim.

101
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,190
Here.

102
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,970
Zhengyu,

103
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,330
since you weren't here this morning,

104
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,930
you may not know many things.

105
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,930
A dozen clients have come to us

106
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,670
to terminate cooperation.

107
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,090
I said sorry to them.

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,530
I paid them the compensation.

109
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,890
I almost knelt to them.

110
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,300
How long do you think you can

111
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,960
keep your deal with Gao Ming under wraps?

112
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,850
Mr. Sun,

113
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,610
your trick didn't work.

114
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,930
He Zhengyu didn't fall for it.

115
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,510
You almost sold me out!

116
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,460
It shouldn't be.

117
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,540
He Zhengyu cares about his parents the most.

118
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,100
Why was he so calm this time?

119
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,400
What's the use of saying this now?

120
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
You need to find a way as soon as possible.

121
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,050
I know.

122
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,300
Actually.

123
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,080
There are many ways

124
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,360
to take down He Zhengyu

125
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,130
and have his law license revoked.

126
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,330
Let me think about it.

127
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,260
We can say he charged both the plaintiff and the defendant.

128
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,460
According to the law,

129
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,930
he'll be finished.

130
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,370
What do you mean?

131
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,420
Look.

132
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,970
He Zhengyu has been in contact with your people recently.

133
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,300
This is how he solicited bribes.

134
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,570
You only need to deposit the money

135
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,860
into He Zhengyu's account in your name

136
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,820
or in the name of the people around you

137
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,500
who have contact with him.

138
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,340
The rest is to report him.

139
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,770
Mr. Sun.

140
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,500
I see.

141
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,540
It seems that I'm only a pawn

142
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,620
you'll use to bring down He Zhengyu.

143
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,690
The enemy of your enemy is your friend.

144
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,340
It's teamwork

145
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,790
and win-win.

146
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,590
How can you say it like that?

147
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,840
Do you have any conscience?

148
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,200
I can tell you clearly that

149
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,850
I've never met Gao Ming.

150
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,360
You know better yourself.

151
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,710
Zhengyu,

152
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,460
the negative impact on our law firm

153
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,180
is already there.

154
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,300
Economy loss is secondary.

155
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,130
The loss of clients is the most important.

156
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,100
Clients are the foundation of a law firm!

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,780
Zhengyu,

158
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,200
I'll give you a long break.

159
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,690
Cooperate with the investigation.

160
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,580
It's good for everyone.

161
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,980
Sun Defeng, what do you mean?

162
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,390
Everyone here knows

163
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,700
90% of our clients

164
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,480
are here for Mr. He.

165
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,210
You have no right to speak here.

166
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,110
If the Lawyers Association investigates,

167
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,740
I will do my best to cooperate.

168
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,420
My personal belongings are insiDec.

169
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,220
Is it illegal for me to take them?

170
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:41,530
Hello?

171
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,780
Is it Mr. He Zhengyu?

172
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,220
Yes.

This is Fuxing Lawyers Association.

174
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,910
We need your cooperation.

175
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,280
OK.

176
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,140
He Zhengyu,

177
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,900
a failure in lawyers

178
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,460
and a hypocritical KOL lawyer,

179
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,810
claims he will only do things in the name of justice.

180
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,220
It’s 2021.

181
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,980
There are still such evil lawyers

182
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,780
who earn dirty money against their conscience.

183
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,460
Isn't he afraid of being punished?

184
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,960
Coming.

185
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,100
Hello.

186
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,960
Why are you here?

187
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,600
I saw you being attacked by netizens on the trending tab,

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,800
so I came to visit you.

189
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm not as fragile as you think.

190
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,940
[Dajun]

191
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,610
Come in.

192
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,860
Shoes.

193
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,500
No need to change your shoes.

194
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,620
Sit.

195
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,060
Hello, Dajun.

196
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,760
Brother.

197
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,780
Zhang Hui came to work today.

198
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:30,750
Okay.

199
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,950
What's wrong?

200
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,710
Zhang Hui is back at Fengyu.

201
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,100
Looks like Zhang Hui and Sun Defeng

202
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,920
are sure that I can't find any evidence.

203
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,200
If they are still safe,

204
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
does it prove that

205
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,560
you really took the money?

206
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,260
It's not presumed like that in law.

207
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,960
But for the time being,

208
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,710
I can't find any evidence of their collusion.

209
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,270
In that case, let's use the discord-sowing stratagem.

210
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,800
Brother.

211
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,860
Zhang Hui came to work today.

212
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,460
But for the time being,

213
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,340
I can't find any evidence of their collusion.

214
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,400
In that case, let's use the discord-sowing stratagem.

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,450
Oh no.

216
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,950
Is Jialan going to meet Sun Defeng?

217
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,910
Wait for me. I need to receive a fax.

218
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,950
Pour yourself some water.

219
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,320
Go ahead.

220
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,270
I have something to do. I have to go.

221
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,870
[Apr. 12th, 2022]

222
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,970
It's because of me.

223
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,180
Jialan went to Sun Defeng because of me.

224
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,420
That wasn't an accident.

225
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,590
It's Sun Defeng.

226
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,110
Dajun.

227
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,360
Help me check.

228
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,980
Since Dec 12th last year,

229
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,410
has there been any abnormal activity for all the vehicles

230
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,530
under Sun De Feng's name?

231
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,330
Repair, compensation, change.

232
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,400
All of these.

233
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,860
Hello.

234
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,420
Here are the flowers for Ms. Zhang Hui.

235
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,350
Leave them to me.

236
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,760
No, we have a rule.

237
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,240
They must be signed by her.

238
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,720
Hui, your delivery.

239
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,970
Ms. Zhang Hui.

240
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,090
These are the 99 roses

241
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,390
Mr. Sun Defeng specially picked for you.

242
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,830
Hope your love will last forever

243
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,980
and enjoy happiness and prosperity.

244
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,980
Please sign here.

245
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,930
You must be mistaken.

246
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,590
I didn't order these flowers.

247
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,050
Of course not.

248
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,680
Mr. Sun Defeng ordered them.

249
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,940
He specially picked these roses for you.

250
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,510
What are you talking about?

251
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,450
Mr. Sun and I

252
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,170
are just colleagues.

253
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,820
If you keep talking nonsense,

254
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,070
I'll call the police.

255
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,170
What's going on? What's going on?

256
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:45,870
Mr. Sun.

257
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
She insisted that you ordered the flowers.

258
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,560
Chen Jialan.

259
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,870
What are you doing here?

260
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm here to send flowers to Ms. Zhang Hui.

261
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,590
You've framed He Zhengyu together.

262
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,130
Are you going to

263
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,970
announce your relationship next?

264
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,590
Is your speech planned?

265
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,420
Because you exposed He Zhengyu's bribery together,

266
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,360
then you realized you had the same view

267
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,610
and share the same goal.

268
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,410
So you plan to spend the rest of you lives together.

269
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,960
I'm here to congratulate you.

270
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,870
Nonsense!

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll say it again.

272
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,050
Ms. Zhang Hui and I

273
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,680
are just colleagues.

274
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,950
Chen Jialan,

275
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,720
if you keep messing around,

276
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,640
just wait for the court summons.

277
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,710
You have to take legal responsibility

278
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,060
for spreading rumors.

279
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,220
That's right.

280
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,100
People who make illegal acts

281
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,850
will eventually take legal responsibility.

282
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,760
So I'm here today to tell you

283
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,540
your conspiracy to frame He Zhengyu

284
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,530
won't succeed.

285
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,860
You fabricated evidence and framed him.

286
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,680
As a lawyer,

287
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,930
you should know better what this crime is.

288
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,720
I hope

289
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,050
your relationship won't be defeated by reality

290
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,450
and you can win over disputes on interests.

291
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,400
Brother.

292
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,640
The cars under Sun Defeng's name

293
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,060
have never been repaired, sold or changed.

294
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,780
None of them.

295
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,510
Are you sure?

296
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,460
Yes.

297
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,060
But I found that the bumper of Zhang Hui's car

298
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,660
was changed at the 4S store

299
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,380
on Dec. 14th last year.

300
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,080
Okay, I got it.

301
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,300
Long time no see.

302
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,850
How have you been?

303
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,690
I'm fine. What's the matter?

304
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,790
Sun Defeng.

305
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,870
If you have a chance to make up for your mistake,

306
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,130
you would do it, right?

307
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,850
I don't understand what you're talking about.

308
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,450
Sorry, I need to see a client.

309
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,110
Chen Jialan is not dead.

310
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:05,940
Yes.

311
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,270
You're right.

312
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,230
Chen Jialan is not dead.

313
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,620
Hello, everyone.

314
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,060
Welcome to the video of

315
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,590
Chen Jialan and He Zhengyu.

316
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,700
We are now at the highest place in Fuxing.

317
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,500
It is a very high place.

318
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,260
I recorded this video

319
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,470
with Chen Jialan

320
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,850
a few days ago.

321
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,530
I'm a lawyer.

322
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,140
Are you trying to scare me with a pieced-together video?

323
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,060
The night of Dec. 12th last year,

324
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,210
it was you

325
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,610
who hit Chen Jialan with Zhang Hui's car.

326
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,940
Don't try to slander me.

327
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,290
I've got the maintenance record of this car.

328
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,700
If I told you

329
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,370
Chen Jialan could survive that night,

330
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,120
and you can also not be a murderer.

331
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,020
Everything can go back to how it used to be.

332
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,800
Are you crazy?

333
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,930
It seems like you have to see it to believe it.

334
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,930
See you at my home at 10 tonight.

335
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,890
You'll understand everything then.

336
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,660
If you don't come,

337
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,860
I'll call the police.

338
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,600
Just say it.

339
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,140
Come in.

340
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,760
Have a seat.

341
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:18,910
Can you tell me now?

342
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,040
No hurry.

343
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,670
Almost.

344
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,079
What?

345
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,369
Time.

346
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,680
What are you doing?

347
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,190
Are you doing magic for me?

348
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,140
Follow me.

349
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,210
No.

350
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,200
What are you doing?

351
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,480
Don't you want to know

352
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,370
why Chen Jialan appeared in 2022?

353
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,450
Follow me.

354
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,290
This is Probe & Investigation.

355
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,260
I'm Mu Shiming.

356
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,700
Today is

357
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Dec. 11th, 2021.

358
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,900
The Fuxing Municipal Government

359
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
signed a cooperation agreement

360
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,620
with Fengyang Investment Co., Ltd.

361
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,420
That means...

362
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,800
What did you do?

363
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,390
What did you do?

364
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,900
I didn't do anything.

365
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,690
I just brought you to 2021.

366
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,090
2...

367
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,590
Excuse me.

368
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,890
Is it 2022 now?

369
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,000
No, it's 2021.

370
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,930
No, to...

371
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,960
May I ask

372
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,870
when is it now?

373
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,270
About 10.

374
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,400
What year is it?

375
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,070
2021.

376
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,690
Are you crazy?

377
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,080
I...

378
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,690
[Dec. 11th, 2021]

379

[10:21:09 p.m.]

380
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,470

381
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,740
2021.

382
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,950
Zhengyu.

383
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:23,790
Jialan.

384
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,030
I can't be with you tonight.

385
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,110
I have an urgent case to deal with.

386
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,630
[Jialan, I can't be with you tonight. I have an urgent case to deal with.]

387
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,350
A case?

388
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,740
Why today?

389
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,930
When time and space overlap...

390
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,570
Sun Defeng,

391
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,490
Tell me the truth.

392
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,090
How did Chen Jialan die?

393
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,670
Tomorrow is

394
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,850
Dec. 12th, 2021.

395
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,090
This is the last chance

396
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,400
to save Jialan.

397
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,020
If she doesn't come back to life tomorrow,

398
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,890
I'll send you to jail myself.

399
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,490
[Dec. 11th, 2021]

400
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,780
That day...

401
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
You've framed He Zhengyu together.

402
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,410
Are you going to...

403
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,760
Miss Zhang Hui and I

404
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,270
are just colleagues.

405
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,960
After Chen Jialan left...

406
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:11,950
Stop the car.

407
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,980
Zhang Hui started to suspect me.

408
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,380
Why does Chen Jialan know everything?

409
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,470
What's wrong?

410
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,170
I just want to know

411
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,850
how Chen Jialan knew our plan.

412
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,480
How would I know?

413
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,740
You were there too.

414
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
Didn't you see it?

415
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,520
Now I know

416
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,730
I was used as a gun.

417
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,210
You told me to lie, and I did.

418
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,840
I posted it on Weibo.

419
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,250
Now it's done.

420
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,710
He Zhengyu was kicked out.

421
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,060
You want to kick me out too?

422
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,320
I...

423
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,250
You made Chen Jialan cause trouble.

424
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,310
Who knows what your relationship is?

425
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,580
I've been waiting for

426
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,660
a proposal.

427
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,310
I'm so pathetic.

428
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,940
Chen Jialan is He Zhengyu's girlfriend.

429
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,260
Don't think too much.

430
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,700
How did He Zhengyu's girlfriend

431
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,910
know what we said in bed?

432
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,340
You promised me

433
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,650
that you'll announce our relationship once it's done.

434
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,400
But now,

435
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,520
Chen Jialan did it for us.

436
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
You denied it.

437
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,040
How dare you say there's nothing between you two?

438
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,640
All right.

439
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,030
He Zhengyu is cunning.

440
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,010
How would I know

441
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,330
where he got the news?

442
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,800
Chen Jialan came here to cause trouble.

443
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,060
Maybe he was behind it.

444
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,550
He Zhengyu is so scary.

445
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,100
I can't keep him by my siDec.

446
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,110
Hui.

447
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,640
You'll be the wife of Fengyu's boss in the future.

448
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,420
You need to be able to stand the storm, okay?

449
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,550
If you want to prove yourself,

450
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,730
you can reveal our relationship tomorrow.

451
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,530
Say that we're getting married.

452
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,330
If we make it public now,

453
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,780
will it prove that

454
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,370
what Chen Jialan said is true?

455
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,760
If we make it public now,

456
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,330
will it means that

457
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,660
we framed He Zhengyu?

458
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,830
Hui, don't worry.

459
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,250
I'll ask Chen Jialan tomorrow.

460
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,540
I'll do it when I find out the details.

461
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,230
How would I know then that

462
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,260
time and space could overlap?

463
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,690
I believed that you must have tapped me.

464
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,320
So I decided

465
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,770
to find Chen Jialan the next day

466
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,550
and get to the bottom of it.

467
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,500
Since you suspected me,

468
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,560
why did you go to Chen Jialan?

469
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,220
I think she's a girl.

470
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,410
It's more convenient to ask her.

471
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,110
Sun Defeng.

472
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,080

That day,

475
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,000
I asked Chen Jialan

to a remote place

477
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,290
and found two hooligans

478
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,830
to get there early.

He Zhengyu, where have you been?

482
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,950
Didn't you say there was a case?

483
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,380
There is no one in Yuchen.

I want to talk to you in detail.

504
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:01,660
Okay.

505
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,470

the whole thing from her.

509
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,920
But I didn't expect that she knows martial arts.

510
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,720
Two men were no match for her.

511
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,860
So I watched her run away.

512
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,560
But unexpectedly,

513
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,490
she came back.

00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,450
She came back to look for those glasses.

515
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,530
She ran away.

516
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,540
Why did she come back

517
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,500
to pick up those glasses?

518
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,380
Those glasses?

519
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,800
It must be a hidden camera.

520
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,300
I can't let her take it away.

521
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,460
So, I just drove...

522
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,030
I...

523
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,660
I went after her with the car.

524
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,520
She happened to be on the road

525
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,410
crossing the street.

526
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,780
I only had one thought.

527
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,620
I couldn't let her go. I...

528
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,500
I...

529
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,800
Tell me the time and place.

530
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,600
Tell me everything.

531
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,270
Jialan.

532
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,650
I won't let anything happen to you.

533
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,950
[2022]

534
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,740
I won't.

535
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,380
[2021]

536
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,200
Why are you here?

537
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,180
I have nothing to do today.

538
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,760
I want to treat you to a meal.

539
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,040
I have an interview today. Maybe another day.

540
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,190
I'll go with you.

541
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,300
Don't worry. I promise.

542
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,800
I won't disturb you.

543
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,890
He Zhengyu.

544
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,060
My interview today is very important.

545
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,190
Don't make trouble.

546
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,300
For me,

547
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,410
the most important thing today is you.

548
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,810
You have your own choice.

549
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,170
But neither me nor him

550
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,330
will let it happen.

551
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,310
He Zhengyu.

552
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,580
Can you stop arguing?

553
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,600
Since the beginning,

554
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,790
we've been a pin against an awl.

555
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,420
Today is the last day.

556
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,150
Stop arguing.

557
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:14,300
[Dec. 12th, 2021]

558
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:14,300
[10:15 p.m.]

559
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,320
Chen Jialan.

560
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,680
You're a little late.

561
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,810
How could it be you?

562
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,480
This is a conflict between us.

563
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,610
Just the two of us.

564
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,770
Don't get other innocent people involved.

565
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,480
Where are you going?

566
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,110
You've been following me all day.

567
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,720
You followed me during my interview.

568
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,980
Am I interrupting you?

569
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,280
You followed me when I was trying on clothes.

570
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,620
You guarded the door of the fitting room.

571
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,350
If I didn't keep an eye on you, you would have run away.

572
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,590
This is harassment.

573
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,710
No.

574
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,820
Also,

575
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,510
didn't we agree not to argue?

576
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,630
Today is actually quite fulfilling.

577
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,530
I finally understand

578
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,860
your schedule for a day.

579
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,370
I'm tired. I'm really tired.

580
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,560
Aren't you tired?

581
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,490
Stop dawdling.

582
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,690
I have an appointment. I have to go.

583
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,290
Stay with me a little longer.

584
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,890
Cancel the appointment.

585
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,480
I'm going to see He Zhengyu.

586
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,200
It's time to overlap.

587
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,900
I'm going to meet my boyfriend.

588
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,050
There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

589
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,180
There won't be anything in the future.

590
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,380
Did you collude with him?

591
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,420
He asked you to watch me?

592
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,210
No.

593
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,980
If I need his reminder,

594
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,210
am I still He Zhengyu?

595
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,820
Did he know

596
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm going to see Sun Defeng today?

597
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,270
Did you know it too?

598
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,370
The person you want to see is Sun Defeng?

599
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,020
Chen Jialan, are you crazy?

600
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,090
I'm here with you today

601
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,860
to prevent you from seeing Sun Defeng.

602
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,910
You can't see him.

603
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,900
Does he know

604
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,270
what I'm going to do today?

605
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,900
Where is he?

606
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,480
Did he go to see Sun Defeng?

607
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:05,860
You're right.

608
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,180
The reason we grew apart is

609
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,420
you.

610
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,240
Wait.

611
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,430
First of all, I admit that you are capable.

612
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,190
You've never lost a case.

613
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,430
You won the lawsuit. You gained a great reputation.

614
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,090
There is no problem with that.

615
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,330
But with your arrogance,

616
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,110
how many people have you offended?

617
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,290
I have to say sorry to

618
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,910
the people you offended

619
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,420
one by one.

620
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,600
Do you know all these?

621
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,140
I know.

622
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:45,890
And I always remember

623
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,920
you chose me.

624
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,340
You chose me

625
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,360
to be the partner of Fengyu Law Firm.

626
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,610
That's exactly why

627
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,660
I put all my energy

628
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,120
on the cases.

629
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,100
I want to work hard

630
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,870
to make Fengyu Law Firm bigger,

631
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,250
to prove to those

632
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,000
who didn't think highly of us,

633
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,230
to prove to you that

634
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,650
your choice was right.

635
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,720
Are you showing it to me?

636
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,800
All the clients of Fengyu

637
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,900
came for you.

638
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,160
What am I then?

639
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,140
I became

640
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,620
a decoration of the law firm.

641
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,420
I just need to be there.

642
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,540
Who else will listen to me?

643
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,770
Will you listen to me?

644
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,030
You won't.

645
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,410
Don't forget

646
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,730
in such a short few years,

647
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,780
you've grown from a small lawyer

648
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,920
to a popular lawyer.

649
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:49,860
Whom should you thank?

650
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,030
Me.

651
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,880
You! Let go! Let go of me!

652
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,140
He Zhengyu.

653
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,820
Don't do anything stupid.

654
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,730
Go home and wait for me, okay?

655
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,570
He Zhengyu!

656
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,460
Let go of me!

657
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,320
Chen Jialan.

658
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,739
Don't be headstrong.

659
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,239
He Zhengyu.

660
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,980
I decide my fate.

661
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,489
This is my fate.

662
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,409
Let go!

663
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,780
You can't handle it.

664
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,090
If you were hit by a car just now,

665
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,639
would you think you're the only one who hurts?

666
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,900
He hurts more than you.

667
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,150
Why are you so selfish?

668
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,820
Do you think he's the only one who hurts?

669
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,900
I don't feel hurt?

670
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,440
He'll be in trouble if he goes to Sun Defeng.

671
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,060
Do you think I don't feel pain?

672
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:40,909
I hurt more.

673
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,199
But I have no choice.

674
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,969
I have to protect you.

675
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,260
I don't know what will happen in the future.

676
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,960
I don't know if I should say it.

677
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:53,380
But I'm afraid it'll be too late if I don't say it.

678
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,110
Chen Jialan.

679
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,929
I fell in love with you too.

680
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,460
Seeing you in a coma in the hospital bed,

681
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,230
I knew you were hit by a car.

682
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,110
And that day,

683
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,720
you didn't come back the whole night.

684
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:10,860
I feel

685
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,250
hurt too.

686
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,640
Chen Jialan.

687
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,310
Aren't you that evil lawyer?

688
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,510
How dare you come out?

689
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,720
You think I'm in your way

690
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,440
and stole your thunder.

691
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,630
You even framed me

692
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,710
just to kick me out of Fengyu.

693
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,150
Yes.

694
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,160
I just want to drag you down

695
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,660
from the altar

696
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,010
so that you can have a taste of

697
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,370
being trampled on by others.

698
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,240
Because only in this way

699
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
will I feel great.

700
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,420
If I'm being unreasonable

701
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,620
and hurt you all these years,

702
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,140
I'm here.

703
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,450
I apologize.

704
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,770
But you

705
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,950
you can't keep making mistakes.

706
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,020
I'm sorry.

707
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,530
I'm sorry.

708
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,430
I don't understand what you're talking about.

709
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,440
I have no time to waste with you.

710
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,880
Sun Defeng,

711
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,350
when will you turn back?

712
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,540
In order to avoid the responsibility of framing me,

713
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,640
you pushed Zhang Hui out

714
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
to take the blame.

715
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,310
There is also the thing about Gao Ming.

716
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,220
His indecent assault conviction is now a fact.

717
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,250
Do you really think

718
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,350
he will protect you in front of the police?

719
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,520
Are you threatening me?

720
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Threatening you?

721
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,840
If I wanted to threaten you,

722
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,750
I wouldn't be here today.

723
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,710
I just want to take this opportunity

724
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,970
to make it clear to you.

725
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,080
As long as you're willing to get lost,

726
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,210
I can let go of

727
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,400
you framing me.

728
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,700
But more importantly,

729
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,570
I have to stop you from making more serious mistakes.

730
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,140
As for

731
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,500
whether we can go back to the past,

732
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,310
I hope we both can be

733
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,590
better and better.

734
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:26,140
As for whether we will continue our cooperation

735
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,080
in the future,

736
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,510
I'm fine with anything.

737
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,340
We can sit down

738
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,150
and talk.

739
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,530
Calm down.

740
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,570
Finally, I want to thank you.

741
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,400
Yes.

742
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,530
Without you,

743
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,730
I'll not be the He Zhengyu today.

744
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,440
Excuse me.

745
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,920
He Zhengyu is not an evil lawyer.

746
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,720
He didn't collude with Gao Ming.

747
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,160
After he found the evidence of

748
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,140
Gao Ming molesting Zhang Xiaojiang,

749
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,840
he submitted it to the police immediately.

750
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,290
He was also a victim.

751
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,000
To stop him

752
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,560
from taking Zhang Xiaojiang's case,

753
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,380
Gao Ming joined forces with Sun Defeng and Zhang Hui

754
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,250
from Fengyu Law Firm.

755
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,860
They set him up together.

756
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,290
I really didn't want to do anything to her.

757
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,350
I just want to figure out what happened.

758
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:29,770
I...

759
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,620
Forget it.

760
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,890
Since you said so,

761
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,560
this matter

762
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,780
is over.

763
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,110
I'll get going then.

764
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,450
[Dec. 12th, 2021]

765
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,450
[10:42 p.m.]

766
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,540
Why is he here?

767
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,430
Why can I see him?

768
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,340
Why didn't the time and space collapse?

769
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,560
It's moving out of the apartment from today on.

770
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,370
Try it.

771
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,040
I won't let you go today.

772
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,540
Are you jealous?

773
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,010
Do you like me secretly?

774
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,780
He Zhengyu, I love you.

775
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,630
You don't like it when I eat Liuzhou river snails rice noodles, right?

776
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,890
If I don't like it, you will eating it?

777
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,220
So this is how it feels to walk with a lover.

778
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,100
We'll grow old together.

779
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,500
We agreed to be together.

780
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,630
No one is allowed to leave first.

781
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,340
This is the future in my heart.

782
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,470
Jialan, I love you.

783
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,800
I love you too.

784
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,740
Because of me, Jialan went to Sun Defeng.

785
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,800
Tell me the time and place

786
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,690
Tell me everything.

787
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:51,380
Are you okay?

788
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,550
No. 206, Changfeng Street, Jiudianliang Road.

789
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,160
How do you know this address?

790
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,520
Why do I suddenly have

791
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,650
all of his memories?

792
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,400
What happened to him?

793
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,070
Sun Defeng's phone is still off.

794
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,260
Are you okay?

795
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,740
He Zhengyu.

796
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,990
Why are you here all of a sudden?

797
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,560
Did the other He Zhengyu contact you?

798
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,360
Say something!

799
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,140
He Zhengyu!

800
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,900
He Zhengyu.

801
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,490
Did the other He Zhengyu contact you?

802
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,110
So that you can have a taste of

803
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:01,700
I apologize.

804
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,090
being trampled on by others.

805
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,030
Because only in this way

806
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,550
will I feel great.

807
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,930
What's wrong with you?

808
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,800
Stop looking for Chen Jialan.

809
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,150
It's over.

810
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,160
Do you have a headache? Let's go to the hospital.

811
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,240
He Zhengyu.

812
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,720
Say something.

813
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,840
What's wrong with you?

814
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,350
Why are you here?

815
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,110
Did you think of something?

816
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:41,690
He...

817
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,240
He Zhengyu.

818
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,850
What are you looking for?

819
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,850
Why are you here?

820
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:07,830
He Zhengyu.

821
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,060
Did the He Zhengyu from four months later contact you?

822
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,680
Did he?

823
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,690
Say something!

824
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,070
He Zhengyu, say something!

825
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,220
It's Dec. 13th.

826
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:08,900
I'm not dead.

827
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,040
I'm still alive.

828
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,510
I'm not dead.

829
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,470
But...

830
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,070
But it means

831
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,410
someone's entropy increased, right?

832
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:38,880
No.

833
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,360
This is 2021.

834
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,620
He is in 2022.

835
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,030
Nothing bad will happen.

836
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,480
If something happens,

837
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,080
the time-space overlap will collapse, right?

838
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:55,890
Jialan.

839
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,240
I want to go home.

840
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,380
I want to go home and wait for him.

841
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,310
There are 22 hours left.

842
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:05,810
Jialan.

843
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,350
At 10:06,

844
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,340
he would appear on the sofa at home.

845
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,390
He'll be there waiting for me to hug him.

846
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,020
Jialan.

847
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,540
Don't follow me.

848
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,650
Don't be the third wheel.

849
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:35,180
♫A dream within reach♫

850
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:34,450
He Zhengyu, where are you?

851
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:39,350
♫Arises because of you♫

852
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,630
He Zhengyu.

853
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,970
♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

854
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,490
I really don't have time.

855
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,710
