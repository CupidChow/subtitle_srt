4
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,480
-Ghost! -Ghost!

5
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,910
Why can't it be locked?

6
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,180
No, this is my home.

7
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,640
This pervert is in my room.

8
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,550
This pervert came to my house with wine?

9
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,380
I...

10
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,180
Come out, you pervert.

11
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,770
Hocus Pocus.

12
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,640
Hocus Pocus.

13
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,010
Where is he?

14
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,950
Where is he?

15
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,820
Where can this person go?

16
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,720
And you are?

17
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,460
Young lady.

18
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,630
I beg of you.

19
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,420
Can you pay attention to the hallway hygiene?

20
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,270
You young people love to order takeout

21
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,010
and express delivery.

22
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,300
The hallway will be extremely dirty if I don't clean it even for one day.

23
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,670
Cleaning is hard work.

24
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,690
Grandma. Grandma.

25
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,610
Don't worry.

26
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,660
Are you mistaken?

27
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,540
I never put takeouts or deliveries in the hallway.

28
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,420
Impossible.

29
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,650
You're still young.

30
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,360
You shouldn't be lying.

31
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,220
I...

32
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,300
Forget it.

33
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,670
Just this once.

34
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,860
Let me tell you something.

35
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,820
You should pay more attention to the hallway hygiene in the future,

36
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,700
otherwise I'll fall out.

37
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,110
These young girls...

38
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,790
Zhengyu,

39
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,730
can we make another excuse?

40
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,140
I really can't say ghost.

41
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,940
As sure as a gun.

42
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,080
I even touched it.

43
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,510
Can I not tell the difference

44
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,100
between illusionary and real touch?

45
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,350
Is it possible that

46
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,880
it's immersive illusion?

47
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,720
You asked me to come

48
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,290
to see you two bicker?

49
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,840
Uncle.

50
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,920
Last night,

51
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,410
I met a woman

52
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
who was neither human nor ghost.

53
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
She has long hair.

54
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,400
Suddenly, she was lying on top of me,

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,330
pressing my hand

56
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,840
and touching my face.

57
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,620
Uncle.

58
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,450
Please take a moment to recall.

59
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,400
Former tenant

60
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,130
or your relatives, friends or anyone.

61
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,530
Who can possibly come in?

62
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,610
No.

63
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,970
This house is rented for the first time,

64
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,900
and you were the only one who ever rented it.

65
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,300
I changed the lock cylinder

66
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,120
on the day we signed the contract.

67
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,570
For the sake of safety,

68
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,870
I bought the most expensive one,

69
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,060
a class C lock cylinder.

70
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,860
-Uncle, you... -I remember now.

71
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,780
I have seen you on TV.

72
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,450
You are that lawyer.

73
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,450
Mr. He.

74
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,600
You are good at making up stories.

75
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,750
That thing...

76
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,580
Forget it.

77
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,000
I really saw it last night.

78
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,740
All right.

79
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,860
I have been kind enough

80
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,780
to rent my house to you at such a low price.

81
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,740
Whatever you say today is useless.

82
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,680
That girl is in her early twenties.

83
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,260
She is skinny,

84
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,310
not short

85
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,580
and fair-skinned.

86
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,260
If something is broken, I can get someone to fix it for you.

87
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,310
Now you say there is someone in the room.

88
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,100
I didn't allow this person in.

89
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,900
Call the property management office or the police.

90
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,010
Go to the person in charge of this.

91
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,980
How about you give me a new room?

92
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,440
You have to pay more money.

93
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,810
I don't have more money.

94
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,900
Young man,

95
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,670
why are you so unreasonable?

96
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,180
Your present house is the cheapest.

97
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,400
Uncle.

98
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,670
Did you have a previous tenant like this?

99
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,230
No.

100
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,870
Mr. He.

101
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,700
You must have been drinking last night.

102
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,300
And you drank a lot.

103
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,630
You were so drunk to have lost your memory.

104
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,620
Hello.

105
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,420
You want to see the house, right?

106
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,350
-Uncle. -Uncle.

107
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,050
I muted my phone, so I missed your call.

108
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,000
Em...

109
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,140
I'll be right down. I'll be right down.

110
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,840
Wait for me.

111
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,310
-There must be a ghost. -There must be a ghost.

112
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,700
Based on my years of experience as a lawyer,

113
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,460
he's lying.

114
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,420
I saw it without experience.

115
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,409
So this girl

116
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,600
is a tenant who lived here before.

117
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,760
She's not short.

118
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,630
She's fair-skinned.

119
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,380
She has strong hands.

120
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,620
What's wrong?

121
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,630
This house is so worth it, Zhengyu.

122
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,290
Where's my phone?

123
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,210
Why...

124
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,570
Why am I running?

125
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
This is my home.

126
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,970
You pervert.

127
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,220
It's bad enough that you slept in my bed.

128
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,540
Now you are taking a shower in my house.

129
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,950
Why don't you just move here?

130
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,430
I did move here.

131
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,300
What do you mean? Why are you so unreasonable?

132
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,230
I'm telling you.

133
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,900
If you take one more step forward,

134
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,420
don't blame me for being rude.

135
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,370
Try it.

136
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,010
I'm warning you once.

137
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,630
Warn... warn...

138
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,970
Warning you twice.

139
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,700
Three times.

140
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,460
Why is there no signal?

141
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,100
Pervert, I'm telling you.

142
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,300
I'm a reporter.

143
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,740
I can write about you.

144
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,000
You just hit me.

145
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,770
You should write about that.

146
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,480
Write!

147
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,950
If you are really a reporter,

148
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,610
then you should know.

149
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,440
According to the provisions of Paragraph 1 of Article 245

150
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,560
of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,

151
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,620
your behavior has constituted the crime of unlawful intrusion.

152
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,180
How can a pervert like you know the law?

153
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,730
A little.

154
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,780
And I know if you don't leave now,

155
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,580
you will face up to three years in prison

156
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,420
or criminal detention.

157
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,100
And

158
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,540
if you continue to be violent to me,

159
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,810
I can also charge you with intentional infliction of bodily harm.

160
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,140
Prolonged illness makes a doctor of a patient.

161
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,820
You know the legal terms by heart.

162
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,820
I, with no talent,

163
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,580
happen to be a lawyer.

164
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,940
You trespassed and knowingly violated the law.

165
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,480
Do you know you will face harsher punishment?

166
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,060
Trespassing?

167
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,800
I rented this house.

168
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,580
You're the one trespassing.

169
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,140
I rented this house.

170
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,370
-You rented this house? -You rented this house?

171
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,500
How can it be? Nonsense!

172
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,620
You...

173
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,350
OK. OK. OK.

174
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,700
Let's stop quarreling.

175
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,090
Since I am a lawyer

176
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,990
and you claim to be a reporter,

177
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,830
then let's talk about the facts.

178
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,090
Take out the evidence.

179
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,110
My rental contract is in the study.

180
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,570
I can show it to you now.

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,400
You...

182
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,300
Found the problem?

183
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,740
Your rent.

184
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,540
Why is it so much cheaper than me?

185
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,810
Is this the point?

186
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,930
The landlord's signatures are the same.

187
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,870
The contents of the contracts are all the same.

188
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,940
The only differences are

189
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,460
the lessees, the signing dates

190
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,330
and the rent.

191
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,220
Look.

192
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,940
Your signing date

193
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,270
is July 26th, 2021.

194
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,900
My signing date

195
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,200
is January 13th, 2022.

196
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,470
So it's obvious that you are...

197
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,660
So it's obvious that

198
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,340
in order to make more money,

199
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,100
in the duration of my lease,

200
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,940
the landlord signed a contract with you for next year.

201
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,660
And with such low rent,

202
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,760
a greedy person like you

203
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,630
clicked with the greedy landlord,

204
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,630
and signed the contract right away.

205
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,160
OK, I'm out of luck.

206
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,940
But at least at the moment,

207
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,140
this house is mine.

208
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,740
You made something out of nothing.

209
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,060
You still have the nerve to say that you are a reporter.

210
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,370
We're talking about the house.

211
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,220
What does it have to do with my job?

212
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,140
And what about you?

213
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,260
Such unreasonable argument.

214
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,310
Is this what a lawyer should do?

215
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,110
Let me show you.

216
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,370
Today is

217
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,680
September 16th, 2021.

218
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,180
Take your future agreement

219
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
and go out.

220
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,240
Buy a new phone, Sister.

221
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,400
There is no signal.

222
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,260
The time on the phone is synchronized with the internet.

223
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,060
It can't be changed at all.

224
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,720
Have a look.

225
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,740
Look, all the things on this table are mine.

226
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,180
A picture of me and my dad.

227
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,200
And this doll is also mine.

228
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,090
These are my medals.

229
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:07,540
Look.

230
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,690
And also

231
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,050
Everything on this wall is mine.

232
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,020
This is the trophy of youth championship I won.

233
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,450
[Certificate of Honor]

234
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,450
[Golden Lawyer]

235
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,180
What is this?

236
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,110
This is mine.

237
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,750
You are really a lawyer?

238
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,350
Is this the point?

239
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,010
The point is that you live in my home now.

240
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,220
What's all this?

241
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,540
What is this?

242
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,460
When did you move in?

243
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,090
So many boxes.

244
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,460
Why didn't I pay attention?

245
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,920
How can you pay attention?

246
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,190
You don't pay attention to your behavior.

247
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,890
And you don't pay attention to your personal hygiene.

248
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,100
For snacks like this,

249
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,290
if you opened it, you should throw it away in time.

250
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,410
Otherwise, cockroaches will gather.

251
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,540
How can you not know this common sense?

252
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,540
This is still edible.

253
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,970
Really!

254
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,240
I see.

255
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,700
What?

256
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,310
You have psychogenic amnesia.

257
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,110
What?

258
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,190
It is a cognitive disorder.

259
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,780
You may have experienced

260
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,530
big frustration or trauma.

261
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,630
Your mind developed defense mechanisms.

262
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,680
So there is a state of selective amnesia.

263
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,040
Even if you were right.

264
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,900
What does it have to do with

265
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,640
our present situation?

266
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,710
Of course.

267
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,260
I once handled a criminal case.

268
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,270
My client had the same mental illness as you.

269
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,800
She killed her ex-husband.

270
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,790
Because she thought her ex-husband

271
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,319
went behind her back to find a mistress.

272
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,829
But the truth is

273
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,480
they have already divorced.

274
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,170
So...

275
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,490
You should be...

276
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,020
You should be injured here,

277
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,319
and lost part of memory.

278
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,980
So you feel that you still lived in the past.

279
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,040
I understand it now.

280
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,190
Are you beating around the bush to scold me?

281
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,600
Four months ago,

282
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,070
you did live here.

283
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,150
But you moved away because of your mental illness.

284
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,910
In your cognition,

285
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,450
you still live here.

286
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,450
So you move here every night.

287
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,340
The landlord was afraid that

288
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,580
you might affect the rental of the house.

289
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,980
So when I asked him,

290
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,540
he stammered.

291
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,160
And it is also because of you,

292
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,680
my rent

293
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,310
is cheaper than yours.

294
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,350
It all makes sense now.

295
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,370
What a lawyer's mouth!

296
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,910
I've seen enough.

297
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,940
After listening to your nonsense,

298
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,510
I really thought I was sick.

299
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,350
Miss,

300
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,240
you should go see a doctor.

301
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,470
There is a psychiatrist I have known for many years,

302
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,500
with excellent medical skills.

303
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,630
I can introduce you.

304
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,470
Then why didn't he cure you?

305
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,320
Fine.

306
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,310
Legally,

307
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,600
if there is a dispute between two people,

308
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,010
a third party is needed to judge.

309
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,520
Judge, let someone judge.

310
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,770
Let's do it tomorrow.

311
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,720
We don't have to wait until tomorrow. Follow me.

312
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,360
What?

313
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,210
Where are you going?

314
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,550
What are you doing?

315
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,940
The neighbor will solve the problem.

316
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,890
They know.

317
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,460
Crazy.

318
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,350
This Grandma is bad-tempered.

319
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,810
She just spoke to me.

320
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,060
That's even better.

321
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,590
They know more than others.

322
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,070
Hello, grandpa.

323
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,520
I want to ask you.

324
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,710
Do you know her?

325
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,610
Isn't this the young lady upstairs?

326
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,520
Yes.

327
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,630
I haven't seen you for a long time.

328
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,620
You moved back?

329
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,190
Move back?

330
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,140
Grandpa, I...

331
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,580
I have always lived here.

332
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,090
Where's Grandma?

333
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,950
She's not here.

334
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,720
She went back to her parents' last month.

335
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,370
Last month?

336
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,130
But I... I just spoke with her yesterday.

337
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,760
I... I...

338
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,380
All right.

339
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,110
I'm really sorry.

340
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,060
Sorry to have bothered you.

341
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,740
Rest early.

342
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,140
No, no.

343
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,540
Let me talk to grandpa...

344
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,370
Don't talk yet.

345
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,330
I'm a little confused.

346
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,600
He has Alzheimer's.

347

Occasional time-space overlap

426
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,980

Continuous time-space overlap happens

wormhole-like effect,

At this time, she and her things will appear

520
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,560
and be mixed with my stuff.

521
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,940
Don't mention

522
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,300
how messy it is!

523
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,300
She is simply a

524
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,170
epitome of dirty mess.

525
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,950
Fortunately, this situation

526
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,580
will end at 10:52 every day.

527
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,640
What are you doing?

528
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,520
You are not sick.

529
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,510
You should read less of these books.

530
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,440
Be careful that knowledge will change your destiny.

531
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,850
Don't believe me, do you?

532
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,970
Look it up if you don't believe me.

533
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,970
She's a reporter named Chen Jialan.

534
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,740
Chen Jialan, right?

535
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,840
Talk as if it were true.

536
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,260
Yes, that's her.

537
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,120
Didn't expect

538
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,310
she's quite cute.

539
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm telling you.

540
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,930
Don't be fooled by her appearance.

541
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,560
Is this you?

542
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,820
It is me.

543
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,690
She's been to our law firm. When?

544
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,690
September 18th.

545
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,530
Four months ago

546
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,460
You should've have it delivered.

547
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,680
You made a special trip.

548
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,780
It's on the way anyway.

549
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,700
Just think of it as saving the company money.

550
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,110
Bye.

551
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,140
Bye.

552
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,750
I'm sorry.

553
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,930
Mr. He,

554
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,000
this is the material sent by client iNEWS.

555
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,950
There are some more at the front desk.

556
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,210
Please sign together.

557
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,570
I remember.

558
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,710
She went to our law firm four months ago.

559
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,940
And she stepped on my shoe that day.

560
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,340
She...

561
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:54,890
Bye.

562
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,140
I'm sorry.

563
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,340
Mr. He,

564
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,410
this is the material sent by client iNEWS.

565
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,600
He Zhengyu.

566
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,780
How can you be here?

567
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,610
Do I know you?

568
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,220
You really are a lawyer.

569
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,810
You two-faced man!

570
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,290
You sneak into other people's house.

571
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,220
Eat, drink and sleep.

572
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,850
Damage other people's property and block my keyhole.

573
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,920
You have done all the bad things.

574
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,630
Now you are here pretending to have amnesia.

575
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,740
Are you suffering from

576
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,000
psychogenic amnesia?

577
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,740
You mistook one for another.

578
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,790
You shouldn't be here.

579
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,130
You should go to the psychiatric department.

580
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,740
Since you know

581
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,250
what psychogenic amnesia is.

582
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:29,890
There is...

583
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,570
There is a psychiatrist you have known for many years,

584
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,500
with excellent medical skills.

585
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,520
Go to the psychiatrist

586
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,920
and have yourself cured.

587
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,430
It's terrible.

588
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,780
You should've thrown your own phone.

589
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,040
Why did you throw mine?

590
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,970
I did see her once four months ago.

591
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,060
But just now

592
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
I remember two different versions.

593
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,970
That memory

594
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,030
seemed to have been updated suddenly.

595
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,730
It's terrible.

596
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,430
What happened on the same day

597
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,750
now have two different versions of memory.

598
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,650
So it's foolproof.

599
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,190
Here we go.

600
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,410
It's amazing.

601
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,760
Have a good look.

602
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,220
She's not here again.

603
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,660
You still have the courage to come.

604
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,320
Today I let you have no return.

605
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,920
A gentleman uses his tongue, not his fists.

606
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,660
Do you know that?

607
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,260
No.

608
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,540
He Zhengyu.

609
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,720
You said you don't know me.

610
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,800
I'll let you know me now.

611
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,840
Let me explain.

612
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,810
You kicked it.

613
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,440
You can't blame me.

614
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,660
Can you listen to my explanation now?

615
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,140
Don't sit on my sofa.

616
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,200
Stay away.

617
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,700
Is here all right?

618
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,530
There are three books I bought on the table.

619
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,840
Don't think you can please me by giving me books.

620
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,970
Who is pleasing you?

621
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,430
I'm lending them to you.

622
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,800
Think calmly first.

623
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,060
Why does this space

624
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,350
have your things and my things?

625
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,150
And they are all mixed together.

626
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,850
Because you moved here early.

627
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,950
You occupied my place.

628
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,350
You...

629
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,880
You just saw.

630
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,010
I suddenly appeared there.

631
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,580
The reason I asked you to read those books

632
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,020
is that the books mentions that

633
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,060
time is not as linear as we think.

634
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,760
Rather it is discrete.

635
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,670
It may overlap, return,

636
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,640
or merge.

637
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,460
I'll show you.

638
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,020
Sit down.

639
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,320
Get away from me

640
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,410
I can still knock you down with one leg.

641
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,710
Simply and directly,

642
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,470
time-space overlap happened in this apartment.

643
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,330
You said I had psychogenic amnesia.

644
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,500
Now you're talking about time-space overlap.

645
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,050
Will you tell me next time that

646
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,180
you are Doraemon?

647
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,780
You came out from the drawer.

648
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,430
That's my phone.

649
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,290
Just now at 10:05,

650
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,410
I recorded a video with my phone.

651
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,590
I recorded the whole process of time-space overlap.

652
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,590
If you don't believe me, just see it.

653
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,980
How is this possible?

654
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,800
This is impossible.

655
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,430
You didn't come last night.

656
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,650
I did.

657
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,180
You blocked the door.

658
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,700
You are a reporter.

659
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,160
Can you be a good listener?

660
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,000
You weren't here last night.

661
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,220
I carefully observed the time-space overlap.

662
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,880
Neither of us is mentally ill.

663
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,340
I can also be sure that

664
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,320
time-space overlap begins at 10:06

665
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,670
and ends at 10:52 every night.

666
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,740
Time-space overlap.

667
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:23,710
Yes.

668
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,440
Suppose...

669
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,230
Suppose

670
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,850
this is this apartment four months ago.

671
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,040
And

672
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,380
this is the apartment where I am now.

673
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,060
Every night at 10:06,

674
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,380
for some reason...

675
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,380
What reason?

676
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:45,450
Didn't you put a note in your room to remind you

677
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,240
not to ask such silly questions?

678
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,840
Why did you get into my study?

679
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,090
That's my study, too.

680
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,410
And it's there.

681
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
I can't gouge my eyeballs off, can I?

682
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,770
Not important, not important.

683
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,900
None of these matters.

684
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,700
In short, every night at 10:06.

685
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,140
These two apartments will overlap

686
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,510
like this.

687
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,380
You mean to say that

688
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,770
in these forty something minutes

689
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,860
this place is yours

690
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,170
and mine.

691
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,760
Clever.

692
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,740
But I have to correct you.

693
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,740
This apartment is mine.

694
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:21,980
Why?

695
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,170
Didn't you say that

696
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,400
time and space merged the two apartments?

697
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,170
Because, the merged apartment

698
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,630
is in 2022 where I am,

699
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,790
not 2021, four months ago,

700
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,160
where you are.

701
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,530
So that is why I couldn't open the door last night.

702
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,270
I see.

703
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,460
During time-space overlap,

704
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,960
people from 2021

705
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,020
can't get into this apartment,

706
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,880
which also verified my theory.

707
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,950
This apartment is mine.

708
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,370
What makes you so sure?

709
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,840
Can you walk now?

710
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,030
Isn't it opened in Cctober?

711
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,410
Precisely, the end of last October.

712
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,350
[Sweet ON]

713

[Was that me?]

720
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,910
[Not me.]

721
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,410
and your future contract

722
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,420
go out.

723
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,700
[Here you go.]

00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,380

OK, done, done.
