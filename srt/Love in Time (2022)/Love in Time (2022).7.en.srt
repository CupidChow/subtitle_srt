4
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,780
Mr. Zhang.

5
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,960
Thank you.

6
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:52,920
Yes.

7
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,350
I'm at the rehearsal of Jirong's wedding.

8
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,650
Terminate the contract?

9
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,979
But, Mr. Zhang...

10
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,860
You see,

11
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,380
Jirong has been working with your brand

12
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,540
for a few years, right?

13
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,210
Although she's getting married,

14
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,270
it won't affect...

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,680
Hello?

16
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,110
Hello, Mr. Zhang...

17
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,670
Mr. Ma.

18
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,740
Mr. Ma, listen to me.

19
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,500
Jirong is married,

20
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,390
but she hasn't had any kids.

21
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,740
And she has no plan to do that.

22
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,310
So she...

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,460
Jirong.

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,020
I hope you can get more love

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,280
after you get married.

26
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,340
I'm not talking about the love you get

27
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,270
as a star.

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,100
Anwen and I are really happy for you.

29
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,829
We really wish you happiness.

30
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,430
Don't worry. I'll be happy.

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,660
Shenghao.

32
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,510
I forgot what I wanted to say.

33
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,120
Zhengyu.

34
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,460
You don't have to say anything.

35
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,560
I know what you want to say.

36
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,290
Don't worry.

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,940
I will treat Jirong well.

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,640
Anwen, you are back.

39
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,440
Anwen.

40
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,100
I think you should go through

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,360
the process yourself.

42
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,140
You look so beautiful today.

43
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,570
After you get married,

44
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,470
whenever you feel wronged,

45
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,070
no matter who is right or wrong,

46
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,200
and whether it makes sense or not,

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,660
let me know immediately.

48
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,730
I will show up by your side

49
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,340
and protect you.

50
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,000
Got it?

51
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,920
Jiang Shenghao.

52
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,380
I never really liked you.

53
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,180
You know that.

54
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,670
But my sister likes you,

55
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,270
which is enough.

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,960
After you get married,

57
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,070
I hope you don't speak loudly to her,

58
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,630
don't reject any of her requests,

59
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,760
and don't hurt her.

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,170
Otherwise, I'll get even with you.

61
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,400
Remember that.

62
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,460
Brother, stop scaring him.

63
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,990
Shenghao won't do me wrong.

64
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,159
The wedding is not until tomorrow,

65
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,220
but you are already on his side today.

66
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,610
Alright.

67
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,590
Marrying my sister

68
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,060
is the reward you get from the good deeds you did in your previous life.

69
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,790
Cherish her.

70
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,140
You are right.

71
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,210
Anwen.

72
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,540
You used to take care of Jirong.

73
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,010
Now let me protect her.

74
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm really grateful that I can marry Jirong.

75
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,160
Don't worry, brother.

76
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,930
What a warm and touching scene.

77
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,460
Now, the bride and groom, please step to the center of the stage.

78
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,070
This is the happiest and sweetest moment

79
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,940
of my life.

80
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,500
In the future, we will have

81
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,650
a happy and sweet life together.

82
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,190
Jirong.

83
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,740
I hope we can treat each other in a naive and nice way,

84
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,060
like kids.

85
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,210
And I hope we can love each other instinctively,

86
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,590
like parents.

87
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,960
I will love you forever,

88
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,890
and be loyal to you forever.

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,330
Chen Jialan.

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,300
Why are you crying?

91
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Why are you crying on my wedding day?

92
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,590
Sorry, I'm just so touched.

93
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,740
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

94
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,980
Let's take a break

95
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,860
and get changed.

96
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,120
We'll take a group photo together later.

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,570
Brother, what did you say to me?

98
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,110
Miss Wu,

99
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,220
this is your wedding dress.

100
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,260
We cleaned it up for you.

101
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,580
Okay. Thank you.

102
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,730
Thank you.

103
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,350
You're welcome.

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,850
All the clients of the brands you endorse

105
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,260
called me just now.

106
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,730
Brother, look.

107
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,260
The new dress I changed for.

108
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,190
Does it go well with this lipstick?

109
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,430
It looks good.

110
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,600
This is it then.

111
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,210
They said you're married now,

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,020
and your identity isn't in line with

113
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,240
the content of their brands' promotion anymore.

114
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,900
And they all want to terminate the cooperation.

115
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,980
I understand.

116
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,060
After all, I get married all of a sudden,

117
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,620
and I'm not single anymore.

118
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,960
I also lost a lot of fans.

119
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,340
What they did is out of business consideration.

120
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,670
It's normal. It's okay.

121
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,550
Are you really going to stop working completely

122
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,880
after getting married?

123
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,300
Why are you so silly, Jirong?

124
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,000
You said you wanted to get married.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't stop you.

126
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,440
I know that in your heart,

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,540
happiness is the most important thing.

128
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,280
But career and marriage

129
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,640
are not contradictory.

130
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,100
You are quitting the industry completely just to get married.

131
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,159
Is that necessary?

132
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,300
I want to take a break

133
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,050
and change my lifestyle.

134
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,500
Isn't it also great

135
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,830
to take care of my husband and kids at home?

136
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,620
Brother, didn't you tell me that

137
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,620
my happiness is the most important?

138
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,360
Fine.

139
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,770
Since this is your decision,

140
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,240
I respect it.

141
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,150
Jirong.

142
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,850
In that case,

143
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,360
I hope you can ask Jiang Shenghao

144
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,159
to sign the marriage agreement.

145
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,190
It can at least give you basic protection.

146
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,610
I'm marrying Shenghao

147
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,540
not for his identity or money.

148
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,980
It's not that we want his identity

149
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,500
or money now, Jirong.

150
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,720
You are blinded by love,

151
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,870
but I can't go nuts together with you.

152
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,520
Jiang Shenghao is obedient to you for now,

153
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,650
but he used to be a playboy.

154
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,020
How can you be sure that

155
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,550
he will be loyal to you after getting married?

156
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,040
If he really does something wrong,

157
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,820
with the marriage agreement,

158
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
at least you won't lose everything.

159
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,880
Think about it.

160
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,490
If you leave the entertainment industry for a few years,

161
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,750
and have a child,

162
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,890
even if you want to make a comeback later,

163
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,150
who will remember you?

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,340
Brother, can we stop talking about this?

165
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,740
You haven't get changed, have you?

166
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,810
Go get changed. Hurry.

167
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,060
Wu Jirong.

168
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,020
Take what I said seriously.

169
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
For your own good.

170
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,730
Smile.

171
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,320
Lift your dress like this.

172
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,760
Okay.

173
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,400
This looks good.

174
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,060

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,320
that wedding was taken as a joke.

348
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,360
After they got married, Jiang Shenghao betrayed Wu Jirong.

349
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,620
Jirong suffered from depression

350
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,880
and was hospitalized.

351
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,950
Until now.

352
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,530
Jirong...

353
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,480
What about Jiang Shenghao?

354
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,220
What happened to him

355
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,810
after Jirong's accident?

356
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,210
I only saw him once.

357
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:16,330
He was taken away by the police for investigation.

358
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,640
Why?

359
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,780
Because they believe Jirong's death was a murder.

360
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,930
Jiang Shenghao was listed as the prime suspect.

361
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,060
So he was taken away.

362
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,820
Impossible.

363
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,970
This is ridiculous.

364
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,540
Jiang Shenghao loves Jirong so much.

365
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,540
There's no way he would kill Jirong.

366
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,580
Jialan.

367
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,210
Jialan, where are you going?

368
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,900
Jialan!

369
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,810
Calm down.

370
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,420
The police station is so far away.

371
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,060
And the time-space overlap is about to end.

372
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,140
You can't make it.

373
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,480
How do you know if you don't try?

374
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,140
Chen Jialan, calm down.

375
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,650
Rat grew up together with me.

376
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,290
I know him well.

377
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,340
He would never kill anyone.

378
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,070
He would never kill Jirong.

379
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,520
He Zhengyu.

380
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,250
You're a lawyer.

381
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,200
Can you help him, please?

382
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,860
Jiang Shenghao has been taken away by the police

383
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,090
for the investigation.

384
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,420
Let's wait for news from the police, okay?

385
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,770
Do you think Rat killed Jirong?

386
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,510
Listen to me calmly.

387
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,630
Jirong was found dead in the swimming pool at midnight.

388
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,020
There are only two possibilities,

389
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,220
homicide or suicide.

390
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,060
Besides, no matter how silly Jirong was,

391
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,260
she wouldn't have gone to the swimming pool in the middle of the night.

392
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,120
And I know her.

393
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,490
She was a good swimmer.

394
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,510
So you just want to say that

395
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,660
you still suspect Jiang Shenghao.

396
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,210
Before evidence is found,

397
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,760
everyone is a suspect.

398
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,670
I'm not saying Jiang Shenghao is the murderer,

399
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,100
but there must be a reason why the police took him away.

400
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,640
Then show me the evidence.

401
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,020
If Jiang Shenghao is the murderer,

402
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,890
I'll send him to prison myself.

403
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,380
But before that,

404
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,040
please be objective.

405
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,230
Hello?

406
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,830
Yes, this is He Zhengyu.

407
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:04,970
OK.

408
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,540
I will do my best to cooperate with the investigation.

409
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,630
Us too.

410
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,740
Come on.

411
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,090
Three, two, one.

412
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,060
Higher.

413
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,860
Hello.

414
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,580
Are you from the bride's family?

415
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,460
This is not bad.

416
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,040
This way, please.

417
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,390
Jialan.

418
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:43,850
Jialan.

419
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,300
Let's block the door.

420
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:45,830
Let's go.

421
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,710
Come on.

422
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,420
I understand.

423
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,020
Red packets.

424
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,210
Everyone has it.

425
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
Jirong is dead.

426
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,650
What about Jiang Shenghao?

427
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,460
Jirong's death was believed to be a murder.

428
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,140
Jiang Shenghao was listed as the prime suspect

429
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,160
and got taken away.

430
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,920
Impossible.

431
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,200
This is ridiculous.

432
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,400
Jiang Shenghao loves Jirong so much.

433
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,480
There's no way he would kill Jirong.

434
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,920
Found it!

435
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,200
Jirong.

436
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,540
Jirong.

437
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,220
Rat, Jirong.

438
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,830
I don't know what the truth is

439
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,860
about what will happen in four month.

440
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,140
As your friend,

441
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,140
I just want to protect

442
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,580
your happiness now.

443
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,080
I won't let Chen Kexin ruin it.

444
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,020
The wedding venue is really well decorated.

445
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,420
Please forgive me for not taking good care of you.

446
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,020
Excuse me.

447
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,620
Jialan.

448
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,620
Excuse me.

449
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,300
Have you seen Chen Kexin?

450
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,090
Chen Kexin?

451
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,410
I didn't invite her.

452
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,820
Why haven't you gotten changed yet?

453
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,700
What I'm telling you now is very important.

454
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
I'll go and block her at the door.

455
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,930
Don't let her in.

456
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,750
If you see her,

457
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,840
call me right away.

458
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,580
What's going on?

459
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,090
Jialan.

460
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,590
Congratulations.

461
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,750
Thank you.

462
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,830
Sorry for not taking good care of you.

463
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,460
Sir, I'm sorry.

464
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,620
There are too many people attending the wedding today.

465
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,100
The parking space in the front is full.

466
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,370
You can park at the back door.

467
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,620
There's parking space at the back door too.

468
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,530
Okay, thank you.

469
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,660
There's a back door.

470
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,350
I need to find another person to help.

471
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,400
He Zhengyu.

472
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,110
Why aren't you in?

473
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,380
Have you ever seen

474
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,610
a wedding where there are even number of groomsmen

475
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,650
and odd number of bridesmaids?

476
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,840
If one is missing, it's better to make it even by missing two.

477
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,600
Good.

478
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,610
Do me a favor.

479
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,860
Block the front door.

480
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,420
If Chen Kexin comes,

481
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,460
you must stop her.

482
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,500
Don't let her in.

483
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,030
She's here to make trouble.

484
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,910
Who told you that?

485
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
She told you herself?

486
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,500
I don't have time to explain.

487
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
You have to help me.

488
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,360
No matter what.

489
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,380
Okay, no problem.

490
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,100
How about this?

491
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,460
I'll add you on WeChat.

492
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,700
If you don't want to do it yourself,

493
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,540
at least inform me.

494
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,260
Let me know as soon as you see Chen Kexin.

495
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,390
I'll be right there.

496
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,180
Thank you.

497
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,420
Coming.

498
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,910
Where's Chen Kexin?

499
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,880
She went in.

500
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,430
Didn't I tell you to stop her?

501
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,630
Our agreement is

502
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,700
to inform you immediately.

503
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,050
Wait.

504
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,670
Chen Jialan, what are you doing?

505
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,770
I know what you want to do.

506
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,500
I won't let you get away with it.

507
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,710
What can I do?

508
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,870
I'm just here to give them a red packet.

509
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,760
Don't lie to me.

510
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,860
What's going on?

511
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,940
What's that noise?

512
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,050
What are the two girls doing?

513
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
They're arguing.

514
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
What are you doing?

515
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,640
I'm just giving a red packet to my ex-boyfriend.

516
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,900
Does it have anything to do with you?

517
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,860
Of course.

518
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,390
Just give me the red packet.

519
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,440
Chen Jialan, let go of me!

520
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,120
Chen Kexin, stop messing around.

521
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,600
Chen Jialan.

522
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,240
Let go.

523
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm just here to give them a red packet.

524
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,620
I've already let it go.

525
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,030
I wish them all the best.

526
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,780
Hey, who are you lying to?

527
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,260
Don't push me.

528
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:04,820
You...

529
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:08,890
Let go of me!

530
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,100
Looks like another couple is getting married too.

531
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,140
It's double the happiness today.

532
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,860
Congratulations.

533
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,840
They look great together.

534
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,320
Yes.

535
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,100
Why are you still here?

536
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,770
Miss Chen, right?

537
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,140
It's my sister's wedding today.

538
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,570
If you're here to congratulate her,

539
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,370
I welcome you.

540
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,220
But if you're here to make trouble,

541
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,680
you may not be able to bear the consequences.

542
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,300
Next, let's welcome the bride to make her love declaration.

543
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,770
OK.

544
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,160
What are you doing?

545
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,020
Let go.

546
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,340
Stupid teammate.

547
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,160
You're crazy.

548
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,580
If you had stopped Chen Kexin at the door,

549
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,950
nothing would have happened.

550
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,410
I wouldn't have been considered a mad woman.

551
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
So embarrassing.

552
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,540
It's good that you know it's embarrassing.

553
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,500
You are always pert,

554
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,060
and think people in a malicious way.

555
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,930
But this is a wedding. And you are still acting this way.

556
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,860
What do you know?

557
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,390
You're so full of yourself.

558
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,020
Besides,

559
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,900
you're just a friend of my friend's wife,

560
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,940
not my friend.

561
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,520
Who are you to lecture me?

562
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,060
Unreasonable.

563
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,920
Thank you for earlier.

564
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,240
Let me introduce myself.

565
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,810
I'm He Zhengyu, Wu Jirong's friend.

566
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,990
Unfortunately, I'm also a lawyer.

567
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,460
I advise you to stay away from Jirong.

568
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,080
Otherwise, I will come get you.

569
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,810
Understand?

570
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,430
Are you single?

571
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,230
The wedding is worth it.

572
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,660
Eligible bachelor who's a lawyer.

573
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,360
Nice.

574
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,190
A good match.

575
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,540
You're both good at being pretentious.

576
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,840
If Chen Kexin comes,

577
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,150
you must stop her.

578
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,140
I've already let it go.

579
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,700
I sincerely wish them the best.

580
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,100
You may not be able to bear the consequences.

581
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,960
Are you single?

582
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,940
What's wrong?

583
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,050
Nothing, just a headache.

584
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,570
I'll be fine after some rest.

585
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:17,420
Go on.

586
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,370
Ms. Wu Jirong asked me

587
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,200
to pick her up from the nursing home on the evening the day before yesterday.

588
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,580
We were going to Jiang Shenghao's house to talk about something together,

589
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,340
but she suddenly changed her mind.

590
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,800
She asked me to drop her off at Jiang Shenghao's door

591
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,190
and then asked me to leave.

592
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,100
Did she tell you anything in the car?

593
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,320
She only told me a few times that

594
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,380
Jiang Shenghao hadn't had an affair.

595
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,220
Please check.

596
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,730
If there's no problem,

597
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,590
sign your name on the deposition.

598
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,110
How is Wu Jirong's relationship

599
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,640
with Wu Anwen, her brother?

600
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,300
As far as I know,

601
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,760
they have always been close.

602
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,700
What's wrong?

603
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,550
Just asking.

604
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,110
Wu Anwen also met Wu Jirong last night.

605
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,580
He's also cooperating with the investigation next door.

606
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,300
Wu Anwen met Jirong last night?

607
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,950
Why didn't you tell me?

608
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,050
He Zhengyu.

609
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,420
On the first day of Chinese New Year.

610
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,760
I guess we came here for the same thing.

611
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,370
I'm now the Jiang family's attorney,

612
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,150
defending Jiang Shenghao.

613
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,700
It seems that we'll be rivals in the future.

614
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,200
What I want to do is to seek justice for Wu Jirong.

615
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,520
There's no such thing as going against each other.

616
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,580
Jirong is dead.

617
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,220
What can I do?

618
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,320
Chen Jialan has stopped Chen Kexin,

619
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,950
but nothing changed.

620
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,850
So,

621
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,180
you can't change the ending

622
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,700
just by changing anything in the past.

623
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,330
The changes that happened so far

624
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,260
haven't caused a noticeable butterfly effect.

625
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,340
Everything is still going

626
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,350
in the way I experienced before.

627
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,219
How is Rat now?

628
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,230
He's still in the police station.

629
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,360
I just came back after the deposition.

630
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,420
I'm so useless.

631
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,449
Nothing has changed.

632
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,810
How is it useless?

633
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,490
You stopping Chen Kexin today

634
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,700
made the news of Jirong being framed as a mistress

635
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,560
all disappear.

636
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,850
Really?

637
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,790
All the news about the wedding is positive.

638
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,550
[Unexpected event took place on Wu Jirong's wedding. Wedding site.]

639
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,550
[Jiang Shenghao's ex-girlfriend Chen Kexin was stopped from going up on the stage.]

640
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,480
There are only some side stories mentioning Kexin.

641
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,660
So, a little change in the past

642
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,030
can trigger the butterfly effect.

643
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,690
Chen Kexin's incident is the best evidence.

644
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,280
Is there any other change?

645
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,520
Without the incident at the wedding,

646
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,820
Chen Kexin wouldn't step in anymore, right?

647
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,480
Wu Jirong and Rat

648
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,960
wouldn't get a divorce,

649
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,570
and Jirong wouldn't die, right?

650
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,170
The divorce case of Jirong and Jiang Shenghao is still there.

651
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,030
Chen Kexin is still the mistress.

652
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,480
Jirong is still dead.

653
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,500
Jiang Shenghao is currently under investigation

654
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,700
as the prime suspect.

655
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,190
Does Chen Kexin do something else?

656
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,970
Wu Anwen also met Wu Jirong last night.

657
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,130
The police seemed to suspect me too.

658
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,880
I was out of town that day.

659
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,160
When I came back,

660
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,090
I heard she sneaked out to see Jiang Shenghao.

661
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,880
I went to see her

662
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,810
to take her home for the reunion of New Year.

663
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,460
But after persuading her for a long time,

664
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,520
she still insisted on staying there.

665
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,070
I was so angry

666
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,450
that I left alone.

667
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,710
I left around two o'clock that day.

668
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,130
Later Jirong sent me a message at 2:30.

669
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,000
The police got the surveillance footage

670
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,290
and proved what I said.

671
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,600
Is there any hint

672
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,970
in your latest memory?

673
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,190
I'm not God.

674
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,180
I don't have a comprehensive perspective.

675
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:01,940
I just

676
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,250
updated He Zhengyu's memory unilaterally.

677
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,780
All I know now is

678
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,140
the main reason of Jirong's tragedy

679
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,140
is that Jiang Shenghao cheated on her with Chen Kexin.

680
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,580
You have to keep an eye on her.

681
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,240
Chen Kexin is the key to changing Jirong's fate.

682
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,950
Okay.

683
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,680
Leave 2021 to me.

684
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,460
If I can change Jirong's death,

685
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,610
and the ending of Rat,

686
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,190
I'm willing to do anything.

687
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,940
I remember there was a line

688
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,290
in the movie The Chorus,

689
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,760
"Never give up.

690
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,190
There will always be hope waiting ahead."

691
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,660
I've been thinking about something these days.

692
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,930
The time-space overlap gave us golden fingers.

693
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,110
Maybe it's the key

694
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,070
to helping Jirong change her fate.

695
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,440
Let's stick to it and change it together.

696
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,740
Neither of us shall give up.

697
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,360
I want Jirong and Rat

698
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,120
to be happy together, forever.

699
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,010
Chen Jialan.

700
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,410
You're like

701
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,560
a female warrior now.

702
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,890
Are you mocking me?

703
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,560
I'm a little tired after a long day.

704
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,860
Have some water. Wait for me.

705
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,670
Female warriors can also starve.

706
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,330
I'll get you something to eat.

707
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,760
There are sandwiches,

708
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,840
dumplings, steak,

709
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,990
and Liuzhou river snails rice noodles in the fridge.

710
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,250
What do you want to eat?

711
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,640
It's Chinese New Year.

712
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,300
I'll have dumplings with you.

713
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:57,610
Okay.

714
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:14,220
♫A dream within reach♫

715
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,570
♫Arises because of you♫

716
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,110
♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

717
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,440
♫We♫

718
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:32,680
♫Are like hour hands embracing and talking♫

719
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,880
♫How can I stop flipping?♫

720
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,890
Do you want chili?

721
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,030
Yes.

722
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,570
I'll cook half the dumplings with vegetable stuffing,

723
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,450
and half with meat.

724
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,380
You want your egg fried or poached?

725
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,020
Fried.

726
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,110
He Zhengyu.

727
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,390
Why are you so nice to me?

728
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,660
Do you secretly love me?

729
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,270
You think too much.

730
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,220
Then why did you hug me that day?

731
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,950
Didn't you say that

732
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,350
hugs are necessary for apologies?

733
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,780
I was just cooperating with you.

734
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,800
Besides, I'm busy with work.

735
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,260
I don't have time to date.

736
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,520
Most importantly,

737
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,150
-you are not my type. -Stop.

738
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,940
I have a stomachache. I need to go to the toilet.

739
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,540
Scumbag. Bastard.

740
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,070
If you don't like me,

741
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,290
then it's me who's imagining things, right?

742
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,420
If you didn't hug me,

743
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,290
would I have thought so much? I'm so mad.

744
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,110
Your stomach doesn't hurt anymore?

745
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:49,710
Of course.

746
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,160
I'm fine now.

747
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,990
Let me make it clear.

748
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,580
We are both adults.

749
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,500
It was just a hug.

750
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,900
I didn't take it seriously.

751
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,050
I asked you just in case you thought too much.

752
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,380
Also, let me remind you.

753
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,460
Don't fall in love with me secretly.

754
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,340
Because nothing will happen.

755
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,020
You are ten thousand miles away

756
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,250
from my type, you know?

757
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,190
Are ten dumplings enough?

758
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,080
Who said I want dumplings?

759
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,490
I want Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

760
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,680
Didn't you just say

761
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,520
you want to have dumplings with me for Chinese New Year?

762
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,910
You should know it's you who wanted to celebrate, not me.

763
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,240
I want Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

764
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,430
You can eat Liuzhou river snails rice noodles,

765
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,740
but eat in the kitchen and

766
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,170
turn on the gas ventilator.

767
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,900
Don't poison me with the smell.

768
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,610
[2021]

769
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,060
The stem cell immunization therapy

770
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,660
has been trending in the medical industry in recent years.

771
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,740
As an emerging medical company,

772
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,220
whose core is stem cell immunization therapy

773
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,940
and cell transplant technology,

774
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,000
Lanyou Technology

775
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,860
has a quite good reputation in the industry.

776
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,060
Many celebrities and rich people

777
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,120
are their clients.

778
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,790
The technology they are proud of

779
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:05,100
is the separation technique of hematopoietic stem cells.

780
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,720
Fan Ke is the main researcher

781
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,870
of this technology.

782
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,050
After leaving Lanyou, Fan Ke started his own business

783
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:10,700
and developed the cultivation technology

784
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,450
of autologous stem cells by himself,

785
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,700
and applied for a patent for massive production.

786
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,770
At this time, Lanyou Technology accused Fan Ke of infringement,

787
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,170
claiming his cultivation technology

788
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,790
of autologous stem cells

789
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,520
violated their core data.

790
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,380
Where is Chen Kexin hiding?

791
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,520
Anwen.

792
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,080
Jiang Shenghao is out.

793
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,930
The police said the evidence isn't enough, so he was acquitted.

794
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:37,670
I knew it.

795
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,180
Innocent until proven guilty.

796
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,900
If no direct evidence is found,

797
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,610
they can't arrest Jiang Shenghao.

798
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,820
Are we going to let him

799
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,300
get away with it like this?

800
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,000
Anwen, I'll continue to investigate.

801
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,400
As long as we find Chen Kexin,

802
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,390
we can find out his motive.

803
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,100
Then we still stand a chance.

804
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,820
If Chen Kexin is really related to Jirong's death,

805
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,450
I'll try my best to find her.

806
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,470
Jirong can't die for no reason.

807
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,510
Zhengyu.

808
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,140
Be my lawyer.

809
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,030
Okay.

810
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,180
The focus of this case

811
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,840
is whether Fan Ke's infringement is convicted.

812
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,900
And if Lanyou Technology Company

813
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,300
has got enough evidence.

814
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,420
One party is Lanyou Technology Company,

815
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,060
and the other party

816
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,790
is the former R&D director of the company, Fan Ke.

817
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,460
-The situation... -This is Chen Kexin.

818
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,860
Give me He Zhengyu's WeChat number.

819
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,620
We must be neutral.

820
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,780
We can't be biased.

821
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,630
Chen Jialan.

822
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,650
Chen Jialan.

823
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,300
Did you hear what I said?

824
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:29,880
Yes.

825
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,320
I'll leave the Lanyou Technology case to you then.

826
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,120
Both parties, attorneys,

827
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,260
and relevant staff,

828
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,140
you have to interview every one of them.

829
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,830
Especially He Zhengyu,

830
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,170
attorney of Lanyou Technology Company.

831
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,830
He's the most important part of this interview.

832
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,500
He Zhengyu...

833
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,160
He's the attorney?

834
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Okay, dismissed.

835
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,860
Okay.

836
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,320
Mr. Wu.

837
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,030
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

838
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,060
Okay.

839
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,390
Brother.

840
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,340
Big case.

841
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,660
A businessman selling seafood.

842
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,820
A divorce case. They have tens of millions of wealth.

843
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,380
If we win the case,

844
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,280
the attorney fee will be 25%.

845
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,620
Reject it.

846
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,620
No work during Chinese New Year.

847
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,030
Hey.

848
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,320
Cut it out.

849
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,340
When did you care about that?

850
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:17,990
Brother,

851
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,100
I know you are very sad

852
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,630
because of Jirong's death.

853
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,030
But we have to move on, right?

854
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,800
We can barely feed ourselves.

855
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,690
Think about it.

856
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,660
The water, electricity, and property fee.

857
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,140
Rent and other supplies.

858
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,620
I beg you.

859
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,840
Let's just meet him, okay?

860
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:38,550
Okay.

861
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,080
You agreed?

862
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,660
I just agreed to meet him.

863
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,940
I didn't say if I'll take it or not.

864
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,660
Also, don't forget about our priority.

865
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,260
Keep looking for Chen Kexin.

866
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,230
Don't worry.

867
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:52,010
Take a sip.

868
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,910
[Sweet ON]

869
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,910
[Love in Time]

870
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,910
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

871
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,930
Listen to me.

872
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:14,970
Calm down.

873
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,390
The police station is too far away.

874
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:16,500
[NG]

875
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,700
Time-space overlap is about to end.

876
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,850
[NG]

877
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,530
[Piece of cake]

878
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:29,790
[Confused]

879
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,980
You think too much.

880
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,100
[What did I think?]

881
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,850
Then why did you hug me that day?

882
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,810
Didn't you say that

883
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,010
hugs are necessary for apologies?

884
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,820
I was just cooperating with you.
