4
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,500
Jia...

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,490
Where did you go yesterday?

6
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,759
How come I couldn't reach you?

7
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,710
You really care about my whereabouts.

8
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,330
I'm worried about you.

9
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,430
Don't mess up my dress.

10
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,420
Do I look good?

11
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,990
Yes.

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,630
But you don't usually dress like this.

13
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,880
Everyone is multifaceted.

14
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,060
I just want to appear

15
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,480
in your memories with different style.

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,020
Why would you say that?

17
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,450
We are together every day.

18
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,110
Why did you mention memories?

19
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,740
We are only together when time-space overlap happens.

20
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,600
The rest of the time we are in each other's memories.

21
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,510
You are beautiful already.

22
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,700
But I want you

23
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,170
to see a different me.

24
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,430
What did you do last night?

25
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,430
Just sit down.

26
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,900
I bought a lot of new clothes.

27
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,710
I'll show you.

28
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,260
You must take a serious look

29
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,100
and remember.

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,670
This one.

31
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,290
Let's take a picture together.

32
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,570
Take a few more.

33
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,710
I'm pretending.

34
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,510
You scared me.

35
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,980
I never thought it would be so tired

36
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,690
to be a fashion icon.

37
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,460
You look pretty either way.

38
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,860
Do you remember what I looked like just now?

39
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,410
Yes.

40
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,610
Since my dad passed away,

41
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,120
I've been living a frugal life

42
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,340
every day.

43
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,790
This career

44
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,150
does not require me to wear high heels.

45
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,870
But I felt regretful about that today,

46
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,500
so I bought these.

47
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,310
Jialan.

48
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,230
The future is still long.

49
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,560
I don't want the future.

50
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,000
I just want the present.

51
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,730
And I just want to do the things I want to do

52
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,330
and be with the person I want to be with the most.

53
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,310
What you want to do most

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,730
will be done

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,290
with the person you most want to be with.

56
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,110
Are you that confident?

57
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,450
Of course.

58
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,500
Then I want...

59
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,750
I want to go skating.

60
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,630
When I was a kid,

61
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,310
my dad would take me to amusement parks or other parks whenever he had time.

62
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,510
But he never took me to the skating rink.

63
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,280
He said

64
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,090
I ran like a little lunatic.

65
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,590
He thought I would fell

66
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,750
after I learned to skate...

67
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,780
Wait for me at the skating rink tomorrow night.

68
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,740
Wait for me.

69
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,890
What do you think?

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
In fact, I just said it casually.

71
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,120
But it's on the must-do list

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,040
for me.

73
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,070
♫All for love. When I come across you♫

74
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,010
♫Just for love. I am waiting for you♫

75
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,700

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,760
♫Go for love♫

77
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,090
It's okay. Take it slow.

♫Everything is for love♫

79
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,920

♫It's like something has changed♫

81

♫Don't waste any more time♫

87

I feel like I'm about to fly now.

♫Traces of love are slowly surfacing♫

89

Look.

91
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,910
You're a fast learner, aren't you?

92
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,720
♫Between us♫

93

♫Just be brave and come a little closer♫

95
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,510
I learned roller skating when I was a kid.

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,560
♫All for love. When I come across you♫

100
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,180
Jia...

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,220
Just like that,

102
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,640
the days passed by.

103
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,670
One night, the tyrannosaurus rex said,

104
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,920
"Henhaochi,

105
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,140
I've got nothing to teach you."

106
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,570
"Let's part ways today."

107
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,190
"Bye."

108
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,170
Henhaochi said,

109
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,940
"No, no."

110
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,860
"I will never part with you."

111
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,250
Jialan,

112
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,870
should I tell you the truth or not?

113
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,140
Or

114
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,630
you already know the truth,

115
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,800
but deliberately pretend not to know.

116
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,440
You haven't sold these stocks yet, right?

117
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,740
The stock has been going up pretty well recently,

118
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,780
so I'm thinking about waiting a bit longer.

119
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,780
The money is mine.

120
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,890
You haven't forgotten, right?

121
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,220
He met a gambling friend

122
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,890
in early December,

123
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,340
and lost all his money in stocks.

124
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,690
Of course not.

125
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,820
Fine, as long as you haven't.

126
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,270
This is

127
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,060
a hosting agreement.

128
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,730
Since I lent you the money,

129
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,940
I will

130
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,940
manage this investment account for you temporarily.

131
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,280
You'll have it back

132
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,990
when you have paid off your gambling debt.

133
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,980
I don't think that's necessary, Zhengyu.

134
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,170
Although you're a lawyer,

135
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,590
I have more experience in investment than you do.

136
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,940
Anwen,

137
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,820
it seems you still have some concerns about me.

138
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,400
No.

139
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,740
It looks like you are the one who has concerns about me.

140
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:19,860
Fine.

141
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,550
In that case,

142
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,160
why don't we

143
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,140
manage this account together?

144
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,060
We can set the password separately.

145
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,590
I'll set the first four digits of the password

146
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,420
and you'll set the last four digits.

147
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,280
This account can only be logged in

148
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,850
when both of us enter the password.

149
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,980
Is that okay for you?

150
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,350
I think it's all right.

151
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,530
Okay.

152
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,240
This investment account will now

153
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
be managed by you and me.

154
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,050
Hello? Go ahead.

155
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,810
Anwen,

156
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,180
will you go to the gambling party tonight?

157
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,240
No, I have no money.

158
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,680
Really?

159
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,260
Didn't you make a lot of money on those stocks?

160
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,720
Money in the stock market is nothing

161
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,450
as long as you don't take it out.

162
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,050
I won't gamble anymore.

163
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,180
Don't call me again.

164
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,290
I'm off to go.

165
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,990
Okay.

166
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,140
Each of you take a turn

167
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,510
introducing your topic.

168
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,110
Ms. Wen,

169
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,360
I've collected some information

170
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,670
about the credibility screening

171
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,920
of online news media.

172
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,760
This is the age of We Media.

173
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,500
Everyone can become a port

174
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,630
to post news online.

175
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,860
Although the channels for obtaining information have become wider,

176
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,380
the credibility of news

177
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,840
has been greatly reduced.

178
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,820
I think this is a question worth exploring.

179
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,040
Mr. Mu.

180
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,160
Jialan.

181
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,910
You prepared many topics this time.

182
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,370
Looks like you've put a lot of effort into it.

183
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,770
That's what you told me.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,660
Journalists should not only be good at discovering,

185
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,500
but also pay attention to the usual accumulation.

186
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,680
This topic

187
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,570
is really what I have always wanted to do.

188
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,700
I've been preparing for a long time.

189
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,820
I can finally do it.

190
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,700
Great. Just go for it.

191
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,770
Mr. Mu.

192
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,060
The topic this time is quite difficult.

193
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,150
There should be a lot of work.

194
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,490
I don't think I can do it alone.

195
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,120
So I want everyone to do it together.

196
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,740
I've already listed these suitable ones.

197
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,620
So could you please take care of the distribution

198
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,620
at that time?

199
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,580
Jialan, have you made up your mind?

200
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,320
In the News Department,

201
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,710
it's rare for anyone to share their topics

202
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,490
with others.

203
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,860
And Ms. Wen has also told you that

204
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,700
you can take your time.

205
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,110
She will give you enough time.

206
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,970
You don't have to do it all at once.

207
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,300
This is really a topic that I have always wanted to do,

208
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,700
but I am not capable enough.

209
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,820
I think the best choice

210
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,250
is to share it with the others.

211
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,110
Only in this way can we turn it from a topic into news,

212
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,950
so that everyone can see it.

213
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,710
Jialan, good for you.

214
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,170
I'm happy for you.

215
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,240
Thank you.

216
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,160
Thank you, sir.

217
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,620
See you.

218
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,960
Why do you want to buy lottery?

219
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,980
I should have thought of it a long time ago.

220
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,540
Otherwise we would have been on the Forbes

221
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,050
last month.

222
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,610
The main characters of those time-traveling movies

223
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,070
make a lot of money from it.

224
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,610
I also want to try.

225
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,710
How many lottery tickets do you want?

226
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:04,880
Just one.

227
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,070
I can't be greedy.

228
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,850
Okay, numbers.

229
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,220
Okay.

230
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,280
How much is it?

231
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Two yuan for one.

232
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:09,720
OK.

233
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,870
By the way,

234
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,140
these numbers are the winning numbers that

235
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,200
I secretly checked on your computer.

236
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,280
Here, your ticket.

237
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,100
Thank you.

238
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,010
By the way, sir.

239
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,290
These numbers are sure to win.

240
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,030
You buy two.

241
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,260
Okay.

242
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,130
Thank you.

243
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,010
When will the prize be drawn?

244
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,980
Tomorrow.

245
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,060
We will be able to witness the miracle tomorrow.

246
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,590
Let's go.

247
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,160
Okay.

248
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,980
Do you think this will really work?

249
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
If you do succeed,

250
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,910
what are you going to do with the money?

251
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,820
There are so many things I want to do.

252
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,500
If I win 10 million,

253
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,650
the first thing I'll do

254
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,710
is to renovate my grandmother's B&B.

255
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,340
Then we can pay off

256
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,030
Wu Anwen's gambling debt.

257
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,290
And we can save Jirong.

258
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,480
Also,

259
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,420
I want to sponsor a little girl

260
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,230
from a single-parent family that I interviewed before

261
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,160
to help her get a better education.

262
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,860
By the way, and Rat.

263
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,460
I have to treat him to dinner.

264
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,840
He used to treat me.

265
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,880
Will I have any money left?

266
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,590
Of course.

267
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,420
Go on.

268
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,940
Then I'll buy some designer bags for Manman.

269
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,410
What color should I buy?

270
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:27,930
I'm so rich.

271
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,720
I'll buy one of each color.

272
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,460
Will I still have money left?

273
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,800
There is still plenty.

274
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,610
Go on.

275
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,630
I'll buy a house then.

276
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,620
Just in case

277
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,780
you can't even afford to live in my apartment in the future.

278
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,700
What about you?

279
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,420
Me?

280
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
What do you want to buy for yourself?

281
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,580
Meeting you has been the best lottery

282
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,920
I've ever won in my life.

283
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,060
Jialan.

284
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,290
Do you really think so?

285
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,490
Yes.

286
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,140
I think money is the least important thing

287
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,460
in this world.

288
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,780
While living,

289
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,530
one should have the courage to love someone

290
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,860
and experience a lot of things, that is...

291
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,130
I mean...

292
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,760
time is too precious.

293
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,670
We should just enjoy it.

294
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,990
I know you know everything.

295
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,420
Know what?

296
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,950
I know why you've been acting strange these days.

297
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,620
I also know that you didn't ask or say anything

298
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,280
because you were afraid that I would be worried.

299
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,340
That's why

300
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,540
you pretended to be fine.

301
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
But you know what?

302
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,110
It makes me sadder to see you like this.

303
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,020
I didn't pretend.

304
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,640
I just want to be happy every day.

305
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,210
Where did you go that day?

306
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,140
How did you know?

307
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,610
Does those matter?

308
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:05,960
No.

309
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,900
What matters is that

310
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,600
I don't have many days left.

311
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,380
I thought

312
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,060
I would be with you for a long time.

313
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,790
Although we only have forty-six minutes a day.

314
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,130
Jialan.

315
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,540
What are you talking about?

316
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,940
I know why you didn't tell me the truth.

317
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,420
It's actually quite difficult

318
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,310
to tell someone who is still alive

319
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,150
that she is about to die soon.

320
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,490
Jialan.

321
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,460
You're not dead. You're just in a coma due to car accident.

322
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,980
I go to see you every day.

323
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,220
You will wake up.

324
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,390
A car accident?

325
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,810
I am in a coma?

326
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,310
Yes.

327
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,360
You're not dead.

328
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,460
And it was Wu Anwen who hit you.

329
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,300
Wu Anwen?

330
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,750
Why would he hit me?

331
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,160
It was an accident.

332
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,240
January 7, 2022.

333
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,660
The day you had the accident was the day

334
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,380
the divorce case between Wu Jirong and Jiang Shenghao

335
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,700
went to court.

336
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,290
After the adjournment that day,

337
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,580
Wu Anwen and Wu Jirong had a fierce dispute

338
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,020
on their way home.

339
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,820
Wu Anwen didn't mind the road,

340
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,750
and hit you.

341
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,310
How could it be such a coincidence?

342
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,180
Didn't I also get into trouble

343
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,020
because of the divorce case of Wu Jirong and Jiang Shenghao?

344
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,520
Now,

345
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,690
it seems like everything is connected.

346
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,750
January 7, 2022,

347
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,270
seems like a turning point for all of us.

348
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,740
And what's even more coincidental is that

349
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,060
I ended up living in the apartment

350
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,340
you used to live in.

351
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,610
So this time-space overlap is not a coincidence.

352
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,580
Are you saying that

353
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,600
it was all meant to be?

354
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,320
Think about it.

355
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,820
Such an incredible thing

356
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,660
happened to both of us

357
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,380
who were involved in the same thing.

358
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,510
What does this mean?

359
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,610
We have to change it.

360
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,400
Yes, that must be it.

361
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,540
Can it really be changed?

362
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,670
Of course.

363
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,240
And I won't give up.

364
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,830
We can definitely change our destiny.

365
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,490
This is also what you prepared, right?

366
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,520
No.

367
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,710
But

368
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,720
that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it.

369
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,610
Are

370
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,060
fireworks round or flat

371
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,760
when viewed from the side?

372
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,870
What?

373
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,130
I have always loved watching fireworks since I was a child.

374
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,800
In our hometown,

375
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,060
there would be a temple fair during the Lantern Festival,

376
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,990
and then there would be fireworks.

377
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,280
I used to watch it with my dad when I was a kid.

378
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,820
But there were too many people.

379
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,350
My dad would carry me on his back.

380
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,120
This way I was the tallest one

381
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,950
in the crowd.

382
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,900
Come here.

383
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,980
What are you doing?

384
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,560
Think of here as a temple fair.

385
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,190
I'm afraid you'll get lost.

386
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,190
Come on.

387
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,880
Am I heavy?

388
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Not at all.

389
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,570
Everyone in front of me get out of the way.

390
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,650
♫All for love. When I come across you♫

391
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,700
What do you think?

392
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,810
♫Just for love. I am waiting for you♫

393
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,450
How's the view from here?

394
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,090
Get out of the way.

395
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,900
Move!

396
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,160
♫Go for love♫

397
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,340

♫We've seen each other before, but I'm missing you again♫

400
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,300
I think the view here is good.

401
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,290
♫Every action you make♫

402
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,940
Look ahead.

403
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,010
Is that the person who sells sugar-coated haws?

404
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,800
♫Every memory about you♫

405
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,700
Look over there. There is a lion dance over there.

406
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,040
♫Will touch me♫

407
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,670
♫So thrilling♫

408
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,820
Did you see it?

409
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,410
-Yeah. -So many people.

410

Zhengyu.

413
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,770
It's so happy to call your name like this.

414
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,560
Then you can always call me that.

415
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,170
Zhengyu.

416
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,020
Zhengyu.

417
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,420
Can we really

418
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,670
change our fate

419
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,510
and watch the fireworks together next year?

420
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,550
Sure.

421
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:00,730
♫A dream within reach♫

422
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,730
That's great.

423
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,900
♫Arises because of you♫

424

428

Jialan.

429
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,490
We will change everything.

430
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,800
♫You are the light shining♫

431
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,060
Whether it's 2022

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,140
or 2023,

433
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,730
I will watch the fireworks with you every day in the future.

434
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,710
♫And warming my eyes♫

435
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,060

Jialan.

♫You are the light halting♫

439
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,190
The fireworks are round.

440
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,100
♫And staying in my heart♫

441
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,330
They always are.

442
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,270
♫Spend dust and dawn with you♫

443
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,620
♫Say out I miss you♫

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,310
♫You will know that♫

445
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,600
Coming up

446
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,290
is the winning lottery numbers for issue 21125.

447
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,230
Twenty-one.

448
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,000
Twenty-one?

449
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:26,900
Twenty-one!

450
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
Nineteen.

451
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
Nineteen...

452
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,180
-Seventeen. -Seventeen...

453
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,770
-How could I not have won a single number? -Three.

454
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,050
-That's impossible. -Fourteen.

455
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,660
The special ball numbers are four and nine.

456
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,910
Is it true that

457
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,540
fate cannot be changed?

458
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,260
Jialan.

459
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,540
Jialan!

460
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,170
Jialan.

461
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,250
Why are you unhappy?

462
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,960
Did you see the lottery numbers?

463
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,760
What's going on?

464
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,500
Not a single number was correct.

465
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,000
This shows that

466
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,370
we cannot change the past.

467
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,750
No way.

468
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,620
It's just a reminder that we can't use it to make money.

469
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,130
And...

470
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,600
Think about it.

471
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,540
Nobita has never used

472
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,250
Doraemon's props to get rich.

473
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,030
This means that props

474
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,310
can only be used to enrich our lives.

475
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,370
It seems you were right four months ago.

476
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,700
Maybe the time-space overlap really has energy conservation.

477
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,190
What happened in the past

478
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,380
will never change again.

479
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,240
Jialan.

480
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,810
-Can you not be... -That's why

481
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,770
we never saved Jirong.

482
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,020
Changing the past during time-space overlap

483
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,120
only happens in movies.

484
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,500
It has nothing to do with us.

485
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,420
It's different.

486
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,970
Haven't we

487
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,300
changed a lot?

488
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:29,860
For example,

489
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,420
Chen Kexin,

490
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,660
Jirong's wedding,

491
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,730
and me.

492
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,950
My current law firm is small.

493
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,610
But through my efforts,

494
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,660
it will sooner or later become

495
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,390
as large as Fengyu Law Firm.

496
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,040
We can use time-space overlap to change the past.

497
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,300
I'll be the same successful lawyer I was.

498
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,620
So,

499
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,010
let's work hard

500
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,030
before the time-space overlap is over.

501
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,960
Don't give up easily, okay?

502
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,250
Okay.

503
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,800
Give me a hug.

504
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,180
Wait a sec.

505
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,380
Don't think about anything else.

506
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,790
Just think if this cake is delicious.

507
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,070
Wait.

508
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:46,940
So good.

509
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,410
Why would you have a hair band?

510
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,260
I prepared it for you.

511
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:10,950
I don't want it. You eat it.

512
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,720
Take a bite.

513
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,880
[Yesterday's welfare lottery draw, who won the first prize?]

514
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,980
Morning.

515
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,110
Morning, Piaopiao.

516
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,180
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

517
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,030
Jialan.

518
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,070
Listen.

519
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,020
The lottery station in our neighborhood is famous now.

520
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,820
The first prize ticket

521
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,040
was sold by that station yesterday.

522
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,100
They hung a banner.

523
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,700
Piaopiao,

524
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,740
thank you

525
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,080
for successfully awakening my painful memories

526
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,730
once again.

527
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,110
What? You bought it too?

528
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,480
I suggest you buy it in our neighborhood.

529
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,940
It can bring you good luck.

530
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,660
Forget it.

531
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,630
Fortune doesn't belong to me.

532
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,020
Hello?

533
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,980
Jialan.

534
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,480
Come to my house at noon

535
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,530
to be my witness.

536
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,260
For what?

537
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,100
I'm going to sign the marriage agreement.

538
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,990
But generally people who get married quickly

539
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,670
tend to get divorced quickly.

540
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,940
I trust Shenghao.

541
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,020
You don't have to sign a prenuptial agreement.

542
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,550
Even if it's not Chen Kexin,

543
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,460
it may be someone else.

544
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,140
They framed me as a mistress.

545
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,180
I'm going to sign the marriage agreement.

546
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Are we really unable to change this?

547
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,260
Is everything back to the beginning?

548
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,950
Anwen,

549
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,470
will you come tonight?

550
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,180
Didn't I tell you?

551
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,160
I quit.

552
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,360
From now on, don't ask me

553
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,280
to play Texas Hold'em,

554
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,410
Doudizhu, Zhajinhua

555
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,480
and Mahjong with you.

556
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,560
Don't call me. I really quit.

557
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,900
Also,

558
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,020
you don't have to remind me in the group chat

559
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,040
if you play.

560
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,600
I don't really want to know.

561
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:02,920
Have fun.

562
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,910
What password

563
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,570
did Zhengyu set?

564
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,650
[Jiang Shenghao]

565
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,070
Go ahead.

566
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,810
Anwen,

567
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,230
I have one thing to tell you.

568
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,330
I'm going to sign the marriage agreement.

569
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,260
What agreement?

570
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,060
It's the loyalty agreement

571
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,120
you told me before.

572
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,260
If I cheat,

573
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,430
everything I have will be Jirong's.

574
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,880
What are you doing, Jiang Shenghao?

575
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,990
Before you got married,

576
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,670
you just wouldn't sign.

577
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,780
Did you do something wrong?

578
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,770
Anwen,

579
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,870
I've already made my decision.

580
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,960
-Rat. -Jialan?

581
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,250
What happened?

582
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,750
Why do you want to sign a marriage agreement?

583
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,220
Did Wu Anwen force you to sign it?

584
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,300
Of course not.

585
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,320
He did argue with me about this.

586
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,780
But this time

587
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,180
I volunteered to sign it.

588
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,100
Recently,

589
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,610
he has been doing good in all aspects.

590
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,170
At first I asked him to be the vice president of the company,

591
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,210
but he refused.

592
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,940
He was willing to be an ordinary manager

593
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,010
in the property company.

594
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,610
I'm a little embarrassed about that.

595
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,290
Well, I'm kind of giving him a guarantee.

596
00:30:59,290 --> 00:30:59,980
Let's go in.

597
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,000
Wait. Come here, Jiang Shenghao.

598
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,380
Listen.

599
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,830
The world is changing too fast.

600
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,220
You should not

601
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,350
bind yourself in this way.

602
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,950
I'm afraid you'll regret it.

603
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,900
Chen Jialan,

604
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,760
you have to trust me.

605
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,620
This agreement is not a shackle,

606
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,830
but a testimony of my love with Jirong.

607
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,360
Let's go.

608
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,690
Jiang Shenghao!

609
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,070
Jialan. Shenghao.

610
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,830
Why don't you guys come in?

611
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,180
-Let's go. -Jirong.

612
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,070
Please look at the details

613
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,790
of this agreement.

614
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,600
Don't get so emotional.

615
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,850
I'm just worried.

616
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,100
I read over this loyalty agreement.

617
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,570
There is no problem of it.

618
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,570
During the marriage,

619
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,090
if the man

620
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,100
shows any infidelity to the marriage,

621
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,760
he will lose all his property.

622
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,570
If you don't have any objections,

623
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,530
please sign it.

624
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,340
OK.

625
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,520
I don't think you should sign.

626
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,450
I still think it's pretty strange.

627
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,420
Honey,

628
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,910
I must sign it this time.

629
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,230
Listen to me, okay?

630
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,350
You need to sign it later.

631
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,590
Me?

632
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,500
Of course you have to sign

633
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,690
as a witness.

634
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,410
Don't be upset.

635
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,030
He just did what he thought was right.

636
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
I'm not upset.

637
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,940
Last time, Wu Anwen

638
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,160
used Chen Kexin to force Jiang Shenghao to sign the agreement.

639
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,430
This time, he volunteered to sign it.

640
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,030
Once again, your suspicions have been verified.

641
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,970
Sure enough,

642
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,270
time-space overlap changed nothing.

643
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,740
What do you mean by verified once again?

644
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,600
I bought a lottery ticket

645
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,020
with the winning numbers

646
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,950
I checked on the computer of the you from four months later.

647
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,880
Guess what?

648
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,540
Not a single number was correct.

649
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,790
Maybe it can't be used to make a fortune.

650
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,150
You two are the same person.

651
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,600
No.

652
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,320
It's me and the you in 2022 too naive.

653
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,190
People become irrational when they want something.

654
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,040
Don't take it seriously.

655
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,640
Maybe he really figured out a way to change it.

656
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,500
-I'll also help, so... -Thank you for your comfort.

657
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Do you need a ride?

658
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,410
No.

659
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,570
I want to take a walk alone.

660
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,610
What are you doing?

661
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,219
Are you playing games instead of working?

662
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:11,870
I have no work to do.

663
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,699
Go to the surrounding office buildings and distribute them.

664
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,610
Have we fallen so far?

665
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,409
I would like to look up at the moon,

666
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,270
but I have to have sixpence first.

667
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,139
But we don't have

668
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,800
any big companies around here.

669
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,540
As long as there is a case.

670
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,460
Well...

671
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,260
What about these quarrel cases?

672
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,800
If they are willing to consult with a lawyer...

673
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,429
Why not?

674
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,850
Then won't we become a neighborhood committee?

675
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,790
The neighborhood committee is free.

676
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,250
We charge.

677
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,230
Fine.

678
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,780
They are even nobler than us.

679
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,770
I read over this loyalty agreement.

680
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,190
There is no problem of it.

681
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,620
Please sign it.

682
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,210
Got it.

683
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,450
You're out of your mind.
