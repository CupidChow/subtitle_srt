00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,340
I went to see Jialan yesterday.

7
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,710
She's still in a coma.

8
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:58,990
It was me.

9
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,830
What?

10
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,900
Chen Jialan

11
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,840
was hit by me.

15
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,520
Jirong and I drove to our home.

16
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,670
We had a fight on the way.

17
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,880
Why did you suddenly overthrow your confession?

18
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,220
I know everything you did.

19
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,610
Did someone tell you something?

20
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,100
Shenghao didn't cheat.

21
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,140
You and Chen Kexin set him up.

22
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,100
You framed him for having an affair.

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,500
You want me to give up on him.

24
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,460
You want us to divorce.

25
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,230
Nonsense!

26
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,570
Who said that?

27
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,150
It's so vicious.

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,130
I don't have a reason to do that.

29
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,820
Why would I ruin your marriage?

30
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,300
Because you need my money.

31
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,460
If I divorce him,

32
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,980
you can get a lot of money

33
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,829
to repay your gambling debt.

34
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,780
Jirong,

35
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,450
no matter who told you this,

36
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,650
you can't believe it.

37
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,780
Trust me.

38
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,780
Here, look.

39
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,170
This is the chat history between you and Chen Kexin.

40
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,800
And this.

41
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,460
This is the one between you and the debt collector.

42
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,860
You are still lying to me?

43
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,620
Anwen, why are you gambling again?

44
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,620
You promised me

45
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,079
you won't gamble anymore.

46
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,340
I paid three million for you two years ago.

47
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,940
How much do you owe this time?

48
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,380
Jirong kept asking me about the gambling debt

49
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,260
and the thing I conspired with Chen Kexin

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,660
to frame Jiang Shenghao.

51
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,380
Yes.

52
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,390
The photo of them hugging

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
was planned by me and Chen Kexin.

54
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,170
The purpose was to get Jirong divorced

55
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,390
and get the Jiang family's property.

56
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,400
You forced me to divorce.

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,300
Don't you care about me

58
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,660
when you see me sad?

59
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,580
Are you my brother?

60
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,980
Jirong.

61
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,260
Don't be angry. How about this?

62
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,870
I'll explain to you

63
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,690
when we get home, okay?

64
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:25,830
Now,

65
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,320
give me your phone.

66
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,760
In your heart,

67
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,890
my lifetime happiness is not as important as money.

68
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,290
Right?

69
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,890
Do what I said, Jirong.

70
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,140
Give me the phone first.

71
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,700
No.

72
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,430
Give it to me.

73
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,700
Give it to me.

74
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,450
No.

75
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,180
Give it to me.

76
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
What's wrong?

77
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,490
Did you hit something?

78
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
There's nothing. It's an illusion.

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,740
That's impossible.

80
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,540
You really didn't see anything?

81
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,220
No, I need to get off and have a look.

82
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,690
Jirong.

83
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,200
It's too dark outside.

84
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,860
It's not safe to get off now.

85
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,410
How about this? I'll come back tomorrow morning

86
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,610
and take a look, okay?

87
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,380
No, I...

88
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,180
Do what I said.

89
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,020
I really didn't see what was hit.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,500
I thought I was just lucky

91
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,600
and left in a hurry.

92
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,820
Not until the next day I saw the investigation notice,

93
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,500
did I find out that I hit a person last night.

94
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,990
Anwen,

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,930
you hit a person last night.

96
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,530
Someone was hit

97
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,570
and rolled into the bush by the road.

98
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,100
It's hard to see at night.

99
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,980
Don't panic.

100
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,090
Let me think.

101
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,620
I...

102
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,420
I will turn myself in.

103
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,020
Let's go.

104
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,580
Let's go now.

105
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,640
No, not now.

106
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,670
You have to wait a few more days.

107
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,460
Why?

108
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,580
Think about it.

109
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
Look at this.

110
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,020
The traffic camera didn't catch the hit-and-run car.

111
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,580
That means

112
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,300
the camera on the road was broken, right?

113
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,830
No one saw us in the same car.

114
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,740
If I turn myself in now,

115
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,100
I have to tell the police

116
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,160
you were in the car.

117
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,460
If the media expose it,

118
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,660
you will be destroyed

119
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,490
by the public.

120
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
Give me some time.

121
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
I'll find a way to get you out of this.

122
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,340
I need to arrange everything.

123
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,860
I need to make up the places I drove by that night,

124
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
the road I drove,

125
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,190
and the places I went to.

126
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,180
I'll turn myself in by then, okay?

127
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,900
No, no, no.

128
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,580
Anwen.

129
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,020
I know you're doing this for me.

130
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,540
But...

131
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,340
Jirong,

132
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,300
I'm sorry

133
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,710
about what I did to Jiang Shenghao.

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,240
I regret it so much.

135
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,460
So you have to give me a chance

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,909
to do more things for you, okay?

137
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,100
I know, but I've thought about it.

138
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,970
No, we can't delay this.

139
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,980
I'd better call the police.

140
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,960
No, you can't call the police.

141
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,800
You can't call the police.

142
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,950
No, I must call the police.

143
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,500
-I'm calling 110. -Don't call the police.

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,960
Are you going to report me?

145
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,580
Do you want to send me to jail?

146
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,180
Jirong,

147
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,520
think about it.

148
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,820
Since you were young,

149
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,400
I've done everything I promised you, right?

150
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,770
I promise you now.

151
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,460
No, I swear to you now.

152
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,760
Give me a few more days.

153
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,050
As long as I can get you out of it,

154
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,880
I will

155
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,350
turn myself in to the police.

156
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,290
Okay?

157
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,700
Good girl.

158
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,620
That's it.

159
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,640
Jirong chose to trust me in the end.

160
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,910
I'm sorry, Zhengyu.

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,340
I really didn't know

162
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,270
Jialan was the one I hit that night.

163
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,620
About Jialan's car accident,

164
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,160
you committed

165
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,180
the crime of inflicting serious bodily injury.

166
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,110
And you also committed the crime of escape after the traffic accident.

167
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,040
I plead guilty.

168
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,060
Zhengyu.

169
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,580
On the night of Jirong's accident,

170
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,520
the fundamental reason we argued

171
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,820
was that she persuaded me to turn myself in.

172
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,230
The seven days I promised her passed soon.

173
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,060
I didn't dare to turn myself in.

174
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Until that day...

175
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,410
What about Chen Kexin?

176
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,940
[2022.01.31]

177
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,940
[01:54 a.m.]

178
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,950
Have you thought about it?

179
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,110
If the Jiang family knows that

180
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,800
it was me who framed Jiang Shenghao

181
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,020
with Chen Kexin,

182
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,720
will the Jiang family accept you?

183
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,230
The Jiang family has always looked down on us.

184
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,760
You must come with me today.

185
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,420
Okay, I'll go with you.

186
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:19,940
Okay.

187
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,610
Good.

188
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,030
Let's go home.

189
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,360
Let's go to the police station together.

190
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:28,560
What?

191
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,240
Do you have to send me to jail?

192
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,710
Anwen, do you know who you hit?

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,670
You hit Chen Jialan.

194
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,670
You hit Chen Jialan, Anwen.

195
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,930
What...

196
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,730
What?

197
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Who told you that?

198
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,250
Shenghao told me Jialan was hit by a car.

199
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,460
The time and place match.

200
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:51,890
Anwen.

201
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,690
No.

202
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,890
It can't be such a coincidence.

203
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,270
No.

204
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,870
There must be a misunderstanding.

205
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,560
Or was it designed by someone?

206
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:00,970
No.

207
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,760
Anwen.

208
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,040
Stop avoiding.

209
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,650
Jialan is in the hospital now.

210
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,310
She has been in a coma for days.

211
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,530
We don't know if she could make it.

212
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,580
Besides, no matter if you hit a stranger

213
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,570
or Chen Jialan,

214
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,420
you have to bear the consequences,

215
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,300
so that we will feel at ease.

216
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,590
Jirong,

217
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,920
you are right.

218
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,620
I will turn myself in.

219
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,060
But please give me some time.

220
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,850
You know I owe a lot, right?

221
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
If I go to jail,

222
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,260
the debtors will come and harass you.

223
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,700
Anwen,

224
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,300
I'll help you pay even if I need to borrow money.

225
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,470
But I...

226
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,180
I still have a lot of work to do.

227
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,870
Stop making excuses.

228
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,360
I won't trust you anymore.

229
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,190
We can't keep making mistakes.

231
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,250
If you don't turn yourself in,

232
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:03,880
I'll go.

233
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,860
No! Jirong! Jirong!

234
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,180
-Calm down. -Let go.

235
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
Calm down and listen to me.

236
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,330
Let me go! Let me go!

237
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,860
Jirong, come back! Jirong!

238
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,160
Jirong!

239
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,940
What's that sound?

240
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,090
I'm sorry for Jialan.

241
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I'm sorry for you.

242
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,240
And I'm sorry for what I did to Jirong.

243
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,540
My only sister

244
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,840
died because of me.

245
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,600
Don't defend me, Zhengyu.

246
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,830
I'll respect the court decision.

247
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,740
People like me

248
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
should go to hell.

249
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
The trial is the day after tomorrow.

250
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,620
What is it?

251
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,930
I want you to give it

252
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
to the He Zhengyu four months later.

253
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,970
I studied all night

254
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,690
about the time-space overlap last night.

255
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,090
There is no evidence that

256
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,430
communication devices can't contact the other person

257
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,350
in the time-space overlap.

258
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,820
So I want to give it a try.

259
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
What if it affects the time-space overlap?

260
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,160
It doesn't matter.

261
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,550
As you said, the worst result

262
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,150
is the collapse of the time-space overlap.

263
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,410
Jialan.

264
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,890
Please help me.

265
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,860
You are the only link

266
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,250
between me and him.

267
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,670
Mr. He,

268
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,820
what I did is

269
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,280
for my boyfriend.

270
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,140
The He Zhengyu four months later

271
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,600
has nothing to do with you.

272
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,460
And I cherish the time

273
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,110
we spent together every night.

274
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,660
I don't want to take any risks.

275
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,460
I understand.

276
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,550
I apologize first.

277
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,420
I don't understand why I would fall in love with you

278
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,520
after four months,

279
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,290
but I respect your love.

280
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Since you like me four months later,

281
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,250
you can put yourself in my position.

282
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,380
If you were me,

283
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,130
after all these supernatural phenomena,

284
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,470
don't you want to know

285
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,560
what you are doing?

286
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,240
Don't you want to contact her?

287
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sure you want to.

288
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,480
Think about it.

289
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,590
Suddenly,

290
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Einstein's theory

291
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,550
really happened to you.

292
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,090
Won't you be excited?

293
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,290
You will be thrilled.

294
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,530
This is a miracle.

295
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,510
I understand how you feel.

296
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,030
And I know myself best.

297
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,140
I'm sure the He Zhengyu four months later

298
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,600
is looking forward for me to contacting him.

299
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,640
Fine.

300
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,590
But let me make it clear.

301
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,620
If it affects

302
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,020
the time-space overlap,

303
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,740
please don't even think about it

304
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,650
and don't try anything else.

305
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,580
No problem.

306
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,950
[2022]

307
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,260
If I want to stop Jialan from being hit by the car,

308
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,900
she must be stopped from crossing the road

309
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,940
on the night of

310
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,290
January 7, 2022.

311
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,120
I will not tell Jialan about this.

312
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,970
If she finds out,

313
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,950
she must be scared and desperate.

314
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,990
He Zhengyu.

315
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,600
Jialan.

316
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,940
Did you find me

317
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,540
from 2022 last night?

318
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,210
Why?

319
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,370
Because...

320
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,750
Because of what?

321
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,190
Did I get fired?

322
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,560
It's the opposite.

323
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,780
You did very well.

324
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,710
You volunteered to work in Africa.

325
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,830
Ms. Wen told me that herself.

326
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,270
What? Me?

327
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,090
I volunteered to work

328
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,430
in Africa?

329
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,840
Isn't that typical you?

330
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,130
You're right.

331
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,660
The world's famous female journalist, Ferrari,

332
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,760
is my role model.

333
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,500
That's why

334
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,960
I can't use my access card.

335
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,790
My identity was different.

336
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,300
By the way, Jialan,

337
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,830
I want to ask you something.

338
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,950
Don't you find it strange

339
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,680
that this paper crane is here?

340
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,940
No. Why?

341
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,500
I've been keeping it here.

342
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,780
Is your paper crane here too?

343
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,230
After I bought it,

344
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,620
I wanted to hang it on my bag,

345
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,180
but I think it looks nice here.

346
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,040
So I put it here.

347
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,020
Jialan.

348
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,300
I found this paper crane you lost

349
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,810
in January, 2022.

350
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,180
Then I moved here.

351
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,300
I put it in the same place as you.

352
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,070
Why did you find my paper crane

353
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,790
four months later?

354
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,890
I've never moved it.

355
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,430
Maybe you lost it when you moved that day.

356
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,020
I happened to find it.

357
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,460
You mean

358
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,359
you found my paper crane

359
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,950
in 2022,

360
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,920
and put it in the same spot.

361
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,470
Yes.

362
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,770
He Zhengyu.

363
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,300
Do you think the paper crane is the reason

364
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,010
why our time and space overlap?

365
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:30,540
This is the secret of the time-space overlap.

366
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,890
I'm not sure yet.

367
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,730
But I'm sure

368
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,550
this paper crane

369
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,600
connects us together.

370
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,740
Since we are destined to be together,

371
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,600
why don't we go out and celebrate?

372
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,930
How do you want to celebrate?

373
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,880
I want to win a stuffed toy.

374
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,940
The last time I went kart racing with Piaopiao,

375
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,600
she won a stuffed toy

376
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,320
and I didn't win anything.

377
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,050
Okay.

378
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,180
You agree?

379
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,470
I'll do whatever you ask.

380
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,310
Hurry up.

381
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,470
Let's go.

382
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,750
It occurs to me that

383
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,900
the other Zhengyu from 2021 gave me

384
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,140
a phone.

385
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,200
He asked me to give it to you.

386
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,180
He said he wanted to contact you through this.

387
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,930
But I'm not sure

388
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,520
if the time-space overlap will end.

389
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,520
It's up to you.

390
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,010
Hello.

391
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,140
I'm He Zhengyu from 2021.

392
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,690
Let's go.

393
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,650
[Busy.]

394
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,730
That's me.

395
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,300
Busy?

396
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,560
What's more important

397
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,590
than us after all these unbelievable things?

398
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,540
Remember.

399
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,160
Competition first, friendship second.

400
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,330
Chen Jialan first,

401
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,860
competition second.

402
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,150
The toy first.

403
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,650
Your happiness first.

404
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,420
Okay.

405
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:43,630
Come on.

406
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,200
Come on.

407
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,290
Everyone, get ready.

408
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,850
Go.

409
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,000
Come here.

410
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,810
Everyone,

411
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,770
we have two champions

412
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,810
in this race.

413
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,900
They are No.9 and No.5.

414
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,240
Congratulations to the two champions.

415
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,300
Now, please follow me

416
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,380
to the reception to get the prize.

417
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,720
Let's go get the prize.

418
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,300
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,710
There's only one stuffed toy left.

420
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,060
I have two coupons.

421
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,340
You can pick the coupons or the toy.

422
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,300
Excuse me.

423
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,100
Can you give me the toy?

424
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,710
It's my girlfriend's birthday today.

425
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,550
I promised her

426
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,530
to give it to her as a birthday gift.

427
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,580
Take it.

428
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,660
Thank you.

429
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,570
Thank you.

430
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,110
You're welcome.

431
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,830
Let's go.

432
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,450
Actually, the coupons are not bad.

433
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,070
Thank you.

434
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,460
Where are you taking me?

435
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,940
To the next kart racing club.

436
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,020
No, He Zhengyu.

437
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,690
There's no time. There are only three minutes left.

438
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,660
I'm happy to win first place.

439
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,360
Wait for me.

440
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,460
He Zhengyu, two minutes left.

441
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,210
He Zhengyu.

442
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,550
One minute left.

443
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,570
Where did you go?

444
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,010
Where did you get it?

445
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,250
There's a claw machine inside.

446
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,310
But it was too late.

447
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,110
So I bought one from the boss.

448
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,610
I must keep my promise.

449
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,730
It's just a little small.

450
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,990
I like it very much.

467
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,730
Morning, Chief Editor.

468
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,260
Morning.

469
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,420
Ms. Wen, I want to ask you something.

470
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:27,950
Go ahead.

471
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,980
Will there be any chances to be sent abroad for work,

472
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,660
like Africa?

473
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,380
The company's overseas business is shrinking.

474
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,740
I don't think there will be journalists sent to Africa

475
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,010
in the next two years.

476
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,850
The journalists who were dispatched

477
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,710
are returning one after another.

478
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,080
Why?

479
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,780
Do you want to go to Africa to improve yourself?

480
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,270
Ms. Wen,

481
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,270
are you sure no journalist will be sent to Africa?

482
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,930
Not if I'm still the chief editor.

483
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,580
Right.

484
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,760
Yes.

485
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,660
Nana.

486
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,900
I want to know

487
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,610
under what conditions the employee card will be demagnetized.

488
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,170
Jialan, your card is demagnetized?

489
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:07,940
No, no.

490
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,110
I'm just curious.

491
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,180
There are many reasons.

492
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,780
Besides the card being damaged, the most common one

493
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,180
is that the card holder is no longer

494
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,740
an employee.

495
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,900
So if someone quits or gets fired,

496
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,560
he or she will not be able to enter the company.

497
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,810
Thank you.

498
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,110
You are welcome.

499
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,530
What happened to me four months later?

500
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,980
Why didn't He Zhengyu tell me the truth?

501
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,960
[2022]

502
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,560
Jialan.

503
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,030
I'm here.

504
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,460
The sunshine outside is very nice today

505
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,900
and the trees are beautiful.

506
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,450
I took several photos.

507
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,390
I'll show them to you.

508
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,670
I've been reading a book recently.

509
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,200
I think there's a good sentence in the book.

510
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm reading it to you.

511
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,450
This book is written by Maugham.

512
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,710
Listen.

513
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,220
Love is the most clear-sighted,

514
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,760
though he may know,

515
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,080
cannot realise that his love will cease;

516
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,650
it gives body to what he knows, and,

517
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,330
knowing it is nothing else,

518
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,430
he loves it better than reality.

519
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,440
It makes a man a little more than himself,

520
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,720
and at the same time a little less.

521
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,380
He ceases to be himself.

522
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,680
What do you think, Jialan?

523
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,780
Do you think it's good too?

524
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,310
I'm continuing.

525
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,000
He is no longer an individual,

526
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,170
but a thing,

527
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,050
an instrument to some purpose...

528
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,910
What are you doing here?

529
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,040
I'm reading for Jialan.

530
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,840
...foreign to his ego.

531
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,750
- Maybe... -Stop it.

532
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,210
Jialan doesn't like Maugham at all.

533
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,190
She likes these.

534
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,490
Are these books for kids?

535
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,130
So what?

536
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,310
These are Jialan's favorites.

537
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,300
Although you're Jialan's boyfriend,

538
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,740
Jialan and I grew up together and

539
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,340
I know what she likes.

540
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,070
This one.

541
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,300
Jialan has always put it on her bookshelf.

542
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,360
She doesn't have the one in your hand.

543
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,230
She may like these before.

544
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,690
But Jialan is a journalist.

545
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,890
Theoretically,

546
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,780
she reads all kinds of books.

547
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,480
Theoretically?

548
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,340
Wu Anwen killed Jirong

549
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,580
and hit Jialan.

550
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,040
As Jirong's best friend,

551
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,330
Jialan's boyfriend,

552
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,610
you shouldn't be Wu Anwen's lawyer theoretically,

553
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,670
right?

554
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,970
The suspect also has human rights.

555
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,110
I'm not helping him get out of it.

556
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,040
Whether I defend him or not,

557
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,940
the law will give a fair verdict of Wu Anwen.

558
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,170
Jirong is gone.

559
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,960
Jialan is in a coma.

560
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,420
Is God fair to them?

561
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,820
How could you mention fairness?

562
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,150
Have you thought about Jirong and Jialan?

563
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:52,940
Get out!

564
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,550
Get out!

565
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,140
What are you quarreling about?

566
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,340
This is the hospital.

567
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,340
Do you really think

568
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,940
the patient is unconscious?

569
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,250
Little Bunny told her dad:

570
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,380
"I love you

571
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,510
to the moon..."

572
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,980
Then she closed her eyes.

573
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,540
"That is really far."

574
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,730
Big Bunny said.

575
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,750
"That is really far."

576
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,870
Big Bunny put Little Bunny

577
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,530
on the bed made of leaves.

578
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,440
He Zhengyu,

579
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,260
You're making Liuzhou river snails rice noodles?

580
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,530
Since you like it,

581
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,880
I'm trying to make it.

582
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,770
But I need some time

583
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,660
to get used to its smell.

584
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,430
Fried egg?

585
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,120
Try it.

586
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,200
It must be delicious.

587
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,740
A lawyer who can't make Liuzhou river snails rice noodles is not a good cook.

588
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,220
Stop talking and eat.

589
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,990
It's delicious.

590
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,470
That's good.

591
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,500
But I don't think I'm as good as you.

592
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,050
Jialan.

593
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,030
Let's have a chat.

594
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,340
Between The Moon and Sixpence

595
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,940
and Guess How Much I Love You,

596
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,740
which one do you like more now?

597
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,680
Of course is Guess How Much I Love You.

598
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,730
It has been my favorite book since I was a little girl.

599
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,000
Have you ever thought about changing to another one?

600
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,810
The book I like is like river snails rice noodles I like.

601
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,070
It will never change.

602
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,940
Just like the man I like.

603
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,110
It won't change.

604
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,740
I'll always like him.

605
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,940
What's wrong?

606
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,550
Nothing.

607
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,360
I just don't know you well.

608
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,270
Why are you suddenly so sad?

609
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,420
Are you hiding something from me?

610
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,140
No.

611
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,220
It's weird.

612
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,720
How do you know what my favorite book is?

613
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Tell me the truth.

614
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,520
I met Jiang Shenghao today.

615
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,220
We talked about the things when you were little.

616
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,680
Shouldn't we know each other better?

617
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:57,730
By the way,

618
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,490
I chatted with

619
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,520
Ms. Wen today.

620
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,100
She said our company's overseas business

621
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,460
is shrinking and

622
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,180
the team sent to Africa is coming back.

623
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,170
Besides,

624
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,890
there won't be any work in Africa in the next two years.

625
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,260
If that's the case,

626
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,630
then why will I be

627
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,020
sent to Africa

628
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,190
four months later?

629
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,660
Do you remember

630
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,860
the butterfly effect I told you before?

631
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,380
After we met,

632
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,880
there are many changes.

633
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,420
Among these changes,

634
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,480
there will be something related to your work

635
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,500
and your company's final decision.

636
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,640
By the way,

637
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,960
the other He Zhengyu sent you many messages.

638
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,220
Do you want to check it?

639
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,590
Eat.

640
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,100
Okay.

641
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,300
Eat up your noodles.

642
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,700
I'll talk to him outside.

643
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,950
You've made up your mind

644
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,280
not to tell me the truth.

645
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:07,960
Fine.

646
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,020
I'll go to iNEWS in 2022

647
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,890
and find out

648
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,890
what you're hiding from me.

649
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,350
Wu Anwen was arrested for Jirong's death.

650
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,850
Because of the case of Jirong's divorce,

651
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,520
I was kicked out of the Fengyu Law Firm by Sun Defeng

652
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,740
and moved to this apartment.

653
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,610
I told you everything.

654
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,580
Chen Jialan and I

655
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,500
are trying to change Jirong's fate.

656
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,430
I need your help.

657
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:32,960
Hello?

658
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,710
Are you listening to me?

659
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,900
Sorry.

660
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,300
There are too much information.

661
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm processing.

662
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,400
Let me make it clear.

663
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,620
All of these started with

664
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,860
Wu Anwen's gambling debt.

665
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,670
But he came to me before.

666
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,980
He said he bought stocks

667
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,020
with all the money I lent him.

668
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,950
He said it'll rise high.

669
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,000
The debt will be paid off in two months.

670
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,810
Was I cheated

671
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,550
or he didn't buy it?

672
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,840
He did buy a stock

673
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,380
called Star Beauty Clinic.

674
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,620
Its price tripled

675
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
at the end of 2021.

676
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,690
Then why?

677
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
He gambled again?

678
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:08,460
Yes.

679
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,020
At the beginning of December,

680
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,540
he met an old gambler.

681
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,230
Then he entered the casino

682
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,460
and lost all the money in the stocks.

683
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,810
I'll ask him to get the money back tomorrow.

684
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,210
The gamblers cannot be helped.

685
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,739
No, no.

686
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,370
Listen to me.

687
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,310
I know the time and place

688
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,620
they gambled

689
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,790
from Wu Anwen from 2022.

690
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,320
This is the chance to change everything.

691
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,250
What we need to do now is to wait.

692
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,790
When Wu Anwen gambles again

693
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,110
in December,

694
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,920
you report them to the police

695
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,850
and arrest them.

696
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,699
If Wu Anwen was arrested,

697
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,969
the next series of things wouldn't have happened.

698
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,080
Jirong wouldn't have died.

699
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,800
Our fate will be changed.

700
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
I understand.

701
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,560
I also want to save Jirong.

702
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,659
But it seems

703
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,860
to be an endless loop.

704
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,210
According to the grandfather paradox in the theory of time travel,

705
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,139
it seems that nothing will change.

706
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,120
He Zhengyu,

707
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,500
the reason why you are so indifferent

708
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,780
because you didn't see

709
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,080
Jirong's cold body lying in front of you,

710
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,960
You never really loved someone.

711
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,760
You don't know the pain of losing someone you love.

712
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,940
You mean Chen Jialan?

713
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,270
Yes.

714
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,040
After the case of Jirong's divorce,

715
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,340
Jirong had a big fight with Wu Anwen

716
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
on the way back.

717
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,110
Wu Anwen was not looking

718
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,500
and hit Chen Jialan.

719
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,320
She's still in a coma in the hospital.

720
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,200
Chen Jialan

721
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,180
was hit by Wu Anwen?

722
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,590
Yes.

723
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,380
He Zhengyu.

724
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,380
Please help me.

725
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,980
I know you never ask for help.

726
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,620
But I only have 46 minutes every day

727
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,060
to come back to 2021.

728
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,220
Time is limited.

729
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,190
I beg you.

730
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,900
Please help Jirong and Jialan.

731
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,550
No.

732
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,290
Jialan's card is demagnetized.

733
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,350
Where could she go?

734
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,610
Ma'am.

735
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,010
Are you a human or a ghost?

736
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,880
Of course I'm a human.

737
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,500
Yes, you are.

738
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,040
I...

739
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,500
I thought you were

740
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,980
Miss Chen who used to live upstairs.

741
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,810
You two look alike.

742
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,040
What's wrong with her?

743
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,400
You don't know it.

744
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,640
She had a car accident a few days ago.

745
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,100
What a pity.

746
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,590
She is so young.

747
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,700
Are you new here?

748
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,990
When did you move here?

749
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,700
She said she is not

750
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,820
a ghost...

751
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,790
Jialan is gone.

752
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,590
I'm worried about her.

753
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,610
Please go find her.

754
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,550
You're not in love with Chen Jialan.

755
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,590
You won't understand this feeling.

756
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,030
But I love her.

757
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,450
I don't want her to be alone in fear.

758
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,370
But I can't stay by her side forever.

759
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,650
So please,

760
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,580
can you go find her for me?

761
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,980
Why are you here?

762
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,860
What are you doing here?

763
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,960
I'm here to see if you're okay.

764
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,760
Do I look like I'm not okay?

765
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:34,900
Yes.

766
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,640
Actually, if you need,

767
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,840
I can stay with you.

No.
