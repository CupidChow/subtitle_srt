5
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,509
What's going on? I'm working.

6
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,300
Go home now.

7
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,820
Your grandma is here.

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,550
Really?

9
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,810
Let her wait for a while.

10
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,160
I'll go back after work.

11
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,060
You don't believe me?

12
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,690
Well...

13
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,600
You think I don't know what you're thinking?

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,890
I'll go back when the time-space overlap is over.

15
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,860
It's none of my business.

16
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,530
Call your grandma yourself.

17
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,579
Hello, Jialan.

18
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,380
Why haven't you come back?

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,800
Why do you work so hard?

20
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,470
What happened?

21
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,380
I don't know.

22
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,690
She came straight away.

23
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,620
She called me before she arrived

24
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,060
and I was the one who picked her up from the station.

25
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,810
Where is my grandma now?

26
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,790
She's upstairs now.

27
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,780
Hurry up and go see her.

28
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,490
I'm leaving.

29
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,980
God.

30
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,120
She would have been shocked

31
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,110
if she had encountered time-space overlap

32
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,310
and found so many things suddenly appearing in the house.

33
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:53,980
But...

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
How did... How did she get in?

35
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,000
She... She said she had the key to your apartment.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,130
My grandma has the key to my apartment.

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,980
Hurry up.

38
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
Look, it's

39
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,100
10:05 now.

40
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,070
OK.

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,630
The time-space overlap will start soon. I hope that won't scare her.

42
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,280
Grandma.

43
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,210
Grandma!

44
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,710
Grandma!

45
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,870
Where is she?

46
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,579
Grandma.

47
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,420
Where's my grandma?

48
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:42,950
Jialan.

49
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,430
Well. You two colluded with my grandma

50
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,480
to lie to me.

51
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,170
I have something to discuss with you.

52
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,770
There is nothing to discuss.

53
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,760
Just forget me, He Zhengyu.

54
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,810
Again, you two joined forces,

55
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,140
and even colluded with my grandma.

56
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,840
I really...

57
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,920
Hit him if you want.

58
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,600
He's right at home.

59
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,079
And he was the one who came up with the idea.

60
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,550
Hitting you is the same.

61
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,500
Chen Jialan.

62
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,410
What?

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,000
How many times do you want him to lose you?

64
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,480
If it weren't for the fact that I couldn't meet him,

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,340
I would have liked to have a few drinks with him.

66
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,600
A man has been dumped by the same woman

67
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,430
once, twice,

68
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,790
and even three times.

69
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,050
Why hasn't he given up yet?

70
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,650
Because he loves you so much.

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,610
Chen Jialan.

72
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,270
Stop torturing him in the name of love.

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,880
Because only I know

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,030
how proud he was.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,720
I couldn't think of a better way.

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,400
Just say what you want to say.

77
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,710
What I want to say is about the three of us.

78
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,000
I want him to hear it too.

79
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,260
Even if there is no Jirong's case, there will be other cases.

80
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,960
I was framed

81
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,230
for intentional personal injury to the other party.

82
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,510
After that, I was still fired by Fengyu Law Firm,

83
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,110
and moved to this apartment.

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,540
It's just that the time has been brought forward

85
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,450
to December 12.

86
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,390
Do you know what that case is?

87
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,880
What?

88
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,010
It is the case of Zhang Xiaojiang that

89
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,340
you are involved in now.

90
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,000
I intentionally hurt the other party?

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,670
It means that I personally hurt

92
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,300
Zhang Xiaojiang's boss, Gao Ming?

93
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,030
Impossible.

94
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,180
This is not my style of doing things.

95
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,780
But that's just the way it is.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,150
I don't understand

97
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,140
why I would meet with Gao Ming four months ago.

98
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,780
The news said it was a coincidence.

99
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,080
But no specific reason for the conflict was stated.

100
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,340
It just said that four months ago

101
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,310
I was detained by the police for seven days

102
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,840
due to assaulting Gao Ming.

103
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,920
After I was released, I was fired by Fengyu Law Firm right away.

104
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,060
Then I moved here.

105
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,610
After that, Zhang Xiaojiang did not ask me to be her attorney.

106
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,180
And she didn't find any evidence to prove that

107
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,440
Gao Ming molested her.

108
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,350
This case came to nothing in the end.

109
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,550
It's too much like a deliberate set-up.

110
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,860
So we suffered a good deal of misfortune

111
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,510
because of this case?

112
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Just like Jirong's case?

113
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,480
I'm not sure.

114
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,300
There's no evidence yet.

115
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,130
However, in terms of timeline,

116
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,610
Jialan's car accident is most likely not an accident.

117
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
Here's the thing.

118
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,830
On November 28, 2021,

119
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,380
Gao Ming called the police and said I beat him.

120
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,610
Public opinion immediately accused me of knowing the law but breaking it.

121
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,820
But we can't rule out that

122
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,850
it was deliberately arranged that way.

123
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,850
On December 10th,

124
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,600
I was fired by Fengyu Law Firm.

125
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,240
Then on December 12,

126
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,120
Jialan had a car accident.

127
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,080
And now,

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,659
you have taken the case of Zhang Xiaojiang at the same time.

129
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
It would be too coincidental

130
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,160
if all of these

131
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,500
were not caused by the same case.

132
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,910
I don't believe it's a coincidence.

133
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,780
I and you from four month ago definitely

134
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,210
found some key evidence

135
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,840
which leads us to be targeted by them.

136
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,450
By the way,

137
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,880
and Sun Defeng.

138
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,970
I vaguely feel that

139
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,080
Sun Defeng has something to do with this matter.

140
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,190
Including Jialan's car accident.

141
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,120
I don't know why,

142
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,490
but I just feel that way.

143
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,060
And this intuition is very strong.

144
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,010
After that, Gao Ming issued a statement on the Internet,

145
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,340
saying that as a senior,

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,320
a responsible

147
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,210
and conscientious entrepreneur,

148
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,380
would forgive Zhang Xiaojiang's wrongdoing.

149
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,770
Now in 2022,

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,580
Zhang Xiaojiang left Fuxing.

151
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,760
But the accusations from the internet against her have not stopped.

152
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,400
I've also been carrying the stigma of being an unscrupulous lawyer.

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,730
This is really too much for a coincidence.

154
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,860
It's like we're in a closed loop,

155
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,770
and no one can escape.

156
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,310
He Zhengyu.

157
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,260
I've told you

158
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,660
what I could find and deduce.

159
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,280
The decision is now up to you.

160
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,070
Are you still going to join me?

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,220
Yes.

162
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,380
It has already been proven that

163
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,610
even if there is no Jirong's case, there will be other cases.

164
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,260
And there will always be other cases

165
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,450
waiting for us.

166
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,670
Just like Jialan said,

167
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,980
we can't escape.

168
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,790
Then we just stay involved.

169
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,100
Now that we've become Sisyphus,

170
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,100
let's keep pushing these rocks.

171
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,650
He Zhengyu,

172
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,800
have you ever thought that

173
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,450
taking Zhang Xiaojiang's case

174
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,250
means that nothing will change.

175
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,100
Things will still happen one after another.

176
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,299
Jialan will still...

177
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,490
I don't care if others

178
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,500
call me a black-hearted lawyer

179
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,010
or an unscrupulous lawyer.

180
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,140
These do not matter.

181
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,620
As long as Jialan is safe,

182
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,220
I am willing to

183
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,600
bear any infamy.

184
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,710
He Zhengyu.

185
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,660
I said not to change anything.

186
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,680
I am the master of my own destiny.

187
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,690
Now that my topic has been approved,

188
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,770
I have to do it...

189
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,410
To change or not to change?

190
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,260
If I don't take Zhang Xiaojiang's case,

191
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,630
will Chen Jialan's fate change?

192
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,310
Get me more wine.

193
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,690
Are you thirsty?

194
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,050
Leave it here.

195
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,810
What happened?

196
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,190
Did you fall out of love?

197
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,690
Or do you have some kind of

198
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,750
terminal illness?

199
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm just thinking

200
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,480
that I've been working hard

201
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,230
for so long.

202
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,940
And there are so many people who like me,

203
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,900
but the one I like has just appeared.

204
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,040
You must be sick.

205
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,460
Yes, I am.

206
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,600
Why did I study

207
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,880
entropy increase and entropy decrease?

208
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,780
-People... -What?

209
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,040
Entropy increase and entropy decrease?

210
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,310
Forget it.

211
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,980
You won't understand even if I tell you.

212
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,420
Even if you understand,

213
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,740
your emotional intelligence isn't high enough.

214
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,860
Based on what you said,

215
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,460
your EQ is not as high as mine.

216
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,590
I'm not talking about that EQ.

217
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,640
It's about love.

218
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,130
Exchange of lives.

219
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,870
For example,

220
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,100
a bad guy kidnaps a girl.

221
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,960
I say: "don't you hurt her,

222
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,980
let her go."

223
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,510
"I'll be your hostage."

224
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,870
This is the classic plot of a police movie.

225
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,990
Now, fate is this bad guy.

226
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,270
And that hostage

227
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,410
is the girl I love.

228
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,430
And I'm

229
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,720
going to save her

230
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,770
from fate.

231
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,800
Never mind.

232
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,380
You don't even understand what entropy increase and entropy decrease are.

233
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,060
You should understand the law of conservation of energy, right?

234
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,460
Conservation of energy?

235
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,540
One life for one life.

236
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,540

237
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
If she is rescued,

238
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,540
then I might be the one who is dead

239
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,590
or perhaps someone else might.

240
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,540
Anyway, someone has to die.

241

In my opinion,

this is fate.

Didn't you doubt this before?

Don't talk about me. Just you.

258

I sure do believe in it.

I had the destiny of being a general

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,450
You still decided to divorce me?

344
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,260
I've figured out one thing these days.

345
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,500
This is my life.

346
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,600
I will accept all these good and bad things.

347
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,080
Whether Wu Anwen is a criminal or not,

348
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,430
he is my brother.

349
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,620
Jirong, you got me wrong.

350
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,270
I didn't ask you to cut ties with your brother.

351
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,350
It doesn't matter.

352
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,840
I've made up my mind.

353
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,150
I won't sign it.

354
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,410
Is it because of this marriage agreement?

355
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,260
I can wait if you need time.

356
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:28,980
Okay.

357
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,020
Sorry

358
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,520
for ruining your mood.

359
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,690
It's okay.

360
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,330
Zhengyu,

361
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,210
I've been quite busy these days.

362
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,320
So I didn't have time to buy you a birthday present.

363
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,650
Today is your birthday.

364
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,200
Happy birthday.

365
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,350
It's time for dinner. Let's have dinner together.

366
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:06,960
I can't go.

367
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,380
I haven't finished the first draft

368
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,180
of Zhang Xiaojiang's case.

369
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,030
I'm off to go.

370
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,900
By the way, happy birthday to you.

371
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,290
I'll give you the gift later.

372
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:13,660
Bye.

373
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,580
Bye.

374
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,420
Hello?

375
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,260
Hello.

376
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,660
Please help me cancel the meal ordered by Mr. He.

377
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,380
OK.

378
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,210
Sir,

379
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,860
what about the birthday cake?

380
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,870
Birthday cake...

381
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,880
It's yours now.

382
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,800
[The beauty of the world...]

383

...is intertwined with you.

384
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,340
I haven't finished it.

Jialan.

412
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,200
Where are you going?

413
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,650
Why are you here?

414
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,870

♫How can I stop flipping?♫

416

I knew you were here.

417
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
So after time-space overlap, I came to you right away.

418
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,020
So you didn't see what I wrote?

419
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,320
What?

420
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,780
♫You are the light shining♫

421
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,420

♫And warming my eyes♫

423
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,690
Is it "The world is beautiful, but you are unhappy with your life"?

00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,940
♫At the end of the world♫

425
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,810
It's "Intertwined with you".

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,070
I just lit the candle.

430
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,100
I knew you wouldn't go far,

431
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,980
♫And staying in my heart♫

432
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,910
so I came from the back balcony to find you.

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,290
Jialan,

434
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,730
will you stay with me on my birthday?

435
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,230
♫Spend dust and dawn with you♫

436
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,490
You have insisted on studying entropy increase.

437
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,140
We have never celebrated each other's birthdays

438
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,650
from the time we met to the time we fell in love.

♫You will know that♫

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,230
Let's go.

445
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,060
These candles are about to go out. Just make a wish!

446
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,170
-Hurry up. -Together.

447

To be able to kiss you again.

Be serious.

465
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,470
My wish is that

466
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,300
Chen Jialan

467
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,350
can cherish every day of her life

468
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,180
and devote her limited life

469
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,340
to her unlimited work

470
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,270
and love.

471
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,030
Liar.

472
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,740
You are saying that on purpose.

473
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
The fact that you have refused Xiaojiang's case

474
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,220
means that you want to change.

475
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,950
That was the me four months ago.

476
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,270
Please note that

477
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,040
I am the only official spokesperson appointed by me.

478
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,100
I'm not going to take any consequences for him.

479
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,020
Besides, I've figured it out.

480
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,370
I respect your choice.

481
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,210
Really?

482
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,370
Why would I lie to you

483
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,670
at this time?

484
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,470
I just want to spend every day with you

485
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,000
before entropy increases.

486
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,740
To put it pessimistically and positively,

487
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,290
why would we worry about the future

488
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,550
when we have no future?

489
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,910
Also, don't avoid me

490
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,670
because you don't want to change.

491
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,680
There are still many things we haven't done together.

492
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,340
We should get every thing done

493
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,980
while there is still time.

494
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,570
Some things are the simplest of routines

495
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,820
for others.

496
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,660
But for us,

497
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,150
it's something we want to do but can't.

498
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,520
I regret that

499
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,630
the first thing I see every morning when I wake up

500
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,840
is not you,

501
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,130
and that I can't hold you to sleep

502
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,820
after saying good night every day.

503
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,530
We can't have breakfast together

504
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,330
and can't brush teeth together.

505
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,220
I regret that

506
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,120
you can't go through all kinds of things in life with me.

507
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,940
Whatever you want to do in the future,

508
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,070
I will do it with you.

509
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,900
Let's not leave any regrets.

510
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,600
So good.

511
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,350
There.

00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,090
[2021]

514
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,060
Jialan.

515
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,920
I have no regrets in my life to meet you.

516
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,330
But precisely because I met you,

517
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,020
I feel so regretful.

518
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,490
So, Zhengyu.

519
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,670
We should cherish the remaining time

520
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,900
and leave no regrets.

521
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,160
Miss Zhang, this way, please.

522
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,350
[Chen Jialan]

523
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,350
[Come to my office now.]

524
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,960
What's the matter?

525
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:24,870
Sit down.

526
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,540
Why did she ask Sun Defeng to represent her?

527
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,220
Wasn't it because you rejected Zhang Xiaojiang?

528
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,140
We were unable to find a right lawyer

529
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,450
to represent her

530
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,710
for a long time before.

531
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,750
Gao Ming is a well-known person.

532
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,370
Those lawyers probably wouldn't want to offend him.

533
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,630
I wonder how Sun Defeng

534
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,440
got the news.

535
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,460
He directly called Zhang Xiaojiang

536
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,990
and said that he would like to be her attorney.

537
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,020
Why would Zhang Xiaojiang

538
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,990
hire Sun Defeng?

539
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,650
I know him well.

540
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,110
He is so greedy.

541
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,130
Instead of helping Gao Ming,

542
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,040
he chose to help Zhang Xiaojiang.

543
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,590
Do you think it's possible?

544
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,600
Go and stop her

545
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,580
before they sign a contract now.

546
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,480
Sun Defeng gave Zhang Xiaojiang a detailed analysis

547
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,420
and guaranteed that

548
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,620
he could win the case.

549
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,730
It's her last chance.

550
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,290
What should I do to stop her?

551
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,830
And she needs a lawyer.

552
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,100
Alright, listen to me.

553
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,450
He guaranteed that he would win the case.

554
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,670
What lawyer would dare to say that?

555
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,850
Wasn't it because you rejected her?

556
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,160
What else could she do?

557
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,660
Well. You should talk to her about this.

558
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,770
I can't do that.

559
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,830
It has to be you.

560
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,530
You must think about it

561
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,550
before she signs the contract.

562
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,770
Call her

563
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,220
if you change your mind.

564
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,970
She has always trusted you.

565
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,270
Chen Jialan.

566
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,560
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

567
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,550
It turns out that your purpose is this.

568
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,840
I'm leaving.

569
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,320
By the way,

570
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
wasn't it your birthday yesterday?

571
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
This is a belated birthday present.

572
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,390
You don't like it?

573
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,540
Okay, I'm off to go.

574
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,880
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

575
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,510
You are so professional.

576
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,310
I'll think about it.

577
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,740
I'll get back to you in a couple of days about signing the contract.

578
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,810
Okay, I'll wait for your reply.

579
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,300
Okay.

580
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,460
I also assure you that

581
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,320
I will try my best to win this case.

582
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,320
Let me walk you to the elevator.

583
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,950
No need.

584
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,420
It's okay.

585
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,190
Thank you.

586
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,500
I can vaguely feel that

587
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,080
Sun Defeng has something to do with this.

588
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,420
Including Jialan's car accident.

589
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,680
I wonder how Sun Defeng

590
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,460
got the news.

591
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,580
He directly called Zhang Xiaojiang

592
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,140
and said that he would like to be her attorney.

593
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,210
And he guaranteed that

594
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,540
he could win the case.

595
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,970
[Miss Zhang, I've thought about it.]

596
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,500
Hello, Miss Zhang.

597
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,390
Go ahead.

598
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,280
-Hello, Mr. Sun. -Sorry, Mr. Sun.

599
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,260
After careful consideration,

600
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,700
I still think that Mr. He

601
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,710
is more suitable to be my attorney.

602
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,300
I'm so sorry about this.

603
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,170
It's okay.

604
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,740
Whoever you choose to be your lawyer

605
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,560
is your right.

606
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,180
He Zhengyu is excellent

and he is my partner.

608

I am sure

609
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,940
he will be able to win the case for you.

610
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,170
Mr. Sun,

611

you're really noble.

You're welcome.

00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I'm Wu Jirong.

683
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,830
Miss Wu,

684
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,600
do you have any plans for your future career

685
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,440
after your comeback?

686
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,580
Are you going to quit the industry in the future?

687
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,159
No.

688
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,540
I will focus my work

689
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,120
on quality film and television works.

690
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,420
I think a good work

691
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,260
is the foundation of an actor.

692
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,400
Since you have chosen to make a comeback,

693
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,320
could you please tell us about your marital status?

694
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,610
Are the rumors about your divorce true?

695
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,380
I'm sorry, Miss Wang.

696
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,780
We've talked about this before.

697
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,420
Please do not ask such questions.

698
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,679
You might need to change the question.

699
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,280
It's okay.

700
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,110
Yeah.

701
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
I think

702
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,889
I really should have given everyone an explanation.

703
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,830
Since you've asked this question,

704
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,620
I'll take this opportunity

705
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,260
to tell you about my current situation.

706
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,340
Thank you for your concern.

707
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
This is not a hype.

708
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,409
As for the rumors of my divorce,

709
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,140
they are true.

710
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,950
But it wasn't because of my brother.

711
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,740
It was because I finally figured out

712
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,140
the direction of my life.

713
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,840
I chose to start over.

714
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,280
In fact,

715
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,050
it was a big blow to your career that

716
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,300
you and Mr. Jiang Shenghao got married and divorced so quickly.

717
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,830
Have you ever regretted it?

718
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,080
Actually, I'm grateful to Mr. Jiang,

719
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,220
who gave me a very happy

720
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,820
and unforgettable relationship experience.

721
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,840
It's just that within this marriage,

722
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
we both realized that

723
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,780
love alone is not enough.

724
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,240
So it's indeed a pity.

725
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,690
Neither of us was able to

726
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,290
make the other really happy.

727
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,050
But to be honest,

728
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,900
I have no regrets

729
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,620
about this marriage.

730
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,990
It's just that there is still a long way to go,

731
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,300
and I choose to go on my own.

732
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,090
I also wish him all the best.

733
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,140
Meng Jianguo?

734
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,860
Hello, I'm He Zhengyu.

735
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm Zhang Xiaojiang's lawyer.

736
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,950
It'll only take you five minutes.

737
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,750
I want to ask you a few questions.

738
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,980
You have been working for Gao Ming for ten years,

739
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,580
why did you suddenly resign?

740
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,260
Ridiculous.

741
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,620
Can't I quit my job whenever I want?

742
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,020
Have you had any conflict

743
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,760
with Gao Ming recently?

744
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,050
Nope.

745
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,080
I just want to find a stable job

746
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,750
and spend more time at home with my daughter.

747
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,160
You haven't wanted to spend time with your daughter for ten years,

748
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,630
and now suddenly you do?

749
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,010
Is there a problem?

750
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,470
My daughter was sick the other day

751
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,620
and wanted me to spend more time with her.

752
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,020
I then made the decision.

753
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,460
You did it because of Zhang Xiaojiang's matter, right?

754
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,570
You're overthinking it.

755
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,750
There were only three of you in the car.

756
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,270
You must have seen it all.

757
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,290
I advise you

758
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,680
not to commit the crime of concealing.

759
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,730
Concealing?

760
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,700
There were only three people in the car that day, and I saw them all.

761
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,440
I have to

762
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,430
testify for Mr. Gao.

763
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,490
It was Zhang Xiaojiang who framed him.

764
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,690
I don't understand why people nowadays

765
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,260
like to make news out of fictional things

766
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,070
and falsely accuse others.

767
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,310
Mr. Meng,

768
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,970
with the current means of investigation,

769
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,550
the police will find out

770
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,350
the truth soon.

771
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,190
Mr. He,

772
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,890
are you threatening me?

773
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,250
Five minutes is up.

774
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,130
I'm going to pick up my daughter.

775
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:55,010
[November 27, 2021]

776
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,230
Framing...

777
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,010
He framed me.

778
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,220
Meng Jianguo

779
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,940
knew the truth.

780
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,400
But he helped Gao Ming lie.

781
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,950
Jiang, calm down.

782
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,930
The more popular this matter is on the Internet,

783
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,340
the more calm you should be as a party.

784
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,410
Jialan is right.

785
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,460
If Meng Jianguo was indeed lying,

786
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,910
it would be a wake-up call for us.

787
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,420
He was so active in helping Gao Ming hide the truth,

788
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,250
which means there must be something wrong.

789
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,620
For example, he took a hush fee,

790
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,830
or something else.

791
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,050
We have to hurry up and investigate on it.

792
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,050
If we don't announce the progress in time,

793
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,870
the public opinion will be reversed immediately.

794
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,510
This will be even more detrimental to Jiang.

795
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,000
I see.

796
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,790
I'll go back to the law firm later

797
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,070
to put together

798
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,020
our existing chain of evidence.

799
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:40,940
And this.

800
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,350
This is the video of that night.

801
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,420
You can take a look.

802
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,130
The video that night?

803
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,740
What video?

804
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,170
Surveillance footage of your neighbor's smart doorbell.

805
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,490
See it?

806
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,600
Yes.

807
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,290
It's reasonable and integrity.

808
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,310
She's such a good writer.

809
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,710
She should come and write legal documents.

810
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,060
What are you talking about?

811
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm talking about Zhang Xiaojiang's Weibo.

812
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,860
Now the hits on this Weibo post are going up like crazy.

813
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,260
It will definitely be on the trending list.

814
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,150
Am I right?

815
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,660
This Weibo post was written by another writer.

816
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,760
Who is it?

817
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,200
So beautiful.

818
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,720
It turns out that there are not only stars in the sky,

819
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,980
but also on the ground.

820
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,160
Maybe each of us is a star.

821
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,340
We are on earth when we are alive,

822
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,720
and become stars in the sky when we die.

823
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,630
So which one will I be?

824
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,760
Jialan,

825
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,140
you are a star on the ground.

826
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,340
You are not in the sky.

827
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,000
Why did you suddenly bring me here

828
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,990
today?

829
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,320
We agreed to

830
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,330
go to your world on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,

831
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,240
and to mine on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

832
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,950
You also said that

833
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,920
you want to see every corner of Fuxing City.

834
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,560
That was all my joke.

835
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,000
I'll do it all

836
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,730
if you say so.

837
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,460
I will make every one of your wishes come true.

838
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:13,890
So silly.

839
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,570
Unfortunately, the time-space overlap is too short.

840
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,440
I was thinking

841
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,870
how can I let you have every corner?

842
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,620
The best way is to

843
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,290
put them all into your eyes at once.

844
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:43,880
What?

845
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,220
Are you going to put me in your eyes too?

846
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,820
I put you here.

847
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,570
Jialan.

848
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,800
This is the first time I've been this high.

849
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,300
Me too.

850
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,400
It's also my first time.
