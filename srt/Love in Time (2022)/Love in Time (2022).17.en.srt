Stay away from me.

176
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,570
You'll get infected.

177
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm not afraid.

178
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,780
Brother, I'm fine.

179
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,410
I'll go see Jiang Shenghao.

180
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,780
Slow down.

181
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,780
Brother.

182
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,430
Thank you.

183
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,810
Brother.

184
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,510
What happened?

185
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,620
He went to a business dinner and got drunk.

186
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,500
Jirong was worried

187
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,160
and asked me to bring him back.

188
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,910
Brother.

189
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,740
Go back and rest early.

190
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:38,900
All right.

191
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,300
I have to listen to

192
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,050
what my precious sister said.

193
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,830
Jialan, I'm fine.

194

Go back.

195

Are you really OK?

196
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,540
Yes.

197
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:49,950
Brother.

198
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,280
Go back early.

199
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,490
OK, I'll watch you go back first.

200
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,420
I'm going to bed.

201
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,710
OK.

202
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,320
It's OK.

Go back.

204
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,390
You're cuter when you're drunk.

205
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,650
Don't sleep on your back.

206
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,400
You might suffocate if you throw up.

207
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,680
Don't worry, brother.

208
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,420
OK, Jialan. I'm going back too.

209
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,120
Go to bed early.

Why did he leave?

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,740
You thought I was leaving. Are you worried?

217
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,070
Admit it.

218
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,020
We can't be separated.

It is impossible.

I can't do it anyway.

When I sent Shenghao back,

Jirong was worried about him.

268
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,460
She asked me to take a photo

Are you still reporting the entertainment section?

I have to meet a client later.

It's rather presumptuous of me to ask you out suddenly today.

291
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,520
Last month you asked me

292
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,340
to join hands against He Zhengyu.

293
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,080

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,980
Why did you suddenly

297
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,590
change your attitude towards him?

298
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,110
And why did you suddenly contact me?

I'm just thinking about how to say it.

I also regard him as my own brother.

312
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,530
But recently,

313
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,400
he and my brother-in-law Jiang Shenghao

314
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,420
joined hands against Jirong.

315
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,990
Maybe it's because the Jiang family is rich

316
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,740
and gave him more benefits.

317

He Zhengyu

318
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,880
has always been keen on money.

319
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,470
He's like a shark seeing blood when he sees money.

320

He broke up our partnership for money.

321

He played dirty behind my back.

Yes.

324
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,220
He even asked an audit team to investigate me.

325
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,110
To be honest,

326
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,260
he just wanted to kick me out

327
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,750
and occupy the law firm.

328
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,940
My experience is similar to yours.

329
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,130
My sister and I trusted him so much.

330

Just get to the point.

331
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:16,610
OK.

332
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,560
I won't beat around the bush with you.

You asked me

334
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,080
to join hands against him?

335
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,550
I was wondering

336
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,400
if you had something on him.

337
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,770
Because my life

338
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,910
has been really hard because of him.

339
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,890

He has a long view.

If I had something on him,

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,680
I would have kicked him out long ago.

No.

00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,330
If you say so, I believe you.

347
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,780
Go and see Jirong.

348
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,520
Maybe she hasn't eaten yet.

349
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,140
Can you do it alone?

350
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,950
You don't know if I can do it?

351
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,320
Hurry up.

352
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,670
OK, go upstairs.

353
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
Let me know if you need anything.

354
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,210
OK. You're so annoying.

355
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,030
By the way.

356
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,440
Chen Jialan,

357
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,580
don't break up with him and disappear

358
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,780
at the least provocation.

359
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,300
No matter how much he likes you,

360
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,360
if you keep doing it, he'll get tired.

361
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,990
Whose side are you on?

362
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,950
Your side, of course.

363
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,960
But if you ever do it again,

364
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,540
you can only go to my house.

365
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,760
Don't run around alone.

366
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,900
Don't think too much.

367
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,700
Do you hear me?

368
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,300
Got it.

369
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,930
I will cherish He Zhengyu.

370
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,560
And I heard what you said.

371
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,790
I know you've been in

372
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,860
a lot of trouble recently

373
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,220
because of work and Jirong.

374
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,480
Why would I bother you with these things?

375
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,120
I really...

376
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,220
I really don't know what to say.

377
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,220
What are you talking about?

378
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,490
There is no need to say anything.

379
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,180
Go upstairs now.

380
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,210
I got goose bumps.

381
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,170
I'm leaving.

382
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,900
Bye.

383
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,810
Take care.

384
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,500
Bye.

385
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,230
How did the photos come out?

386
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:30,850
Look.

387
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,530
Photos of them hugging.

388
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,960
I captured all.

389
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,970
Let me see yours.

390
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,500
Good.

391
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,140
Very good.

392
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,190
Perfect.

393
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,030
Brother.

394
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,000
The Jiang family is so rich.

395
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,860
Why does he keep her

396
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,070
in such a shabby neighborhood?

397
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,090
What do you know?

398
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,750
This is the low profile of rich people.

399
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,700
So low profile.

400
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,460
♫All for love. When I come across you♫

401
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,400
♫Just for love. I am waiting for you♫

♫Everything is for love♫

404
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,900
That's not right. I just came back like this?

405
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,500
♫It's like something has changed♫

406
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,830
It's embarrassing.

407
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,380
♫We've seen each other before, but I'm missing you again♫

408
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,040
♫Every action you make♫

409
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,400
♫Every memory about you♫

410
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,690
♫Will touch me♫

411
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,470
♫So thrilling♫

412
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,500
♫Don't waste any more time♫

413
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,810
There will be no signal later.

414
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,350
♫Traces of love are slowly surfacing♫

415
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,900
♫Maybe there is something special♫

416
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,040
♫Between us♫

417
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,930
♫Just be brave and come a little closer♫

418
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,930
♫All for love. When I come across you♫

419
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,660

00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,250

♫Everything is for love. I am waiting for you♫

422
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,600
Surprise.

423
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,520
Are we in sync on this?

424
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,800
Of course.

425
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,850
He Zhengyu.

426
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,560
Let's record the content of our dates

427
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:48,980
in the future.

428
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,000
Sure.

429
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,170
Come on.

430
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:04,710
Hello.

431
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,480
Welcome to the couple's channel of

432
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,110
Chen Jialan and He Zhengyu.

433
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,080
No.

434
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,810
We're recording for ourselves.

435
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,840
We are not video bloggers.

436
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,340
We can be each other's blogger.

437
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,240
I'm your blogger.

438
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,300
You are my blogger.

439
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,300
Please introduce yourself.

440
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,740
Hello, everyone.

441
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,220
I'm He Zhengyu.

442
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,060
Let's play a game.

443
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,210
It's a test of synchronicity.

444
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,610
What do you think?

445
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,040
OK.

446
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,750
How about this?

447
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,870
Let's

448
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,000
ask each other a question.

449
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,350
Three, two, one.

450
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,620
We'll say the answer at the same time.

451
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:42,980
OK.

452
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,830
OK.

453
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,400
What do you like about each other?

454
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,050
Three, two, one.

455
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,950
-You're smart. -You're brave.

456
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,430
Are we in sync on this

457
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,390
or not?

458
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,310
But I like your answer.

459
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,280
Your answer is not satisfactory.

460
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,030
Why didn't you say I'm pretty?

461
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,660
If I say I like you

462
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,010
because you're pretty,

463
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,290
will you be angry?

464
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:11,970
Yes.

465
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,070
OK, next question.

466
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,130
Let's play...

467
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,380
Think of a word.

468
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,300
When we say it out,

469
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,940
we have to show it with our bodies.

470
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,800
What time is it?

471
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,340
I'll say one.

472
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,300
Take a shower.

473
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,490
You...

474
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,260
When you take a shower,

475
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,780
of course you have to wash your back.

476
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
Play basketball.

477
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,000
Eat.

478
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,510
Sleep.

479
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,820
Who is the other's favorite singer?

480
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,710
Three, two, one.

481
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,300
-Jacky Cheung. -Jay Chou.

482
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,590
I don't like Jacky Cheung.

483
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,760
What is your favorite city?

484
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,270
-Dalian. -Nanjing.

485
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,720
-Green. -Blue.

486
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,620
What's my favorite lipstick color?

487
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,280
Three, two.

488
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,990
Lipstick color?

489
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,590
I really can't spin anymore.

490
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,790
I feel like vomiting.

491
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,820
Now that you mention it, I feel a little dizzy too.

492
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,530
I feel like vomiting too.

493
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,370
Does that mean we have one thing in sync?

494
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:25,570
Jialan.

495
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,050
Our biggest synchronicity is that we like each other.

496
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,140
Hello, come in.

497
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,620
Hello, I'd like to buy some flowers.

498
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,350
Please come in.

499
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,420
There are many kinds of flowers inside.

500
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,350
Why does this woman buy flowers early in the morning?

501
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,740
It's better than staying at home.

502
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,600
They just arrived in the morning.

503
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,600
What kind of flowers do you like?

504
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,390
OK.

505
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,780
She's already inside. We can't get a picture anymore.

506
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,710
Let's go in and see what's going on.

507
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,030
Give it to me.

508
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,520
Be careful.

509
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
Listen to her.

510
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,260
OK.

511
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,120
Hello, welcome.

512
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,000
Please wait a moment.

513
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,650
It's OK. Go ahead.

514
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,050
I'm just looking around.

515
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,820
Hello, can you help me make a simple bouquet?

516
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,300
My friend is hospitalized.

517
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,420
I want to pay a visit.

518
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:29,900
OK.

519
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,380
Is she a girl?

520
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,030
Yes.

521
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,140
I suggest you don't give her white

522
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,110
or blue flowers.

523
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,180
Gladiolas, carnations and roses are recommended.

524
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,140
If mixed,

525
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,540
it would be a good choice.

526
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,760
Then it's up to you.

527
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,400
OK.

528
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,700
Please take a seat.

529
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,960
I'll go pack it for you.

530
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,700
Thank you.

531
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,390
I'm speechless.

532
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,670
What did she say?

533
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,340
She said the flowers are for a female friend.

534
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,850
Does she mean Wu Jirong?

535
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,550
The news said Wu Jirong had appendicitis.

536
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,090
No way!

537
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,880
The mistress goes to see the wife?

538
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,410
That's why I'm speechless.

539
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,540
Please come again. Take care.

540
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,740
Jirong, sorry.

541
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,700
I caught a cold two days ago. I didn't come to see you.

542
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,540
It's OK.

543
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,880
Shenghao told me that

544
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,400
you and Zhengyu are on-again-off-again.

545
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,810
You're so childish.

546
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,360
But it's good that you've made up now.

547
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,130
[A-lister is sick on bed, while her husband passionately kisses her mistress.]

548
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,060
Here.

549
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,220
What's wrong?

550
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,110
Jirong.

551
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,160
This...

552
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,990
This is He Zhengyu.

553
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,360
We made up at your home yesterday.

554
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
These paparazzi

555
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,780
will do whatever they can

556
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,820
to make things up for their performance.

557
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,020
Seriously, they really need to be sued.

558
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,460
Who needs to be sued?

559
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,220
You think you can sue anyone

560
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,170
just because you have a lawyer boyfriend?

561
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,500
You said it was Zhengyu?

562
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,820
Here, take a look.

563
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
Where is Zhengyu?

564
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,600
You rushed into my room to record a video that day

565
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,330
to frame me and Jiang Shenghao.

566
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,310
You released that news too, right?

567
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,350
It doesn't matter

568
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,630
who released the news.

569
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,610
Jialan,

570
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,470
you're still young.

571
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,220
It's not scary to do something wrong.

572
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,650
But you have to be responsible

573
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,980
and admit your mistake.

574
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:48,880
Tell me.

575
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,190
When Jirong and Shenghao just got married,

576
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,500
some media said that

577
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,180
you and Jiang Shenghao

578
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,650
had history.

579
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,480
We didn't want to believe it.

580
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,880
But now?

581
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,760
How can we trust you?

582
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,460
That's not Jiang Shenghao.

583
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,770
That's He Zhengyu.

584
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,060
And the news last time

585
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,540
was fabricated by paparazzi.

586
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,940
How can it be considered evidence?

587
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,500
He Zhengyu

588
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,580
came a few minutes before you.

589
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,389
When you sent Jiang Shenghao back,

590
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,790
He Zhengyu was in my room.

591
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,820
How can you lie with your eyes open?

592
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,739
See for yourself where Zhengyu is.

593
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,719
Is he there? Is he?

594
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,090
Enough, stop arguing.

595
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,780
There's a CCTV in front of my house.

596
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,090
We will know whether Zhengyu has come or not

597
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,159
by checking the CCTV.

598
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,219
Yes, there's CCTV.

599
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,739
We can check the CCTV.

600
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,710
OK, I'll go with you.

601

No?

Or she will misunderstand Jiang Shenghao.

But I've told Jirong

651

I worked overtime. I've never seen you.

652
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,420
You went to Jiang Shenghao's in the middle of the night.

653
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,750
It could be big or small.

654
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,810
To put it in a small way, it is a disturbance.

655
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,180
To put it in a big way, it is trespassing.

656

in such a complicated way?

People think we are a couple.

659
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,270
Isn't it normal

660
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,780
for couples to fight?

661
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,680
You're a lawyer.

662
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,060
You want to make up with your girlfriend,

663
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,460
but you're embarrassed.

664
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,790
That's why you went secretly.

665
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,330
Isn't that reasonable?

666
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,220

Don't interrupt.

You sneaked into Jiang Shenghao's house.

But when you heard the sound,

670
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,480
you hid behind the curtains.

671
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,610
When Jirong asked you,

672
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,700
you didn't know there was a mistress.

673
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,450
That's why you lied to her

674
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,520
and didn't tell her the truth.

675
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,980
You're making it too easy.

676

the sudden disappearance of He Zhengyu?

678

I haven't figured it out yet.

I don't understand why he was not photographed

at the front and back doors of Jiang Shenghao's house.

681

How did he show up?

682
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,120
You came to me without a plausible story?

683
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,380
I came to discuss with you.

684
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,180
Two heads are better than one, right?

685
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,520
But am I in this group?

686
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,840
Why did you drag me in?

687
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,590
We're in a special situation. We should overcome difficulties together.

688
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,090
I did this to protect

689
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,700
the marriage between Shenghao and Jirong.

690
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,500
Consider it a favor to yourself.

691
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,090
First,

692
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,780
you may not know

693
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,310
we're not close enough

694
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,720
to share weal and woe.

695
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,640
Second,

696
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,520
you may not know me.

697
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,270
I hate it when people arrange my schedule.

698
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,420
No.

699
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,980
No, He Zhengyu.

700
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,870
He Zhengyu.

701
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,540
This matter not only concerns

702
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,600
me and He Zhengyu from four months later.

703
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,870
It's also concerns whether we can save Jirong.

704
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,940
If Jirong believes that Jiang Shenghao cheated on her,

705
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,000
she will divorce him.

706
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Then the situation will be

707
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,530
exactly the same as before.

708
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,410
I'll think of another way.

709
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,720
What way?

710
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,880
The other He Zhengyu and I

711
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,720
have tried all the ways.

712
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,480
But we're still at this stage.

713
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,610
If I had any other way,

714
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,930
I won't come to you.

715
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:21,940
Fine.

716
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,090
Let me ask you.

717
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,670
Jiang Shenghao's affair

718
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,400
is the trigger for their divorce.

719
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,520
In 2022,

720
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,920
Jiang Shenghao cheated with Chen Kexin.

721
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,490
You solved the problem of Chen Kexin.

722
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,560
But you became the one who cheated with him.

723
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,980
Nothing has changed.

724
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,640
Did it occur to you that

725
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,130
this might not work?

726
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:40,980
Fine.

727
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,540
Even if I help you this time,

728
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,140
how can you be sure that

729
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,990
Jiang Shenghao wouldn't cheat with someone else?

730
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,390
You're right.

731
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,870
I can't be sure.

732
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,640
I know you believed that

733
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,270
the future can't be changed.

734
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,730
If that's the case,

735
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,460
I would have stayed in a coma

736
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,380
in 2022.

737
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,270
Anyway,

738
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,410
no matter what happens,

739
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,190
He Zhengyu and I will try our best

740
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,170
to make up and change.

741
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,080
Even if we can only change a little,

742
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,540
we will still try our best.

743
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,340
You've never experienced this.

744
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,310
I really put you on the spot by coming to you.

745
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,650
Sorry to have bothered you.

746
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,200
Hello, Ms. Wen.

747
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,350
What can I do for you?

748
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,060
Jialan,

749
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,060
don't come to the company for now.

750
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,700
A lot of media and fans of Wu Jirong

751
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,960
gathered downstairs.

752
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,850
Take a break.

753
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,770
Ms. Wen.

754
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,750
Try not to confront them head-on.

755
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,210
Leave the rest to me.

756
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,500
These public accounts

757
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,730
have no bottom line.

758
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,970
The same thing happened last time.

759
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,540
They made up stories

760
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,800
to mislead the public.

761
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,800
It's the same this time.

762
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,790
I won't go easy on them.

763
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,720
I'm going to sue those who spread the rumor

764
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,980
and let them take legal responsibility.

765
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,260
Jirong.

766
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,910
You didn't suspect me of cheating with Jialan, did you?

767
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,200
Did you drink too much last night?

768
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,120
I had a business dinner yesterday. I had a few drinks.

769
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,730
But these two things are not related.

770
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,190
Calm down.

771
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,630
I believe there's nothing between you and Chen Jialan.

772
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,630
I also believe your feelings for me.

773
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,090
But sometimes people are not rational

774
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,350
when it comes to alcohol.

775
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,260
You also told me

776
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,510
you drank too much

777
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,240
and didn't remember anything.

778
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,570
Could it be that you mistook her for me?

779
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,130
That's my sister.

780
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,600
That's Chen Jialan.

781
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,620
We grew up together.

782
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,280
How can I not tell you from her?

783
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,980
What do you have in common?

784
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,740
Besides,

785
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,130
even if I'm drunk,

786
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,160
Chen Jialan must be sober.

787
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,410
Chen Jialan said the person in the photo was He Zhengyu.

788
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,740
But I asked Zhengyu.

789
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,230
He didn't see Chen Jialan last night.

790
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,460
This is impossible. This is definitely Zhengyu.

791
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,850
How could it be me?

792
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,120
Who else could it be?

793
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,400
You're still quibbling in front of Jirong.

794
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,800
Chen Jialan admitted it.

795
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,980
I thought about it.

796
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,740
I don't want Jirong to die.

797
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,960
On this point,

798
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,860
we have reached a consensus.

799
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,470
One more thing,

800
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,370
whether I admit it or not,

801
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,680
you're in a relationship with me from four months later.

802
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,340
No matter how I explain it,

803
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,900
most people won't believe that

804
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,960
we have nothing to do with each other.

805
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,330
Based on the above two,

806
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,980
I accept your suggestion.

807
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,230
No.

808
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,020
I really don't understand lawyers like you.

809
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,380
It's such a simple thing,

810
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,110
but you made it so complicated.

811
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,410
Because there's something more important.

812
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,870
The public opinion online

813
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,300
has already assumed that

814
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,050
Jiang Shenghao had an affair.

815
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,840
Even if I stand up

816
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,320
and admit that the person in the photo is me,

817
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
people will think

818
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,660
the Jiang family is behind the scenes

819
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,370
and let me take the blame.

820
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,580
You work in the media.

821
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,710
You should know that

822
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,510
the public opinion online...

823
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,510
People are still willing to believe

824
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,680
the so-called truth they believe.

825
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,980
I understand.

826
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,900
You don't understand.

827
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,020
What I want to tell you is that

828
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,220
don't check the public opinion online.
