Jialan.

Check Zhang Xiaojiang's Weibo.

It has been shared 100,000 times.

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,930
Zhang Xiaojiang's Weibo has been shared 100,000 times?

10
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,970
Yes, you heard it right.

11
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,780
Come to the office now.

12
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,300
OK. See you in the office.

Hey!

What are you doing?

16
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,890
How could you not know

17
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,440
there's a CCTV beforehand?

18
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,010
How could you let this thing

19
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,460
be revealed on the Internet?

20
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,820
Get the PR, paid posters,

21
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,250
and the media to cover it up.

22
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,500
I don't care how you do it.

Hello.

27
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,060
I want to speak to Mr. Gao.

28

29

It doesn't matter.

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,579
What matters is that I know

31
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,100
Mr. Gao is very dangerous.

32
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,850
Watch your mouth.

33
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,300
Give it to me.

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,150
Hello.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,040
Mr. Gao,

36
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,610
I just want to remind you that

37
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,370
Zhang Xiaojiang is not capable

38
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,020
to make you so passive.

39
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,900
What do you mean?

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,730
It's her lawyer He Zhengyu.

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,340
He Zhengyu?

42
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,850
Why is it him again?

43
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,790
How did it go?

44
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,160
It's already on air.

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,140
Thank you, Jialan.

46
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,190
You worked all night.

47
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,590
Liu, aren't you the same?

48
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,940
Yesterday, Miss Zhang released another Weibo

49
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,579
with the video recorded by the intelligent doorbell

50
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,550
to respond to the doubts online.

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,980
After the video was released,

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,910
the netizens stopped questioning

53
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,990
how Miss Zhang entered the house

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,220
and whether Miss Zhang offered an invitation.

55
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,930
Listen.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,579
This must be the number one online.

57
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,250
Don't forget to buy me bubble tea.

58
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,060
Of course.

Many netizens began to

60
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,670
criticize Mr. Gao's shameful behaviour openly.

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,670
There are more and more people supporting Miss Zhang.

62
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:04,820
Hello?

63

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,780

72
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:31,890
Miss.

73
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,030

Welcome.

76
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,460
Sorry, I'm late.

77
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,130
What are we doing here?

78
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,310
Try this wedding dress on.

79
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,940
Isn't this the one in the closet?

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,360
He ordered it.

81
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,750
No need.

82
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,980
I just took a look when I was passing by.

83
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,570
One glance is worth ten thousand years.

84
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,550
I mean

85
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,940
it costs ten thousand yuan to take a glance.

86
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,000
This wedding dress looks expensive.

87
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,840
It's not a loss to try it on.

88
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,790
And he asked me to try on his dress.

89
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,970
We have to hurry up.

90
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,250
He wants to try too.

91
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,940
Judging from his tone,

92
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,800
you're getting married tonight.

93
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,990
Should I give you a gift?

94
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,880
Of course.

95
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,560
But don't come in person.

96
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,830
Excuse me.

97
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,110
Please help her try on this.

98
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,440
Okay.

99
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,060
Thank you.

100
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,600

101
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,090
OK.

103
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,420
He seems to be slimmer than you now.

104
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,130
Sir,

105
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,350
how about these two?

106
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,550
Personally, I recommend this navy blue suit.

107
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,880
It matches your fiancee's wedding dress.

108
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,670
Personally, I prefer grey.

109
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,270
And because I'm fat,

110
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,720
the loose one suits me better.

111
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,340
But the key is the cheap price.

112
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,780
Sir, you're funny.

113

Are these all ours?

175
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,820
Yes, the man came with you

176
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,760
ordered them.

177
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,180
Please enjoy.

178
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,290
He's exaggerating.

179
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

180
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,580
Didn't you say we'll leave after casually eating something?

181
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,810
What a waste.

182
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,380
It won't be wasted.

183
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,350
You can eat whatever you want.

184
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,580
I'll pack the rest.

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,200
Let's eat.

186
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,040
This is for you.

187
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,590
Why did you give me a gift?

188
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,670
You gave me a gift on my birthday.

189
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,960
Just a gift in return.

190
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,260
But it's not my birthday yet.

191
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,700
Thank you. I'll take it.

192
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,170
It's pretty.

193
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,960
Why are you giving me this?

194
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,240
You can't wear a wedding dress

195
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,500
without accessories.

196
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,030
Thank you.

197
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,090
Hello, sir.

198
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,710
What would you like to order?

199
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,980
A set meal.

200
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
A bottle of wine recommended by your restaurant.

201
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,520
OK. Please wait a moment.

202
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,360
Are you Lawyer He Zhengyu?

203
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,630
I don't think I'm mistaken.

204
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,850
I'm Gao Ming from the Gao's Group.

205
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,150
I've always wanted to visit you.

206
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,210
I didn't expect to see you here today.

207
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,370
Nice to meet you.

208
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,720
Mr. Gao, are you here today

209
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,110
to talk about Zhang Xiaojiang's case?

210
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,190
No, no, no.

211
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,750
It's just a coincidence.

212
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,210
I've heard a lot about you.

213
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,510
You are the most elite lawyer

214
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,230
in Fuxing.

215
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,420
You handled Fei's Company's case very well.

216
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,300
I have an idea.

217
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,570
After Zhang Xiaojiang's case is over,

218
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,070
I would like to invite you to my company

219
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,400
as a legal adviser.

220
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,090
As for the Legal Department I'm hiring now,

221
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,300
their levels

222
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,910
are not as good as your fingers.

223
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,840
Sir, what do you think of this wine?

224
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,630
Mr. Gao,

225
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,130
let's talk about it

226
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,880
after we solve Zhang Xiaojiang's case.

227
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
Maybe when this case is over,

228
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,890
you will change your mind.

229
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,550
No.

230
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,460
I love talents.

231
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,560
If you can

232
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,350
turn this case upside down,

233
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,860
I will like you more.

234
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,750
You are the talent I need.

235
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,900
I can give you a high salary

236
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,300
or even give you shares.

237
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,290
Don't, Mr. Gao.

238
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,240
You're indeed Mr. Gao.

239
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,270
No wonder you can manage such a big group.

240
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,490
But you may not know

241
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,140
what you told me today

242
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,460
can be used as evidence

243
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,190
for bribery.

244
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,350
Those ordinary lawyers' level and mentality

245
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,970
are no match for yours.

246
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,020
Okay, let's not talk about the case.

247
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,480
We're all hungry. Let's eat.

248
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,730
Mr. He,

249
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,310
I don't think you're from Fuxing.

250
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,050
Where are you from?

251
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,280
Anzhou?

252
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,380
I know that place very well.

253
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,940
What do your parents do?

254
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,510
Maybe we know each other.

255
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,900
What do you want to say, Mr. Gao?

256
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,210
Your parents

257
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,330
are professors of Anzhou Normal College, right?

258
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,920
One is in the math department

259
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
and the other is in the history department.

260
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,160
I guess they live in Building 2, Unit 2 of Garden Community,

261
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,330
Dongfeng Road.

262
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,850
Which room is it?

263
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,850
501, right?

264
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,390
What do you want?

265
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,660
Well, I don't want to do anything.

266
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,400
I just think Mr. He is too busy

267
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,590
to visit your parents.

268
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,030
So I sent a friend of mine

269
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,860
to visit your home in advance

270
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,960
and take care of your parents.

271
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,900
Now,

272
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,160
I guess they already arrived your home.

273
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,820
He Zhengyu.

274
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,760
Have you forgotten?

275
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,750
I don't understand why

276
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,380
I met Gao Ming four months ago.

277
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,060
The news said it was a coincidence

278
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,950
but did not say specific reason.

279
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,400
It just said that, four months ago,

280
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,570
I was detained for seven days

281
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,870
because of assaulting Gao Ming.

282
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,800
After I came out, I was expelled from Fengyu Law Firm.

283
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,630
Hello, mom.

284
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,160
Are you at home?

285
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,020
I just want to tell you

286
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,260
if a stranger comes,

287
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,440
don't open the door.

288
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,410
I'm just reminding you.

289
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,400
I'm fine. Don't worry.

290
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,040
I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

291
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,180
Mr. Gao,

292
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,270
you've done a lot.

293
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,420
If you have the mood,

294
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,050
why don't you take more time to read the Criminal Law?

295
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,770
What is the sentence for attempted rape?

296
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,830
What is the sentence for defamation?

297
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,990
Let's eat first.

298
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,600
Leave him alone.

299
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,120
And what's the sentence for

300
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,980
today's crime of picking quarrels and provoking troubles?

301
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,640
Does Mr. Gao want to add the video of assulting me

302
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,770
to your company's promotional video?

303
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,550
Mr. Gao has finished eating?

304
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,480
Then take all the paparazzi you hired away.

305
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,580
The next time we meet

306
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,870
should be in court.

307
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,490
Jirong,

308
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,510
do you have to leave?

309
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,540
But we still have a month's cooling-off period.

310
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,420
It's better for me to leave.

311
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,079
Otherwise, it'll be awkward.

312
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,150
Jirong,

313
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,270
let's have dinner together sometime.

314
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,520
You're so beautiful.

315
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,700
Thank you for everything.

316
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:14,860
Jialan.

317
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,390
Just imagine that

318
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,840
we're on the beach of Santorini.

319
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
We're now on the beach of Santorini.

320
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,500
We will make it come true.

321
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,110
Right now,

322
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,340
it is real.

323
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,150
Will you be the heroine in my paintings?

324
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,320
Yes, I do.

325
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,790
Jialan.

326
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,420
I love you.

327
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,010
Zhengyu.

328
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,130
I love you too.

329
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,850
Jialan.

330
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,700
A little to the right.

331
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Okay, right away.

332
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,730
Come on.

333
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,680
Santorini is so beautiful.

334
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,630
When we go there,

335
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,800
we'll live in such a house.

336
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,420
Time flies in Santorini Island.

337
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:11,730
By the way,

338
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,050
there's one thing I don't know how to say.

339
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,680
It's kind of weird.

340
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,350
What?

341
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,420
It's the other you. He...

342
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,110
He seems...

343
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,510
He likes you too.

344

00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,820
It's harder to get evidence.

515
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,600
Can we win?

516
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,370
Do your best.

517
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,550
Really?

518
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,110
Meng Jianguo.

519
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,370
As long as we can handle this driver,

520
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,030
all the doubts will be solved.

521
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,470
It hurts again.

522
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,980
Looks like what Meng Jianguo did for Gao Ming

523
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
is not just hiding

524
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,910
the CCTV in the car.

525
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,720
Let's get down to business.

526
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,590
Is Meng Jianguo's old house

527
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,900
selling?

528
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,510
Yes. Buy a new house and sell the old one.

529
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,710
Well, investigate the schedule

530
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,250
of Gao Ming for these few days.

531
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,110
Find a place where we can meet him.

532
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,670
Make it natural.

533
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,090
Let's encounter him.

534
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,180
Then contact the agent

535
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,220
who is selling Meng Jianguo's old house.

536
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,110
Tell him you want to buy the house outright.

537
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,620
I will

538
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,620
go to Zhang Xiaojiang again.

539
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,300
But besides that,

540
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,890
another person's attitude is very important.

541
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,430
Who?

542
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,750
Zhang Xiaojiang.

543
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,610
I knew it.

544
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,990
I've already called her to inform her to come here.

545
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,190
-And now... -Jialan.

546
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,470
Xiaojiang.

547
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,520
Mr. He.

548
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,730
Here.

549
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,720
Miss Zhang.

550
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,650
Mr. He,

551
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,070
you don't have to say anything.

552
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,760
I trust you.

553
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,460
I'm not a suspicious person.

554
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,000
And I believe

555
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,940
you wouldn't do that.

556
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,080
Their goal is too obvious.

557
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,650
They don't want you to be my attorney.

558
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,440
So,

559
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,040
I should apologize to you.

560
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,920
You were framed

561
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,390
because you helped me.

562
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,160
It's not entirely because of you.

563
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,920
They are targeting me

564
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,160
so they made use of your case.

565
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,960
We're on the same boat.

566
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,180
It's nothing to be wronged.

567
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,210
Mr. He,

568
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,890
I won't back down.

569
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,430
Let's fight together!

570
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,140
Thank you.

571
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,710
It's nothing.

572
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,390
What is this?

573
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,530
Come and help.

574
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,070
You got the photo developed?

My socks?

589
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,670

600
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:49,410
♫Spend dust and dawn with you♫

601

00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,780
Jialan.

603
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,720
I feel like we're decorating a wedding house.

604

605

[2021]

607

Why hasn't he contacted me yet?

608
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,040
Did he find anything over there?

609
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:21,690

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,739
There's no signal

613
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,300
so I put my phone on the balcony.

614

♫We♫

615
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,449
I'll check who it is.

616
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,690
Keep thinking where to put it.

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,300
Jialan.

620
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
What's going on with him?

621
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,960
I've thought about the photo.

622
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,540
I know where it should be hung.

623
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,940
What situation is it now?

624
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,280
I'm so anxious now.

625
00:34:59,310 --> 00:34:59,870
And you two...

626
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,930
You may talk to him.

627
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,110
Go ahead.

628
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,360
Am I right?

629
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,180
Sun Defeng is the mastermind of Gao Ming.

630
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,380
They worked together

631
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,570
One paid,

632
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,760
and the other ordered Zhang Hui to report.

633
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,490
That's true.

634
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,970
That doesn't make sense.

635
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,900
I have never contacted Gao Ming

636
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,700
in private,

637
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,290
not even a call.

638
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
There is only time

639
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,740
but Chen Jialan recorded the conversation.

640
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,360
There's no proof of my bribery.

641
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,220
It's not the time you met Gao Ming.

642
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,770
It was the time you went to Meng Jianguo.

643
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:28,500
Gao Ming said

644
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,940
you contacted each other through Meng Jianguo.

645
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,690
And submitted the surveillance video

646
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,630
at the gate of the unit

647
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,930
as evidence.

648
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,570
How is that possible?

649
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,340
I can't be so stupid

650
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
to ask for money in front of his unit.

651
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,800
Meng Jianguo said,

652
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,940
in order to avoid suspicion,

653
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,530
you've never met Gao Ming.

654
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,660
The details were communicated

655
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,140
through the middleman.

656
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,340
And it was you who came up with this idea.

657
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,870
They're really good at shifting blames.

658
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,490
Leave Meng Jianguo to me.

659
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
I have an idea.

660
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,590
If everything goes well,

661
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,250
we should have the answer in a few days.

662
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,450
What about Zhang Hui?

663
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,450
Where is she now?

664
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
I have to find her.

665
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,540
It's hard.

666
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,840
You may not know

667
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,670
Zhang Hui and Sun Defeng

668
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,680
are actually a couple.

669
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:18,060
What?

670
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,680
So Zhang Hui wasn't bribed by money?

671
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:22,930
My...

672
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,490
To be exact,

673
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,760
our biggest weakness

674
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,820
is not good at maintaining relationships.

675
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,490
Our emotional sensitivity is low.

676
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,750
Sun Defeng and Zhang Hui are indeed a couple.

677
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,250
They seldom showed up together in the company.

678
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,380
It's normal that you didn't notice it.

679
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,830
After we left Fengyu,

680
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,840
they made it public

681
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,570
and announced the engagement.

682
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,700
In other words, Fengyu

683
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,210
became a mom-and-pop store four months later.

684
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,040
It's true that they worked together

685
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,580
to expell you.

686
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,430
It's also true that they announced the engagement.

687
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,630
But Dajun said

688
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,840
they didn't have the wedding on time.

689
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,350
Although they still work in the company,

690
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,220
they seem to have broke up.

691
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,140
Sun Defeng's temper

692
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,620
has become very strange.

693
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,820
He often loses his temper for no reason.

694
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,500
I don't know if those changes

695
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,500
have anything to do

696
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,300
with our current situation.

697
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,830
Okay. I know.

698
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,100
As for Zhang Hui,

699
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,150
you may try to find where she is.

700
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,520
Okay, don't worry.

701
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,060
That's all for now.

702
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:20,790
Jialan.

703
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,720
Let's hang the photo.

704
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,270
OK.

705
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,230
Let's go.

706
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,820
Are you sure Gao Ming will come?

707
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,340
Yes.

708
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,210
He has an appointment with investors at 10:30.

709
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,670
This seat is very obvious.

710
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,150
He'll come over later.

711
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,580
I'm sure he'll see us.

712
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
You can start now.

713
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,090
OK, I see.

714
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,950
Thank you, Mr. He.

715
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,660
Mr. Gao,

716
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,470
I've been thinking about something all night.

717
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,070
I think I should tell you.

718
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,840
Zhang Xiaojiang is back.

719
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,330
She asked me out for dinner last night.

720
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,060
She said she found a key witness

721
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,590
who is willing to testify for her.

722
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,390
That night, he was at the scene

723
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,480
and witnessed what happened.

724
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,470
Witnessed what happened?

725
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,900
You're drunk.

726
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,790
Come, lean on me for a while.

727
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,040
Be good.

728
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,680
I don't like disobedient employees.

729
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,250
Jiang, here.

730
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,300
Jiang. Jiang.

731
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,260
Jiang, be good.

732
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,070
Meng Jianguo.

733
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,780
-Mr. He, Gao Ming knew the news. -He's coming.

734
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,310
Mr. Meng.

735
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,300
The buyer is quite generous.

736
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,060
That's good.

737
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,710
Sorry to keep you waiting.

738
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,510
It's okay.

739
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,390
Why are you here?

740
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,570
Mr. Meng.

741
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,960
What a coincidence.

742
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,690
I didn't expect to see you here.

743
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,690
You know him?

744
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,620
Stare at him.

745
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,230
He's a tough guy.

746
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,900
Be tough later.

747
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,270
I didn't know who's the seller before.

749
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,100
Since he had some conflicts

750
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,170
with my friend,

751
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,280
let's forget about it this time.

752
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,410
We're paying in one installment anyway.

753
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,860
We can find a seller easily.

754
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,460
Why don't you reconsider it?

755
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,140
Wait.

756
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,600
Mr. He.

757
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,590
They are different matters.

758
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,330
It's been a few months.

759
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,280
You must not be a narrow-minded person.

760
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,220
You know what.

761
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,120
My house is cost-effective.

762
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,870
It's impossible to find a better one in a short time.

763
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,810
If your friend really wants to buy it,

764
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,760
let's sit down and talk.

765
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,160
Forget about our relationship first.

766
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,890
We will only focus on the house.

767
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,350
It's not easy for you to find a house.

768
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,980
If you think the house suits you, just sit down and talk.

769
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,440
It's not easy for him to come all the way here.

770
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,330
Okay, let's talk.

771
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,210
Have a seat.

772
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,020
Have a seat.

773
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,960
Let's talk.

774
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,590
You guys continue.

775
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,290
I'm going to the bathroom.

776
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,700
What would you like to drink?

777
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
Gao Ming arrived.

778
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,560
You've gone too far.

779
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,180
This is not the price we agreed on.

780
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,150
Let's talk about it.

781
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,030
Come on.

782
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,370
Okay.

783
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,350
You two should make it clear.

784
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:15,830
Got it?

785
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,650
OK. Come on.

786
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,890
How was your talk?

787
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,300
I don't think your friend

788
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,500
wants to buy the house.

789
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,020
Why?

790
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,230
The price is too low.

791
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,960
If they have told me the price before,

792
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,580
I wouldn't come today.

793
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,320
Keep an eye on them.

794
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,730
I'll sign the contract soon.

795
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,140
Yes.

796
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
You can talk more.

797
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,470
Maybe the price is too high.

798
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,070
But I heard that he paid full.

799
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,780
This is too different

800
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,210
from my expectation.

801
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,010
How about we add each other on WeChat?

802
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,580
It's easier to communicate in private.

803
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,170
Cool.

804
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,770
Here.

805
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,410
Here.

806
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,960
-I sent it. -OK.

807
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,910
Wish a good cooperation.

808
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,880
Thank you, Mr. He.

809
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,450
Come on.

810
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,080
I'll go check on them.

811
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,860
Drink more.

812
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,250
Secretary Cao.

813
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,230
Why are you here?

814
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,210
Mr. Gao is here too.

815
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,080
Mr. Gao is here too?

816
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,990
How long have you been here?

817
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,480
How long do you want us to be here?

818
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,300
I...

819
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,960
I'm here to sell the house.

820
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,900
It's none of my business.

821
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,490
You'd better explain to Mr. Gao.

822
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:19,070
Come on.

823
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,450
Mr. Gao is waiting for you.

824
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,130
What did you say to He Zhengyu?

825
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,430
Mr. Gao, I didn't.

826
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm here to sell the house.

827
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,890
What house?

828
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,210
Where's the agent?

829
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,260
It was just you and He Zhengyu.

830
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,140
Meng,

831
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,330
this is your fault.

832
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,380
You asked for three million.

833
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,770
Mr. Gao gave it to you.

834
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,360
You have a new house and a good car now.

835
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,080
How could you do

836
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,560
such an ungrateful thing?

837
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,610
No, no.

838
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,990
Mr. Gao,

839
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,940
I'm grateful to you.

840
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,000
How could I forget?

841
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,770
I will never do anything

842
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,130
that will do harm to you.

843
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,090
Besides, after I took your money,

844
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,380
I framed Zhang Xiaojiang

845
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,710
according to your order,

846
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,700
and I transfered to He Zhengyu

847
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,540
according to your order.

848
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,290
They hate me so much because of this.

849
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,420
How could they ask me to work with them?

850
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,540
I just want to sell that old house.

851
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:38,930
Really?

852
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,430
Mr. Gao,

853
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,420
I am the most trustworthy.

854
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,690
I gave you the dash cam right away.

855
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,580
I have no evidence to do anything.

856
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,900
Be careful.

857
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:53,960
Of course.

858
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,260
I dare not lie to you, right?

859
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,670
Mr. Meng, let's talk.

860
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,750
You two set me up.

861
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,470
Give me the backup of the dash cam.

862
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,380
Show him the video.

863
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,150
Mr. Gao, I am the most trustworthy.

864
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,400
I gave you the dashcam right away.

865
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,260
I have no evidence to do anything.

866
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:32,080
You heard it.

867
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,230
Gao Ming took the memory card.

868
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,840
Go find him if you want it.

869
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,610
So I want the backup.

870
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:38,850
What backup?

871
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,060
I don't understand.

872
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,780
This is the habit of a blackmailer. It can't be wrong.

873
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,190
If you want to blackmail him,

874
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,590
you have to leave a way out

875
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,350
just in case.

876
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,120
I'm not as smart as you.

877
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Mr. Meng Jianguo,

878
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,600
whether you give it out or not,

879
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,710
the ending is set.

880
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,190
Gao Ming will be brought to justice.

881
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,320
And Zhang Xiaojiang

882
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,820
will prove her innocence.

883
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,680
I'm giving you a choice.

884
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,060
You may choose to be Gao Ming's accomplice

885
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,990
who commited blackmail and frame,

886
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,310
or become a person who sprouts wings

887
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,310
and repents.

888
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,420
There is a backup.

889
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,190
Gao Ming's car is equiped with

890
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,120
a dash cam of three recording mode.

891
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,340
Not only can sounds be recorded, but also videos.

892
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,160
What he did to Zhang XiaoJiang that night

893
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,040
was recorded.

894
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,040
That's why Gao Ming gave me so much money.

895
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,600
That's it.

896
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,800
Jiang, you're drunk.

897
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,690
Come, lean on me for a while.

898
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,940
I don't like disobedient employees.

899
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,380
Jiang, here.

900
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:00,900
Be good. Don't move.

901
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,710
With the video in the dash cam,

902
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:12,670
[2021]

903
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,730
we'll be able to prove Gao Ming's crime

904
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,200
and bring him to justice.

905
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,910
Jiang can finally

906
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,200
get justice for herself.

907
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,060
Our efforts will pay off.

908
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,380
Chen Jialan, calm down.

909
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,530
You must record the video in the dash cam

910
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,380
with your phone.

911
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,670
We can only keep the evidence in that was.

912
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,670
Don't worry.

913
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,430
Not only did I record it, I also backed it up.

914
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,830
I'll send it to you later.

915
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,120
Okay.

916
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,530
Meticulous and reasonable.

917
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,350
It's worth working with me.

918
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,980
The closer, the better.

919
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,860
Is the good one the one living in four months ago

920
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,990
or the one living in four months later?

921
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,370
He Zhengyu.

922
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,620
Are you jealous of yourself?

923
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,940
He Zhengyu.

924
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,160
It's only been four months.

925
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,080
I almost can't recognize myself.

926
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,090
Trust me.

927
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,270
You'll fall in love with the you living in four months later.

928
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,460
Alright, let's not talk about this.

929
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,800
Let's get down to business.

930
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,440
Well,

931
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,860
do I need a backup of the conversation

932
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,620
between Gao Ming and Meng Jianguo in the stairs?

933
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,880
So that you can be cleared of the bribery?

934
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:03,700
No.

935
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,300
Everything in the video

936
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,750
happened in 2022.

937
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,090
We can't use it to solve the problem in 2021.

938
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:11,220
It will cause more unnecessary troubles.

939
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,750
So, regarding the bribery,

940
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,660
you need to think of another way

941
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,520
in 2021.

942
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,660
By the way,

943
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,750
tell this good news to Zhang Xiaojiang.

944
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,560
We've found crucial evidence.

945
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,230
Okay, I'll tell her right away.

946
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,290
Well, I'm hanging up.

947
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:28,930
Bye.

948
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:58,880
[Sweet ON]

949
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:58,880

[Look at my hand]

953
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,170
[What is it?]

954
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,590
[Focus on the gift]

955
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,000
[Why she doesn't look at me? So obvious]

956
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,730
Sorry.

957
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,160
I thought those are real.

958
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:10,720
[Embarrased]

959
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,940
[She didn't look at me]

960
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,940
[So it's obvious]

961
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,940
[So I didn't actually eat them]

962
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:14,800
Wait.

963
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,310
[A new way of hugging?]

964
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,640
What are you dong?

965

[Speechless]

966
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,170
[I can't hug her this way?]

967
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,840
It's so beautiful.

968
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,150
[What happened?]

969
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,120
What do you think, sir?

970
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,020
So beautiful.

971
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,370
[Let me see]

972
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:27,010

[Gorgeous]

00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,790
[Unbelievable]
