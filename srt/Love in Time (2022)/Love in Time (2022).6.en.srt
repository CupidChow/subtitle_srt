4
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,270
The screw is loose.

5
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,560
It will be fine if I tighten it up.

6
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,130
Okay. Have a try.

7
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,680
It is OK.

8
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,340
There's a loose one here.

9
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,020
Chen Jialan...

10
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,900
I got an electric shock.

11
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,940
Help me! Help me!

12
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,660
I'm kidding...

13
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,020
An electric shock will kill you.

14
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,550
How can you joke about this?

15
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,690
This...

16
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,630
I really got hurt this time.

17
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,780
You lied to me first.

18
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,260
Chen Jialan.

19
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,410
He Zhengyu.

20
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,180
You forced me to fix the lamp.

21
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,220
You are unreasonable.

22
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,940
You are short.

23
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,470
-I worry about you. -You...

24
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,300
Okay.

25
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,210
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,500
Help me up.

27
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,329
It is my fault.

28
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,579
For the sake of the friendship we fostered when we were helping

29
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,170
Li Ziqiang and other relocation households together,

30
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,230
please forgive me.

31
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,180
By the way,

32
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,710
did you win the rights maintenance case?

33
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,840
Your question

34
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,870
is meaningless.

35
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,700
Yes.

36
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,630
You are invincible in the legal profession.

37
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,840
How are Li Ziqiang and others now?

38
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,360
Do you want to see them?

39
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,240
As usual.

40
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,630
Are you as usual too?

41
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,040
-You know each other. -You know each other.

42
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,990
Why are you two together?

43
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,260
We are...

44
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,300
We have met once.

45
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,930
Okay.

46
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,330
Two bowls of signature noodles.

47
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,870
They will be ready soon.

48
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,830
Do you usually eat here too?

49
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,710
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

50
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,060
Compared to four months ago,

51
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,780
this place has indeed changed a little.

52
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,159
This table was supposed to be horizontally placed like this.

53
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,290
And there's one more table over there.

54
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,659
They were changed a few days ago.

55
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,520
Didn't you say...

56
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,470
Look over there.

57
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

58
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,420
Okay.

59
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,260
Five mutton kebabs and five beef kebabs.

60
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,860
Business is very good today.

61
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,460
How do you know they are here?

62
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,210
I will put them here.

63
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,510
I found it by accident.

64
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,300
Is that woman his wife?

65
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,900
She doesn't

66
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,300
look sick at all.

67
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,450
Give me ten more mutton kebabs.

68
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:10,860
Hurry up.

69
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,490
Okay.

70
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,860
It's four months later.

71
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,240
She got the money and had the operation.

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,040
What's wrong with her recovery?

73
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,910
He Zhengyu,

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,790
you've finally done a great thing.

75
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,880
Hey,

76
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,980
is order number eight ready?

77
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,300
Is that Li Zili?

78
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,030
I am leaving.

79
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,990
I think so.

80
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,170
-Don't worry. -Be careful.

81
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,780
You know he's a delivery rider.

82
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,659
I have seen this for the first time,

83
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,790
just like you.

84
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:45,260
What's up?

85
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,659
Don't move.

86
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,159
Boss.

87
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,240
I'll take the takeout.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,920
Okay.

89
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,220
What?

90
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,500
Here are the noodles.

91
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,580
Thank you.

92
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,200
Why did you hug me just now?

93
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,920
I didn't want him to see me.

94
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,540
Thank you.

95
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,220
What are you doing?

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,740
Didn't we agree that I would pay for the bill?

97
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,670
Don't pay for it.

98
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,220
Let me do it.

99
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,410
It's 2022 now.

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Your money can't be used.

101
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,410
I...

102
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,160
Last time at the convenience store,

103
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,100
did I owe them money?

104
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,159
I made it up for you.

105
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Thank you.

106
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,640
Why didn't you go and take a look just now?

107
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,760
I don't like barbecue. It's unhealthy.

108
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,420
That's not what I meant.

109
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,680
If the case is over, it's over.

110
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,870
Don't bother them.

111
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,860
Every time I won the lawsuit,

112
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,560
the clients wanted to thank me

113
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,510
and tried their best to repay me.

114
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,390
But for me, that is my duty.

115
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,560
He Zhengyu, I...

116
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,300
I find that

117
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,430
you're different from what I thought.

118
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,910
You still have strengths.

119
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,870
I have many strengths.

120
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,270
You know little about me.

121
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,180
You are proud.

122
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,440
Let me ask you.

123
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,890
I just want to know more about you.

124
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,100
You must answer me honestly.

125
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,630
Go ahead.

126
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,840
Do you love lawyer, this occupation?

127
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,180
Yes.

128
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,280
Do you like to be clean?

129
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,590
Yes.

130
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,900
Do you like wine?

131
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,030
Yes.

132
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,230
Do you love Jirong?

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,540
You just wanted to ask me this.

134
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,150
You want to trick me.

135
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,970
With your IQ, you'd better give up.

136
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,550
He Zhengyu.

137
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,650
Jirong is my friend's fiancée.

138
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,730
I must be sure that

139
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,590
you don't love her.

140
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,430
Chen Jialan, I am telling you again.

141
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,150
Jirong and I are just good friends.

142
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,180
There is no sexual tension

143
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,610
between us.

144
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,990
When will you ask Jirong to meet me?

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
What's the hurry?

146
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,500
Of course I am in a hurry.

147
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,780
Jirong and Jiang Shenghao are getting married.

148
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,380
I want...

149
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,670
What did you say?

150
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,090
♫If♫

151
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,360
♫We are destined to meet♫

152
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,490
♫To meet at this moment♫

153
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,309
♫Our fate overlap♫

154
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,809
♫If♫

155
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,680
♫If tomorrow I need to exchange with♫

156
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,440
♫The world with you♫

157
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,610
♫Let me give up everything♫

158
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,140
It's so big.

159
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,780
Yes.

160
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,960
Jirong likes this villa the most.

161
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,840
Jirong likes the floor-to-ceiling windows.

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,640
So I installed the floor-to-ceiling windows for her.

163
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,570
Then we can see the swimming pool

164
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,630
in the living room.

165
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,890
Is there a swimming pool?

166
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,290
Yes.

167
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,840
The house you rent is so beautiful.

168
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,780
When I get rich,

169
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,650
I'll stay here for the rest of my life.

170
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,420
Stop thinking about it.

171
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,700
I've bought this place.

172
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,630
It is decorated according to the style Jirong likes.

173
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,850
Let's go.

174
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,410
By the way,

175
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,860
keep this a secret for me.

176
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,030
Jirong,

177
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,950
we're back!

178
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,500
Jirong!

179
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,570
You're back.

180
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,300
You bought so many things.

181
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,850
Yes.

182
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,980
Sit down and have a rest.

183
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,940
I made juice.

184
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,690
Jirong,

185
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,540
this place is so beautiful.

186
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,040
Yes,

187
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,420
then come here often.

188
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,380
I'll make you something delicious.

189
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,940
Jirong,

190
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,220
you must see

191
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,510
Jialan's dessert some time.

192
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,870
It is so ugly.

193
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,950
Jiang Shenghao.

194
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,610
But it is really delicious.

195
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,620
Really?

196
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,250
Then I must learn it.

197
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,090
Teach me.

198
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,030
Okay.

199
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,260
Come to my house tonight.

200
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,350
Because the notebook which has the secret recipe for dessert

201
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,720
is at home.

202
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,350
Please come to my home.

203
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,260
Okay, no problem.

204
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,630
Great move!

205
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,520
Wait. My skill is cooling down.

206
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,850
I will use it right away.

207
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,970
Since you love playing games so much,

208
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,260
why don't you just work as an network administrator

209
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,520
in your uncle's store?

210
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,040
No way.

211
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,350
I'm waiting to rally with you.

212
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,740
Do you trust me so much that

213
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,270
you leave your future to me?

214
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,820
Failure is only temporary.

215
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,910
You haven't given up either.

216
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,940
As long as I follow you,

217
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,470
I will have a bright future.

218
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,680
Although Fengyu Law Firm has cut ties with us,

219
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,730
there are many more famous law firms

220
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,720
welcoming us

221
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,830
and waiting for you to pick.

222
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,240
What if I don't take the bright future

223
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,310
and go a dangerous way instead?

224
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,430
What do you mean?

225
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,130
I want to start my own business and open a law firm.

226
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,960
Sure.

227
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,110
When do you plan to start?

228
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,980
Just recently.

229
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,790
You need to work quickly.

230
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,520
When the new law firm is open,

231
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,450
everything is waiting to be built.

232
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,980
Go! Go!

233
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,530
Hello, Jirong.

234
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,080
Hello, Jialan.

235
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,500
I have something to do. I can't go to your home tonight.

237
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
What happened?

238
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,070
I'll tell you later.

239
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,660
I'll call you

240
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,570
before I make sure the time I go to your home.

241
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,680
Okay, bye.

242
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,370
Why are you crying?

243
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,540
Who bullied you?

244
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,860
I’m happy.

245
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,460
Li Ziqiang sent me a letter of gratitude.

246
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,920
I have never received a letter of gratitude.

247
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,800
Did you receive it too?

248
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,040
I received it earlier.

249
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,220
Then why didn't you tell me yesterday?

250
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,710
Weren't you touched?

251
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,580
I've been a lawyer for so many years.

252
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,070
I've seen many letters of gratitude and threatening letters.

253
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,020
If I were as emotional as you,

254
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
I would have cried 800 times.

255
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,380
Did you ask Jirong out for me?

256
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,810
I did.

257
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,300
I planned to let you meet tonight.

258
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,060
But Jirong just called me and

259
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
said that something came up.

260
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,420
She said she would call me

261
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,740
before she came.

262
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,420
I'll tell you then.

263
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
I'll prepare things for dessert.

264
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,930
Luckily Jirong didn’t come tonight.

265
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,640
I forgot to buy the baking powder for dessert.

266
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,070
I'm going downstairs to buy some.

267
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,070
Why did you come out?

268
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,220
It is almost zero degree.

269
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,580
If you wear so little,

270
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,120
you will freeze.

271
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,340
Thank you.

272
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,760
You need more clothes when it's cold.

273
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,620
You don't know this common sense.

274
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,920
♫A dream within reach♫

275
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,270
♫Arises because of you♫

276
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,790
How could I know that

277
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,720
the temperature would suddenly drop four months later?

278
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,810
♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

279
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,430
Then from now on,

280
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,260
I will write the weather forecast

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,130
♫We♫

282
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,790
on the small blackboard by the door every day.

283
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,380
♫Are like hour hands embracing and talking♫

284
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,520
You're a sophistry genius.

285
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,460
Since when did you lose to me in speaking?

286
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,090
I just didn't take it to heart since you are an idiot.

287
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,580
♫How can I stop flipping?♫

288
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,820
You are an idiot.

289
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,970
How did you ride?

290
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,540
Are you okay?

291
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,160
I think I'm fine.

292
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,980
What's wrong?

293
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,180
It's OK.

294
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,820
It's okay. I can do it myself.

295
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,480
Don't move.

296
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,450
It's just a minor injury. It doesn't matter.

297
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,280
Don't pull a long face.

298
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,090
No matter how small the cut is, you have to treat it.

299
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,710
It is done.

300
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,470
Thank you.

301
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,980
Lollipop?

302
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,180
I bought it when I bought the band-aid.

303
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,700
You are so casual when giving me a gift.

304
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,760
You can return it if you don't like it.

305
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,880
I will eat it.

306
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,080
Since I can't bring it back to 2021 anyway,

307
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,210
I won't gain weight.

308
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,200
Thank you.

309
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,990
But your lollipop is too plain.

310
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,700
I like the stylish ones.

311
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,640
Buy them yourself.

312
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,260
Hello,

313
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,310
dad, mom.

314
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,780
Zhengyu,

315
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,840
your mom asked me to ask you when you would return on New Year's Eve.

316
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,140
Don't listen to your dad.

317
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,359
He misses you.

318
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,310
He's been talking about you these days.

319
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:07,950
Dad, mom,

320
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
I may not be able to go back this year.

321
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,599
I have a case now.

322
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,780
The trial will be held after Chinese New Year.

323
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,619
I have to prepare for it in advance.

324
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,349
Don't worry.

325
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,630
I'll go back right after I finish my work.

326
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,660
What case do you have to prepare during the Chinese New Year?

327
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,720
Okay, get back to work if you are busy.

328
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,190
But take care of yourself.

329
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,780
Come back when you're done.

330
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,960
Time for the time-space overlap is coming.

331
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,720
Go back now.

332
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,050
Let me help you.

333
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,970
It's okay. I can do it myself.

334
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,950
Let's go.

335
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,380
These photos were received last night.

336
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,490
Jirong and I

337
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,500
are willing to believe that they are synthesized by anti-fans.

338
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,230
I want to hear what you will say.

339
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,040
Anwen,

340
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,770
these photos are not synthesized.

341
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,100
They are real.

342
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
You're so frank.

343
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,740
How can you do this to my sister?

344
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,380
No, Anwen.

345
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,090
Anwen,

346
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,860
you go out first.

347
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,040
We'll solve this by ourselves.

348
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,970
You go out first.

349
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,230
Jirong,

350
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,980
I have really broken up with her.

351
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,580
There's nothing between us.

352
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,830
But you said that these photos are real.

353
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,920
Yes. They are real.

354
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,860
I went to get the diamond ring that day.

355
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,300
I don't know

356
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,630
why she appeared there.

357
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,440
Why didn't you tell me?

358
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,920
Sorry, I...

359
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,780
It's my fault for not telling you.

360
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,980
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

361
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,870
But I swear

362
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,630
there's nothing between us.

363
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,220
I wanted to get the diamond ring and give you a surprise,

364
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,700
but...

365
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,100
I heard that you were getting married.

366
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,690
Yes.

367
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,260
I wish you all the best.

368
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,860
Thank you.

369
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,630
Will you invite me to your wedding?

370
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,290
Stop it. You don't need the food there.

371
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,680
I mean

372
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,910
I can't let you spend money when you come.

373
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,640
Give me a hug.

374
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,500
What's wrong with that?

375
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,360
I'll bid you farewell from now on.

376
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,590
It must be that time.

377
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,550
Someone took the photo for me on purpose.

378
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,750
Someone framed me.

379
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,290
Jirong,

380
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,230
there's really nothing between me and her.

381
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,730
You'd better tell the truth.

382
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,270
Of course.

383
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,010
All I said is true.

384
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,110
If I were lying,

385
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,650
I would be struck by lightning.

386
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,780
I will die horribly.

387
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,190
What if you meet your ex again?

388
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,600
I won't meet them.

389
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,890
No one can meet me.

390
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,560
Anwen,

391
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,720
I have explained it to Jirong.

392
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,710
My silly sister is still easy to fool.

393
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,700
Anwen,

394
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,100
what do you mean?

395
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,870
It's simple if you want me to believe you.

396
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,220
Sign a marriage agreement.

397
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,670
If you have an affair and

398
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,420
Jirong wants to divorce you,

399
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,220
you should make it up to her

400
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,980
with all the martial property.

401
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,020
Anwen, it's not necessary.

402
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,970
I have explained

403
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,560
about the photo to her.

404
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,200
What? Do you feel guilty?

405
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,870
Anwen,

406
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,040
if I sign this agreement, it will mean that I feel guilty.

407
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Our relationship

408
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,820
can not be measured with money.

409
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,310
Money can't measure love,

410
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,390
but it's enough to control you.

411
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,790
Just tell me whether you will sign it or not.

412
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,840
Anwen, I'm really sorry.

413
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,310
I can't sign this contract.

414
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,290
Okay.

415
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,090
Then don't get married. Go.

416
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,960
Anwen,

417
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
I trust Shenghao.

418
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,100
We don't need to sign the marriage agreement.

419
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:38,670
Jialan,

420
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,190
can you teach me how to bake a cake tonight?

421
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,190
Jirong,

422
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,450
come on in.

423
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,970
I brought you a bottle of wine.

424
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,430
I don't know if you like it.

425
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,480
I like all your gifts.

426
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,750
Shouldn't we go inside?

427
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,550
What are you doing, Jialan?

428
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,480
I have a surprise for you.

429
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,170
Count to five seconds.

430
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,080
Okay.

431
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:16,810
Five,

432
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,290
four,

433
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,540
three,

434
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:20,850
two,

435
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,840
one.

436
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,620
It's done.

437
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,030
What surprise?

438
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,100
It's me at this moment.

439
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,380
No wonder Shenghao said you were like a child.

440
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,970
Jirong,

441
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,910
come in.

442
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,870
This is the living room.

443
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,880
He Zhengyu is not here.

444
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,910
This cake is so complicated.

445
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,250
It looks complicated,

446
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,110
but it's actually very simple.

447
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,310
You will master it as soon as I teach you.

448
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,150
That dart machine looks familiar.

449
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,970
I sometimes play it.

450
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,940
My friend has the same one.

451
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,780
What a coincidence!

452
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,310
Jirong?

453
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,900
Zhengyu?

454
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,920
Why are you here?

455
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,350
Jialan asked me to come here and make a cake.

456
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,470
Why are you here?

457
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,310
Jialan has told me.

458
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,900
Ji... Jirong,

459
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,820
take a seat.

460
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll be right back.

461
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,030
Is he

462
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,180
wearing pajamas?

463
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,890
Really?

464
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,000
I didn't notice.

465
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,590
Are you two together?

466
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,460
No, how is that possible?

467
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,290
But he was wearing pajamas.

468
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,080
Maybe he...

469
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,180
maybe his clothes got dirty, and he changed into pajamas.

470
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,910
Does he carry pajamas with him?

471
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,350
That's my pajamas.

472
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,550
When I bought pajamas,

473
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,930
I got one free.

474
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,010
It is OK.

475
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,950
I am the happiest one

476
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,390
if you two are together.

477
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,350
Jirong, take a seat.

478
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,440
I'll take a look.

479
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,190
Okay.

480
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,420
Why didn't you knock on the door?

481
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,010
Sorry.

482
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,260
Jirong is coming tonight.

483
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,660
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

484
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,780
I received the call this afternoon.

485
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,910
How can I tell you?

486
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,500
You want to wear perfume.

487
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,710
This is my least respect to my friend.

488
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,970
You won't understand.

489
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,160
He Zhengyu, let me ask you again.

490
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,020
Do you love

491
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,340
Jirong?

492
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,930
Let me tell you one last time.

493
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,410
We are just friends.

494
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,700
I don't care who you are.

495
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,830
I'm warning you now.

496
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,740
Rat and Jirong are getting married soon.

497
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,540
When we go out,

498
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,980
think carefully about what you should say.

499
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,390
I will keep an eye on you.

500
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,210
If you say anything improper

501
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,260
to Jirong,

502
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,690
I'll break your leg.

503
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,340
Later, you just

504
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,340
make your cake.

505
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,790
My talk with Jirong

506
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,840
concerns the fate of a few people.

507
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,050
Don't make trouble.

508
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,190
Jirong!

509
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:34,950
Jirong,

510
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,660
you chat.

511
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,310
I'll make a new flavor.

512
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,350
What are you two doing?

513
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,500
Ask him.

514
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,780
Come this way.

515
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,240
Sit down.

516
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,850
You knew each other long ago.

517
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,600
Why didn't you tell me?

518
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,970
How can I see you now?

519
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,190
How can I tell you?

520
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,270
I'm not always busy.

521
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,660
Are you two living together?

522
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,360
Me and her?

523
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,270
How is that possible?

524
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,090
Zhengyu,

525
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,440
I think you're a little different.

526
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,450
Really?

527
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,280
Hair style?

528
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,040
No.

529
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,340
I think you've always been

530
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,260
frank.

531
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,810
You never hesitate.

532
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,140
But you talk like her now.

533
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,430
Like her?

534
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,610
I'll change.

535
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,420
Okay.

536
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Since you don't tell me, I won't ask.

537
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,640
Tell me.

538
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,750
What are you two up to?

539
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,500
You didn't just ask me to come here and make the cake, did you?

540
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Follow me.

541
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,560
Jirong,

542
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,070
are you really going to marry Jiang Shenghao?

543
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,540
I have asked you and Jialan to be the best man and the bridesmaid.

544
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,940
Why do you still doubt it?

545
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,700
No.

546
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,220
What I'm going to say may be a bit direct.

547
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,530
It may surprise you,

548
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,610
but please think about it carefully.

549
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,040
Why? It's like you're going to court.

550
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,550
You trust me, right?

551
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,710
Of course.

552
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,330
Do you really have to marry Jiang Shenghao?

553
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,360
Do you know him?

554
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,060
You've only known each other for two months.

555
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,240
Have you checked his family background,

556
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,040
his personal,

557
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,490
and his love history?

558
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,030
Shenghao is a kind

559
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,240
and sincere man.

560
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,880
He takes good care of me.

561
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,650
I'm happy with him.

562
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,720
I think that's enough.

563
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,620
Not at all.

564
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,340
I know you're in love,

565
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,790
so you think he's good in everything.

566
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,650
But have you ever thought that four months later...

567
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,470
or even four years later?

568
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,300
If you don't know

569
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,680
your lover,

570
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,550
you'll suffer greatly.

571
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,740
But I'm getting married soon.

572
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,620
I'm very happy now.

573
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,250
Jirong,

574
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,720
marriage is a serious matter

575
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,340
and it is related to your life.

576
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,660
Love alone is useless.

577
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,490
You must know everything about him.

578
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,690
You should be rational when you need to.

579
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,430
What are you trying to say?

580
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,700
Zhengyu, do you know something?

581
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,920
I know what I said was a bit abrupt,

582
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,510
but this is the only way I can think of.

583
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,460
I want you to be happy,

584
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,950
so I'm telling you before you get married.

585
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
Jiang Shenghao is not who you can depend on.

586
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,250
He has many ex-girlfriends.

587
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,900
-And a girl called Chen Kexin. -He Zhengyu.

588
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,550
Sorry, Jirong.

589
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,750
Wait for me.

590
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,700
You must think over

591
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,760
what I just said...

592
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,070
Chen Jialan.

593
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,470
Chen Jialan.

594
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,720
Chen Jialan.

595
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,270
He Zhengyu,

596
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,270
you finally show your ambition.

597
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,180
What else can you explain?

598
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,800
Didn't you agree to

599
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,940
stay still just now?

600
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,190
Why did you come out and make trouble?

601
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,350
If I didn't come out,

602
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,330
a marriage would be ruined by you.

603
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,580
If I didn't come out,

604
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,700
I wouldn't know how much you hurt Jirong.

605
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,970
You know nothing.

606
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,540
If I don't stop Jirong,

607
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,630
Jirong's heart will be broken.

608
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,520
I know Rat loves Jirong.

609
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,100
I know

610
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,500
they are happy together.

611
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,180
I also know that they are getting married soon.

612
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,780
But you came out to stop them.

613
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,640
Come and have a look.

614
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,580
What do you want me to see?

615
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,790
You are a reporter.

616
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,500
I'll show you the truth.

617
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,080
Okay.

618
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,950
[Famous actress Wu Jirong divorced with Jiang Shenghao, the rich second generation.]

619
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,730
I don't believe it,

620
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,260
no matter what happened.

621
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,750
You forged it, didn't you?

622
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,610
People can't change their nature.

623
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,450
Jiang Shenghao is a playboy.

624
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,740
Rat is not like that.

625
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,670
That was before.

626
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,290
He will never betray Jirong.

627
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:17,990
So,

628
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,040
you also admit that Jiang Shenghao is a playboy.

629
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,020
Love is love.

630
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,210
The truth is the truth.

631
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,140
I hope you can tell the difference.

632
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,020
Zhengyu, Jialan.

633
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,170
Are you okay?

634
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,720
We are fine.

635
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,700
That's good.

636
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,480
I'm leaving.

637
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,650
There are two minutes left.

638
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,550
I'll send her back.

639
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,610
I will send her back

640
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,490
Don't go out. Don't make trouble.

641
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,980
Where are you?

642
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,000
Come on.

643
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,390
It...

644
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,420
Come on.

645
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:06,920
I'll stop now.

646
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,560
Hurry up.

647
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,370
I will go now.

648
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,980
What are you going to do?

649
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,520
Jirong has received my note.

650
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,770
She said she had something important to tell me.

651
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,370
I have to go.

652
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:14,700
Okay.

653
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,500
Help me check out later.

654
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,290
Go ahead.

655
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
Get in the car.

656
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,340
Chen Jialan, what are you doing?

657
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,290
Jiang Shenghao, you bastard!

658
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,220
Chen Jialan, do you want to kill me?

659
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,580
Hit me if you're a man.

660
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,290
Chen Jialan,

661
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,280
I'm rehearsing tomorrow.

662
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,940
How can I see Jirong if you make me look like a pig?

663
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,260
Fine, let me ask you.

664
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,020
Go ahead.

665
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,010
Jirong,

666
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,390
you just told me on WeChat

667
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,560
that you have something important to tell me.

668
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,170
What is it?

669
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,210
Let's talk about it together when we meet Shenghao.

670
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,770
Are you going to divorce him?

671
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,860
He didn't cheat on me.

672
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,180
He didn't betray me.

673
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,690
Jirong,

674
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,810
we have witness and evidence.

675
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,300
He really didn't cheat on me.

676
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,560
It's all because of me.

677
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,250
It's all my fault.

678
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,810
What happened?

679
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,730
Jirong! Jirong!

680
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,450
What's wrong? Who is it?

681
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,660
The nurse who took care of me at the nursing home.

682
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,920
She urged me to go back.

683
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,890
Zhengyu,

684
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,450
you go back first.

685
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,480
I want to explain the misunderstanding between us

686
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,610
to Shenghao alone.

687
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
You just said that

688
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,180
you had something to tell him after meeting Jiang Shenghao.

689
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,860
But I thought about it.

690
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,100
I think I should solve personal affairs

691
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,540
between me and Shenghao first

692
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,340
before we talk about other things.

693
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,140
Go back first.

694
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
I'll wait for you.

695
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,130
I picked you up,

696
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
so I have to send you back.

697
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,810
It's okay.

698
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,810
Shenghao will take me home too.

699
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:56,600
No.

700
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,040
I'm afraid you'll have another conflict.

701
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,390
It won't happen. Trust me.

702
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,910
It's just a misunderstanding.

703
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,290
Misunderstanding?

704
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,230
Jirong,

705
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,330
are you hiding something from me?

706
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,010
No.

707
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,310
Zhengyu,

708
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,239
if anything happens to me,

709
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,159
I'll come to you immediately.

710
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,699
I think it will be New Year's Eve soon.

711
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,310
I want to spend the Spring Festival with him.

712
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,520
We'll talk about other things later.

713
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:35,810
Okay.

714
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,170
Tell me immediately if anything happens.

715
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,980
Thank you, Zhengyu.

716
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,690
Don't mention it. Go.

717
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,590
Call me.

718
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,050
Go inside.

719
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,080
You are making supper.

720
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,860
I've been beating people the whole afternoon. I'm tired.

721
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,060
Do you have a problem?

722
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,610
Yes.

723
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,130
I'm hungry too.

724
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,970
You are making sandwiches.

725
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,310
Let me do it.

726
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,360
You're so attentive.

727
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,220
Do you want to apologize to me for what you have done when meeting Jirong?

728
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,500
Not only that,

729
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,060
but also Jiang Shenghao.

730
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,690
I am hungry too.

731
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,170
I beat Jiang Shenghao the whole afternoon.

732
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,960
Maybe Jiang Shenghao didn't cheat on Jirong.

733
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,370
Cheating is cheating.

734
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,750
No cheating is no cheating.

735
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,220
What does "maybe" mean?

736
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,830
Jirong said it herself.

737
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,110
As you know,

738
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,710
the Spring Festival is coming in my world.

739
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,110
Jirong sent me a message.

740
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,370
She asked me to pick her up from the nursing home.

741
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,810
She said she'd spend the Spring Festival with Jiang Shenghao.

742
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,940
She also said that she wanted to clear up some misunderstandings with him.

743
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,550
Really?

744
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,130
Are they reconciled?

745
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,330
Jirong won't lie.

746
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,130
I guess so.

747
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,630
Great.

748
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,960
You were so angry

749
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,700
and you hit him.

750
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,340
I owe you an apology.

751
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,950
It's okay.

752
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,920
I should apologize to Rat.

753
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,660
He got beaten for nothing.

754
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,590
When I see him tomorrow,

755
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,240
I will give him a big hug.

756
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,980
Do you need to hug him to apologize?

757
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,640
It's not sincere to just apologize.

758
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,720
Good friends should hug each other

759
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,030
to show our sincerity.

Take a look.

785
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,260
Thank you.

786
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,710
Sorry.

787
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,550
Sorry.

788
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,380
I'm late.

789
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,670
Sorry for wasting your time.

790
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,630
It's okay.

791
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,620
Wasting others' time

792
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,350
equals wasting others' lives.

793
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,610
Why did he hug me last night?

794
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,360
Could it be...

795
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,220
he likes me...

796
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,490
I'm sorry.

797
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,570
I'll get changed now.

798
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,200
Over there.

799
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,670
I will get a comb.

800
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,950
Why did you blush?

801
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,560
Your heart is beating so fast.

802
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,880
Calm down.

803
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,400
Get changed.

804
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,970
We're done.

805
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,340
Why haven't you two finished yet?

806
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,620
Hurry up. They are waiting for us.

807
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,800
I think I'm a little...

808
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,260
Isn't there someone else?

809
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,490
Hi.

810
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,370
It's okay. The heels are too high.

811
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,530
These are your flowers.

812
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,300
Hurry up.

813
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,970
They are waiting for us.

814
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,500
Let's go.

815
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,140
Who do you think is the most handsome among the best men?

816
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,940
He Zhengyu,

817
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,950
of course.

818
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,120
I also think Mr. He is handsome.

819
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,220
Did you see his figure?

820
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,110
He looks very self-disciplined.

821
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,260
He is also talented.

822
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,720
I also heard that his customers are either rich or noble.

823
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,630
Either rich or noble.

824
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,830
Either rich or noble?

825
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,820
Didn't he just sue for

826
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,010
Li Ziqiang, an ordinary person?

827
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:40,980
Look.

828
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,640
Mr. He is not only rich,

829
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,260
but also very sympathetic.

830
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,530
I heard that he's arrogant

831
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,390
domineering and sharp-tongued.

832
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,030
He has a lot of bad habits.

833
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,300
He's arrogant and domineering.

834
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,980
I like his personality.

835
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,450
How do you know him so well?

836
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:54,860
Yeah.

837
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,860
What's your relationship with him?

838
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,580
Roommates.

839
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,480
I heard some gossip from my roommate.

840
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,310
I heard that he was still single.

841
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,850
Don't worry. You guys won't be his girlfriends.

842
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,910
He'll be single in four months.

843
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,970
Alright, let's go.

844
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,620
Okay, handsome men and beautiful girls,

845
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,820
our rehearsal is about to start.

846
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,330
Best men, please stand in a row on the left side.

847
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,770
Bridesmaids, please come to the right

848
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,160
to match the best men

849
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,160
and get ready to come to the stage.

850
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,880
Fine, girls.

851
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,900
To make the scene more beautiful

852
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
and more harmonious,

853
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,140
bridesmaids, please go for the best man

854
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,400
who has the same corsage with you

855
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,790
for matching, OK?

856
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,380
Best men, please look for your matching bridesmaids too.

857
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,420
Hurry up.

858
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,530
You can get closer

859
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,460
and get to know each other first.

860
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,260
Later,

861
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,840
our rehearsal will start soon.

862
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,500
Best men...

863
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,430
Everyone has been waiting for you

864
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,450
for an hour today.

865
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,640
Why are you pulling a long face?

866
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,870
I feel guilty

867
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,380
because I waste others' time.

868
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,820
I don't dare to pull a long face.

869
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,680
-You have bad eyesight. -The first group get ready.

870
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,090
OK. We are going to go on the stage.

871
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,130
Keep smiling.

872
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:09,950
Action.

873
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,670
OK. Smile.

874
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,660
He Zhengyu.

875
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,440
speaking of which,

876
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,090
since we met,

877
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,850
we seem to have connections.

878
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,100
We kind of become good friends because of the conflicts.

879
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,160
Let's shake hands and be reconciled.

880
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,100
Be reconciled?

881
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,010
I don't think we need to be reconciled.

882
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,990
Our relationship today

883
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,420
is just about the wedding

884
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,780
where my friend marry your friend.

885
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,450
We can't be friends.

886
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,690
Okay, Team Four, get ready.

887
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,110
However,

888
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,850
if you have legal problems,

889
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,050
you can ask me.

890
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,070
Forget it.

891
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,670
As for your identity,

892
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,050
you are not my target clients.

893
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,960
Who are you looking down on?

894
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,740
But we are

895
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,230
the best man and the bridesmaid.

896
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,690
Can I get a discount if I hire you for a lawsuit?

897
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,140
No.

898
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,950
No, he's not him.

899
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,660
The He Zhengyu in front of me

900
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,320
is not my roommate He Zhengyu.

901
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,410
Although it's only been four months,

902
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,600
they are totally different.

903
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,310
I hate the old one.

904
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,690
Remember to put my name card

905
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,290
beside your ID card.

906
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,630
You won't get another one if you lose it.

907
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,960
I'm sorry.

908
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,520
I don't think my height

909
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,570
is suitable for the best man.

910
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,730
Can I switch with you?

911
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:12,270
Okay.

912
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,260
Thank you.

913
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,020
Okay, bridesmaids and best men,

914
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,340
our rehearsal for this round

915
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,140
is over.

916
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,600
Let's move on to the next round of rehearsal.

917
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,730
Let's welcome the bride.

918
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,210
I need to answer this call.

919
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:24,820
Are you okay?

920
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,520
I'm fine.

921
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Sorry, everyone.

922
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,030
I have something to deal with.

923
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,620
In order not to waste your time,

924
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,080
Zhengyu,

925
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,880
please help me with the process.

926
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,790
You may not know that

927
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:37,040
Mr. He is like a brother to us.

928
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,670
He is also Jirong's brother.

929
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,450
-Let's continue with the rehearsal. -I'll be back soon.

930
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,450
I'll be back soon.

931
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,150
OK.

932
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:58,370
Mr. Zhang.

933
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,630
Thank you.

934
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,550
Yes.

935
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,950
I am at the rehearsal of Jirong's wedding.

936
