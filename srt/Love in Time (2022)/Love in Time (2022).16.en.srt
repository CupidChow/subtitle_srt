5
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Morning, Jirong.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,360
Morning, Jialan.

7
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
I made the breakfast.

8
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,420
Have some.

9
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,680
Thank you.

10
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,020
Jirong,

11
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,570
I've troubled you this time.

12
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,780
I'll move out once I find an apartment.

13
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,590
Chen Jialan,

14
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,949
what's going on between you and He Zhengyu?

15
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,540
Nothing.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
We broke up.

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,080
Part as friends.

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,050
Is there any misunderstanding?

19
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,920
No.

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,020
We just broke up peacefully.

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,750
And we won't get back together.

22
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,210
I need to catch the bus.

23
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,090
I may be late.

24
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,640
You guys eat first.

25
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,100
I'll take this.

26
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,920
I've figured it out, Brother.

27
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,160
Sun Defeng was the one who ordered Wang to do that.

28
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,200
He intended to set you up.

29
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,220
Sun Defeng even told Wang

30
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,620
how to answer in court.

31
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,420
The purpose is to shift the blame to you

32
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,170
to get you be investigated by the Bar Association.

33
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,050
Well.

34
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,160
He dug a hole, built a ladder,

35
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,100
and then invited me to the trap.

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,620
Sun's quite good at

37
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,680
seting someone up.

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,110
He's so cunning.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,490
Fortunately, you were prepared.

40
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,300
Otherwise, he would have set you up.

41
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,230
You have no idea.

42
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,450
Sun Defeng paid Wang a lot.

43
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,350
At first, he didn't say anything.

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,070
After he got drunk,

45
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,920
he told me everything.

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,620
Your business level has improved.

47
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,270
Keep it up.

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,980
It's not a big deal.

49
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,360
I've thought about it.

50
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,470
From now on, I'll be in charge of external affairs.

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,470
And you will take internal affairs.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,400
But seriously,

53
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,420
well,

54
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,829
we have to take the initiative.

55
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,900
We can't let Sun Defeng set us up again.

56
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,540
No need.

57
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,020
We already know

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,079
Sun Defeng's mind and his trump card.

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,840
But he knows nothing about us.

60
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,660
So let's stay still

61
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,650
in case we trigger the butterfly effect

62
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,380
or even something unexpected.

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,510
When did you start worrying about others?

64
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm being thoughtful.

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,660
Anyway, keep an eye on Sun Defeng.

66
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,240
We can act accordingly.

67
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,030
Hello, Anwen.

68
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,260
Zhengyu.

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,800
Do you have time for lunch?

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,820
Let's have lunch together.

71
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,620
I want to consult you something.

72
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:20,620
OK.

73
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,580
Anwen.

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,650
Zhengyu.

75
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,430
Have a seat.

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,800
How is your work? Is everything good?

77
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,580
Yep.

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,780
Dealing with the proprietors

79
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,480
is much easier than dealing with the investors.

80
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,590
Good to know.

81
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,880
Two steaks?

82
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,810
Sure.

83
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,220
Is there traffic jam?

84
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,290
No.

85
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,980
Excuse me.

86
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,480
Thank you.

87
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Your steak.

88
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,980
Please enjoy.

89
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,060
-Excuse me. -I want some lemon.

90
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,220
Okay, please wait a moment.

91
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,740
Okay.

92
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,090
I was reading this

93
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,140
when you came in.

94
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,390
The stock is doing well recently.

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,260
I'm thinking about selling it off

96
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,650
after several days.

97
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,540
Then I'll pay you back first.

98
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,340
Anwen,

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,380
it doesn't matter whether you pay back or not.

100
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,770
You need to quit gambling.

101
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,660
If you can't,

102
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,250
I don't know if you can pay back your debt in the rest of your life.

103
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,740
More importantly, you might have to go to jail.

104
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,020
I will. I will quit.

105
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,730
I've quit.

106
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,490
Don't worry.

107
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,720
Hello, your steak.

108
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,820
Okay, thank you.

109
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,080
-Please enjoy. -Please take this away.

110
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,810
Okay.

111
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
By the way, Anwen,

112
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,620
don't you have something to consult me?

113
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,080
Jiang Shenghao

114
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,410
said he signed a marriage agreement with Jirong.

115
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,340
He asked you to draft the agreement.

116
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,070
Is that true?

117
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,590
What's wrong?

118
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,300
I just don't understand.

119
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,260
You know that

120
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,700
before they got married,

121
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,660
I wanted him to sign an agreement like that.

122
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,380
But he refused to sign it no matter what.

123
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,310
Now he's married and suddenly signed the agreement.

124
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,290
Is this agreement still valid?

125
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,470
No matter it's a prenuptial agreement or a marital agreement,

126
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,520
as long as it's a civil agreement

127
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,870
signed by both parties,

128
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,350
it will be valid.

129
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,900
Is there such an article in the agreement?

130
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,440
If Jiang Shenghao

131
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,270
has an affair,

132
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,940
he'll have to give up the joint property.

133
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,240
Don't look at me like that.

134
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,010
I just want to verify with you.

135
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,120
According to the terms of the agreement,

136
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,340
both parties have this right and obligation.

137
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,290
Whoever cheats

138
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,950
will have to give up the joint property.

139
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,630
Whoever?

140
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,100
You should know Jirong well.

141
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,860
I'm just explaining the agreement.

142
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,720
He did sign the agreement.

143
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,750
But

144
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,960
it's hard

145
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,520
to define cheating.

146
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,650
What can be the evidence?

147
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,110
If there is no so-called evidence of cheating,

148
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,620
how can the other party sue

149
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,770
the one who cheated?

150
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,060
Anwen,

151
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,800
there are many kinds of evidence.

152
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,740
As long as it's obtained by legal means,

153
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,600
it can be considered as evidence.

154
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,650
But Anwen,

155
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,260
we should

156
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,110
give them more blessings.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,659
You always talk about cheating.

158
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
It's inappropriate.

159
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,120
Yes, it's inappropriate.

160
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,350
Sometimes, when I talk,

161
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,230
I just shoot from the hip.

162
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,490
Don't take it to heart.

163
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,770
But I don't.

164
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,280
Where are you going? I can give you a ride.

165
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,740
No need.

166
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,660
I hailed a car.

167
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,500
I'm meeting a client.

168
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,610
It's a bit far.

169
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,770
Go on with your work.

170
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,540
I'm leaving.

171
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,510
Okay. Take care.

172
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,530
Jialan.

173
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,120
You did a good job today.

174
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,659
Thank you, Liu.

175
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,990
I'll keep working hard.

176
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,130
But don't rush for quick success.

177
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,179
You're still young.

178
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,710
You have a long way to go, you know?

179
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,260
I won't drive you hom today.

180
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,530
I'll send the materials back to the company first.

181
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:43,860
Okay.

182
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,860
See you tomorrow, Liu.

183
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
See you tomorrow.

184
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,170
Wu Anwen once used Chen Kexin

185
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,010
to make Rat break the agreement.

186
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,280
Now that the marriage agreement was signed,

187
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,270
will Wu Anwen contact her again?

188
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,300
Be punctual next time.

189
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,260
What a coincidence.

190
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,020
Just a little bit late.

191
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,730
They...

192
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,770
Why did you ask me out?

193
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,340
I want to see if I can cooperate with Miss Chen.

194
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,540
Cooperate?

195
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,570
How?

196
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,090
Miss Chen, do you remember this photo?

197
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,340
Sorry.

198
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:40,630
Anwen.

199
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:41,840
Zhengyu.

200
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,650
What... What a coincidence.

201
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,010
Yes, it is.

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,020
Anwen,

203
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,410
when did you become so close to Miss Chen?

204
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,130
Maybe Mr. He is too busy.

205
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,940
We are in a relationship.

206
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,780
Anwen.

207
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,970
Did you just know it too?

208
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,760
Your joke is not funny at all.

209
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,640
Well, you know,

210
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,860
Kexin

211
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,130
is Jiang Shenghao's ex-girlfriend.

212
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,410
So this is a bit awkward.

213
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,180
I can't say it.

214
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,020
Since you met me today,

215
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,830
keep it a secret for me?

216
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,740
But, Zhengyu,

217
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,110
since we just met,

218
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,230
is it really a coincidence that we met here again?

219
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,020
Well. Yep.

220
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,110
Or

221
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,980
you thought it's not safe for me to take a taxi alone

222
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,830
and followed me all the way here.

223
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,420
Zhengyu.

224
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,400
Sorry, I'm late again.

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,460
You won't blame me, right?

226
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,670
Of course no,

227
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,180
honey.

228
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,880
You're here too?

229
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,200
What a coincidence.

230
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,750
Zhengyu.

231
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
I heard the hot spring here is great.

232
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,120
Why don't the four of us

233
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,070
go for the hot spring sometime?

234
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,420
Sure.

235
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:16,750
Sure.

236
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,530
Cool.

237
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,790
We're leaving.

238
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,570
-OK. -OK.

239
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,430
Let's go.

240
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,910
Take care.

241
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,680
Bye.

242
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,940
It's alright.

243
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
You two should go.

244
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,830
Okay.

245
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,210
Bye.

246
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,950
Why are you here?

247
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,210
Are you following me or Wu Anwen?

248
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,850
I'm here.

249
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,130
If you think with your brain,

250
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,700
you'll know I'm following Chen Kexin.

251
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,150
After Rat signed the agreement,

252
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,010
I knew Wu Anwen will make trouble.

253
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,470
And I was right.

254
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,580
They even

255
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,980
pretended to be a couple.

256
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,080
I didn't expect they would do that.

257
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,040
Didn't you use the same trick?

258
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,550
I'm different from them.

259
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,990
That's my brainwave when in danger.

260
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,810
Well, you're the same for me.

261
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,580
Wait.

262
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,380
Do you think I want to be a fake couple with you?

263
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,910
It's all for Rat and Jirong.

264
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,730
Since Wu Anwen said

265
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,090
Chen Kexin is his girlfriend,

266
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,190
let's play along

267
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,540
and make it come true.

268
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,090
Your brain can be useful sometimes.

269
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,830
Tell me. What's your trick?

270
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,810
I took a photo

271
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,780
when Chen Kexin was holding Wu Anwen.

272
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,390
I will send the photo to Jirong.

273
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,120
In that case,

274
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,960
no matter how Wu Anwen framed Sheng Hao,

275
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,020
it will be useless.

276
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,150
I'm leaving.

277
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,520
Wait.

278
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,480
I have something to tell you.

279
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,660
What?

280
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,540
You want me to continue pretending your boyfriend?

281
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,140
Can you keep your voice down?

282
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,150
Are you addicted to acting?

283
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,470
You have to make it look real.

284
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,700
If you did that in front of Wu Anwen,

285
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
shouldn't we also act like that

286
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,780
in front of Jirong and Jiang Shenghao?

287
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,650
Or how can we explain

288
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,980
that Chen Kexin is Wu Anwen's girlfriend?

289
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,140
Then go find the other He Zhengyu

290
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,590
and let him go with you after time-space overlap.

291
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,340
We broke up.

292
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,630
Well.

293
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,650
You were so sweet before.

294
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,240
Why did you break up all of a sudden?

295
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,110
Do you really not know?

296
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,180
You knew

297
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,460
what I will be like

298
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,550
in 2022.

299
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,900
But you didn't tell me.

300
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,670
You knew everything?

301
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,430
You think you won't have a future

302
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,870
so you broke up with him.

303
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,440
For the two in love,

304
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,100
if one of them knows the other

305
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,300
will encounter misfortune,

306
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,740
shouldn't they choose

307
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,920
to face it together?

308
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,980
Cherish the remaining beautiful time.

309
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,320
I have no future.

310
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,780
But he has.

311
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,820
I think it's good now.

312
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,560
We just met.

313
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,550
Maybe he doesn't like me that much.

314
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,420
So do I.

315
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,800
It's okay.

316
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,720
No, thanks.

317
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,770
I think

318
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,220
this is just your one-sided thought.

319
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,280
Based on my understanding of myself,

320
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,270
the me living in four months later

321
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,210
won't give up so easily.

322
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,980
[2022]

323
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,860
As for acting as a boyfriend,

324
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,630
you should go to that He Zhengyu.

325
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,870
I can't do it.

326
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,400
[2021]

327
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,260
[Zhengyu Thank you.]

328
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,180
He Zhengyu.

329
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,270
Sorry for wasting your time.

330
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,060
I have to go.

331
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,000
[Don't let her go.]

332
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,000
[Look at you.]

333
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,460
You can go on your work.

334
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,190
I'm done.

335
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,660
People often say

336
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,410
person who is disappointed in love loves to talk.

337
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,290
I'm willing to be a listener now.

338
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,670
If I ask you again,

339
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,060
will you say yes?

340
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,950
What are you waiting for?

341
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,350
Sit down and have a drink.

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,810
What would you do if I say

343
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,430
I'll turn you down again?

344
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,100
I might hit you.

345
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,580
I'll think about it.

346
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,360
Let's have another drink.

347
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,000
Have you made up your mind?

348
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,480
I'm here.

349
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Give it back to me.

350
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,490
I can give it back to you.

351
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,610
But give me an answer.

352
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,670
Are you nodding or shaking your head?

353
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,860
Just a glance.

354
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,720
I'll tell you right away if I nod or shake my head.

355
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,870
I need to go to the bathroom.

356
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,550
Why are you here?

357
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,610
You can't be here.

358
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,600
That He Zhengyu is here.

359
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,930
He knew I was here and went to the bathroom.

360
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,110
You're still worried that the time-space overlap will collapse,

361
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:19,830
right?

362
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,520
I can help.

363
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,460
He Zhengyu,

364
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,210
we broke up.

365
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,910
You're not a clingy person.

366
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,260
Let go.

367
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,690
I respect you.

368
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,370
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,310
I'm the one who should apologize.

370
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,410
You said we broke up.

371
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,040
No matter how reluctant I am,

372
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,660
I should cooperate with you.

373
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,930
But I don't want to give up.

374
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,520
I want to try

375
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,220
to change our fate

376
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,490
and seize you.

377
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,240
He Zhengyu, you...

378
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,730
Just try one more time, OK?

379
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,560
If we succeed this time,

380
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
we don't have to break up.

381
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,220
We can change our fate.

382
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,610
No matter what others do,

383
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,840
at least...

384
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,260
at least we

385
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,990
don't have to suffer like this.

386
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,970
Just try one more time.

387
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,980
OK?

388
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,420
Okay.

389
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,200
Here.

390
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,340
So many boxes.

391
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,910
Are you moving out?

392
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,770
No.

393
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,030
Business trip.

394
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,320
Business trip?

395
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,820
But this is too much.

396
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,650
Let's go. It may be late.

397
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,910
[2022]

398
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,300
It's the one in front.

399
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,440
Jialan.

400
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,660
Wait here.

401
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,700
I'll go in and see

402
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,110
if there's anyone else.

403
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,190
Okay.

404
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,690
Wait.

405
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,980
If Mr. Mu is here,

406
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,890
don't come out.

407
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,950
I'm afraid he'll recognize me even I put on a mask.

408
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,040
Okay.

409
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,580
No.

410
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,700
I can't see the me living in 2022.

411
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,370
Otherwise, time-space will collapse.

412
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,980
What happened?

413
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,100
Thank you.

414
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,790
It's okay. It's our duty.

415
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,860
Call us if anything happens.

416
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,570
Okay.

417
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,490
What happened?

418
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,230
The electrocardiogram monitor

419
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,810
detected a sudden change.

420
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,730
But she's back to normal now.

421
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,510
Jialan.

422
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,110
Did you do something just now?

423
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,420
I just walked a few steps forward

424
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,940
to see what it looks like inside.

425
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,180
But I suddenly thought

426
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,840
what if time-space collapse.

427
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,060
So I came back.

428
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,080
In that case,

429
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,500
it may have something to do with

430
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,830
the distance between you and the sickbed.

431
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,520
The closer you are,

432
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,030
the more emotional the you on the sickbed will be.

433
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,560
Emotional fluctuations?

434
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,600
Is this good for waking up?

435
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,480
We may try.

436
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,920
The Jialan from 2021

437
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,670
is approaching the Jialan from 2022.

438
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,800
What will happen?

439
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,710
Will time-space collapse again?

440
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,660
Jialan.

441
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,330
Jialan!

442
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,870
Jialan!

443
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,600
The time-space overlap collapsed again.

444
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,960
Will the other me wake up?

445
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,470
If you can't wake up this time,

446
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,720
we can try again next time.

447
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,590
If you can't wake up next time,

448
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,960
we can try again and again.

449
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,220
Jialan.

450
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,410
I won't give up.

451
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,490
He Zhengyu, are you home?

452
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,950
He Zhengyu!

453
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,660
But the time-space overlap did happen.

454
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,380
Why is the darts machine gone?

455
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,630
So many boxes.

456
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,280
Are you moving out?

457
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,680
Did He Zhengyu really move out?

458
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,890
[2022]

459
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,660
Why isn't he here yet?

460
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,710
Is he not coming?

461
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,730
Hello, nurse.

462
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,140
How is

463
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,250
the patient now?

464
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,440
Are you her family?

465
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,420
I'm her friend.

466
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,810
Nothing special.

467
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,690
Is there anyone else in the ward?

468
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,910
No.

469
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,700
Who visited her today?

470
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,490
Mr. Mu was here today.

471
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,780
Only Mr. Mu?

472
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,910
Did the patient's boyfriend come?

473
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,430
I don't know.

474
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,440
Sorry.

475
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,580
My phone is dead.

476
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,950
Can I use your phone?

477
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,940
Sure, go ahead.

478
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,540
Thank you.

479
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,450
Sorry,

480
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,270
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

481
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:56,980
Oh no.

482
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,490
[2021]

483
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,020
Why didn't He Zhengyu come today?

484
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,950
Where did he go?

485
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,550
Will he contact the one living in four months ago?

486
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,400
Hello, Jirong.

487
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,860
Can you tell me

488
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,080
the exact address of He Zhengyu's home?

489
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,100
Am I too impulsive?

490
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,690
What if the reason

491
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,950
why his phone is dead is out of juice or...

492
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,410
Even if He Zhengyu really wanted to move out,

493
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,230
since I insisted on breaking up with him,

494
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,500
who am I

495
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,220
to inquire about him?

496
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,390
No, I can't do it.

497
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,330
Where did he go?

498
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,350
It's quite late for you to come.

499
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,420
You want to drink with me again?

500
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,500
No, I'm sorry.

501
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,040
I want to ask you

502
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,300
do you know anything about that He Zhengyu?

503
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,200
I can't find him or get through to him.

504
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm worried something might happen to him.

505
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,440
What could happen to a man like him?

506
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,250
Maybe it's because his phone is dead.

507
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:11,820
No.

508
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,320
He didn't visit the me in hospital today.

509
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,300
If you care so much,

510
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,500
why don't you make up?

511
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,850
Are you two working together

512
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,390
to make me worry again?

513
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,930
Maybe he retreated in order to advance.

514
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,580
Based on my understanding of myself,

515
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,240
it's like the way I treat love.

516
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,630
Retreat in order to advance?

517
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,860
Even if he doesn't come to the hospital again,

518
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,590
I don't care.

519
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,130
Sorry to bother you.

520
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,310
Why would anyone want to date?

521
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,740
Crazy.

522
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,960
Brother.

523
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,020
If Jialan hadn't met you

524
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,420
in the hotel that day,

525
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,020
how long are you going to keep it from us?

526
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,750
I don't want you to overthink.

527
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,960
After all, Kexin used to...

528
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,670
Am I that petty?

529
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,500
Shenghao and I are married.

530
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:25,420
Although Miss Chen is his ex-girlfriend,

531
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,540
and we had a quarrel before,

532
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,520
you are my only family.

533
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,820
If Miss Chen is your final choice,

534
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,090
Shenghao and I will give you our best wishes.

535
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,969
Yes, Jirong is right.

536
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,690
We will sincerely bless you.

Let's leave them behind.

To be honest,

540
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,460
if Jialan hadn't taken that photo,

541
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,690
I would never believe

542
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,489
that Anwen and Miss Chen will be in a relationship.

543
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,179
Yes, let bygones be bygones.

544
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,389
I think Chen Kexin is your sister-in-law now.

545
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:58,570
Right.

546
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,680
Anwen,

547
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,500
shouldn't you toast me?

548
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,500
If it weren't me,

549
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
you wouldn't dare to make it public.

550
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,650
Yes, I want to thank you.

551
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,120
A toast to you.

552
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,980
Anwen,

553

00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,550
I will.

555

I'll learn from Zhengyu about this.

556
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,260
Why isn't Zhengyu here today?

557

Famous lawyers are always busy.

When did you make up?

559
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,350
Well. It just happened.

560
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,530
Chen Jialan,

561
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,010
two days ago, you said

you would never get back together with him.

563
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,620
You are really changeable.

564
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,070
When did you get back together?

565
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,590
Jialan told me last night.

566
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,740
You are his girlfriend,

567
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,540
how can you don't know where your boyfriend lives?

568
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,860
Chen Jialan, you're so mean.

569
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,590
Alright.

570
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,860
Isn't getting back together a good thing?

Did something leak from you?

Why do I feel Chen Jialan is weird?

580
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,430
I think she knew something.

581
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,720
Wu Anwen,

582
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,880
don't try to shift the blame to me.

583
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,090
It's just a brainwave to pretend to be a couple.

584
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,290
Chen Jialan knew you have a girlfriend,

585
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,500
and told your sister and your brother-in-law.

586
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,030
What's so strange about it?

587

This is great.

Jiang Shenghao signed the agreement.

591
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,500
Will your sister believe

592
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,540
that I cheat with Jiang Shenghao?

593

I don't care.

You have no money?

I can only earn a little salary.

I wouldn't have done this with you.

Besides, don't say that again.

You have no money now.

Where did you go yesterday?

Why didn't you tell me?
