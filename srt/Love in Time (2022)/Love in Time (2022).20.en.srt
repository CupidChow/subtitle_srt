Do you often play this game

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,740
in the video

6
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,789
when you were at home?

7
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,990
It's just that our tacit understanding

8
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,720
between us is not good enough.

9
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,590
The answer doesn't matter.

10
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,380
What matters is that he is willing to spend time

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,350
to play this unreasonable game with you.

12
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,170
That means he really cares about you.

13

I won't give up on you

39
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,170
no matter how the entropy changes.

40
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,900

41

we have changed Jirong's fate.

42
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,840
We will be like Sisyphus.

43
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,830
Let's try one more time.

44
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,610
We can change your fate.

45
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,820
The other me

46
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,520
forgot to tell you something yesterday.

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,250
The most famous sentence about the Law of Entropy

48
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,010
was said by Schrodinger.

49
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,020
Living organisms feed on negative entropy.

50
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,090
The meaning of life

51
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,310
is the process of continuous battles to fight against entropy increase.

52
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,280
Do you know

53
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,340
how many times he rolled the rock?

54
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,920
He didn't know how many times.

55
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,780
But he always believed in the next time.

56
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,400
So you have to believe

57
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,500
we can turn 46 minutes

58
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,530
into 24 hours.

59
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,040
As long as we believe there will be a good result,

60
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,370
we don't care if it needs to take some time.

61
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:43,960
Okay.

62
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,700
It's just rolling the rock.

She died in a car accident.

69
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,290
What?

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,460
The time-space overlap still exists.

71

I still rented this apartment.

72
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,130
So, we were still set up by Sun Defeng.

73
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,660
Don't tell Jialan about this.

74

75
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,150

76
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,420

77
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,570
I've kept an eye on Sun Defeng.

78

How did he do it?

79
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,300
It's really like when I was a kid.

80
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,530

81

00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,200
it's useless.

174
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,740
What happened to Jirong is the best proof.

175
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,240
Sisyphus will stop rolling the rock.

176
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,180
There must be someone who has to leave.

177
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,440
It is destined.

178
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,710
Let me, who is in a coma,

179
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,350
do it.

180
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,660
You don't have to come to me.

181
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,610
Don't worry.

182
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,270
I will cherish

183
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,340
every day I have.

184
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,700
I hope you can have a better life.

185
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,870
Then my choice today will not be in vain.

186
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,840
Forget me.

187
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,600
I have regrets in my life,

188
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,190
but I'm content because of you.

189
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,940
Are you okay?

190
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,810
Chen Jialan.

191
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,360
I was fooled by your pretense of being relaxed again.

192
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,600
You are determined this time.

193
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,690
What's wrong with Mu Shiming?

194
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,520
Zhengyu.

195
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,390
There is a new case.

196
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,950
Let's talk about it later.

197
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,900
What's the rush?

198
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,880
Mu Shiming.

199
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,510
Did Chen Jialan contact you?

200
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,970
Do you know where she went?

201
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,210
She asked for a leave

202
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,540
on WeChat this morning.

203
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,110
Did something happen to Jialan?

204
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,350
If Chen Jialan contacts you,

205
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,550
tell me immediately.

206
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,330
He Zhengyu.

207
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,990
The case?

208
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,290
What is it? Tell me.

209
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,620
A while ago, a female employee of the Gao's Group

210
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,160
was drunk and sexually harassed by her boss.

211
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,740
Then she was fired by the company without any reason.

212
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
The client has publicly asked for help online

213
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,980
and it has caused many arguments.

214
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,420
Now Zhang Xiaojiang

215
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,500
came to our law firm,

216
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,030
hoping you can be her lawyer

217
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,150
to help solve this.

218
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,010
Sexual harassment after drinking.

219
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,560
It is difficult to collect evidence in such cases.

220
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,370
And the legal definition

221
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,450
is vague.

222
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,170
Unless there is strong evidence,

223
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,840
it's hard to determine which side is innocent.

224
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,440
There are two groups online.

225
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,500
One group sympathizes with Zhang Xiaojiang.

226
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,610
The other group thinks neither side is innocent,

227
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,940
thinking that they didn't reach the agreement on the price.

228
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,650
How about this?

229
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,870
You go meet the client

230
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,100
and get to know

231
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,620
what happened at the time

232
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,780
to ensure that she has provided complete information.

233
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,140
Second, after the incident,

234
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,760
did she call the police immediately?

235
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,720
What about the evidence at the time of the crime?

236
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,920
Don't miss any useful clues.

237
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
I will decide

238
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,990
whether we should take this case or not,

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,980
after you sort out all the information.

240
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,400
Got it.

241
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,130
Chen Jialan.

242
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,000
Where are you?

243
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,430
Thank you.

244
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,490
Blueberry.

245
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,890
Plum.

246
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,280
Peach blossom.

247
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,190
What is this?

248
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,570
This must be grandma's best wine.

249
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,430
Kiddo,

250
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,500
I just sealed it.

251
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't touch it.

252
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,240
I just want to try it for you.

253
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,550
Try?

254
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,820
Grandma,

255
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,330
do you remember I liked to make wine with you

256
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,650
when I was little?

257
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,650
Yes.

258
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,270
How could I forget?

259
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,150
You've been a troublemaker since childhood.

260
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,720
I remember that year when I just made a jar of wine,

261
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,359
you secretly grabbed salt and sprinkled it in.

262
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,150
When I opened the jar after a month,

263
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,869
oh my god, there was a terrible smell.

264
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,400
You made a lot of trouble for me.

265
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,480
I was just curious.

266
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,970
I wanted to know what it tasted like

267
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,760
with salt.

268
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
You were satisfied with curiosity.

269
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,080
It was killing me.

270
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,080
Grandma, you smell so good.

271
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,850
I'm almost 70 years old.

272
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,620
What good smell can there be?

273
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,050
You smell good.

274
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,340
It's the smell of my childhood.

275
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,720
Grandma's smell.

276
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,290
I will never forget this smell.

277
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,900
Dad.

278
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,650
Mom.

279
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,850
I might be able to reunite with you soon.

280
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,220
Jialan.

281
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,860
Dinner is ready.

282
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,890
Come downstairs and eat.

283
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,150
Coming.

284
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,120
Time to eat.

285
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,620
Squirrel-shaped mandarin fish.

286
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,730
Biluo shrimp, and braised tofu.

287
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,410
They are all my favorites.

288
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,260
Eat more if you like.

289
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,800
Okay.

290
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,130
Look at you.

291
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,400
When you get married,

292
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,070
aren't you afraid your in-laws will laugh at you?

293
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,430
Then I won't get married.

294
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,560
I will stay with you.

295
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,930
Don't talk nonsense.

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Jialan,

297
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,800
I'm getting old.

298
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,800
I can't be with you forever.

299
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,040
Don't blame me for nagging.

300
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,840
You need to find someone you like

301
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,860
as soon as possible.

302
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,980
That He Zhengyu you mentioned

303
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,640
is not bad.

304
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,950
A good man like him is very popular.

305
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,530
Don't talk about me.

306
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,420
Grandma, when will you find a husband?

307
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,340
Mrs. Li told me that

308
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,000
many old men are pursuing you.

309
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,630
You kiddo.

310
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,610
How dare you

311
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,180
joke about me?

312
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,360
I'm serious.

313
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,530
If you meet someone nice,

314
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,040
you should think about it.

315
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,120
I've been away all year long.

316
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,550
I can't take care of you.

317
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,450
I wish someone could take care of you.

318
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,860
Eat up.

319
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:39,890
Here.

320
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,300
Grandma.

321
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,460
I want to see my parents later.

322
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,480
It's time to see them.

323
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,260
But there is the rain.

324
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,500
It rains off and on here.

325
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,980
How about another day?

326
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,410
It's okay. I'll just bring an umbrella.

327
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,790
Okay, let's eat.

328
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,580
Let me get you some soup.

329
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,270
Eat.

330
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,560
If I win 10 million,

331
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
the first thing I want to do is

332
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
to renovate my grandma's homestay.

333
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,440
[Jiale Home]

334
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,320
-Hello, He... -Is Chen Jialan back home?

335
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,330
No.

336
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,420
Where did she go?

337
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,030
Why is there no news?

338
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,060
She probably went back to her grandma's house in Changjia.

339
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,260
I only have 46 minutes.

340
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
I can't make it.

341
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,170
Changjia?

342
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,650
I'll go.

343
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,110
I'm on my way.

344
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,250
Send me the address.

345
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,710
Okay.

346
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,900
By the way,

347
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,820
when you see Chen Jialan again,

348
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,200
don't tell her about

349
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,570
entropy increase or decrease.

350
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,900
If she is missing again,

351
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,990
I won't forgive you.

352
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,130
Are you blaming me?

353
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,370
If it weren't for you,

354
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,300
Jialan wouldn't have gone missing.

355
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,820
Fine.

356
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,860
It's not the time to discuss who's wrong.

357
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,310
Go.

358
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,560
By the way,

359
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,710
drive safe at night.

360
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,180
If you're alive, that means I'm fine.

Jialan.

386
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,270
It's raining outside,

387
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,590
but I'm not by your side.

388
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,790
I know you made your choice,

389
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,870
but I have my own choice.

390
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,880
-Granny, calm down. -Officer, I beg you.

391
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,500
My granddaughter went out yesterday

392
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,900
and hasn't come back yet.

393
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,200
-Let me go. -Granny, please calm down.

394
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,740
Please listen to me.

395
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,150
The rainstorm has just stopped.

396
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,360
The road on the mountain is dangerous.

397
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,170
The staff

398
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,250

399
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,790

Yes?

402
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,570
We are short of rescue members.

403
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,230
Please send some people here.

404
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,140
Copy that.

405
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,280
Granny, wait a moment.

406
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,410
I need to make a call.

407
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,140
Hello, granny.

408
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,510
May I ask

409
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,750
if Chen Jialan lives here?

410
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,740
I'm He Zhengyu. I'm Jialan's...

411
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,710
He Zhengyu.

412
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,050
Jialan's boyfriend, the lawyer.

413
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,760
Granny.

414
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,090
What happened to Jialan?

415
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,850
Jialan went to

416
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,660
her parents' grave tomorrow afternoon.

417
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,540
But she hasn't come back yet.

418
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,220
I couldn't get through to her.

419
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,180
I'm so worried.

420
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,540
Granny, calm down.

421
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,620
May I know where this cemetery is?

422
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,030
Is it this way or that way?

423
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,820
Granny, calm down.

424
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,660
Someone is trapped in the camping area.

425
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
After we received the call,

426
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,540
we have sent people

427
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,380
to rescue.

428
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,260
And I have sent more men to help.

429
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,860
Officer,

430
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,010
where exactly is the cemetery?

431
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,580
Sir,

432
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,440
I understand what you mean.

433
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
It's difficult to make to the mountain after the rain.

434
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,400
And there may be flood

435
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,300
and mudslides.

436
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,550
Just wait here for the news, okay?

437
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,050
Here's the thing.

438
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,740
I learned field rescue before

439
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,680
and I was in the Blue Sky Rescue Team before.

440
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,180
So you may rest assured.

441
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,020
Okay.

442
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,360
Come with me to get the equipment. Take it with you.

443
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:20,990
Just in case.

444
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,400
Okay.

445
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,330
Okay, let's go.

446
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,130
Wait a second.

447
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,300
Granny, don't worry.

448
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,380
I will bring Jialan back safely.

449
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,620
Be careful.

450
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,350
Don't worry.

451
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,460
Are you okay? Be careful.

452
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,950
This way.

453
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,540
Follow me.

454
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,340
Everything is fine.

455
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,660
Keep up.

456
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,170
Hello.

457
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,050

Be careful.

460
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,430
Have you seen this girl?

461
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,640
No.

462
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:51,830
Okay.

463
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,390
Keep up. Be careful.

464
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,380
Hello.

465
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,660
May I ask

466
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,060
if you've seen this girl?

467
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,790
No.

468
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,800
Ask those in the back.

469
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,770
Okay, thank you.

470
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,160
Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Yes.

Where is she now?

477
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,380
She should be in the back.

478
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,620
Okay, thank you.

479

Thank you.

00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,600
♫Say I miss you♫

519
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,280
♫You will know that♫

520
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,740
Chen Jialan.

521
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,920
You're scaring me to death.

522
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,410
If something bad happens to you,

523
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,070
what should I tell your parents?

524
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,110
I'm fine.

525
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,830
I just sprained my ankle.

526
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,980
Fine.

527
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,550
Alright.

528
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,370
I made some ginger sugar water.

529
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,870
I'll get it for you.

530
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:28,680
Okay.

531
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,440
Thank you, grandma.

532
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,090
Granny.

533
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,230
You'll feel better with some ice on it.

534
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,230
I can do it myself.

535
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,070
It's okay.

536
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,130
Are you hurt?

537
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,930
Just a scratch.

538
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,590
I got scratched in the forest.

539
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,350
Why don't you deal with it?

540
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,460
No need.

541
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,380
You'll get infected if you don't treat it.

542
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,010
I can do it myself.

543
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,610
It's okay.

544
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:20,940
This way.

545
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,860
How could you say I have no common sense?

546
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,260
You don't even know how to treat your wound.

547
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,200
All right.

548
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,920
Why do you look guilty?

549
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,880
I don't want to talk to you.

550
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,960
You always disappear

551
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,700
and put yourself in danger.

552
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,220
Can we talk about it?

553
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,220
Do you have to do it?

554
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,260
I think you're planning to make us worried about you

555
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,060
before you sacrifice yourself.

556
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,810
I've explained everything to you.

557
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,560
Why do you have to interfere with my fate?

558
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,430
Jirong is fine now.

559
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,620
Everyone is fine.

560
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,310
If someone has to leave,

561
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,230
isn't it the best choice

562
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,850
to let me who is in coma leave?

563
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,500
Chen Jialan, have you ever thought

564
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,530
whether you sacrifice yourself for love

565
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,010
or for your own feelings?

566
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,130
You keep saying

567
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,700
you want to sacrifice yourself to protect others.

568
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,380
But have you asked

569
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,700
others how they feel?

570
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,490
It was you who said that

571
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,430
if anything goes wrong, make up for it.

572
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,910
But what are you doing now?

573
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,840
Your grandma is almost 70 years old.

574
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,780
Do you know how much

575
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,610
she loves you?

576
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,120
How will she take it if something happens to you?

577
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,179
What should she do?

578
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,560
Have you thought about these?

579
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,190
How could I not?

580
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,090
If a glass of water turns into ice in the fridge,

581
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,250
there will be entropy decrease.

582
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,510
Then the fridge will consume a lot of electricity

583
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,909
to increase the entropy.

584
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Didn't Jirong's incident prove it?

585
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,350
Let it end here.

586
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,630
I don't agree.

587
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,870
I mean

588
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,810
the He Zhengyu four months later won't agree.

589
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,210
But he only has 46 minutes

590
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,179
to spend time with you.

591
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:53,639
And I

592
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,650
have 23 hours and 14 minutes

593
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,350
every day.

594
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,340
So

595
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,430
no matter what happens,

596
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,230
the three of us have to face it together.

597
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,780
He Zhengyu.

598
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,550
I'm not as persistent as you.

599
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,700
Thank you.

600
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,220
You only have two choices now.

601
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,660
First, go back with me.

602
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,480
Second,

603
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,600
I will stay here with you.

604
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,730
It's your choice.

Move.

631
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,340
What's wrong with you?

632
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,100
Here is another seat.

633
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,560
Why do you have to sit here?

634
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,780
I just want to sit next to you.

635
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,660
Grandma, don't mind.

636
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,630
Jialan is mad at me.

637
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,790
Mad at you?

638
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,820
Did you have a fight?

639
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:53,750
Yes.

640
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,670
I accidentally pissed her off.

641
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,200
She ran away without a word.

642
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,620
I tried everything and finally found her here.

643
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,540
Jialan,

644
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,200
this is your fault.

645
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,900
It's normal for a couple

646
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,760
to have a fight.

647
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,160
How could you come home because of it?

648
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,130
Grandma, don't listen to him.

649
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,500
He is not my boyfriend.

650
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,360
Grandma, look.

651
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,470
She has been trying to break up with me since yesterday.

652
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,670
She is still mad at me.

653
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,390
No wonder you came back all of a sudden.

654
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,520
It's not because you miss me.

655
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,010
Jialan,

656
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,310
remember what I'm saying.

657
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,260
The most important thing between a couple

658
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,670
is communication and understanding.

659
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,350
You can't run away from home all the time.

660
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,370
Not to mention breaking up.

661
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,730
This will hurt your feelings.

662
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,560
We've never been together.

663
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,970
How can we break up?

664
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,930
See, you're mad.

665
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,060
Kiddo.

666
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,460
He Zhengyu,

667
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,590
what did you tell my grandma?

668
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,190
Who is it?

669
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,110
-What's happening? -Don't go.

670
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,930
Stop!

671
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,710
Grandma, stay here.

672
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,970
I'll go check with him.

673
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,420
Stop!

674
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,050
Call the police!

675
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,180
Mrs. Jiang, what happened?

676
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,080
Jialan.

677
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,900
You're back.

678
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,300
That's great.

679
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,080
Jialan.

680
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,800
You are a journalist, right?

681
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,050
You must help Zhang Xiaojiang.

682
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,260
A female employee of the Gao's Group

683
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,650
was sexually harassed by her boss.

684
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,250
There are two groups online.

685
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,090
One group sympathizes with Zhang Xiaojiang.

686
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,580
The other group thinks neither side is innocent.

687
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,870
It's my granddaughter, Zhang Xiaojiang.

688
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,600
You met her when you were young.

689
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,540
Jiang.

690
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,700
What happened to her?

691
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,420
Her boss harassed her

692
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,310
and tried to rape her.

693
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,480
Did she call the police?

694
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,280
Yes.

695
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,410
But there's not enough evidence.

696
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,090
The police can't file a case.

697
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,740
The boss even accused her

698
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,090
of defamation.

699
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,850
Jiang is arrested by the police.

700
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,210
Mrs. Zhang.

701
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Here's the thing.

702
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,540
Miss Zhang was taken away by the police,

703
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,620
but it doesn't necessarily mean she committed a crime.

704
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,820
This is not an arrest.

705
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,930
Because after the police receive a report,

706
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,630
they will summon related people to ask.

707
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,140
Summons is a normal procedure.

708
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,680
Are they going to arrest her after the summons?

709
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,130
If the police have finished the investigation and

710
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,920
there is evidence proving Zhang Xiaojiang committed defamation,

711
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,120
she will be arrested.

712
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,780
Is there any justice?

713
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,040
Is there any justice?

714
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,820
Mrs. Zhang, don't worry.

715
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,520
It's not Jiang's fault.

716
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,000
She's very brave

717
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,570
to expose him.

718
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,830
Don't worry. We have to trust the police.

719
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,810
If Jiang is framed,

720
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,400
I believe everyone will support Jiang.

721
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,770
What's wrong?

722
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,100
The Zhang Xiaojiang you just mentioned

723
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
came to me before.

724
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,960
She wanted me to be her lawyer.

725
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,400
What a coincidence.

726
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,470
You are neighbors.

727
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,180
Did you take the case?

728
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,070
Not yet.

729
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,530
But I asked Dajun to investigate it.

730
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,700
And there are many questions about this case.

731
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,250
What questions?

732
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,530
The biggest question online is,

733
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,080
how could a drunk girl

734
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,590
escape

735
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,700
from a man's hand

736
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,980
on her own?

737
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,080
She was unconscious before getting in the car

738
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,910
and how could she come to her senses after she got home?

739
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,650
This is ridiculous.

740
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,530
She resisted desperately

741
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,940
so that she could avoid getting hurt even more.

742
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,740
How could people doubt about it?

743
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,850
From what you know about her,

744
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,680
what do you think about this?

745
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,100
Generally,

746
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,120
women are vulnerable members.

747
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,900
Even if I was not a journalist,

748
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,370
in this case,

749
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,390
I'd rather trust a woman.

750
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,420
Okay. Let's go back now

751
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,930
to help Zhang Xiaojiang.

752
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,420
Now that the police

753
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,030
has taken Gao Ming's case,

754
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,740
it means he has provided evidence

755
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,620
that was against Zhang Xiaojiang.

756
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,380
So we must find Zhang Xiaojiang

757
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,690
and help her as soon as possible.

758
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,640
As a journalist,

759
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,390
you can follow this case all the way.

760
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,190
Okay, I'll go pack up.

761
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,960
You haven't eaten yet.

762
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,490
I'm fine.

763
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,740
A female employee of the Gao's Group.

764
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,060
Help Zhang Xiaojiang.

765
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,860
I'd rather trust...

766
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,920
So we must find Zhang Xiaojiang

767
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,720
and help her as soon as possible.

Everything is back to square one.

Jialan.

Remember what I said.

776
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,680
Go back and get along with Zhengyu.

Grandma.

780

Keep

781
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,020
the bank card

00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,270
just call them.

785
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,450
They will help you.

786
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,140
Got it?

787
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,450
Yes.

788
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,090
I remember it all.

789
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,440
Grandma,

790
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,320
take good care of yourself.

791
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,020
Don't worry. Go.

792
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,340
Zhengyu.

793
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,430
Here.

794
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,010
Please.

795
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,050
I entrust Jialan to you.

796
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,300
Take good care of her.

797
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,250
Don't worry, grandma.

798
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,960
I'll take good care of Jialan.

799
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,280
We're leaving.

800
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:10,370
Go.

801
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,900
Go. Hurry.

802
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,620
-We are leaving, grandma. -Go.

803
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,720
Get in the car.

804
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,260
Go back. Don't wait.

805
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,580
Get in.

806
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,420
You're awake.

807
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,480
I'll go see Zhang Xiaojiang.

808
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,200
Okay.

809
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,900
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

810
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,850
Okay. Thank you.

811
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:01,560
Jiang.

812
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:02,660
Jialan.

813
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,860
I'm sorry, Jiang.

814
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,980
I'm fine. Sorry to make you worry.

815
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,140
It's all thanks to Mr. He.

816
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,240
You're welcome.

817
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,930
Let's go eat something.

818
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,640
Jialan hasn't had breakfast yet.

819
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,080
Okay.

820
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,300
Get in the car.

821
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:21,120
Gao Ming asked me to make toasts to the clients one by one.

822
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,040
Besides,

823
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,420
I had to drink for him.

824
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,000
He said it's my basic quality as an employee.

825
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,150
After a few rounds, I totally fainted.

826
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,430
I couldn't even stand.

827
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,290
On the way back,

828
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,840
he was all over me.

829
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,210
I don't like disobedient employees.

830
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,700
When I got home,

831
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,430
Here, Jiang.

832
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,220
he followed me upstairs.

833
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,760
As soon as he came in my house,

834
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,950
he was all hands

835
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,820
I had only one thought.

836
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,000
I couldn't let him do that.

837
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,260
I fought hard.

838
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,010
I kicked him and pouched him.

839
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,980
I think I might kick something.

840
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,520
I remember he shouted and stopped.

841
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:07,750
Miss Zhang,

842
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,750
do you have any cameras in your house?

843
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,380
According to your description,

844
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,620
the evidence is very unfavorable to you.

845
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,210
There are three surveillance cameras.

846
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,180
One is in a hotel.

847
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,520
It only recorded

848
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,520
you lied on the table when you were drunk.

849
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,960
It can't prove

850
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,780
he made you drink deliberately.

851
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,380
He sent you home after dinner.

852
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,560
He could even say

853
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,020
you were drunk

854
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,440
and he did it because he cared about his subordinates.

855
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,620
The other two surveillance cameras are in your neighbourhood

856
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,620
and the elevator.

857
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,430
They only recorded he helped you upstairs

858
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,230
and there was no other movement.

859
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,550
The most important behaviors happened

860
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,350
in his car and in your house.

861
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,460
Based on the current evidence,

862
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,520
not only it can't help you,

863
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,090
but also will prove his innocence.

864
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,300
The public are scolding me

865
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,560
for spreading rumors.

866
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,500
I was harassed

867
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,820
and now I have to go to jail?

868
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,550
Don't worry.

869
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,890
What I said just now

870
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,760
is based on what we have now.

871
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,990
Maybe I shouldn't have asked for help online.

872
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,390
I'm not Gao Ming's opponent.

873
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,190
I'm scared.

874
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,600
I'm really scared.

875
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,390
Jiang,

876
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,090
I've been through cyber violence.

877
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,730
I understand how you feel.

878
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,360
You're brave enough

879
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,770
to expose him.

880
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,540
Not everyone has the courage

881
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,500
to reveal their wounds to others.

882
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,300
The devil won't let us go

883
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,840
even if we keep quiet.

884
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,760
Jiang, you have to believe

885
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,020
justice will come sooner or later.

886
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,300
But it will definitely come.

887
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,340
You want to follow up on Zhang's case?

888
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,670
This topic is a hot topic.

889
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,000
But based on my previous experience,

890
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,320
there are many changes

891
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,860
as the case is being investigated.

892
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,780
Before we find out the truth,

893
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,150
I'm afraid it's hard for us

894
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,080
to make a convincing point of view.

895
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,670
Jialan, what do you think?

896
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,150
Ms. Wen,

897
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,770
I agree with Piaopiao.

898
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,600
I thought about that too.

899
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,910
But I still want to choose this topic.

900
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,790
It's not because it's a hot topic,

901
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,270
but because I saw

902
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,490
some comments online

903
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,750
which made me to think.

904
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,400
I don't know when

905
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,290
people talk about

906
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,600
this kind of cases

907
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,880
by blaming the victims.

908
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,420
We need to pay attention that

909
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,600
the victims might be a little part of the reason,

910
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,400
but it doesn't mean the victims are guilty.

911
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,040
And we are too strict

912
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:34,930
to the victims.

913
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,190
We want the victims to be flawless.

914
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:38,820
But is there flawless victims

915
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,500
in this world?

916
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,890
We are humans, not gods.

917
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,680
The public opinion shouldn't be a moral court.

918
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,760
And now the public opinion has a great influence.

919
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,460
I think the media

920
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,200
are almost divided into two major groups.

921
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,110
One group ignores the facts

922
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,900
and only cares about the online traffic.

923
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,420
The other group is cautious and ambiguous.

924
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,230
They observe first

925
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:02,840
and blame both sides.

926
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,490
Then what else do journalists need to do?

927
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,760
Shouldn't journalists

928
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,880
go to the crime scene

929
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,280
to find out the truth?

930
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,220
What if

931
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:15,270
it turns around again?

932
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,520
That's the meaning of our investigation.

933
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,400
If we always wait and watch,

934
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,790
we can't fulfill our duty

935
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,370
as journalists.

936
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,510
This topic is worth following.

937
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,710
I support Jialan.

938
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,120
You're right.

939
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,330
As journalists, we should charge into the battle.

940
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,920
We'll follow the topic.

941
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:40,690
It's yours.

942
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:42,430
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

943
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:42,900
Jialan,

944
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,770
let me know if you need any help.

945
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,030
Okay.

946
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,040
Jialan, you can do it!

947
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,180
Go for it, Jialan!

948
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,180
Jialan, go for it!

949
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,880
[Sweet ON]

950
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,880
[Love in Time]

951
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,880
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

952
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,950
You're limping.

953
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,370
When can you go to your granny's house like this?

954
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,030
Grandma's house.

955
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,910
[Grandma, granny]

956
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,530
Isn't granny grandma?

957
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,420
[Finally]

958
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,120
[Take it away calmly.]

959
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,290
I put it

960
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,360
on my foot.

961
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,720
[Oh my. It's done.]

962
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,370
It means you are devoted.

963
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,690
[Devoted, excellent]

964
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,160
I'm freezing.

965
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,200
[It's so cold.]

966
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,860
[Hold it.]

967
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,850
[Can't hold it.]

968
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,980
[So close.]
