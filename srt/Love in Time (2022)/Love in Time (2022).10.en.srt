4
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,150
Manman.

5
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,420
Why are you here so late?

6
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,539
Don't mention it.

7
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:53,100
I was chased by a ghost all night.

8
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,370
A ghost? Who?

9
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:57,340
He Zhengyu.

10
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,780
He Zhengyu?

11
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,360
Why did he chase you?

12
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,340
Because

13
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,630
I gave his WeChat to Chen Kexin.

14
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,820
Wait. I'll get you some water.

15
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,610
Tell me slowly.

16
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,260
Wait.

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,690
Brother.

18
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,450
It's not good to force a girl like this.

19
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,880
That's how Chen Kexin treated me.

20
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,010
If Chen Jialan hadn't texted her,

21
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,900
I wouldn't have been harassed like this.

22
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,060
Then we should get even with Chen Kexin.

23
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,790
She's not the essential cause.

24
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,030
Park the car for me.

25
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,260
Tell me what happened.

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,450
-Well... -Chen Jialan!

27
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,850
Answer me.

28
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,660
What's your relationship with Sun Defeng?

29
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,260
You can even find this place?

30
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,470
You're really a ghost.

31
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,660
He Zhengyu, right?

32
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,060
Didn't your teacher teach you manners?

33
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,100
Who let you in?

34
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,300
It's still open. I'm a customer.

35
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,500
Why can't I come in?

36
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,440
What kind of customer are you?

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,370
Did you consume?

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,730
Excuse me.

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,340
One iced Americano, please.

40
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,370
Miss.

41
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,490
Can I talk to her now?

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,240
No.

43
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,860
Manman.

44
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,750
Let me explain to him.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,410
But I have to stay here with you.

46
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,050
It's okay.

47
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,810
Wait for me outside.

48
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll call you if anything happens.

49
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,560
Fine.

50
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,470
Just answer me.

51
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,750
Do you know Sun Defeng?

52
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,740
Who?

53
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,450
Ms. Chen.

54
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,230
I remember you said you are very patient.

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,230
I happen to be very patient too.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,340
I can follow you all night

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,740
until you tell the truth.

58
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,030
Isn't that what a rogue does?

59
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,770
Indeed.

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,660
Tracking is the worst option

61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,860
among all other ways.

62
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,740
But there's no other way.

63
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,580
I hope we can end this game as soon as possible.

64
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,850
So please tell me

65
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,950
who told you my privacy.

66
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,090
You, yourself.

67
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,800
Ms. Chen,

68
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
let me put it this way.

69
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,900
Among all girls,

70
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:36,940
you are

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,560
the type I don't want to contact the most.

72
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,900
If possible,

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,630
I would never talk to you,

74
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,860
not to mention

75
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,990
telling you my personal information.

76
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,190
He Zhengyu,

77
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,820
I hope you won't regret

78
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,440
in a few months.

79
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,060
Tell me.

80
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,340
What's your relationship with Sun Defeng?

81
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,120
Wait, which Sun Defeng?

82
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,300
The Sun Defeng from the Fengyu Law Firm.

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,850
My partner, Sun Defeng.

84
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,330
I'll ask you one last time.

85
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,340
What is your relationship with him?

86
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,060
Why did he

87
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,820
tell you my personal information?

88
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,870
I'll tell you one last time.

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,640
I don't know Sun Defeng.

90
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,340
And it's really unprofessional

91
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,540
to make unreasonable guesses.

92
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,580
So how did you steal

93
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,940
my personal information?

94
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,550
Do you know

95
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,900
how scary it is

96
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,270
that your personal privacy is known by a stranger?

97
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,990
Mr. He, I swear

98
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,770
I don't know Sun Defeng.

99
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,890
You told me yourself.

100
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,960
Chen Jialan.

101
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,410
We are adults.

102
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,810
Don't you think

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,220
such an excuse is low?

104
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,780
He Zhengyu!

105
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,540
So is it gentleman

106
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,000
to yell at a lady like this?

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
We're closed.

108
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,780
This way, please.

109
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,460
I'll wait for your reply.

110
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,080
This...

111
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,520
[Wu Anwen and Chen Kexin talked secretly for more than two hours in Wu's house.]

112
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,860
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

113
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,510
You're the last person who saw Jirong.

114
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,200
How did Chen Kexin find my apartment?

115
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,180
How did I get drunk and how those dirty photos were taken?

116
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,440
How could you not know?

117
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
You're talking about another thing.

118
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,980
That's your ex-girlfriend.

119
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,909
I don't know her.

120
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,180
See you.

121
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,100
Hello.

122
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,500
What's your name?

123
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,170
I'm Zhang Qiqi.

124
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,940
Hello, Qiqi.

125
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,180
Is it hard for you to learn violin?

126
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,500
No, I like it.

127
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,910
I practise for two or three hours a day.

128
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,540
The teacher even praised me for playing great.

129
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:14,730
Qiqi.

130
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,350
Is it because you're afraid

131
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,900
you may fail the art exam?

132
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,060
So she is this kind of person

133
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,300
-while working. -When I was young,

134
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,700
I met the same situation.

135
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,860
I learned martial arts when I was little.

136
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,900
Every time I played, I felt it too hard

137
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,380
to learn and I was so tired.

138
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,430
But you have to think in another way.

139
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,590
Qiqi, you've practised so hard.

140
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,820
You can definitely

141
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,110
have a good result.

142
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,020
Thank you.

143
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,720
You're welcome.

144
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,300
Sorry for wasting your time.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,159
It's okay.

146
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,640
Then we're leaving.

147
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,670
Bye bye.

148
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,760
Bye, Qiqi.

149
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:56,810
Liu.

150
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,100
Thank you for today.

151
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,940
It's my job.

152
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,400
Jialan,

153
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,670
I'm going back to the company to return the equipment.

154
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,580
I'll leave you alone.

155
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,980
Be careful when you go home.

156
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,340
Okay.

157
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,670
Cool.

158
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,860
Okay, Liu, take care.

159
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,300
Bye.

160
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,910
Bye.

161
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,590
Mr. He.

162
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,440
What are you doing?

163
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,410
What do you want?

164
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,260
I've explained it to you hundreds of times.

165
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,920
But you just don't believe me.

166
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,780
Do you think I'm that...

167
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,400
Yes, the jinx.

168
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm here

169
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,360
to ask you something else.

170
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,110
Ok.

171
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,940
Go ahead and ask. I'll answer quickly.

172
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,620
Anyway, don't ask

173
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,060
anything beyond my knowledge.

174
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,560
OK?

175
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,420
Answer me.

176
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,420
Did Wu Anwen and Chen Kexin

177
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,660
meet yesterday?

178
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,050
How did you know they met yesterday?

179
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,790
I'm asking you now.

180
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,960
If I answer you,

181
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,740
can you promise

182
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,000
not to bother me again?

183
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,520
Tell me.

184
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,540
Actually,

185
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,460
it was just a coincidence that

186
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,880
I bumped into Kexin and Wu Anwen yesterday.

187
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,300
Do you know what they talked about?

188
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,500
How could I know?

189
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,340
Looks like I need to investigate Wu Anwen.

190
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,240
You asked. I answered.

191
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,540
You have to keep your promise.

192
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,020
Don't come to me again.

193
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,830
But you will come to me.

194
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,890
How did he come to 2021?

195
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,470
There's nothing special.

196
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,960
Could it be Doraemon's drawer?

197
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,430
It's too small.

198
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,460
About this big.

199
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,780
Animation is fictional afterall.

200
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,180
How did he get here?

201
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,530
He...

202
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,210
See?

203
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,240
I told you you'd come back.

204
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,080
Tell me what happened.

205
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,020
You finally talk to me.

206
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,210
This is the normal communication between people.

207
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,360
Open it.

208
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
Did you buy all these?

209
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,130
Of course.

210
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,220
But you don't like me eating Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

211
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,150
If I don't like it, you won't eat it?

212
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,740
Why are you mad at me?

213
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,000
You didn't talk to me and just wrote things down.

214
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,100
Tell me

215
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,630
how did you go to 2021 first.

216
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,440
Follow me.

217
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,540
What?

218
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,030
Why did you bring me to the balcony?

219
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:22,950
Listen.

220
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,950
What?

221
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,800
Listen carefully.

222
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,980
Crickets?

223
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,470
And then?

224
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,910
Crickets...

225
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,260
What's special?

226
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,410
Now is 2021.

227
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:52,810
Yes.

228
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,680
You're in 2021.

229
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,760
You came to my world.

230
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,460
You're not that stupid.

231
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,430
Now is indeed 2021.

232
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
There's signal!

233
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,320
This is the best proof.

234
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,420
So we can not only

235
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,500
go to 2022 through the front door,

236
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,860
we can also go to 2021

237
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,400
through the back balcony.

238
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,050
That's it.

239
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,250
Then we can do many things.

240
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,820
We can investigate

241
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,400
Wu Anwen and Chen Kexin,

242
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,370
and change the ending of Jirong.

243
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,100
What I want to do now the most

244
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,240
is to see Jirong.

245
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,340
She is still alive in your world.

246
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,610
I want to see her.

247
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,910
I shouldn't have left

248
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,500
when I sent her to Jiang Shenghao's house.

249
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,070
Okay, let's go now.

250
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:44,880
Come on.

251
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,010
Slow down.

252
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,890
Jialan? Zhengyu?

253
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,160
Is Jirong here?

254
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,390
Yes, she is here.

255
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,270
Who's here?

256
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,280
Jialan? Zhengyu?

257
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,950
Jirong,

258
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,820
you must take care of yourself.

259
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:17,790
Must.

260
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,010
What's wrong?

261
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,940
What I mean is...

262
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,690
Jialan and I will do our best.

263
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,570
He means...

264
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,660
We will work hard,

265
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,640
and you need to work harder.

266
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,590
I see.

267
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,670
You are here to announce your relationship?

268
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,070
Those words are strange.

269
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,300
No need to be too shy.

270
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,910
I thought something happened.

271
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,240
It's good. I'm happy for you.

272
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,410
-We... -We're here to announce our relationship.

273
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,890
Thank you for introducing us to each other.

274
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,020
Zhengyu.

275
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm very happy that you're in a relationship with Jialan.

276
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,840
Take good care of Jialan.

277
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,520
That's great.

278
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,220
I've been looking forward to this day.

279
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,780
Try to be like us.

280
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,740
But Zhengyu, I don't think this is like your style.

281
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,310
Honey.

282
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,870
This is the magic of love.

283
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,740
All right, stop standing there.

284
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,510
Come in.

285
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,350
Since we've done the announcement,

286
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,610
we won't bother you in the middle of the night.

287
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,950
We're leaving. Bye.

288
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,590
You're leaving?

289
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,950
Be careful.

290
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,660
You know what.

291
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,890
There's a thing called mobile phone.

292
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,820
It's fast to send good news with it.

293
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,460
I know.

294
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,300
Let's sleep.

295
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,110
Thank you for seeing Jirong with me.

296
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,010
It's not a big deal.

297
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,900
But I should apologize to you.

298
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,030
The announcement just now...

299
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,000
Just to bluff it out.

300
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,780
I understand.

301
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,330
In that case,

302
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,750
it's best to pretend that we went for announcement.

303
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,500
How you do it doesn't matter.

304
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,100
It indeed doesn't matter.

305
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,560
Then why did you step back?

306
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,470
Are you afraid I'll pester you?

307
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,740
You think too much.

308
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,590
Don't get me wrong.

309
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,160
I'm worried about you.

310
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,480
Our friends

311
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,620
will think about our relationship.

312
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,680
It's bad for you.

313
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,930
Right. Right. It's bad for me.

314
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,390
How can I get a boyfriend in that case?

315
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,530
You have a boyfriend?

316
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,350
Sir, let me interview you.

317
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,540
What does it have to do

318
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,490
with you?

319
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,940
Of course it has nothing to do with you if you don't like me.

320
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,990
We are just roommates.

321
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,589
Why should I care if she has a boyfriend?

322
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,920

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,980
Here's the latest evidence

338
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,100
we just received from Lanyou Technology Company

339
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,340
and the chat records of

340
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,960
Fan Ke and his ex-colleague, Wang,

341
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,120
from half a year ago.

342
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,540
It involves

343
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,090
the key research and development data of Lanyou Technology Company,

344
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,550
which is highly similar to Fan Ke's product.

345
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,230
Wang is willing to testify in court?

346
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,240
Yes for sure.

347
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,620
With this evidence,

348
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,470
we'll take the initiative in this case.

349
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,990
Mr. Fan Ke,

350
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,020
would you like to talk about

351
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,280
why you left Lanyou Technology Company?

352
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,400
The most important reason

353
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,820
is that my personal concepts

354
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,880
diverged from the original company.

355
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,700
I can't stand that they monetized

356
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,560
a product which is not mature yet.

357
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,180
The leaders of the company were too impatient.

358
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,650
I'm not the only one who's not satisfied with the operation of the company,

359
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,330
The employees who are still in the company

360
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,860
have the same thought as me.

361
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
Will you still see each other often?

362
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,200
For example, talk about the company's projects.

363
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,800
Of course.

364
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,080
Hold on.

365
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,820
This is the chat records of me and my former colleague.

366
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,420
Thank you.

Yes.

373

You can eat at the table from now on.

374
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,830
I did break the rules.

375
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,640
But you don't have to be too grateful.

376
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,030
I really don't need to eat in the kitchen anymore?

377
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,250
Yes.

378
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,190
And I don't need to turn on the range hood?

379

Are you He Zhengyu?

No. You're the crazy one.

383
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,610
That's right. You are still annoying.

384
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm going back to my room.

385
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,250
By the way,

386
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,000
for the Lanyou Technology Company's case,

387
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,030
I had an interview with Fan Ke today.

388
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,930
I took a look at the materials.

389
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,060
I think you might lose four months ago.

390
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,050
Wang's chatting is full of traps.

391
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,780
It seems that he did it on purpose

392
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,950
to make some compelling evidence.

393
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,280
You mean it's a trap?

394
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,340
You should know what you've been through.

395
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,740
So who will win in the end?

396
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,090
It wasn't Lanyou Technology Company's case before,

397
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,350
but another tort case.

398
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,470
After this incident,

399
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,900
it became Lanyou Technology Company's case.

400
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,740
You mean

401
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,660
this case is also caused

402
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,060
by the butterfly effect?

403
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,720
But it doesn't matter.

404
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,030
The case will be heared soon.

405
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,880
Can you do me a favor?

406
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,300
Go find the He Zhengyu living in four months ago

407
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,030
to remind him

408
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,050
Sun Defeng is untrustworthy.

409
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,700
He should pay attention to him.

410
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,950
Shouldn't I remind you

411
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,120
Wang's evidence could be fake?

412
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,320
You can try.

413
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,000
From what I know about him,

414
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
he's tough and arrogant.

415
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,100
If he knows you reminded him,

416
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,660
he would feel humiliated.

417
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,250
It's really you.

418
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,260
You even scold yourself when you're ruthless.

419
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,580
I can

420
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,220
ask about Sun Defeng.

421
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,990
But do you think

422
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,230
he will believe me?

423
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,860
I just told him firmly that

424
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,190
I don't know Sun Defeng.

425
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,870

Bring him here.

428
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,370

429
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,910
I mean, this apartment?

430
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,290
Yes, here.

431
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:17,870
When he saw me,

432
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,540
he will know

433
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,790
why you know his personal information.

434
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,390
He won't bother you anymore.

435
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,660
Unless he sees it with his own eyes,

436
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,190
he won't believe anything.

437
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,640
Will it work?

438
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,190
So I asked you to find him

439
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,310
so that he can be prepared in advance.

Use Wang's evidence carefully.

443

It's highly likely that his chat records with Fan Ke

are intended to misguide you.

No, I'm not lying.

516
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't know what happened.

517
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
What is your purpose?

518
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,340
My purpose?

519
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,530
To get exclusive news about Lanyou Technology Company from me, right?

520
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:32,930
No.

521
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,500
Mr. He, why do you think of me like that?

522
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,380
First, you investagted my privacy

523
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,120
and then told me about Wang.

524
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,270
Now, you asked me to come to your house.

525
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,900
You must did those for some reasons.

526
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,420
I'm not as calculating as you think.

527
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,850
Then you have a favor to ask.

528
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,230
No.

529
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,500
Mr. He,

530
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,730
please stop guessing.

531
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,290
Then please stop harassing me.

532
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,750
Do you think I like you?

533
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,010
Unless you have a better reason.

534
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:05,950
No.

535
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,740
Think whatever you want.

536
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,930
I made a mistake today.

537
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,600
My apology. I am sorry.

538
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,600
By the way,

539
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,460
why did you come to me today

540
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,790
and mention Sun Defeng?

541
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,740
Because someone wants me to tell you

542
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,880
Sun Defeng is trying to kick you out.

543
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,340
He wants you to be careful.

544
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,300
Or you'll be kicked out from the law firm

545
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,780
after three months.

546
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,290
The me living in four months later

547
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:41,970
told you?

548
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
Do you believe it?

549
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,580
Do you?

550
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,200
But you are right about one thing.

551
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,470
There is something wrong with Wang's evidence.

552
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,520
You knew it?

553
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,980
As for the information about a case,

554
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,860
a lawyer

555
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,010
doesn't need a reporter to remind him.

556
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,130
I hope you can use these tricks

557
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,070
to improve your job.

558
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,220
[time-space overlap]

559
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,860
It's weird.

560
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,850
Everything used to be fine.

561
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,050
Why didn't the overlap happen tonight?

562
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,490
The conditions of time-space overlap were all satisfied.

563
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,300
Did I touch

564
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,860
the taboo of the time-space overlap?

565
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,060
Time,

566
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,590
location,

567
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,280
and persons involved.

568
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,310
Me, Chen Jialan, and the apartment.

569
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,380
Time, location, and persons involved.

570
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,620
They were all fine.

571
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,000
Is it because there's one more person?

572
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,690
Wait.

573
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,370
When Jirong and Mu Shiming came,

574
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,770
the overlap still happened as usual.

575
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,330
No.

576
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,770
The persons were different.

577
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,830
Tonight it was the He Zhengyu living in four months ago.

578
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,120
In the same time-space,

579
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,320
there can't be two "me" in the same time.

580
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,230
Otherwise, the conservation of mass will be broke.

581
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,770
It's all his false.

582
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,520
Can the time-space overlap

583
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,040
happen again?

584
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,900
Why do I want to see myself so much?

585
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,170
If the time-space overlap never happens again,

586
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,030
I'll never see Chen Jialan again.

587
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,150
Can I see He Zhengyu again?

588
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,630
Why am I worried about not seeing Chen Jialan?

589
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,310
Shouldn't I worry that

590
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,740
I won't have the chance to save Jirong?

591
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,790
Can I see him again?

592
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,910
If I knew the time-space overlap could be so unpredictable,

593
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,440
I wouldn't hide my feeling.

594
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,870
I should have directly told him

595
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,290
I fell in love with you.

596
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,070
I don't care.

597
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,929
Stop looking.

598
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,580
How long have you been here?

599
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,570
Since the first picture.

600
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,139
Stop struggling. You fell in love with her.

601
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,590
I'm just sorry

602
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:42,580
I might not be able to see

603
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,909
such an energetic female friend any more.

604
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,520
It's not just a pity.

605
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,510
Did your throat hurt again?

606
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,449
How do you know?

607
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,120
The inner heat.

608
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,720
Look at the Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

609
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,450
What a beautiful double photo!

610
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,520
Let me taste it.

611
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,800
Don't deny it.

612
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,560
You just fell in love with her.

613
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,770
So what if I admit it?

614
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,570
It's too late.

615
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,220
I might not have time to tell her

616
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,910
my real feeling.

617
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,250
Opportunities are created by ourselves.

618
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,820
Go see her.

619
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,530
No.

620
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,570
I like the one living in four months ago.

621
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,130
How much can she change in four months?

622
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,390
Comfort yourself with fantasy first.

623
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,250
Or there's nothing you can do now.

624
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,480
No.

625
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,550
I can't.

626
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,760
Because she said

627
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,980
she doesn't want to be spoiled.

628
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,540
Fine.

629
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,690
Do whatever you want.

630
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,950
If she doesn't want to be spoiled,

631
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,290
just don't tell her.

632
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,310
When did you like to drink hand-grinded coffee?

633
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,840
You said it's troublesome.

634
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,070
People have to change, right?

635
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,800
Excuse me.

636
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,970
May I ask

637
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,940
if Chen Jialan comes to work today?

638
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,820
Chen Jialan?

639
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,700
Chen Jialan.

640
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,910
You mean Mr. Mu's girlfriend?

641
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,010
Mr. Mu's girlfriend?

642
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,030
Mr. Mu is over there.

643
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,030
Ask him yourself.

644
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,180
Okay.

645
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,080
Thank you.

646
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,350
What's going on?

647
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,080
I don't know.

648
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,260
Mu Shiming.

649
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,650
He Zhengyu?

650
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,090
Long time no see.

651
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,020
Long time no see.

652
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
You want to see me?

653
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,990
Of course not. I'm here to see Chen Jialan.

654
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,430
You came here to see her?

655
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,540
Well.

656
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,800
It's time to work.

657
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,530
Don't come here if there's nothing.

658
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:20,370
I have to go.

659
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,380
Jialan is waiting for me.

660
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,810
Waiting for you?

661
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,250
The Jialan living in 2022

662
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,390
is in a relationship with Mu Shiming.

663
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,870
Chen Jialan?

664
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,120
You mean Mr. Mu's girlfriend?

665
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,430
Don't come here if there's nothing.

666
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,260
I have to go.

667
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,290
Jialan is waiting for me.

668
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,730
How can I get a boyfriend in that case?

669
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,930
You have a boyfriend?

670
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,340
Mr. Mu had a stomach attack yesterday.

671
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,540
I can't let him alone.

672
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,660
You like Mu Shiming.

673
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,800
I only take Mr. Mu as my senior.

674
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:45,680
Jialan!

675
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,290
Right!

676
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,650
What took you so long?

677
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,090
I was dealing with a news.

678
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,580
A girl wanted to jump off a building

679
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,300
because of her loan for cosmetology.

680
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,710
It took her a long time to figure it out.

681
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,480
I also want to ask you

682
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,110
what's your real feeling on me?

683
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,430
Do you like me or...

684
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,920
What are you doing?

685
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,190
You haven't answered my question.

686
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,100
Isn't that...

687
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,580
Isn't that the best answer?

688
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,670
I want to hear it.

689
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,580
Jialan.

690
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,280
This morning,

691
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,640
I went to your company.

692
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,450
I told you I don't want to be spoiled about my future.

693
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,880
Okay, I'll stop.

694
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,750
Since you were already there,

695
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,310
I'd better listen to it.

696
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,290
Did you see me?

697
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,850
How have I been?

698
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,020
In 2022,

699
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,620
you are Mu Shiming's girlfriend,

700
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,350
and you're living a happy life.

701
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,450
Mr. Mu and I...

702
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,940
How is that possible? You must be mistaken.

703
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,850
I only take Mr. Mu as my senior

704
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,720
and an idol.

705
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,700
We don't love each other at all.

706
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,500
How can I be his girlfriend

707
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,440
in four months?

708
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,060
Besides, it's only been four months.

709
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,130
It's not 40 years.

710
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,020
Mu Shiming was

711
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,310
your idol in school.

712
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,240
And he's your colleague now.

713
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,260
And

714
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,000
he even guides you without reservation.

715
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,420
The perfect timing and place are all occupied by him.

716
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,150
If he confesses his love to you,

717
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,300
will you refuse him?

718
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,420
Your analysis makes sense.

719
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,050
Chen Jialan!

720
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,910
But it's just the analysis by you.

721
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,840
Besides,

722
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,460
I already know you.

723
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,860
I've become your roommate.

724
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,660
And we just...

725
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,220
Anyway, according to the butterfly effect,

726
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,720
the future won't be what you see today.
