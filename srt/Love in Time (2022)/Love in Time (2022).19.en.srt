Do you like Zhengyu?

7
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,630
Zhengyu must like you a lot.

8
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,640
I've never seen him

9
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,340
care about a girl

10
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,670
like he cares about you.

11
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,700
Jiang Shenghao?

12
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,020
Zhengyu ruined my life.

13
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,790
I'll ruin his too.

14
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,100
Jialan.

15
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,900
Jialan. Jialan.

16
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,190
Jialan.

17
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,010
Slowly.

18
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,410
I'll run you another EEG

19
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,760
tomorrow morning.

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,310
I'll ask the nurse to inform you then.

21
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:12,990
-Thank you. -Thank you.

22
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,590
It's okay.

23
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,470
Does it hurt?

24
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,670
Just a little.

25
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,590
Sorry. I was late.

26
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,520
If you didn't come,

27
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,370
you'll probably have to see me at the funeral parlor.

28
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

29
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,930
Don't worry.

30
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,900
I'm all right, aren't I?

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
I got a lot more serious injuries

32
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,670
when I was practicing boxing as a kid.

33
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,740
It's time.

34
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,830
See you tomorrow.

35
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,659
See you tomorrow.

36
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,530
Jialan.

37
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,620
How are you? Are you okay?

38
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,380
I'm fine.

39
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,440
Jialan.

40
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,060
I apologize on behalf of my brother.

41
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,710
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,070
Jirong.

43
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,820
Let your brother

44
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,800
bear the consequences of what he did himself.

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Wait for him to apologize to Jialan.

46
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,550
I didn't expect Wu Anwen to not only make Jialan suffer from cyber violence,

47
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,660
but he even hurt Jialan physically.

48
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,280
Chen Jialan.

49
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,580
I was downstairs

50
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,380
telling the police

51
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,300
what happened.

52
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,360
They'll come up and ask you later.

53
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
As for Chen Kexin,

54
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,570
she just fell down the stairs and hurt her feet.

55
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,770
She will be fine after a few days of rest.

56
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,520
As for Wu Anwen,

57
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,180
do you plan to reconcile

58
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,180
or continue to prosecute him for criminal liability?

59
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,480
I personally suggest...

60
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,159
Jialan.

61
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,320
I hope you can forgive my brother.

62
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,070
I will make him introspect

63
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,270
and apologize to you.

64
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,180
As for your medical expenses and mental damage fee,

65
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,990
I will cover

66
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,140
all your expenses.

67
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,430
Can you reconcile with him?

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,270
Jirong.

69
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,840
I'm not that badly injured.

70
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,470
You must sue him.

71
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,550
He broke into your house,

72
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,610
threatened Chen Kexin's personal safety

73
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,210
and intentionally hurt you.

74
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,190
Wu Anwen must be punished by law.

75
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,290
This is indeed a chance for Wu Anwen to lose freedom

76
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,550
and change the future.

77
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,950
I'll sue him.

78
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,740
Zhengyu.

79
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,490
I have something to say to you. Come out.

80
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,550
Zhengyu.

81
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,140
I know you are mad about

82
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,550
what my brother did.

83
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,710
But we've known each other for so many years.

84
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,830
My brother has always treated you as his brother.

85
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,160
You can't just forget about our history.

86
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,580
Jirong.

87
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,030
It's not that I forget about it.

88
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,840
But Wu Anwen went too far.

89
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,340
If I continue to indulge him,

90
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,340
it would equal ruining him.

91
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,390
But my brother made this impulsive mistake

92
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,840
because of me.

93
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,940
I don't think his guilt is that serious.

94
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,970
Jirong, there is something

95
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
I haven't told you.

96
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,170
But I think

97
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,420
you need to know now.

98
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,790
Your brother

99
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,440
owed eight million yuan for gambling.

100
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,200
What?

101
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,590
It's true.

102
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,060
He didn't dare to tell you.

103
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,720
Since you haven't worked after getting married,

104
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,920
he had no money to pay his gambling debt.

105
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,650
That's why he planned

106
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,140
to frame Jiang Shenghao for cheating.

107
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,140
He even wanted to put on this show with Chen Kexin.

108
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,940
But he didn't expect that

109
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,470
Chen Jialan and I ruined it.

110
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,960
So he hated Chen Jialan.

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,380
And then he framed Jiang Shenghao,

112
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,110
claiming that he cheated on you with Chen Jialan.

113
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,580
Chen Jialan suffered from cyber violence

114
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,380
because he bribed those paparazzi and streamers.

115
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,700
Jirong.

116
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,320
Your brother has gone further and further.

117
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,810
Only by law

118
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
can we stop him before it's too late.

119
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
How could this be?

120
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,150
Jirong.

121
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,039
Where are you going?

122
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:33,880
Jirong.

123
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,260
Hello.

124
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,220
Hello.

125
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,260
I'm the lawyer hired by Ms. Wu Jirong.

126
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,420
I want to see Wu Anwen.

127
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,260
OK. Follow me.

128
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,790
-OK, thanks. -This way.

129
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,390
Are you gambling again?

130
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,340
Zhengyu told me everything.

131
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,840
You gambled again

132
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,470
and owed eight million.

133
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,140
So you did all this

134
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,740
just to get me and Shenghao divorced,

135
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,100
so that you can repay your gambling debt

136
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,160
with the compensation money, right?

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,110
No.

138
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,990
Zhengyu must have

139
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,010
some misunderstanding about this.

140
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,110
Can't you be honest with me?

141
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,820
Three years ago, you owed three million for gambling.

142
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,020
I paid it back for you.

143
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,140
You swore that you would never gamble again.

144
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,200
But what happened?

145
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,710
Not only did you continue gambling,

146
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,690
you spent more and more on gambling.

147
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,270
You even did so many bad things

148
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,150
for money,

149
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
and made such a big trouble tonight.

150
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,090
It's not like that, Jirong.

151
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,820
Listen to me.

152
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,280
Mr. Wu.

153
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,120
Alright, Mr. Wu.

154
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,420
I've asked what Ms. Wu wanted me to ask for her.

155
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,210
Next,

156
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,690
I need to get some information from you.

157
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,530
Get me out.

158
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,480
My sister hired you to get me out of here,

159
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,080
not to teach me how to behave.

160
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,530
Mr. Wu.

161
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm sorry, Lawyer.

162
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,590
Please tell my sister

163
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,320
that I know I was wrong this time.

164
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,420
Let her give me another chance.

165
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,250
Please.

166
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,080
Please.

167
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,710
Okay, I got it.

168
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,320
Thank you.

169
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,900
I won't forgive him anymore.

170
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,910
If I forgive him again, it equals ruining him.

171
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,820
Thank you.

172
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,190
Okay, Ms. Wu.

173
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
Keep in touch.

174

00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,330
December 12.

346
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,790
It was even earlier.

347
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,610
So there's still

348
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,710
one month left.

349
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,100
[Inpatient 2]

350
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,680
It's okay. I can do it myself.

351
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,450
Do you want some?

352
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,310
No.

353
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,350
Fine.

354
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,020
Life is unpredictable.

355
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,610
I thought things will change

356
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,310
when Wu Anwen gambles again

357
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,370
in early December.

358
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,340
I didn't expect that he was arrested yesterday.

359
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,760
Is it all over now?

360
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,500
I thought about it all night.

361
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,460
Could it have changed

362
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,690
on He Zhengyu's side?

363
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,340
Has Jirong been saved?

364
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,320
Has everything come to a happy ending now?

365
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,990
It's not a big deal.

366
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,610
You wasted your sleep time to think about it?

367
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,390
No.

368
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,490
The timeline is very complicated.

369
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,440
Haven't you watched that drama?

370
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,330
If we don't fix the timeline,

371
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,900
the time administration will come and arrest us.

372
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,430
What are you talking about?

373
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,310
Chen Jialan,

374
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,830
what are you thinking?

375
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,640
Look forward to the future

376
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,450
and use your imagination, okay?

377
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,020
Sure.

378
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,480
Please continue your speech.

379
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm thinking

380
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,100
if everything changes,

381
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,450
we will go back to our original life.

382
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,410
If nothing changes,

383
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,460
and everything stays the same,

384
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,080
then there must be some

385
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
unexpected "Black swan" incident.

386
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,340
Do you want it to change

387
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,310
or not?

388
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,250
Of course I want it to change.

389
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,040
Then Jirong won't die.

390
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,290
I won't be in a coma.

391
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,750
You...

392
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,770
You won't lose your reputation

393
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,870
and live in that shabby apartment.

394
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,380
Yes.

395
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,340
And the time-space overlap will not happen.

396
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,200
You won't meet me from the future.

397
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,350
Then we'll break up on good terms.

398
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,360
I haven't thought about that yet.

399
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,150
You've been thinking about it all night but not this?

400

Your brain is different from normal people.

What does it have to do with you?

402
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,350
I just want to remind you

403
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,070
not to think about useless things.

404
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,070
I'm going to work.

405

I'm still the gold-medal lawyer today.

If things don't change,

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,330
I'll have to save more money

I've checked.

413
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,240
On December 12 last year,

414
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,270
the day of Chen Jialan's car accident,

415
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,420
Wu Anwen was in jail.

416
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,700
Did he get bailed

417
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,300
or go on medical parole during that time?

418
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,230
I checked it.

419
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,820
Wu Anwen has been in jail

420
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,990
since November 11th last year.

421
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,940
Until February 19th this year, when he got sentenced,

422
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,870
he had been in jail this whole time.

423
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,400
Check if there was any small passenger car missing in this city

on the day of the accident.

425
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,710
And ask the detective

426

if there's any update on the case.

427
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,030
OK, I'll go check.

428

Jialan.

432
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,900
After I came to see you last time,

433
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,590
I had a dream.

434
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
You told me in my dream that I had a bad taste.

435
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,650
So I asked the flower shop owner

436
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,460
to add some daisies and Barberton daisies.

437
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,980
Look.

438
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,970
Does it suit your taste?

I brought your boyfriend here as well.

He didn't dare to visit you.

442
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,340
To be honest, I want to beat him up too.

443
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,350
But when I think about how you protected him...

444

I was wrong.

449
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,100
I was too arrogant.

450
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,910
To be honest,

451
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,620
I thought about the same thing when Jialan passed away.

452
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,580
If I had taken better care of her,

453
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,550
would there have been no accident?

454
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,320
But I figured it out later.

455
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,680
Life and death are all about fate.

What happened to Jirong?

465

Jirong officially filed for divorce.

466
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,850

Don't stretch your wound.

By the way, Jirong,

He might get a lighter sentence.

Don't worry about the gambling debt as well.

It's not easy for you to earn money.

Keep it yourself.

As a girl,

more money

479
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,020
means more sense of security.

after your brother comes out,

483
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,450
I'll find him a job.

484
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,260
Your brother has to make his own living, right?

485
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,990
Thus we can avoid having intersections with him.

486
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,230
Avoid contacting with him?

487
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,250
Why?

488
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,190
Didn't you say you want to cut ties with him yesterday?

489

Jirong.

491
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,510
The reason why Wu Anwen,

492
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,720
your brother, came to be like this

493
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,860
is that he knew you're his sister and you would cover it up for him.

494
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,020
He can't make mistakes again and again.

495
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
He has to bear his own consequences.

496
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,890
Jirong.

497
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,850
I really don't want to lose you.

498
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,760
But with your brother

499
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,090
meddling with our life,

500
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,550
our relationship won't last long.

501
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,160
But he is my brother.

502
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,760
I was raised by him.

503
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,060
He committed a crime,

504
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,300
so he should be punished by the law.

505
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,830
I have no objection to that.

506
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,770
But I really can't

507
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,430
cut ties with him like you said.

508
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,350
And I really can't accept

509
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,420
that you said it.

510
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,450
Jirong, calm down.

511
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,700
I was a little anxious and words came out the wrong way.

512
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,920
I also hope we can be together.

513
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,110
Can you calm down?

514
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,470
I'm very calm.

515
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,410
I'm calmer than ever.

516
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,870
In this case,

518
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,040
Jirong and I understood that

519
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,840
our marriage has many problems.

520
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,560
Love doesn't mean

521
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,220
two people can be together forever.

522
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,150
Marriage is something different.

523
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,050
It's just that it has been too late

524
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,380
when I understood that.

525
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,630
I really want to start over.

526
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,680
As long as you're alive, there's a chance to start over.

527
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,580
[2021]

528
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,970
Why isn't there any message yet?

529
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,690
Is the time not right?

530
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,840
You can't even get an IV drip properly.

531
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,310
If the needle got misplaced, you'll have to get another injection.

532
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,660
It's already 10:22.

533
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,930
Did he contact you?

534
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:33,980
No.

535
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,030
Did nothing change?

536
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,190
I was right.

537
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,010
You are good looking but you are a jinx.

538
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,880
[Zhengyu]

539
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,210
Did something happen?

540
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,100
What are you doing? You're getting an IV drip.

541
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,710
Why did you pull the needle out?

542
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,170
I need to go home and check.

543
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,420
So,

544
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,740
the time-space overlap did happen.

545
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,170
He didn't come back at all.

546
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,140
Maybe he happens to be working overtime.

547
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,300
We have to go find him in 2022.

548
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,260
-Is it necessary? -Let's go.

549
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,800
I can walk by myself.

550
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,610
[2022]

551
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,550
Sorry.

552
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,730
Our phone is out of battery.

553
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,790
Can I borrow yours?

554
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,910
Sure, no problem.

555
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,820
-Here. -Thanks.

556
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,750
You're welcome.

557
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,850
You two are together?

558
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,060
Good for you.

559
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,270
Do you have Zhou Dajun's number?

560
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,290
I didn't answer the phone?

561
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,850
No. Type it in.

562
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,160
Okay.

563
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,850
Sir,

564
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,120
you can deliver the lollipop yourself today.

565
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,260
Lollipop?

566
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,160
I don't eat sweet food.

567
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,020
Last time,

568
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,690
you saved a lot of money here.

569
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,480
I have a large jar of lollipops

570
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,010
that I haven't delivered to Miss Chen for you.

571
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,560
Well,

572
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,480
she needs to eat less sweet food.

573
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,810
It's bad for her health.

574
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,600
Go ahead.

575
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,540
He Zhengyu, you're really something.

576
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:22,710
Hello.

577
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,100
Dajun?

578
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,630
Yes.

579
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,440
Is this Yuchen Law Firm?

580
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,330
Yes, and you are?

581
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,150
I saw your ad in the neighborhood,

582
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,970
so I called you for inquiry.

583
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,820
We're closed today.

584
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,780
If you need anything,

585
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,060
you can come to the law firm and talk to us tomorrow.

586
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,470
Sorry to disturb you.

587
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,180
I just want to talk to

588
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,650
He Zhengyu, Mr. He.

589
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,740
I have something I need to talk to him about.

590
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,300
We don't live together, madam.

591
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,260
It's too late today.

592
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,400
Mr. He will come to work tomorrow.

593
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,140
You can see him if you come.

594
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,670
Alright?

595
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,810
Wait.

596
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,620
I can't reach him.

597
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,420
I haven't seen him all day as well.

598
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,570
Okay, see you tomorrow.

599
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,060
Bye.

600
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,790
He Zhengyu.

601
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,200
He Zhengyu.

602
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,550
Sister.

603
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,450
It seems that Mr. He isn't at home.

604
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,590
Where can he go at this hour?

605
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,500
He's not answering his phone either.

606
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:39,960
Sister.

607
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,540
You have to get up and put on makeup at 4 a.m. tomorrow.

608
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,820
I know, but...

609
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,330
How about this?

610
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,540
When you are filming tomorrow,

611
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,340
I'll come to see if Mr. He is home.

612
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,780
OK. Let's go.

613
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,560
He's not with Zhou Dajun.

614
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,360
Where can he go?

615
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,950
I don't know.

616
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,410
Sometimes, I don't know him well enough either.

617
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,870
Just like this.

618
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,860
Giving someone something so sweet and childish.

619
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,300
Thank you, but it's not childish at all.

620
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,570
Don't worry.

621
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:25,420
He won't go anywhere weird.

622
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,750
Your joke is not funny at all.

623
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
I forgot to return the phone.

624
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,620
I'll return it.

625
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:44,639
Stop the car.

626
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,150
Zhengyu.

627
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,640
Why didn't you answer your phone?

628
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,970
I went to your place and you weren't there.

629
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,300
I was so worried.

630
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,080
Ji... Jirong.

631
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,380
Are you all right?

632
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,420
I'm not.

633
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,190
I've been worried about you since this morning.

634
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,450
But the whole crew was waiting for me to start,

635
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,390
so I couldn't leave.

636
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,470
I was so worried.

637
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,230
Great, Jirong!

638
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,380
That's great.

639
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,520
No.

640
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Zhengyu, what's wrong with you?

641
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,580
You're doing it again and again.

642
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,220
The situation will be worse if you keep doing this.

643
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,240
Let's go to the hospital.

644
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,510
What hospital? It's so late.

645
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,290
I'm fine.

646
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,390
Don't feel burdened.

647
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,870
Psychological diseases are actually similar to a cold.

648
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:48,730
Jirong.

649
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,640
I'm just under a lot of pressure at work recently,

650
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,640
so I've been emotionally unstable.

651
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,860
Under a lot of pressure at work?

652
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,390
I can help you with that too.

653
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,990
I have many friends in the entertainment industry.

654
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,420
They all need legal consultants.

655
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,740
I can introduce them to you.

656
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,470
I also know an office building.

657
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,300
-There are a lot of elite law firms in that building. -Jirong.

658
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,650
I can pay the rent for you.

659
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,520
Jirong must know

660
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,450
that I was in a coma in the hospital.

661
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,010
If I go over there and greet her like this,

662
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,010
she'll be scared.

663
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,810
Jirong, I don't need more cases.

664
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:21,930
Zhengyu.

665
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,370
There's a private hospital where I'm a VIP.

666
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,470
The psychiatrists there can been seen at any time.

667
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,410
And it's very private.

668
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,290
Don't feel pressured.

669
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,520
Don't worry.

670
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:35,580
Jirong.

671
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,860
I'm really fine.

672
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,050
My mental state is very normal.

673
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,330
Trust me.

674
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,590
Your assistant is calling you.

675
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,270
Where are you going, Zhengyu?

676
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,630
Where is he?

677
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,330
He's gone again.

678
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,650
Jirong is alive.

679
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:08,780
So...

680
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,540
So things have been changed.

681
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,790
Our efforts worked.

682
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,030
So we were right to sue Wu Anwen.

683
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,300
Wu Anwen went to jail,

684
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,730
so the future changed.

685
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,200
But

686
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,330
the time-space overlap is still on.

687
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,660
That's because my fate and his

688
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,860
haven't changed yet.

689
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,770
I've been studying physics theory lately.

690
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,520
I want to know if the time-space overlap

691
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,120
can change the future or not.

692
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,680
Why can

693
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,880
or can't it change the future?

694
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,380
If it really changes,

695
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,380
then what's the impact it can bring?

696
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,670
What is it?

697
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,920
I've been reading

698
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,080
about this too.

699
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,810
But every time, I fall asleep

700
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,540
after reading for five minutes.

701
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,020
It's okay. I'll tell you.

702
00:37:59,330 --> 00:37:59,880
Sure.

703
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,700
The highest law in nature

704
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,900
is the Law of Entropy.

705
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,620
In an isolated system, the entropy can only increase.

706
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,090
Only in open systems

707
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,040
can entropy decrease.

708
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,150
As long as there is a decrease in entropy due to the resistance against increase,

709
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,210
entropy in other substances must have been increased.

710
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,210
Our world maintains its dynamic balance

711
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,140
by this kind of confrontation.

712
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,590
Can you speak in human language?

713
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,630
Was I not speaking human language?

714
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,320
For example,

715
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,760
a glass of water evaporates and turns into vapor.

716
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,120
That's called entropy increase.

717
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,020
But if you put this glass of water in the refrigerator,

718
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,170
it will turn from liquid water to solid ice,

719
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,690
and it's called entropy decrease.

720
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,170
If you want to achieve the so-called entropy decrease,

721
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,740
we have to use the refrigerator

722
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,220
and consume a lot of electricity.

723
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,160
Understand?

724
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,250
You mean Jirong is the water.

725
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,800
Death is her vapor state.

726
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,230
We changed her fate of dying.

727
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,300
Therefore, in replacement,

728
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,280
the refrigerator will consume a lot of electricity.

729
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,490
What is the electricity then?

730
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,410
I'm not sure.

731
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,330
What are you doing?

732
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,330
Do you think

733
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,950
something happened to him?

734
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,190
What?

735
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,330
Can the electricity consumed

736
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,320
be him?

737
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,470
I was just wondering

738
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,600
if the Law of Entropy can explain this.

739
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,560
Don't worry like this.

740
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,990
Besides,

741
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,160
didn't Jirong just say she had met him?

742
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,800
Maybe...Maybe he's working

743
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,010
to earn the rent right now.

744
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,700
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

745
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,760
Let's think about it tomorrow, okay?

746
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,310
But...

747
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,320
I should be the one who should be sad now.

748
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,810
Stop it.

749
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,660
Look at me.

750
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,390
You're right.

751
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,120
Jirong just met him this morning.

752
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,330
He must be fine.

753
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,750
Why is it already dawn?

754
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,280
Water.

755
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,160
Give me a bottle of water.

756
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,820
Let's go.

757
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,480
Put it away.

758
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,950
We can't drive after drinking.

759
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,760
We need a designated driver.

760
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,900
What's the app called?

761
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,200
I don't know.

762
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,130
Let's get in the car and take a rest first.

763
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,060
We'll remember when we sober up.

764
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:07,950
Let's go.

765
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,750
I can remember.

766
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,850
I can tell you are a lightweight.

767
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,430
Oh no.

768
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,020
Hello, Jirong.

769
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,000
If you poke the dough again,

770
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,850
you won't be able to eat the dumpling.

771
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,750
No matter how hard I poke it, it's still a dumpling.

772
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,870
I won't waste it.

773
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,340
If you don't like it,

774
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,070
I'll buy you breakfast from another restaurant.

775
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,290
Forget it. I don't want to eat.

776
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,350
I have no appetite.

777
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,130
Actually, what you're most worried about is that

778
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,330
the accident will happen to you, right?

779
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,170
Do you know what I've been thinking?

780
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,600
I think

781
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,550
it's better if it happens to me.

782
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,770
It's better than if it happens to him.

783
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,930
I'm already unconscious.

784
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,110
It's more cost-effective

785
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,960
than if it happens to He Zhengyu, who's lively and healthy.

786
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,230
You can't think like that.

787
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,730
Life can't be measured by cost-effectiveness.

788
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,660
But life can be measured.

789
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,090
An unconscious person

790
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,820
and a normal person.

791
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,910
Which one will you choose

792
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,200
if one of them has to die?

793
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:55,870
If

794
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,340
I'm the one who'll die,

795
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,830
I think this is the best ending

796
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,280
between us.

797
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,730
Although there are some regrets.

798
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,830
We've only been together for two months.

799
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,100
We could only see each other for 46 minutes every day.

800
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,970
But since my parents passed away,

801
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,950
he's the only love I've got.

802
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:43,910
Take a shower.

803
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,180
Shower.

804
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,080
You have to wash your back if you take a shower.

805
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,160
Let's play another game

806
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,780
to increase the difficulty.

807
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,660
Still the tacit Q&A.

808
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,490
But we need to turn around at the same time.

809
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,420
Turning around.

810
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,410
Like this.

811
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,300
Let's start.

812
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,360
That He Zhengyu...

813
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,150
Who is his/her favorite singer?

814
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,230
Does he deserve to be loved this much?

815
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,090
You love him to the degree that

816
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,370
you would choose yourself when one of you has to die?

817
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:16,940
Green.

818
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:17,920
Again.

819
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,190
Look.

820
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,440
Do you think it's worth it?

821
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,940
[Fuxing Dongling Prison]

822
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,220
It's more cost-effective that it happens to me.

823
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,570
Than if it happens to him who's lively and healthy.

824
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,890
But life can be measured.

825
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,970
Do you think it's worth it?

826
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,610
Is it worth it?

827
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,470
Jialan.

828
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,210
How do you want me to accept it?

829
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,160
He Zhengyu.

830
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,790
Why are you here?

831
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,070
I should be asking you that.

832
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,700
Why are you here?

833
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,600
You didn't like

834
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,060
to take criminal cases before, did you?

835
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,720
I didn't say that I like it now.

836
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,250
I'm Wu Anwen's attorney now.

837
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,590
You're Wu Anwen's attorney?

838
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,320
The lawyers from one law firm

839
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,140
can't be

840
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,040
the attorneys for both

841
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,940
the victim and the suspect in one case.

842
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,380
That means we've stopped being partners.

843
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,660
Are you here to see him too?

844
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,270
Don't waste your time.

845
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,740
He won't see you.

846
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,020
Isn't he already sentenced?

847
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,120
Which law says

848
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,500
a person who is sentenced

849
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,120
can't meet his attorney?

850
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,510
That's rare.

851
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,680
You have developed a relationship with your client.

852
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,070
Don't worry about that.

853
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,410
Wu Anwen is already sentenced.

854
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,780
Are you here

855
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,180
to show off?

856
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,630
You think too much.

857
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,530
It's best if I thought too much.

858
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,860
Chen Jialan's incident wasn't an accident, right?

859
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,200
Although Wu Anwen was in prison

860
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,590
when Chen Jialan's accident happened,

861
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,940
Sun Defeng was outside.

862
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,000
If Sun Defeng

863
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,150
had been close to Wu Anwen at that time,

864
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,960
could he be related to Jialan's death?

865
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,300
So he kicked me out of the law firm.

866
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,880
[Sweet ON]

867
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,880
[Love in Time]

868
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,880
[Exclusively on iQIYI]

869
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,440
Since your brother gambled,

870
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,090
he...

871
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,640
[Embarrassed. Forgot his line.]

872
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:05,730
Your brother's...

873
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:09,060
[Look at my hand dance]

874
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,440
[Confused]

875
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,520
I was just...

876
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,510
Sorry.

877
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:14,560
[What's the next line?]

878
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,540
[I'll go first]

879
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,010
[Crap. Where should I hide?]

880
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,270
[Whatever]

881
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,760
Your assistant is calling you.

882
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:24,920
[Hurry to leave]

883
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,770
Where are you going, Zhengyu?

884
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,830
[Close behind]

885
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,090
[Done]

886
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,300
[You need to run out of the frame.]

887
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,060
You can still see me? Sorry.

888
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,530
[Hahaha]
