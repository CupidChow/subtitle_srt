[Episode 04]

4
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,360
Why are you here?

5
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,259
Didn't you say yesterday that you didn't want to see me?

6
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,190
You didn't keep your word, did you?

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,090
I was going to move out.

8
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,660
But then I thought about it.

9
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,740
Although we are in different time-space,

10
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,940
this is also your home

11
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,490
and you have the right to live your life in your own way.

12
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,410
That's more like it.

13
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,620
Besides, we are still in the adjustment period of cohabitation,

14
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,210
so it is normal for us to have conflicts.

15
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,380
It's not cohabitation. We're just roommates.

16
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,690
Yeah, roommates.

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,940
So

18
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,520
you're okay with me staying here?

19
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,340
You don't need to ask my permission.

20
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,670
I'm not the house owner.

21
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,210
Since we're roommates,

22
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,790
why don't we have dinner together?

23
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,970
He Zhengyu,

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,900
what do you want?

25
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,860
I just want to have an informal dinner with you.

26
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,950
An informal dinner?

27
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,810
You call this an informal dinner?

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,270
I don't believe you would be so nice to me

29
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,070
for no reason.

30
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,750
Tell me, what do you want?

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,100
You're overthinking it.

32
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,590
I am just trying to

33
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,230
live in peace with you.

34
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,790
Would you really be so nice?

35
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,940
I don't believe you.

36
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,430
Look.

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,120
You misunderstood me.

38
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,300
I would also like to take this opportunity

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,829
to get familiar with you

40
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,220
to facilitate our future life.

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,910
Am I right?

42
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,230
Please have a seat.

43
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't like these.

44
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,540
You can tell me

45
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,650
what you like.

46
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,100
Haven't you eaten Liuzhou river snails rice noodle before?

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,990
No.

48
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,060
This is similar to

49
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,920
cooking instant noodles, right?

50
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,460
Okay, leave it to me.

51
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,329
By the way,

52
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,420
please add a fried egg to the soup for me.

53
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,750
And it would be nice to have a chicken claw.

54
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,910
It seems he really hasn't tried this before.

55
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,790
I just confirmed that

56
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,480
it indeed smells like this.

57
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,220
There are still some over there.

58
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,100
Do you want to try?

59
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,620
No.

60
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,620
I'll pass.

61
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,170
Okay.

62
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,840
I can go to the study if you don't like the smell.

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,480
No, no.

64
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,130
It's okay.

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Just eat here.

66
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,500
All right.

67
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:04,990
The steak...

68
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,120
You really don't want to try it?

69
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,950
It's alright. I'm full.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
-I'm off to work now. -You...

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,940
What?

72
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,070
Nothing, just go ahead.

73
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,940
Li Zili had just been fired by Fei's Company,

74
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,990
and Li Ziqiang sued Fei's Company for forced demolition and beating.

75
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,990
My name is Li Zili.

76
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,950
As far as I know,

77
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,970
you also worked for Fei's Company before, right?

78
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,530
Yes.

79
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,110
Please listen to me, miss.

80
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,160
Fei's Company

81
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,580
not only maliciously lowers the compensation

82
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,020
during the demolition process,

83
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,560
but also uses force to retaliate against people. They beat up my brother.

84
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,140
I was expelled because I couldn't stand what they were doing

85
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,960
and didn't want to join them.

86
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,140
Could this be a coincidence?

87
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,030
May I come in, Chen Jialan?

88
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

89
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,770
I'm just looking for something.

90
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,830
It won't take long.

91
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,050
Hurry up, then.

92
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,940
Where is it?

93
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,500
I remember it was right here.

94
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,860
Just hurry up.

95
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,220
Don't disturb my work.

96
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,330
It might be there.

97
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,370
Where is it?

98
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,590
Did I put it on the table?

99
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,790
Isn't this Jiang Shenghao?

100
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,040
You know him?

101
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,140
What does it matter to you

102
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,200
if I know him or not?

103
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,140
You know him?

104
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,200
Of course.

105
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,310
Wu Jirong is my good friend,

106
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,460
and Jiang Shenghao is her husband.

107
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,110
So Rat's proposal was successful.

108
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,880
And they soon got a marriage certificate.

109
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,049
But generally people

110
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,500
who get married quickly

111
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,320
tend to get divorced quickly.

112
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,480
Why do you have to

113
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,950
think that way?

114
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,580
Are you really Jirong's good friend?

115
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,820
You must be an anti-fan.

116
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,350
I'm just telling the truth.

117
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,440
Our law firm

118
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,880
handles several of these cases every year.

119
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,780
You lawyers

120
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,700
just want everyone to get divorced

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,170
so that you can make money.

122
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,030
I'm telling you this

123
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,910
because you know Jiang Shenghao.

124
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,180
No need.

125
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,860
But...

126
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,180
Have you found your stuff yet?

127
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,780
Please get out if you're done.

128
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,350
Wu Jirong is my good friend.

129
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,060
I have no reason to curse her.

130
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,710
She's a superstar.

131
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,740
Information about her can be found online.

132
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,030
Stop pretending.

133
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,540
I really know her.

134
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,840
Then do you know this?

135
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,070
Chen Jialan, I...

136
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,340
Get out.

137
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,660
Wait...

138
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,330
Don't bother me.

139
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,470
So annoying.

140
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,660
I haven't found my stuff yet.

141
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,050
You're really annoying.

142
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,580
I haven't found my stuff...

143
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,120
Why is she so difficult to get along with?

144
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,590
Here are the details of the whole event.

145
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,820
According to Li Ziqiang,

146
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,040
it was indeed Fei Meng

147
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,070
who ordered his men to beat him up at that time.

148
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,580
And the hospital's diagnostic certificate also showed that

149
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,660
his arm was indeed

150
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,260
a comminuted fracture

151
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,650
caused by the blow of external force.

152
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,160
And he also had a slight concussion.

153
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,660
The case of Fei's Company's forced demolition and beating

154
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,920
has sparked widespread social concern.

155
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,670
We must pay attention to

156
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,880
the accuracy of the information now.

157
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,690
Any questions?

158
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,770
Ms. Wen,

159
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,300
I have an idea.

160
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,210
Please go ahead.

161
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,650
The leader of the disturbance outside the Fei's Company building that day

162
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,410
was named Li Zili,

163
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,360
who is the brother of Li Ziqiang.

164
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,570
According to what he said,

165
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,040
he was fired by Fei's Company

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,250
because he couldn't stand

167
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,570
their behavior.

168
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,110
But I went to Fei's Company to investigate

169
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,210
and I found out that he and his construction team were fired

170
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,190
before the demolition.

171
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,960
So I suspect there is something else behind this incident.

172
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,220
What Li Zili did

173
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,420
was to defend his rights against the dismissal of Fei's Company employees.

174
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,030
It has nothing to do with Fei Meng beating people, does it?

175
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,760
Besides,

176
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,620
public opinions are now on the side of the Li brothers.

177
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,060
But the duty of journalists is to disclose the truth

178
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,540
and tell the public the truth.

179
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,820
If we just pander to

180
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,850
the netizens' speculation

181
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,840
and only report the story they want to see,

182
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,210
wouldn't that defeat

183
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,980
our original purpose?

184
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,770
Chen Jialan,

185
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,380
is what you are saying your own speculation,

186
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,240
or have you found solid evidence?

187
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,670
This is just my suspicion for now.

188
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,760
I haven't found the evidence yet.

189
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,710
I want to say one more thing.

190
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,630
I did find a lot of suspicions

191
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,780
during the interview with Li Ziqiang.

192
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,920
But I didn't find any conclusive evidence either.

193
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,750
And since the Fei's Company case will soon go to trial,

194
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,590
I want to

195
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,620
see the outcome of the trial first.

196
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,540
But since Chen Jialan mentioned it just now,

197
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,000
it shows that she has a good sensitivity of news.

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,590
How about

199
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,430
we report these two stories separately for now?

200
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,170
Chen Jialan and I will follow up the connection

201
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,770
between these two things.

202
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay, just do as you say.

203
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
That's all for today.

204
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,040
You're dismissed.

205
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,880
Awesome, Chen Jialan.

206
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,050
Even Mr. Mu wanted to work with you.

207
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,160
He's a maverick.

208
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,600
It's great that you got his approval.

209
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,530
Mr. Mu, I will try my best

210
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,470
to live up to your expectations.

211
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,390
I'm sure you can do it.

212
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,550
Okay.

213
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,430
Brother.

214
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,050
I found Chen Kexin.

215
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,770
Send me your location.

216
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,490
Where is she?

217
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Let's go meet her.

218
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,690
What do you want?

219
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,800
Hello, Miss Chen.

220
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,090
We won't take you long.

221
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,820
It's just that we would like to confirm some questions

222
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,550
about Jiang Shenghao with you.

223
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,180
No need.

224
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,180
Jiang Shenghao is just a jerk.

225
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,460
He was already with me

226
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,980
but he didn't want to divorce Wu Jirong.

227
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,670
What happened in the apartment that night

228
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,260
was just like what you think.

229
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,320
I made it very clear

230
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,420
when I cooperated with the investigation.

231
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,670
As for the rest, I have no comment.

232
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,300
Please stop bothering me in the future.

233
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,620
Miss Chen, please don't get us wrong.

234
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
Here is the thing.

235
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Jiang Shenghao

236
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,770
said in court that you perjured.

237
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,270
We hope to find more conclusive evidence

238
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,900
that he cheated after marriage.

239
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,740
When this case goes to trial again,

240
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,860
we would like you to testify

241
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,420
and be questioned by the judge.

242
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,350
It'll be more helpful for the case.

243
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,320
I don't mind testifying in court.

244
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,590
But there is a long story

245
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,860
between me and Jiang Shenghao.

246
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,860
Excuse me.

247
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,960
I'd like to go to the bathroom.

248
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,180
Sir.

249
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,230
There's a bathroom over there.

250
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,020
Chen Kexin!

251
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,590
What are you stopping me for?

252
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,050
Wait...

253
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,260
What's going on?

254
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,750
Sorry.

255
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,370
That lady said

256
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,300
she didn't know you

257
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,680
and asked us for help.

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,060
Please forgive us.

259
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,370
Can't you see that we know each other?

260
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,570
You can go to the bar if you need to order.

261
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,120
If you verbally harass

262
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,850
our female customers again...

263
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,120
Harass?

264
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,670
Alright.

265
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,390
Let's go.

266
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,820
We finally found her,

267
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,160
but she just ran away.

268
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,020
What do you mean by run away?

269
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,290
We were just asking her some questions,

270
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,750
not arresting criminals.

271
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,900
But we didn't

272
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,530
get any useful information.

273
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,760
No.

274
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,080
We've found a lot.

275
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,720
What?

276
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:27,740
We just

277
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,460
questioned her normally

278
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,390
but she ran away.

279
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,810
Running away means exposure.

280
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,580
Because there's something

281
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,160
she doesn't want us to know about,

282
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,650
and it's closely tied to the case.

283
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,040
But it's going to be hard to find her again.

284
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,520
Don't worry. You got me.

285
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,140
Jialan,

286
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,900
why don't they get their own coffee

287
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,870
but have to ask you to help them?

288
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,390
They are quite busy.

289
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,480
It's not a big deal.

290
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,020
Mr. Mu had never worked with anyone before,

291
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,280
yet he worked with her.

292
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,080
The cake was quite ugly.

293
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,800
I just threw it in the trash.

294
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:07,880
Me too.

295
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,070
I didn't take a bite.

296
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,360
Well,

297
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,190
did she leave early for dinner that day

298
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,350
to find Mr. Mu?

299
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,370
Of course.

300
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,040
She was in a hurry that day...

301
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,200
It is your freedom

302
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,380
to throw away the things people give you.

303
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,740
But I can't stand

304
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,270
you speaking ill of others.

305
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,350
I seem to have a manuscript that I haven't finished yet.

306
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:26,910
Right.

307
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,780
You are just too kind.

308
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,140
It's okay. Thank you, Piaopiao.

309
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,960
I'm off to go.

310
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,300
Whatever Chen Jialan is going to do tonight...

311
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,070
Even if she treats the house like a garbage dump,

312
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,330
I have to put up with it.

313
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,339
Because I need her to help me make an appointment with Jirong.

314
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,579
Remember.

315
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:17,520
Smile.

316
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,090
Luckily I got my fist under control.

317
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,760
What are you walking around for?

318
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,330
Go away.

319
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,350
Remember, smile.

320
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,780
Thank you.

321
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,630
Chen Jialan.

322
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,690
Would you please...

323
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,130
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

324
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,790
Can't you see I'm in a bad mood?

325
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,480
I know.

326
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,250
Then you indeed need to vent it.

327
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,630
I am venting it.

328
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,780
I have an idea

329
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,860
to make you feel better in a minute.

330
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,940
So cold.

331
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,180
It's winter here.

332
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,420
Wear more when you come out next time.

333
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,150
No need.

334
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,020
Okay, thank you.

335
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,430
Thank you.

336
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,770
It's so good.

337
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,190
Do you want to try it?

338
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,630
I don't eat sweet.

339
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,190
You are such a poser.

340
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,210
What's wrong with me?

341
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,270
Childish.

342
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,020
Now that you're eating cake,

343
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,840
I have something...

344
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,770
Answer me first.

345
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,860
Where did you get the equipment?

346
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,860
What does it have to do with you?

347
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,340
Can't I just ask you?

348
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,970
How dare you come back?

349
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,220
I'll kill you today.

350
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,980
After learning that you know martial arts,

351
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,440
I deliberately went to buy a set of equipment

352
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,730
to protect myself.

353
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,990
Martial arts?

354
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,350
Were the moves you used

355
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,280
learned from taekwondo videos?

356
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,120
And what I learned was not martial arts,

357
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,450
but mixed martial arts.

358
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Do you want to try?

359
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,140
No.

360
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,860
I can't tell the difference anyway.

361
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,630
Look at you.

362
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,050
How can you

363
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,710
be so violent every day?

364
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,400
You usually look quite normal.

365
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,930
How come you're actually a slick-haired scum?

366
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,980
If I were a scum,

367
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,130
would I buy you a cake?

368
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,060
Since you have already eaten the cake.

369
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,970
Don't say anything about this cake.

370
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,460
It was because of this cake.

371
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,210
I worked so hard

372
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,220
to make them cakes for so long

373
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,940
and they said the cakes were ugly.

374
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,220
They seem to be right.

375
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,820
He Zhengyu!

376
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,710
Is that what you're mad about?

[Hualin Road]

378
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,110
I've already treated them to dinner.

379
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,210
I... I got to be a journalist

380
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,100
because of my hard work.

381
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,700
I merely

382
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,230
left dinner a little early.

383
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,820
Did they have to discredit me like that?

384
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,660
Left early?

385
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,320
I did it all because of Rat,

386
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,420
also known as Jiang Shenghao.

387
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,590
He told me to leave.

388
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,590
Are you close to Jiang Shenghao?

389
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,030
Stop.

390
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,300
Don't try to

get any gossip from me.

392
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,850
I won't tell you.

393
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:57,840
Fine.

394
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,550
I won't ask.

Where were we?

The workplace...

398

The workplace is a... The workplace is a small society.

399
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,660
We don't need to do ineffective socialization,

400
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,300
but we can't be socially inactive either.

401
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,620
We still need to maintain the necessary relationships.

402
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,880
Is that you want to say?

403
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,080
You know all these.

I do.

405
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,620
But Rat is my best friend.

406
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,750
He is indeed more important than those ineffective social interactions.

407

I didn't expect you to be quite principled.

I have a handkerchief in my pocket.

You can wipe it.

413
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,970
So troublesome.

I have a handkerchief in my pocket.

You can wipe it with that handkerchief.

No.

Look. What is she doing?

433

You and Liu Da go to the press conference first.

449

Their attorney is He Zhengyu?

No.

452

I'll be right there.

because of Fei's Company's case?

469
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,620
you chose to be the attorney for Fei's Company?

470

Everyone,

471

aren't you worried that the outcome of this trial

477
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,540
will break your glorious record

I'm not sure about,

nor do I fight a lawsuit that I have no chance of winning.

482
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,800
So I will still win this time.

483

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,560
Brother.

517
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,310
Take my hand.

518
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,690
Be careful.

519
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,930
How much money did you take from Fei's Company?

520
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,760
You will be punished for doing so.

521
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,290
First,

522
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,360
the law is about evidence,

523
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,380
not karma.

524
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,180
Secondly,

525
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,490
everyone here

526
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,860
heard what you just said,

527
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,060
so I can sue you at any time.

528
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,980
He Zhengyu!

529
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,260
Mr. He,

530
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,020
I have a question for you.

531
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,890
You are

532
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,730
an undefeated myth in the lawyer world,

533
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,680
and it is normal for you

534
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,770
to defend the legal rights of your clients.

535
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,860
But as far as I know,

536
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,120
all your clients are rich.

537
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,340
Are you seeking a victory

538
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,060
for fairness and justice

539
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,110
or a victory for rich clients?

540
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,620
That's a good question.

541
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,240
You are the first journalist

542
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,180
to ask me this question

543
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,980
in my many years in the business.

544
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,820
My answer is

545
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,450
neither.

546
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,060
Justice occupies a different place in everyone's heart.

547
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,590
And there is no uniform standard for victory.

548
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,980
As a lawyer,

549
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:30,820
all I can do

550
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,370
is to maintain the justice defined by the law.

551
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,400
I want to remind you, as a reporter,

552
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,900
that your interview

553
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,550
with subjective intent just now

554
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,500
has violated

555
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,360
the spirit of objective and neutral interviewing.

556
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,260
You are right about that.

557
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,700
But as a human being,

558
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,050
one should have the awareness to speak up for the weak.

559
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,450
What do you think, Mr. He?

560
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,750
This is a press conference for Fei's Company,

561
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,010
not the selection of the top ten young people.

562
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,340
What you are talking about is not in the scope of discussion.

563
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,260
He Zhengyu.

564
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,740
You're practicing?

565
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,260
I bought you a cake.

566
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,930
Sweets stimulate dopamine,

567
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,860
which can help you feel better.

568
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,680
I didn't know you four months ago.

569
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,440
I apologize for him.

570
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,960
He Zhengyu,

571
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,750
You've been acting strange these days.

572
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,100
Why do I feel like you've changed?

573
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,070
Really?

574
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,650
I don't think so.

575
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,910
You bought me a cake yesterday.

576
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,260
And today you humbly apologized

577
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,190
for what happened four months ago.

578
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,180
You even bought me another cake.

579
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,250
Something must be wrong.

580
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,820
You also asked me

581
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,380
to do you a favor last night.

582
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,640
What do you want?

583
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,260
Are you still

584
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,380
trying to separate

585
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,590
Jirong and Shenghao?

586
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,860
No way.

587
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,180
Separate? That's not what I meant.

588
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,900
Your thoughts have nothing to do with me.

589
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,700
It's useless.

590
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,010
He Zhengyu,

591
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,720
you didn't get ruined

592
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
because of this case,

593
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,480
did you?

594
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,400
Could you please not use

595
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,650
the word "ruined"?

596
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,650
I did move here

597
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,560
because I lost a lawsuit.

598
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,300
But it wasn't because of the one you're talking about.

599
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,380
I won that one you're mentioning.

600
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,100
You did take the dirty money.

601
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,950
Chen Jialan,

602
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,670
I don't doubt that you have a sense of justice.

603
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,800
But you're using it in the wrong place.

604
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,500
We have all seen Li Ziqiang's injuries.

605
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,580
His injury examination report was also written by the hospital.

606
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,710
How can that be fake?

607
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,480
We did see Li Ziqiang's injuries.

608
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,500
But who saw

609
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,830
the people from Fei's Company beat him up?

610
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,380
You're a lawyer. I can't convince you.

611
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,240
But it doesn't mean you're right.

612
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,150
You may not trust me,

613
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,930
but you should trust the law

614
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,180
and the judge, right?

615
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:42,670
Look.

616
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,060
[Fei's Company won. He Zhengyu maintained his undefeated legacy.]

617
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,420
This is the result, not the evidence.

618
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,170
What other evidence do you want?

619
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,310
In my world,

620
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,730
the jury is still out on this.

621
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,190
I'll figure it out myself.

622
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,420
Chen Jialan.

623
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,350
Don't follow me.

624
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,630
I don't want to see you.

625
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,260
Thank you.

626
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,180
Sir.

627
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,150
Follow that car.

628
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,030
Go, go, go.

629
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,020
Follow him.

630
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,780
Let me ask you.

631
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,020
Do you know where the Li brothers are?

632
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,050
What do you want?

633
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,330
Do you know it or not?

634
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,350
Why is she so mean?

635
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,370
I won't put up with you

636
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,620
if it isn't for

637
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,170
asking Jirong out.

638
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,360
I just thought about it.

639
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,960
You can ask me tomorrow.

640
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,220
I mean the me from four months ago.

641
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,360
I remember that day I went to...

642
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
What is it?

643
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,350
It's really annoying.

644
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,670
Are you that journalist from iNEWS?

645
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,060
How did you know?

646
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,190
Why are you following me?

647
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,320
Who is following you?

648
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,630
I'm here for coffee.

649
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,730
Ms. Chen.

650
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,410
I have work to do.

651
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,139
Please go have fun elsewhere.

652
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,139
Don't disturb me.

653
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,300
I have work to do too.

654
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,590
So, don't disturb me.

655
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,300
Work?

656
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,699
Are you also here to see Li Zili?

657
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,600
How did you know I was here?

658
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,480
You told me yourself.

659
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,719
Forget it. I'm going to do an interview.

660
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,780
Don't get in my way.

661
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,280
Come back.

662
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,409
What do you want?

663
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,179
Is it a public interview?

664
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:31,199
If so,

665
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,380
your outfit is too informal.

666
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:33,870
If not,

667
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,260
your outfit is too ostentatious.

668
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,409
What other ideas do you have?

669
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,420
Just follow me

670
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,560
and sit behind me normally.

671
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,260
Remember,

672
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,889
you're not an actor.

673
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,929
You don't need to be so extra.

674
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,030
I'll have two specials and a fruit plate.

675
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,630
Thank you.

676
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,360
Li Zili,

677
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,630
you have to get your brother to keep his mouth shut.

678
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,360
Your coffee.

679
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,240
The defendant's lawyer is not easy to deal with.

680
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,130
We will all be screwed if something happens.

681
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,700
Don't worry.

682
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,480
My brother is very honest.

683
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,390
I've told him.

684
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,830
Then my money...

685
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,050
What money?

686
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,560
Li Zili,

687
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,700
you can't burn the bridge, right?

688
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,340
I'm not as foolish as your brother.

689
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,960
Don't get me wrong.

690
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,360
I will pay you

691
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,690
once the lawsuit is won and the compensation arrives.

692
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,800
You are really a bastard.

693
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,970
You could even think of self-harm.

694
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,480
I did it because I knew how to win the game.

695
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,070
If he doesn't break his arm,

696
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,360
we won't get the money.

697
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,130
Don't worry.

698
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,110
I'm sorry.

699
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,960
We almost got caught just now.

700
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,520
Li Ziqiang's forensic report has come out.

701
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,950
He fractured the same part twice in a short period of time.

702
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,180
It is likely that the plaintiff

703
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,660
has done a second injury to himself

704
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,570
in order to frame Fei's Company.

705
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,360
Obviously, it wasn't done by Fei's Company.

706
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,660
Journalists have to express facts, not emotions.

707
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,920
Don't make yourself look so amateurish.

708
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,520
Bye.

709
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,110
You didn't pay the bill.

710
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:35,800
Waiter.

711
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,950
Bill, please.

712
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,670
I just paid the bill...

713
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,590
Now it's raining.

714
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,140
I'll have to pay for a taxi.

715
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,390
Get in.

716
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,060
Get in.

717
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:05,940
Thank you.

718
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,320
Thank you.

719
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,890
Where are you headed?

720
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,550
My company,

721
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,040
iNEWS.

722
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,510
Thank you.

723
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,110
I used to think that

724
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,120
what I saw was real.

725
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,150
But I didn't expect that this case

726
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,770
has proved me wrong.

727
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,200
I heard you never lost a case.

728
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,490
How did you do that?

729
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,180
Because I have a brain.

730
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,180
Thank you for sending me back specially.

731
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,010
You're overthinking it.

732
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,940
It's raining so hard now.

733
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,070
I would do the same thing for everyone.

734
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,670
If you ever find out

735
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,970
how annoying you are right now,

736
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,030
will you regret it?

737
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,440
What do you mean?

738
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,540
Nothing.

739
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,030
Bye.

740
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,420
He Zhengyu?

741
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,710
What are you doing here?

742
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,690
Mr. Mu.

743
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,030
He gave me a ride.

744
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,010
Why are you two together?

745
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,600
When did you become an entertainment reporter?

746
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,380
So gossipy.

747
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,380
You are now the attorney representing Fei Meng.

748
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,460
Your identity is too sensitive.

749
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,720
Jilan is my colleague.

750
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,850
I need to remind her

751
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,870
not to be taken advantage of.

752
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,840
You should indeed do that.

753
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,000
The professional level of your iNEWS staff

754
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,930
needs to be improved.

755
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,790
He Zhengyu!

756
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,700
I can't affect the fairness of the news.

757
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,780
I can only affect

758
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,040
the authenticity of the news you report.

759
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,110
Your hair is all wet.

760
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,150
Dry it.

761
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,720
Don't catch a cold.

762
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,840
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

763
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,960
Let's go.

764
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay.

765
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
By the way, Mr. Mu,

766
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,690
I found Li Zili.

767
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,060
I also recorded some videos.

768
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,660
Let me see.

769
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,320
Are you that journalist from iNEWS?

770
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,250
I did it because I knew how to win the game.

771
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,430
It is likely that the plaintiff has done a second injury to himself...

772
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,270
iNEWS.

773
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,550
Again?

774
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,590
Come on.

775
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,610
It's just a game.

776
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,610
Why would you connect it to reality?

777
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,650
My memory is updated again.

778
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,810
Brother.

779
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,200
Why do you keep repeating this?

780
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,330
Why don't you believe me?

781
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,280
I do.

782
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,120
You are the boss.

783
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,850
I'll believe whatever you say.

784
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,960
Do you remember

785
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,500
the case in which Li Ziqiang framed Fei's Company?

786
00:40:59,500 --> 00:40:59,980
Yes.

787
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,610
His medical report was investigated by me.

788
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,500
Li Zili

789
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,620
was fired from his job

790
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,500
for cutting corners in a construction project.

791
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,110
Fei Meng gave us the evidence.

792
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,730
I personally investigated Li Zili

793
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,550
to make sure everything was in order,

794
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,820
and it turned out that

795
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,060
he was colluding with a mole in Fei's Company

796
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,390
to screw Fei's Company.

797
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,850
Wait...

798
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,040
Didn't we win the case?

799
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,560
Why are you still mentioning it?

800
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,220
My new memory now shows me that

801
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
when I checked on Li Zili,

802
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,750
Chen Jialan was also there.

803
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:28,770
So cool.

804
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,380
Which one of you does she like more?

805
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,580
Is it you four months ago or is it you now?

806
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,060
It's not like that.

807
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,510
I'm not even sure now

808
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,360
which one of me she hates more.

809
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,950
I guess it's you now.

810
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,480
Get lost.

811
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,700
Now that our relationship is so strained.

812
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,540
She's even less likely to help me ask Jirong out.

813
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,350
You're getting worse.

814
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,650
Why would Chen Jialan

815
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,150
appear in all my new memories?

816
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,610
Is there a pattern to this?

817
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,110
Play the game first.

818
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
Don't get us lose.

819
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,700
The ultimate.

820
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,580
Wait, the skill is on cooldown. Wait...

821
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,060
Go! Go! Go!

822
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,140
Chen Jialan!

823
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,240
Chen Jialan?

824
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,690
Chen Jialan?

825
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,820
She didn't stay out on purpose, did she?

826
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,300
It's indeed wise to come back late.

827
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,570
That way I don't have to see that annoying guy.

828
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,500
I can have a quiet environment now.

829
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,140
Chen Jialan, my proposal was successful.

830
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,480
-Come and have dinner with us. -He proposed successfully?

831
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,160
Great!

832
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,180
Chen Jialan,

833
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,970
why are you standing outside sneakily?

834
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,630
Come in.

835
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,500
It's really you.

836
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,930
Ms. Wu.

837
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,320
Ms. Wu?

838
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,500
What are you talking about?

839
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,030
Stop pretending to be a kid.

840
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,380
Just call me Jirong.

841
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,120
Have a seat.

842
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,060
Okay.

843
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,730
Wouldn't it interrupt your work

844
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,810
that we asked you to come over suddenly?

845
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,640
Not at all.

846
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,990
It's my lunch break now.

847
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,620
You're...

848
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,870
You're much prettier than on TV.

849
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,470
Thank you.

850
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,120
Guess what?

851
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,070
This is my wife.

852
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,450
Stop showing off.

853
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,360
Such a big diamond ring!

854
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,410
You must have spent a lot of money, right?

855
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,190
Of course.

856
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,320
This is what I have to do.

857
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,530
Jialan.

858
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,770
I've heard him talk about you a lot.

859
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,700
I also watched your live coverage.

860
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,690
I was wondering

861
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,340
how such a thin girl

862
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,820
could have so much energy.

863
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,220
I think you're cool.

864
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,200
Do you really think so?

865
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,520
Of course.

866
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,060
I know it's hard for girls to be journalists.

867
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,170
It's not easy.

868
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,530
I really admire you.

869
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,860
Thank you.

870
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,890
It's okay.

871
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,620
I'm not that excellent.

872
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,360
You girls are amazing.

873
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,220
You've just met,

874
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,440
but it's like you've known each other for years.

875
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,700
None of your business.

876
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,460
Jirong.

877
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,230
Tell me if Shenghao makes you unhappy.

878
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,230
I'll protect you.

879
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,920
I am good at arguing and fighting.

880
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,360
Okay.

881
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,390
Then you'll be my family from now on.

882
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:09,870
Fine.

883
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:10,910
You are a family.

884
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:11,950
I'm an outsider.

885
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,890
I'll leave then.

886
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,980
Don't go.

887
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,920
Who will pay if you leave?

888
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,100
Look.

889
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,510
I'm still useful.

890
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,840
Then I'll continue to shine.

891
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,540
By the way, Jirong,

892
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,920
I have a small request.

893
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,230
My best friend is your big fan.

894
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,260
Could you please give me an autographed photo of you?

895
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:33,990
No problem.

896
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,520
I will let Sheng Hao give it to you later.

897
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,120
Thank you.

898
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,790
Jirong.

899
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,270
Is the temperature right?

900
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,090
Yeah.

901
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,000
I met Rat's fiancee today.

902
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,810
She will be the happiest bride

903
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,020
in the world.

904
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,830
Happiest?

905
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,890
It was a nightmare.

906
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:12,470
Chen Jialan,

907
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,020
you just didn't come back on purpose.

908
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,660
They can still annul the engagement.

909
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,440
I can definitely deal with you.

910
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,820
Chen Jialan,

911
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,010
next time it will be you begging me.

Should I put my left hand lower or my right hand lower?

916
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,740
It's better if you pinch her face.

917
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,010
The skin of my hands is too dark.

Sorry.
