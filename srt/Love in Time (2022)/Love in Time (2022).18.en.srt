[2021]

5
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,020
Hello.

6
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,460
Chen Jialan, what's wrong with you?

7
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,690
Why did you tell Wu Anwen that

8
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,350
the person in the photo was me?

9
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,740
What are you talking about?

10
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,860
Wu Anwen said that you admitted that

11
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,100
the person in the photo was me.

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,500
What's wrong with you? Why did you say that?

13
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,360
Are you crazy? What did I admit?

14
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,890
There were He Zhengyu and I in the photo.

15
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,460
Then why did Zhengyu say that

16
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,120
he wasn't with you last night?

17
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,090
Jiang Shenghao, here's the thing.

18
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,500
That photo was indeed a photo of me and He Zhengyu.

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,470
This is true.

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,060
As for what Wu Anwen said,

21
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,300
don't believe a word.

22
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,620
He just wanted to confuse others.

23
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,370
He said it to Jirong deliberately.

24
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,020
Anyway, the most important thing is Jirong.

25
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,740
As long as we explain it to Jirong clearly,

26
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,980
what Wu Anwen says doesn't matter.

27
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,020
Explain it to Jirong...

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,020
I know I need to explain it to Jirong.

29
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,140
but the point is that Jirong doesn't trust me now.

30
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,340
I have a headache now.

31
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,180
Anyway, that's what happened.

32
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,320
Give me some time.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,010
I will explain it to Jirong.

34
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,180
OK.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,120
But you must be quick.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,760
I don't want Jirong to be too sad.

37
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,540
Don't worry.

38
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,490
[Miss Chen, the other woman, meets a man hurriedly to plot]

39
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,400
We were photographed so soon.

40
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,460
Is someone following me?

41
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,440
You're a hot topic now.

42
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,560
It's normal that you are stalked.

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,920
I think we must have been photographed too.

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,880
It'll be on the news soon.

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,590
Well,

46
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,460
we can't stay here any longer.

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,120
Let's split up. I'll go first.

48
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,230
No, we have to go together.

49
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,680
Why?

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,060
When the time-space overlaps,

51
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,430
if He Zhengyu can't find me,

52
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,430
he will be worried.

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,500
It's none of my business.

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,220
Of course it has something to do with you.

55
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,100
In 2022,

56
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,430
you will automatically have a new memory.

57
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,340
What?

58
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,990
[She is inside.]

59
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,990
[Who? Inside what?]

60
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,090
[I am sorry. I sent it to the wrong person.]

61
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,350
You think I'm a moving hard disk.

62
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,000
There is no help for it.

63
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,300
You are four months earlier,

64
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,550
while he is four months later.

65
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,660
That's why he can update your memory in real time.

66
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,050
This is the advantage of the time.

67
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,910
Just accept it.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,170
Now, let's think about

69
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,030
how to get rid of those paparazzi.

70
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,860
I'll get you a new pair of slippers.

71
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Let's make a deal.

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm just taking you in temporarily.

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,140
Come on.

74
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,580
Thank you.

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,870
You're welcome.

76
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,220
This is the living room.

77
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,350
That's the kitchen.

78
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,380
This is the guest bathroom.

79
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,540
You can use it anytime.

80
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:51,880
Also,

81
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,230
in my house,

82
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,490
let me know if you need anything.

83
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,650
Also,

84
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,290
don't touch anything.

85
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,550
Okay.

86
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,620
Also,

87
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,760
this is my bedroom.

88
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,530
This is my private space.

89
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,530
It's so big here.

90
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,740
He Zhengyu should know that I'm here.

91
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,550
I've been thinking about it all day.

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,980
I still don't believe it.

93
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,080
It's not the first time I've met Jialan,

94
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,190
and I know how they get along.

95
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,290
It's not what you think.

96
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,810
I didn't think about it.

97
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,140
I saw it with my own eyes.

98
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,580
Anwen,

99
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,590
Jialan has been worried about me and Shenghao.

100
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,710
She sent us books, and

101
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,440
she also helped us find the marriage consultant.

102
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,210
And she has a boyfriend.

103
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,830
Her boyfriend is He Zhengyu.

104
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,380
Anyway,

105
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,410
I trust her.

106
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,130
You are too silly.

107
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,360
Maybe all of us

108
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,980
were blinded by

109
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,070
Chen Jialan's innocent appearance.

110
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,230
Maybe she's the kind of girl

111
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,130
who still wants to date another man while she has a boyfriend.

112
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,190
There are many girls like that in society.

113
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,120
You have played such a role before.

114
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,100
That's a play.

115
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,970
Is a play the same as life?

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,460
I've been thinking about it these days.

117
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,390
After you got married,

118
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,650
she asked Jiang Shenghao

119
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,130
to guard against me first.

120
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,800
Then, when you and Jiang Shenghao's

121
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,120
love life started tumbling

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,150
and you weren't home,

123
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,860
she broke up with He Zhengyu

124
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,060
and moved into Jiang Shenghao's house.

125
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,600
Jiang Shenghao listens to her

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,480
all the time.

127
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,890
See for yourself.

128
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,570
It was taken yesterday morning.

129
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,060
They kissed the night before.

130
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,090
The next morning,

131
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,540
they hugged and said goodbye reluctantly.

132
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,590
If there were only one or two photos,

133
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,140
it could be a coincidence.

134
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,220
But why can people take photos of them

135
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,290
getting so close to each other every time?

136
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,680
Come on, Jirong.

137
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,460
Yes,

138
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,230
they grew up together.

139
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,890
They were good friends in childhood.

140
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,860
But when they grow up,

141
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,420
shouldn't they at least have a sense of boundary?

142
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,340
Men and women shouldn't get too close to each other.

143
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,870
Is this hard to understand?

144
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,590
Even siblings

145
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,409
don't always hug each other.

146
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,170
Now I suspect that

147
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,820
they had a complicated relationship at the beginning.

148
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,270
Maybe

149
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,590
Chen Jialan thought that Jiang Shenghao was a player,

150
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,380
and Jiang Shenghao didn't want to be responsible for her,

151
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,980
so they didn't get together.

152
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,940
But you showed up.

153
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,550
Don't cry.

154
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,730

I won't feel wronged when you are here.

173
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,870
♫Miracles will always come♫

174
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,450
Don't worry.

175
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,450
I've found the evidence.

176
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
to prove your innocence.

177
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,600
Really?

178
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,910
What evidence did you find?

179
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,620
The night before yesterday,

180
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,660
I climbed the wall on the side of the villa.

181
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,780
I was recorded by my neighbor's surveillance camera.

182
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,510
Although the video is blurry,

183
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,260
I can be recognized.

184
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,350
And the lunch box in my hand can also be seen.

185
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,680
It is the same box as

186
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,230
the box in Wu Anwen's video.

187
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,810
The chain of evidence is complete now.

188
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,020
It's enough to prove that the man in the photo is me,

189
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,620
rather than Jiang Shenghao.

190
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,890
That's great.

191
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,860
But the owner of that house

192
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,730
is not home these days.

193
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,100
We can only get the video three days later.

194
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,990
So in the next three days,

195
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,520
you still have to

196
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,130
bear the slander and cyber violence.

197
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,660
It's okay.

198
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,200
It's not my first time suffering cyber violence.

199
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm used to it.

200
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,650
And as long as you're by my side,

201
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,030
nothing else matters.

202
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,190
Hello, everyone.

203
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,990
This is the vlog of Chen Jialan and He Zhengyu.

204
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,770
We're at your house four months earlier.

205

♫A dream within reach♫

206
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,090
Strictly speaking, this is not my home.

207
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,690
But I know

208
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,690
every corner here.

209
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,890
♫Arises because of you♫

210

Let's appreciate the night view here.

♫Pass through the huge crowd♫

213
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,310

♫How can I stop flipping?♫

It's your turn. Aim at the red dot.

219
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,540
-No problem. -It's broken.

220
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,400

♫You are the light shining♫

Relax this hand.

♫At the end of the world♫

227

Right foot.

228

The center of gravity is on the right foot.

♫Hug you♫

230

Aim at it. We will reach that point.

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,720
Relax and throw it.

232
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,550
One, two, three, go.

♫And staying in my heart♫

Aim at it. Open both eyes.

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,490
How can I aim at it if I open both eyes?

239
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:36,270
♫Spend dust and dawn with you♫

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,600
Come on.

246
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,710
One, two, three, go.

247
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,680
Actually, I have something

248
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,310
I really like to play at home.

249
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,800
Do you want to give it a try?

250
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,440
This one?

251
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,120
Yes.

252
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,230
Let's go.

253
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,270
♫A dream within reach♫

254
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,090
Try it. I will help you.

255
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,140
It's been a long time since I played it last time.

256
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:12,940
You're back.

257
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,300
Thank you for today.

258
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,650
I just want to take a shower now

259
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,450
and forget all the unhappiness.

260
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,080
Also,

261
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,290
tonight, you sleep on...

262
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,340
I will sleep on the sofa.

263
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,840
I know.

264
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,380
You have mysophobia,

265
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,040
and you don't like the smell of others on the bed.

266
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,100
Where were you last night?

267
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Were you with Jialan?

268
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,900
Last night...

269
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,340
Were you in Jiang Shenghao's house?

270
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,020
Look at the hot news today,

271
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,620
and you will understand it.

272
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,270
[Reversal. The man who kissed was not the man we knew.]

273
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,930
In 2022,

274
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,350
the kissing photo incident has been clarified.

275
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,930
There's no the other woman,

276
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,340
and Jiang Shenghao didn't cheat on her,

277
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,410
[Wu Jirong announced her divorce. Her lawyer, He Zhengyu, said that there was no other woman.]

278
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,100
but they still got divorced.

279
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,800
Although the process had changed,

280
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,460
the results were the same.

281
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,530
Why was that?

282
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,340
Is the future a thing that can't be changed?

283
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,490
Jialan, what should I do?

284
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,320
No matter how hard I try,

285
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,570
our fate will be the same.

286
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,280
Can't I save Jirong?

287
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,550
Are you going to keep lying here?

288
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,970
Jialan, please,

289
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,040
please wake up.

290
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,740
I want you to tell me

291
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,400
that fate can be changed.

292
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,250
Jialan.

293
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,080
I suspect that

294
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,680
they had a complicated relationship at the beginning.

295
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,440
Maybe

296
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,370
Chen Jialan thought Jiang Shenghao was a player,

297
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,100
and Jiang Shenghao didn't want to be responsible for her,

298
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,700
so they didn't get together.

299
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,240
Then you showed up.

300
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,160
There is one more you in Jiang Shenghao's world.

301
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,880
Chen Jialan suddenly felt that something was wrong.

302
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,450
She thought that Jiang Shenghao's love for her

303
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,410
was divided by you.

304
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,620
She even thought that

305
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,080
the Jiang family's property should be hers.

306
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,200
Everyone is the same.

307
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
People only know what's important

308
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,850
when they lose it.

309
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,860
It's not hard to understand.

310
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,390
Just think about it, and you will understand.

311
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,840
Jirong,

312
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,170
yes,

313
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,310
you and Jiang Shenghao are a couple.

314
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,210
But since you knew each other,

315
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,510
it has only been half a year,

316
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,020
not to mention Chen Jialan.

317
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,960
How many times have you two met?

318
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,600
Speaking of which,

319
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,710
do you really know who they are?

320
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,320
Anwen, can you stop?

321
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,950
Fine, I'll stop.

322
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

323
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,180
One last word.

324
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,180
Are you really confident that

325
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,660
your relationship with Jiang Shenghao for half a year

326
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,940
can defeat their companionship

327
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,270
for more than ten years?

328
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,490
The person in the photo is really He Zhengyu.

329
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,680
He just felt embarrassed to admit

330
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,819
getting back together in the middle of the night.

331
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,420
When you asked him,

332
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,940
he didn't know what happened.

333
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,760
You know him. He's so proud.

334
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,640
I know I have no evidence.

335
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,940
But Jialan is looking for evidence.

336
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,069
I believe the truth will come out soon.

337
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,300
It doesn't matter anymore.

338
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,830
Ji... Jirong.

339
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,510
I just think that

340
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,640
compared to the relationship between you and Chen Jialan,

341
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,300
our relationship

342
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,200
is too fragile.

343
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,560
Jirong,

344
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,520
these are two different things.

345
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,120
They are totally different.

346
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,330
It's different.

347
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,180
You and Chen Jianlan don't need to explain anything,

348
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,500
and you can understand

349
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,090
each other's feelings.

350
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,440
You trust each other.

351
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,370
But between us, it is not the same.

352
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,750
I admit that

353
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,890
this matter shook me.

354
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,780
I suspected you.

355
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,590
But because of this little doubt,

356
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,490
I understood that

357
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
the trust between us is far less than

358
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,500
that between you and Chen Jialan.

359
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,100
Jirong, I don't understand.

360
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,220
Jialan and I only grew up together.

361
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,600
We're just too close.

362
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,260
All these years,

363
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,000
we just treat each other as family.

364
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,150
But you're not family after all.

365
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,090
When Jialan broke up with Zhengyu,

366
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,780
you brought her home

367
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,140
without discussing with me

368
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,870
and told her to stay as long as she wanted.

369
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,180
Besides, she told you to guard against my brother,

370
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,500
so you obeyed,

371
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,300
and guarded against my brother.

372
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
I think she is more important to you than me.

373
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,210
Jirong,

374
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,360
why didn't you tell me at that time

375
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,620
that you are unhappy about these things?

376
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,900
I was not unhappy.

377
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,010
I am talking about this thing.

378
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,060
From the beginning, you trust Chen Jialan all the time.

379
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,020
You never thought that

380
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,810
maybe she is afraid of

381
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,380
losing you, her childhood friend,

382
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,320
so, she did something wrong, and

383
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,100
she lied to you.

384
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
It is impossible.

385
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,740
Jialan won't lie to me.

386
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,810
Why not?

387
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,150
She hasn't found any evidence yet.

388
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,830
Why do you trust her so much?

389
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,610
What did your brother tell you just now?

390
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,060
You still don't understand that

391
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,620
it has nothing to do with what my brother said.

392
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,620
How can it have nothing to do with it?

393
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,870
Your brother is the one who lied.

394
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,460
Jialan and I are just siblings that are not related.

395
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,700
How can you

396
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,980
think of us like that?

397
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,450
Fine, let me ask you.

398
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,680
Between me and your brother, which one do you trust?

399
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,770
Between me and Chen Jialan,

400
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,030
which one do you trust?

401
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,390
Let's calm down first.

402
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,200
I forgot that there was someone here.

403
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,300
Look at you.

404
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,520
Why don't you sleep in the middle of the night?

405
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,370
I can't sleep.

406
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,470
When I close my eyes, those comments online arise in my mind.

407
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,050
My head spins immediately.

408
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,440
[He Zhengyu]

409
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,660
Why did you give me your business card?

410
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
If you need a lawyer to get involved,

411
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,820
I can collect malicious comments

412
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,400
online to obtain evidence right now

413
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
so that you can sue them anytime.

414
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,050
As for how much compensation you want,

415
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,240
tell me the amount.

416
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,490
However, correspondingly,

417
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,380
my lawyer fee is also very high.

418
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,540
Do you want a cheap one?

419
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,230
No problem.

420
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,180
I can recommend my assistant, Zhou Dajun,

421
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,870
to you.

422
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,930
But in terms of professional ability,

423
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,970
there is a big gap between us.

424
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,790
I can not assure you of winning.

425
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,680
But if I were you,

426
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,350
I wouldn't spend the legal fee,

427
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,800
and I wouldn't let those people

428
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,240
affect my normal life.

429
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,050
Because when the truth comes out three days later,

430
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,320
someone will help you cry out against justice.

431
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,920
And when you look carefully.

432
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,680
you will find that the people who helped you

433
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,280
are the ones who scolded you.

434
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,090
You're good at comforting people.

435
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,150
I'm not comforting you.

436
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,890
I'm just telling the truth.

437
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,610
Anyway, thank you.

438
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,080
Although I won't help you in the lawsuit,

439
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,890
I can help you with something.

440
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,800
What are you going to do?

441
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,230
Good people do it to the end.

442
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,260
You sleep on the bed, and I sleep on the sofa.

443
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,660
It's good for your sleep.

444
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,620
But you don't like others

445
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,220
sleeping in your bed, right?

446
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,090
Yes.

447
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,430
So I might regret it in three seconds.

448
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,130
Three,

449
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,860
two...

450
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,340
Thank you.

451
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,050
One.

452
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,440
Ms. Chen, I asked you out today because I want to tell you that

453
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,020
there is something that you can't do,

454
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,140
and you will die

455
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,020
if you earn some money.

456
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,910
What do you mean?

457
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,350
You know the answer.

458
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,120
Wu Anwen.

459
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,090
What do you mean?

460
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,120
I know your relationship with Wu Anwen is fake.

461
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,050
You were acting.

462
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,990
I want you to tell the truth.

463
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,080
The truth?

464
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,110
What truth?

465
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,030
Wu Anwen is using you

466
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,820
to frame Jiang Shenghao and let others believe that he has another woman.

467
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,460
Mr. He, you have started to make wild assumptions.

468
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,600
Who told you that?

469
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,150
Chen Jialan?

470
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,190
I came to you because I have evidence.

471
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,710
If you don't want to go to court

472
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,010
with Wu Anwen,

473
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,230
you should stop now

474
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,210
and distance yourself from him.

475
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,440
What evidence?

476
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,710
The photo you used to frame Jiang Shenghao.

477
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,240
Do you remember this photo?

478
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:57,860
Chen Jialan.

479
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,550
Hurry up.

480
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,620
Ms. Chen,

481
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,760
in terms of the relationship among

482
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,010
you, Wu Jirong, and Jiang Shenghao,

483
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,360
do you have anything to say?

484
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,210
You are fans of Wu Jirong.

485
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,580
Are you more willing to believe that

486
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,010
Wu Jirong's husband cheated on her

487
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,740
than to believe it's a misunderstanding?

488
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,440
Misunderstanding?

489
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,570
You said you wanted to protect Jirong.

490
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,870
But you are the ones

491
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,920
who spread Jiang Shenghao's rumors online.

492
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,520
You besiege me here every day

493
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,180
and shout to uphold justice for Jirong.

494
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,750
But who would really calm down

495
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,910
and listen to me telling the truth?

496
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,910
If you have time to denounce me here,

497
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,330
you'd better go back and think about

498
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,140
how you were manipulated

499
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,490
to hurt innocent people on hearsay evidence.

500
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,490
The Internet is not a lawless place.

501
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,900
Internet violence is not a method

502
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,360
to uphold justice for you.

503
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,580
And you.

504
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,300
You spread rumors without permission.

505
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,930
You exaggerated details

506
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,460
and made sensational headlines

507
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,180
just for the poor views.

508
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,090
You incited netizens and people who didn't know the truth.

509

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,780
The husband of famous artist Wu Jirong,

515
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,690
Jiang Shenghao, cheated on his wife with his childhood friend.

516
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,450
This topic has drawn a lot of attention.

517
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,780
The party involved, Chen Jialan,

518
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,260
suffers cyber violence.

519
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,740
Since the "MOP Tongxu" incident in 2006,

520
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,520
there has been much cyber violence.

521
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,120
It seems to be getting worse.

522
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,100
Although the ending of the incident is reversed...

523
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,500
Actually, I've always wanted to know that

524
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,940
before the fans of Jirong

525
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,740
and those who scolded me online

526
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,070
denounced me,

527
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,840
had they had prejudgments?

528
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,930
They made such a big fuss

529
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,770
just with a blurry photo.

530
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,360
Do they have some other purposes?

531
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,240
What you want to know

532
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,830
is the same as

533
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,060
what those who have experienced cyber violence thought.

534
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,180
But for this topic,

535
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,900
to this point is far from enough.

536
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,740
We need to find out

537
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,860
what the people who besieged you really want.

538
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,110
This is the real value

539
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,620
and the point that can arouse the discussion.

540
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,810
Actually, I think what fans want most

541
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,470
is to protect their idols.

542
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,970
That's right.

543
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,060
I approve of it.

544
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,050
But I don't know since when

545
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,140
they need their idols to be perfect

546
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,280
and live in a vacuum.

547
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,660
So when something tiny

548
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,920
occurs to their idols,

549
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,930
the fans will immediately besiege the trouble.

550
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,410
At that time, for them,

551
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,610
the truth doesn't matter anymore.

552
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,880
They share the same enemy and keep each other warm.

553
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,650
It gives them a sense of belonging.

554
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,380
At the same time, they have no scruples

555

stalk and threaten the victims.

They started in the name of love,

but in the end,

559
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,300

♫Maybe there is something special♫

680
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,370
I wish you happiness every day.

681
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,330
Wish you happiness every day.

682
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,020
♫Between us♫

683
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,190

♫Just be brave and come a little closer♫

685
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,530
Cheers.

686
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,370
I didn't see anything tonight.

687
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,910
♫All for love. When I come across you♫

688
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,800
What about you?

689
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,520
I've never been here.

690
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,640
♫Just for love. I am waiting for you♫

691
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,230
♫Go for love♫

692
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,440
Hello?

693
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,870
Hello, Ms. Chen.

694
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,930
We're from the Zero Distance in Fuxing.

695
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,790
We would like to invite you

696
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,960
to attend the live stream online about cyber violence

697
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,280
as the person involved

698
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,070
in cyber violence tonight.

699
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Here's the thing.

700
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,140
The special topic iNEWS chose

701
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,230
was well received.

702
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,980
We want to follow iNEWS

703
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,370
to extend the topic.

704
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,420
OK.

705
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,420
Test the microphone. Test the microphone.

706
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,980
Director, is the microphone OK?

707
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,630
OK. OK.

708
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,520
Can you test the microphone?

709
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,300
Hello. Hello.

710
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,300
Okay, no problem.

711
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,340
Ready?

712
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,580
Five, four, three, two, one.

713
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,580
Go.

714
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,970
Good evening, everyone.

715
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,530
Welcome to this episode.

716
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,530
Today, we're honored to have

717
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,070
Ms. Chen Jialan, a reporter from iNEWS,

718
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,900
who has been popular recently.

719
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,470
Welcome.

720
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,800
Hello, I'm Chen Jialan.

721
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,500
The theme of this show

722
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,460
is cyber violence.

723
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,500
We all know that cyber violence is getting more,

724
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,820
and the influence is getting bigger.

725
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,300
For example,

726
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,060
"MOP Tongxu" incident in 2006

727
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,179
marked the beginning of cyber violence.

728
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,489
It was also cyber violence caused by cheating in marriage.

729
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,889
Then, it was discussed by the global media.

730
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,100
Tongxu also became

731
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,460
one of Baidu's 10 major news figures that year.

732
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,580
Ms. Chen

733
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,219
is also experiencing this kind of thing.

734
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,100
And as far as I know,

735
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,840
it's not the first time you've experienced cyber violence,

736
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,239
right?

737
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:28,850
Yes.

738
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,460
Ms. Chen,

739
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,239
you are also a reporter.

740
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,010
We all want to know that

741
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,210
when you become a person who experiences it,

742
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,679
from an objective reporter,

743
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,280
what do you think about that?

744
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,400
Whether I'm an objective reporter

745
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,620
or a person who experiences cyber violence,

746
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,420
I firmly resist cyber violence.

747
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,449
After this incident,

748
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,860
I suggest all

749
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,719
who have suffered cyber violence

750
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,330
protect themselves with the law.

751
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,300
In the Internet era,

752
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,490
our social formation has changed.

753
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,760
The judgment of personal harm

754
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,720
has changed too.

755
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,620
I believe, in the future,

756
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,470
the mental damage

757
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
will be equally important to

758
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
the physical damage.

759
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,720
We can't tolerate

760
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,190
the malignity and sniping from keyboard warriors.

761
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,500
You're indeed a reporter.

762
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,770
You have an independent view on the case.

763
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,660
About what you have experienced,

764
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,340
the netizens have some questions.

765
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,800
Please look at this photo.

766
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,860
You said the man behind the curtain

767
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,990
was your boyfriend.

768
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,680
But many netizens think this is Jiang Shenghao.

769
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,380
The people in the photo are

770
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,140
me and my boyfriend, He Zhengyu.

771
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,400
He is also Jiang Shenghao's good friend.

772
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,380
I see.

773
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,100
Let's take a look at

774
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,160
another photo, OK?

775
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,700
Look.

776
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,260
This is Jiang Shenghao.

777
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,580
We grew up together.

778
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,020
When I moved out of his house that day,

779
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,880
he sent me home.

780
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,400
This is just a farewell between friends.

781
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,220
Yes, that's right.

782
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,020
It's normal to hug

783
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,060
friends to show friendship.

784
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,740
But

785
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,460
the netizens sent us two photos privately.

786
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,940
And they have some doubts

787
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,070
about those photos.

788
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,070
Let's take a look.

789
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,940
This photo was taken when a netizen

790
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,940
met you and your boyfriend by chance.

791
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,020
We can tell that the difference in height

792
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,090
between you two.

793
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,710
But the kissing photo behind the curtains

794
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,860
show that the two are the same height.

795
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,870
Your hugging photo

796
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,680
with Jiang Shenghao shows that you are the same height.

797
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,930
What do you think about this?

798
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,300
Wu Anwen has sharp eyes.

799
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,610
He found the height.

800
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,290
Otherwise, we'll be fooled by her.

801
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,410
So you came prepared.

802
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,420
No.

803
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,380
We're just looking for the truth.

804
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,060
There are two videos at the same time.

805
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,390
Let's watch them again.

806
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,060
Jialan,

807
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,010
are you okay?

808
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,330
Mu Shiming said that you didn't go to work.

809
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,380
Are you sick?

810
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,070
Anwen, why are you in my room?

811
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,420
Is this your room?

812
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,990
I sent Shenghao back.

813
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,550
Jirong asked me to take a photo of him.

814
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,600
Chen Jialan, why are you so stupid?

815
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,050
How could you fall into such a trap?

816
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,930
I can't explain it to Jirong now.

817
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,940
Wait, Ms Chen.

818
00:37:59,370 --> 00:37:59,900
Ms Chen,

819
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,240
we haven't finished yet.

820
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,370
Why are you leaving?

821
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,870
You are guiding maliciously.

822
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,220
I have the right to refuse to answer.

823
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,980
You misunderstood us.

824
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
We just want to find more truth

825
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,380
so that we can discuss

826
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,710
cyber violence better.

827
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,950
The person involved has refused to shoot.

828
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,950
If you continue to shoot,

829
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,480
you'll invade her privacy.

830
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,860
Jialan, take off the microphone.

831
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,390
Let's go.

832
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,690
Wait.

833
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:23,860
Don't go.

834
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,810
He Zhengyu,

835
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,500
if we explain to them now,

836
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,150
they'll get what they want.

837
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,170
I've got the surveillance footage.

838
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,360
These three videos can prove that

839
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,650
I was the one who came to Jiang Shenghao's house with my lunch box

840
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,180
and brought Ms. Chen Jialan dinner with love.

841
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,360
When no one answered after I knocked on the door,

842
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,680
as the video showed,

843
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,930
I climbed the wall, went into Jiang Shenghao's house,

844
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,450
and went to the second floor.

845
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,340
Now we have witnesses and evidence.

846
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,600
The people in the photo

847
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,090
were me and Ms. Chen Jialan.

848
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,980
Really?

849
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,820
But...

850
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,280
I know what you want to ask.

851
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,970
Where was I in the second video?

852
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,950
After all, I went to someone else's house

853
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,440
to find my girlfriend.

854
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,940
I didn't want others to know.

855
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,930
So I hid.

856
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,960
As for my height...

857
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,660
Jialan,

858
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,510
stand up.

859
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,900
Please shake the camera from our feet.

860
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,890
Is it clear now?

861
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,980
Have a seat.

862
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,670
It was just a misunderstanding originally.

863
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,400
We can explain it in a few words.

864
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,340
But why did it

865
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,850
turn to this?

866
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,240
From a series of stalking and secretly filming,

867
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,170
gradually formed cyber violence,

868
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,320
to today, regardless of the truth,

869
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,660
guiding the public opinion with live stream,

870
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,720
what's the reason?

871
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,760
Someone is behind all of these.

872
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,970
I have a recording here.

873
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,170
Please listen to it.

874
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,570
I'm Jiang Shenghao's ex-girlfriend.

875
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,880
A few days ago, Wu Jirong's brother,

876
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,730
Wu Anwen came to cooperate with me.

877
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,220
He wanted to use my identity of Jiang Shenghao's ex

878
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,880
to frame Jiang Shenghao and say that he cheated.

879
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,890
Then Jiang Shenghao would compensate Wu Jirong

880
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,350
with a lot of money according to

881
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,280
the marriage agreement he signed.

882
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,860
At the same time, after Wu Jirong was betrayed by her husband,

883
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,210
she would return to her work.

884
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,390
But I've given up on Jiang Shenghao.

885
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,540
I didn’t do as Wu Anwen said.

886
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,250
But when I found out that Wu Anwen used another way

887
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,420
to frame Jiang Shenghao and Ms Chen,

888
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,300
I was very angry and guilty.

889
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,260
So I decided to stand up.

890
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,820
I believe

891
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,780
now you should know

892
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,680
what the truth is.

893
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,340
We were all manipulated

894
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,010
by a man named Wu Anwen.

895
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,160
From now on,

896
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,720
I'm Chen Jialan's lawyer.

897
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,440
On behalf of my client,

898
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,520
I will send you a lawyer's letter.

899
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:06,310
Then I'll sue you for stalking,

900
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,100
photographing, slandering

901
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,500
and even taking money from relevant people

902
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,060
to frame my client.

903
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,320
He Zhengyu,

904
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,950
thank you for helping me in time today.

905
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,460
How did you get the footage?

906
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,350
The neighbor hasn't come back.

907
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,680
He hasn't come back.

908
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,740
I contacted the housekeeper of their property management

909
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,050
and asked for help after I talked to the owner.

910
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,050
The owner is good.

911
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,680
He agreed after checking the situation,

912
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,460
so I got the footage.

913
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,150
Anyway,

914
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,700
thank you so much for changing the situation.

915
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,230
Besides,

916
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,820
I also want to thank Mr. Mu.

917
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,600
The crew has apologized to me.

918
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,470
I accepted it,

919
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,890
and made up with them.

920
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,660
Thank you.

921
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,580
I didn't do anything.

922
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,510
I'll go then.

923
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:54,920
Bye.

924
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,890
My car is parked there. Let me give you a ride.

925
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:01,460
I...

926
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,160
Hello.

927
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,010
He Zhengyu, He Zhengyu, come here.

928
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,740
Wu Anwen comes to me. Come here.

929
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,030
I'll be right there.

930
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,640
Where do you want to go?

931
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,500
I don't want to go anywhere.

932
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,690
You ruined everything.

933
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,290
Do you still want to run away?

934
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:37,770
Open the door!

935
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,700
Open the door!

936
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,890
Wu Anwen.

937
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,050
Do you know what you are doing?

938
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,340
Zhengyu.

939
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,100
Why?

940
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,020
Why are you watching me?

941
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,400
You're my brother.

942
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,600
Do you have to do this?

943
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:03,980
What are you doing?

944
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,720
I will kill her.

945
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,420
Wu Anwen,

946
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,650
if this goes on,

947
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,310
Jirong will have no family.

948
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,650
Go and see her.

949
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,270
Go. I'll keep an eye on him.

950
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,610
You like Zhengyu, don't you?

951
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,540
Zhengyu must like you too.

952
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,010
I've never seen him

953
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,740
care about any girls

954
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,340
in the way he cares about you.

955
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,250
Jiang Shenghao.

956
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,300
Zhengyu ruined my life.

957
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,790
I'm going to destroy his too.

958
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,880
[Sweet ON]

959
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:26,880
[Love in Time]

00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,090
[OK. I will try it.]

00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,600
I entered. That was not right.

00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,590
Don't cry.

970
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,450
OK.

971
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,670
It looks bad.

972
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,570
You said that what I took looked bad,

973
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,600

You are so annoying.

Do it again.
