35

I have a question.

36
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,340
Why do you want to divorce your wife?

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,920
Women

38
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,820
are petty.

You are all men.

Why not?

You lawyers

53
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,790
take money from people and do things for them.

54

Excuse me.

58
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,770
I just want to explain

59
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,830
why I won't take it.

60
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,740
First,

61
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,580
leaving without money is not valid.

62
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,940
And I have to correct you.

63
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,470
Women's labor in family should be respected.

64
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,880
It also generates social labor value.

65
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,490
According to the market,

66
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,960
she may earn more than you.

67
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,140
That's one of the reasons.

68
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,600
Second,

69
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,070
you work in the society.

70
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,300
After divorce, you continue to enjoy social status,

71
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,600
resources and connections.

72
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,580
But your wife

73
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,760
have to face the difficulties of returning to society.

74
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,180
I'll keep hiring you.

75
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,440
Tell me.

76
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,560
You can charge by hour or second.

77
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,540
Being a lawyer for so many years,

78
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,050
I have seen many hypocrites.

79
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,960
But I've never seen

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,630
an honest villain like you.

81
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,860
You swear too?

82
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,340
Mr. Wu, you misunderstood.

83
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,110
Mr. He is praising you.

84
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,530
You had an affair righteously,

85
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,440
asked for a divorce frankly

86
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,810
and didn't want the children squarely.

87
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,720
Look at you.

88
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,570
You're really a smart businessman.

89
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,990
We can also say that you are not a human.

90
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,409
You little brats.

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,710
Don't talk nonsense with me

92
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,540
just because you're educated

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,840
and know a few words.

94
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,580
Listen.

95
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,850
Without my respect for the law,

96
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,450
people like you will starve to death.

97
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,890
Mr. Wu,

98
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
I'll give you a suggestion for free.

99
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,200
For your wife and children,

100
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,020
you should pay compensation

101
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,590
and alimony as asked of you.

102
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,380
The money saved

103
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,130
should be used to take a look at your brain.

104
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,930
Kill three birds with one stone.

105
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,560
I was wrong, okay?

106
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
It's said that money make people kind.

107
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,860
It's not populated yet.

108
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,560
In the future, ask thoroughly first before meeting.

109
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,310
This kind of person is a waste of time.

110
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,670
You're very humane now.

111
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,240
Because of Chen Jialan...

112
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:49,610

Do I have to tell you?

119
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,290
You're right.

120
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,990
If you're looking for Chen Kexin,

121
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,910
she's not here.

122
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,060
You came here in vain.

123
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,580
Sun Defeng is also looking for Chen Kexin.

124
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,470
She must know something.

125
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,620
Otherwise, Sun Defeng wouldn't have come to her.

126
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,660
If she's just the third one

127
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,790
between Wu Jirong and Jiang Shenghao,

128
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,290
there's no need to disappear.

129
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,150
Chen Kexin must know some secret,

130
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,260
or she's hiding because she's threatened.

131
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,340
We have to find her as soon as possible.

132
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,670
We have to find her before Sun Defeng does.

You're so patient.

136
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,659
Have you received the messages I sent you?

137
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,210
Yes.

138
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,510
But I won't accept your interview.

139
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,460
Mr. He,

140
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,220
you said yourself.

141
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,580
I'm very patient.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,310
It's okay if you don't agree now.

143
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,910
I have plenty of time to wait.

144
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,190
Then wait until Friday.

145
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,390
I will not only accept your interview,

146
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,850
I will also announce the result

147
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,810
to all the media.

148
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,260
- No. -Mr. He.

149
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,020
Do you remember me?

150
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,140
I'm Chen Kexin.

151
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,360
We met at Jiang Shenghao's wedding.

152
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
I don't remember.

153
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,290
I just want to ask you for a favor.

154
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,060
Someone has been harassing me.

155
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,730
I want you to send a lawyer's letter

156
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,620
to warn him.

157
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,090
I'm too scared to sleep at night.

158
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,490
Ms. Chen,

159
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,010
Firstly, any registered law firm

160
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,260
can send a lawyer's letter.

161
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,480
You don't have to come to me.

162
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,080
Secondly,

163
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,809
if you are really harassed,

164
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,600
I suggest you call the police.

165
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,570
Mr. He.

166
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,770
Chen Jialan.

167
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,320
If you had given me Mr. He's WeChat,

168
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,450
I wouldn't have been like this.

169
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,020
No.

170
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,520
Why should I give it to you?

171
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,720
I don't know you well.

172
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,470
Do you also like Mr. He?

173
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,410
So you didn't give me his WeChat on purpose.

174
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,340
And you came to stalk him yourself.

175
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,740
I'm just doing my job.

176
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,100
Do you think everyone is like you,

177
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,090
a stalker?

178
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,240
What do you know?

179
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,980
A rich and handsome single man like him

180
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,810
is a rare quality resource.

181
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,610
Of course I have to be quick and accurate.

182
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,280
Fine.

183
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,460
Since you've moved on,

184
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,100
don't go to Jiang Shenghao anymore.

185
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,530
OK.

186
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,940
As long as Mr. He and I can make it,

187
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,820
I won't care about any of them.

188
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,900
But if Mr. He and I don't make it,

189
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,590
I can only go for plan B

190
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,970
and go back to Jiang Shenghao.

191
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,050
No... Chen Kexin.

192
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,130
Ms. Chen, think about it.

193
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,300
WeChat.

194
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,200
Chen Kexin, where are you hiding?

195
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,130
The latest update

196
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,690
was half a month ago.

197
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,980
Is he really interested in

198
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,920
Chen Kexin?

199
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,470
You scared me, Chen Jialan.

200
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,460
Why are you sneaking around?

201
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,770
I think you are the sneaky one.

202
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,220
You can't focus on anything when you see a beauty.

203
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,950
What beauty?

204
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,240
Chen Kexin.

205
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,510
You know her too?

206
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,970
You've been staring for so long.

207
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,700
Is it personal or for business?

208
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,830
Are you seeking personal gain in business affairs?

209
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

210
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,220
Chen Jialan.

211
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,210
Are you pretending to be a ghost today?

212
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,530
Why are you following me?

213
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,990
Don't change the subject.

214
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,120
I know your memory has changed.

215
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,760
You also know

216
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,560
Chen Kexin came to see you today.

217
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,550
I know.

218
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,130
Can't you see that she likes you?

219
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,180
Why?

220
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,330
Is she your type?

221
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,330
Why are you staring at me like that?

222
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,700
Chen Jialan,

223
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,250
are you jealous?

224
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,930
Because I said yesterday that

225
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,620
you're not my type.

226
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,840
Don't flatter yourself.

227
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,300
It's because of Chen Kexin.

228
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,330
She asked me for your WeChat all day.

229
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,230
So annoying.

230
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,340
She asked me to ask about your feelings.

231
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,270
You have to give her a clear answer.

232
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,790
Ignore her.

233
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,660
You don't need to answer her.

234
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,550
Wait.

235
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,860
What's wrong?

236
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,950
This might be a new chance.

237
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:03,890
Chance?

238
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,870
What chance?

239
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,700
A chance to save Jirong.

240
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,130
Think about Jirong’s death.

241
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,670
The main reason

242
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,400
is her broken marriage.

243
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,000
And the cause of the broken marriage

244
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,950
is Chen Kexin.

245
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,110
If we get rid of Chen Kexin

246
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,190
from the root,

247
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,240
she won't have to bother Shenghao.

248
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,700
Then the marriage between Shenghao and Jirong

249
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,710
will not break.

250
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,420
Jirong wouldn't have died.

251
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,400
What do you want to say?

252
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,080
What I want to say is

253
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,040
since Kexin Chen was interested in

254
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,640
the you from four months ago,

255
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,930
let's help them.

256
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,510
She then has a new target,

257
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,960
so she won't pester Shenghao anymore.

258
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,110
Then we can get rid of Chen Kexin

259
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,400
from the root.

260
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,570
What do you think?

261
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,590
Chen Jialan,

262
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,380
Is this a method from

263
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,580
a normal human brain?

264
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,740
We're talking business.

265
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,260
Why did you attack me?

266
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,780
Didn't I discuss with you?

267
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,920
I disagree.

268
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,530
Don't reject me so soon.

269
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,350
I can only communicate with you directly.

270
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,340
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll misunderstand.

271
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,460
Let me tell you clearly now.

272
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,180
I disagree.

273
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,850
Do you have a better idea?

274
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,900
What do you mean?

275
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,750
In 2022,

276
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,900
you couldn't find Chen Kexin.

277
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,560
You don't know what happened.

278
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,760
But in 2021,

279
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,830
I could see her,

280
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
but I can't do anything.

281
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm worried too.

282
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
We agreed to save Jirong together.

283
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,920
We should face the enemy together.

284
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,380
We should try everything.

285
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,470
What do you mean?

286
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,180
I'm the one sacrificing.

287
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,180
No.

288
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,050
This concerns Jirong’s life.

289
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,260
Do you think I'm so idle

290
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,660
to be God of Matchmaking?

291
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,650
Do you think this method will work?

292
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,570
How will you know if you don't try?

293
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,640
Fine.

294
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,980
Okay.

295
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,820
No.

296
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,580
It's useless if only I agree.

297
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,540
He can't do it.

298
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,930
From what I know,

299
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,240
he won't like someone like Kexin.

300
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,230
What kind of girl does he like?

301
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,200
Do you really want to know?

302
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,280
I sent you the location of the interview.

303
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,410
Okay, see you later.

304
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,420
Thank you for the interview.

305
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,660
Mu Shiming told me everything.

306
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,240
In view of the case of Lanyou Technology,

307
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,020
iNEWS intends to do an exclusive interview on

308
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,860
intellectual property rights.

309
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,020
Since you've interviewed Fan Ke,

310
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,810
you can't just listen to the family.

311
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,060
So I was entrusted by Lanyou Technology

312
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,160
to state their position.

313
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,180
So it's Mr. Mu who is helping me.

314
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,360
Ask me whatever you want.

315
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,960
First,

316
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,390
Lanyou Technology insists that Fan Ke has infringed.

317
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,120
Is there conclusive evidence?

318
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,260
The current evidence

319
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,310
can only be shown during the trial.

320
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,100
But I can tell you clearly.

321
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,070
Lanyou Technology is very confident

322
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,000
about this case.

323
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,620
It is understood that this project

324
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,750
has been developed by Fan Ke for years.

325
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,980
And Lanyou Technology,

326
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,640
as a powerful sponsor,

327
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,860
after using Fan Ke's research results

328
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,720
to make profit,

329
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,040
they sued the R&D for infringement.

330
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,870
Isn't that unfair?

331
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,660
As the core researcher

332
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,810
of this technology,

333
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,090
his credit is an established fact.

334
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,320
But at the same time,

335
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,410
Fan Ke is an ex-employee of Lanyou Technology.

336
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,580
He developed this patent for his job.

337
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,020
And it was completed

338
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,700
with the help of Lanyou Technology.

339
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,160
So the patent of this technology

340
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,890
belongs to Lanyou Technology.

341
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,300
After Fan Ke resigned,

342
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,930
although it's past the prohibition period,

343
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,350
he can't use

344
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,180
the relevant data of this technology.

345
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,180
So the request of Lanyou Technology

346
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,100
is reasonable and legal.

347
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,710
But as far as I know,

348
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,610
the product developed by Fan Ke's start-up

349
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,450
is similar to the product developed by Lanyou Technology,

350
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,580
but his core technology is different.

351
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,710
Unless you have evidence that

352
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,020
Fan Ke's new product

353
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,020
has been used

354
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,860
in Lanyou Technology before,

355
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,150
otherwise, Fan Ke just developed

356
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,380
the same type of products.

357
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,740
You can't accuse any employee who leaves the company

358
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,070
and then develops the same type of product of infringement.

359
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,660
Are you really not going to order anything?

360
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,730
It's too expensive here.

361
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,860
Our company meal allowance is capped.

362
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
It's okay. You order. It's my treat.

363
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:40,940
No need.

364
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Let's continue with the interview.

365
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,870
Mr. He.

366
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,310
Good afternoon.

367
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,840
How did you know I was here?

368
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,630
I don't know.

369
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,340
I just like

370
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,280
to drink here.

371
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,760
Since we are destined to meet,

372
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,900
let's share a table.

373
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,120
Thank you.

374
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,230
A bottle of champagne, please.

375
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,960
Please wait.

376
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,900
Let's talk about the interview later.

377
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,750
I don't like to be disturbed

378
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,829
when I'm working.

379
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,650
Ms. Chen.

380
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,180
I don't know how

381
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,099
I give you the impression that

382
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,089
made you think that there's a possibility between us.

383
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,440
Now I will tell you clearly

384
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,900
I have no feelings for you.

385
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,380
So I hope

386
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,859
you will not appear in front of me again

387
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,940
to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

388
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,470
Waitress, the bill please.

389
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,750
Sir, this way please.

390
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,680
Have you ever seen someone so unreasonable?

391
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,430
Isn't he always like this?

392
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,240
He's cold-blooded and arrogant.

393
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
I don't know what you like about him.

394
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Handsome.

395
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,450
What's the use of being handsome?

396
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,320
The most important thing in a relationship is whether this man

397
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,870
respects you, cares about you,

398
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,890
or understands you.

399
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,140
Do good looks help?

400
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,750
According to you,

401
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,310
the only one who meets these

402
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,190
is Jiang Shenghao.

403
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,290
When I was with him,

404
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,240
he always indulged me.

405
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,590
He always made me happy.

406
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,650
He didn't even say a harsh word to me.

407
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,730
I was happy when I was with him.

408
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,990
I think He Zhengyu is good.

409
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,190
Really?

410
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,880
For example...

411
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,480
Handsome.

412
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,840
That's what I told you.

413
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,340
He is calm and steady when things go wrong.

414
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,870
He speaks clearly and logically.

415
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,250
And he is a gentleman, right?

416
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,230
Most importantly,

417
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,260
he doesn't get close to women.

418
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,180
Isn't this

419
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,390
what girls like the most?

420
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,590
The last one

421
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,900
made me helpless.

422
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,540
He's opposite to Shenghao.

423
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,920
Come to think of it,

424
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,790
Jiang Shenghao is the best.

425
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,330
No.

426
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,340
A true man never backtracks.

427
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,080
We are modern women now.

428
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,510
Why should you give up

429
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,870
after a little setback?

430
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,310
How about this?

431
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,470
I'll help you chase him.

432
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,380
I can help you get He Zhengyu.

433
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,240
For real?

434
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,840
I'll try my best.

435
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,710
But you must promise me

436
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,660
you will never go to Jiang Shenghao again.

437
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,800
Don't worry.

438
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,310
As long as I can get He Zhengyu,

439
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,570
I won't care about Jiang Shenghao at all.

440
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,740
Excuse me.

441
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,630
Where is the dressing room?

442
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,650
This way, please.

443
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,470
Laugh if you want. Don't hold it back.

444
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
I'm not laughing.

445
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,620
I just want to tell you

446
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,990
before you do something next time,

447
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,190
think about it first.

448
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,330
Not everything can be taken for granted.

449
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,380
I told you

450
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,800
this is not a good idea.

451
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,900
You didn't come up with a good idea.

452
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,350
I have to be flexible.

453
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,940
I didn't say no.

454
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,590
But this method failed.

455
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,860
How dare you say that?

456
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,410
No.

457
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,840
Why are you so annoying?

458
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,170
I just want to ask

459
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,020
how to chase someone like you.

460
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,770
There's only one way.

461
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,310
What is it?

462
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,550
Dream on.

463
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,120
He Zhengyu, I'm serious.

464
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,620
Kexin said today

465
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,930
if she can't be with you,

466
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,370
she'll go back to Jiang Shenghao.

467
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,700
What do you want me to do?

468
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,980
I can only update

469
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,780
the memory of He Zhengyu in 2021.

470
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,840
I can't

471
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,290
let him

472
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,310
update my memory.

473
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,360
But you have me.

474
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,060
You just need to tell me

475
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,300
your preferences.

476
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,450
Then I'll tell Chen Kexin,

477
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,660
so she can please He Zhengyu from four months ago.

478
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,520
Simple as that.

479
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,940
Chen Jialan,

480
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,020
the most important things between a man and a woman are feelings,

481
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,660
chemistry and hormone.

482
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,330
What you said is more suitable for a blind date.

483
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,410
I'm not asking you to date her.

484
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,100
I need Kexin to focus on

485
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
the He Zhengyu from four months ago.

486
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,350
When we save Jirong,

487
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,230
everything will go back on track.

488
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,620
Are there any other ways?

489
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,790
What do you want to know?

490
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,130
Have a seat.

491
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,600
Let's start with the most basic.

492
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,740
There are 3,000 questions in total.

493
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,320
3,000?

494
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,740
Don't worry. I've reduced it to 300.

495
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,570
No, no, no.

496
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,770
These questions can only be used to calculate a probability.

497
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,030
They can't help to know someone's heart.

498
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,010
Just ask whatever you want.

499
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,530
Fine.

500
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,980
I'll ask you something simple.

501
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,730
What's your favorite food?

502
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,140
Nothing particular.

503
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,930
As long as it is clean.

504
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,110
What about you?

505
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,450
What?

506
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,260
We're roommates after all.

507
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,300
Let's get to know each other better.

508
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,160
I want information equivalence.

509
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,510
Sweet things.

510
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,650
What's your favorite color?

511
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,530
Don't you like Liuzhou river snails rice noodles?

512
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,510
I'm asking you a question.

513
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,110
What's your favorite color?

514
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,610
Blue.

515
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,960
What about you?

516
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,570
Liuzhou river snails rice noodles.

517
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,440
Right.

518
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,430
Pink. Pink.

519
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,660
What type of girl do you like?

520
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,160
Long hair or short hair?

521
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,540
Long hair.

522
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,350
Are you single?

523
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,640
Do you prefer tall or short girls?

524
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,720
I don't like short ones.

525
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,230
After all, I'm tall.

526
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,490
I suggest you call the police directly.

527
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,410
Mr. He.

528
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,310
She doesn't need to be too tall.

529
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,380
1.68 meters should be fine.

530
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,560
So accurate.

531
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,020
Well,

532
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,830
what kind of character do you like?

533
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,810
A girl of character.

534
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,460
A bit of temper is fine.

535
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,600
At ordinary times she can be in a daze,

536
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,100
but she must be serious when she does things.

537
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,390
Do you like heavy makeup or light makeup?

538
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,940
Natural ones.

539
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,040
I don't like heavy makeup.

540
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,020
Mr. He.

541
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,510
Good afternoon.

542
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,680
Luckily, that doesn't sound like Chen Kexin at all.

543
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,250
No, it's none of my business

544
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,380
if he likes Chen Kexin or not.

545
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,440
All right, that's all.

546
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:54,930
That's it?

547
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,220
These are the fundamental questions.

548
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,030
I know now.

549
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,330
Give me your schedule of

550
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,290
four months ago.

551
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,920
He Zhengyu got off work early today.

552
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,880
At 5:45 p.m.,

553
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,460
he will be downstairs from his house.

554
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,900
What a coincidence, Mr. He.

555
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,820
Do you live here too?

556
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,220
My friend lives here too.

557
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,460
Every day at 1:30 pm,

558
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,660
He Zhengyu will go to the coffee shop

559
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,580
on the basement floor of the shopping mall opposite the law firm.

560
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,110
Mr. He, what a coincidence.

561
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,470
He Zhengyu will go shopping in the mall

562
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,780
on Huaihai Road this afternoon.

563
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,340
Mr. He, what a coincidence.

564
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,350
Ms. Chen,

565
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,790
it's impossible between us.

566
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,410
Please don't waste your time.

567
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,140
I don't think I'm wasting time.

568
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,880
I'm talking about my time.

569
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,000
Madam, please stay.

570
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,950
Not now.

571
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,570
Well.

572
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,110
Please wait a moment.

573
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,090
I'll go in and report.

574
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,330
Please wait a moment.

575
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,450
Mr. He.

576
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,800
A woman wants to see you.

577
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,860
Mr. He,

578
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,680
I just want to treat you to a meal.

579
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,930
Thank you for helping me out

580
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,850
at the wedding.

581
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,910
I couldn't stop her.

582
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,580
Who told you about my schedule?

583
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,990
What do you mean?

584
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,350
Ms. Chen,

585
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,400
I've kept the evidence of

586
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,220
what you've done these days.

587
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,920
I'm telling you one last time.

588
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,700
Please don't appear in front of me again.

589
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,430
or I'll sue you for harassment.

590
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,540
Why are you yelling so loudly?

591
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,330
What's wrong with having feelings for you?

592
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,370
What's wrong with having feelings for him?

593
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,140
If your feelings bother me,

594
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
it's harassment.

595
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,580
You're the only one

596
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,570
who knows all my schedule.

597
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,500
How did she know?

598
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,890
I swear to God.

599
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,460
I met her for the first time three minutes ago.

600
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,340
It's not his fault.

601
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,860
If you don't want to see me, I'll leave.

602
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,980
By the way, Mr. He,

603
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
don't blame Chen Jialan.

604
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,260
She meant well.

605
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,760
Bye.

606
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,770
Chen Jialan?

607
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,360
No wonder

608
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,120
they showed up at the same time.

609
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,640
Is she the one who leaked my schedule?

610
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,680
He Zhengyu.

611
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,540
Deal with personal matters in private.

612
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,200
Is it appropriate to let her come to the law firm?

613
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,350
It's getting worse.

614
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,590
Nana.

615
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,780
Who's looking for me?

616
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,180
-It's her. -Chen Jialan.

617
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,650
Chen Kexin.

618
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,840
Why are you here?

619
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,820
What are you doing here?

620
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,890
You're asking me?

621
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,060
Didn't you say that

622
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,940
you will help me ask He Zhengyu out?

623
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,040
It's been so long.

624
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,260
I don't even have a chance to eat with him.

625
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,720
Are you really helping me?

626
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,340
Of course I am.

627
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,390
He Zhengyu is so stubborn?

628
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:04,990
Growing up,

629
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,330
I've never been disliked like this.

630
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,190
Chen Jialan,

631
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,130
are you playing me?

632
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,700
Of course not.

633
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,400
No, I mean it.

634
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,330
How about this?

635
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,340
I'll ask him out for you.

636
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,930
What's your relationship with him?

637
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,420
Why does he listen to you?

638
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,460
Just trust me one last time.

639
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,830
Tomorrow night,

640
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,550
I'll bring him to you.

641
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,920
Okay, this is the last time.

642
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,910
If you dare to fool me again,

643
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,560
I won't forgive you.

644
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,730
No. Trust me.

645
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,540
What?

646
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,630
You're asking me to pretend to be He Zhengyu from four months ago

647
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,360
to have dinner with Chen Kexin.

648
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,310
What are you thinking about every day?

649
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,940
You shouldn't be a reporter.

650
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,720
You should be a screenwriter.

651
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,160
I had no choice.

652
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,550
Words escaped my lips.

653
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,370
Just go.

654
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,110
We'll talk about the rest later.

655
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,980
Will you put away your thoughts

656
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,470
and listen to my idea?

657
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,170
What is it?

658
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,880
What is it? Tell me.

659
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,880
I've been reading Kexin's Weibo these days.

660
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,580
I found that before she started to date Jiang Shenghao,

661
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,900
she often posted about things related to luxury goods

662
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,560
on social media.

663
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,280
But with her current financial ability,

664
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,540
she can't afford them.

665
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,430
More importantly, her relationships

666
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,270
are overlapping.

667
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,700
So I suspect

668
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,860
she committed relationship fraud.

669
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,180
But I haven't found clear evidence yet.

670
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,440
So I need some time.

671
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
You haven't found any evidence?

672
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,380
It's just your guess?

673
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,940
Besides, even if Chen Kexin committed fraud,

674
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,370
we still need a plaintiff's client.

675
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,980
I’ve asked Dajun to look.

676
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,220
Rationally speaking,

677
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,480
your plan is very good.

678
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,890
But have you ever thought

679
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,660
it's normal to have financial exchanges

680
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,720
in a relationship?

681
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,450
And both of her ex-boyfriends

682
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,710
are not short of money.

683
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,630
Compared to economic loss,

684
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,530
they don't want others to know

685
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,190
that they are the blockheads.

686
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,460
You can't force them

687
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,780
to be the client.

688
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,370
Let me think about it.

689
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,830
There will be a better way.

690
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,700
Okay.

691
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,170
Before you think of it,

692
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,120
I'll carry out my plan first.

693
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,490
What plan?

694
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,180
Here's my plan.

695
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,560
I'll tell Chen Kexin.

696
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,860
To avoid the embarrassment of

697
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,260
the two of you eating out,

698
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,720
so I asked her to come home.

699
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,600
Then...

700
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,410
Come on, put this on.

701
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,750
What?

702
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,980
Didn't I say I wanted to give you a surprise?

703
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,260
It's not a surprise.

704
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,340
Chen Jialan.

705
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,460
You said

706
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,620
you'll ask He Zhengyu out for dinner for me.

707
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,250
So I came.

708
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,300
When I go in,

709
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,020
if I don't see him...

710
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,740
I know.

711
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,980
I promised you.

712
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,460
He Zhengyu will show up.

713
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:08,990
Put it on.

714
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,140
Okay.

715
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,000
-Be gentle. -Okay.

716
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,060
Wait for me.

717
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,360
Wait.

718
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,490
Hurry up.

719
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,140
OK. Come on.

720
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,090
Be careful. There's an obstacle ahead.

721
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,000
Lift your foot.

722
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,910
Slowly.

723
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:38,880
Okay.

724
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,720
Just stand here.

725
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,770
Are you done?

726
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,040
Almost. Don't take it off.

727
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,520
Chen Jialan, what are you doing?

728
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,450
You're so annoying.

729
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,780
Don't take it off. Only a few seconds left.

730
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,910
Good evening, Ms. Chen.

731
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,620
Mr. He.

732
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,040
You really came.

733
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,800
You're so thoughtful.

734
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,060
You prepared candlelight dinner for us.

735
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,850
I misunderstood you before.

736
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,850
Didn't you say you'd order some takeout?

737
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,290
Why is it so grand?

738
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:57,840
Sit down.

739
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,780
Be sensible later.

740
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,040
Don't be a third wheel.

741
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,600
I made the steak in advance.

742
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,610
Try it.

743
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,490
I didn't expect you to be so good at cooking.

744
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,060
You don't need to be a cook to fry a steak.

745
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,860
Jialan told me

746
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,380
you're a gentleman,

747
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,910
mature and reliable.

748
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,240
I didn't expect you to be so good at cooking.

749
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,170
You're amazing.

750
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,440
Really?

751
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,950
I didn't know I was so good in her mind.

752
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,500
In my opinion,

753
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,950
Mr. He is more than that.

754
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,140
Thank you.

755
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,050
What is He Zhengyu doing?

756
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,560
He refused with words,

757
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,490
but he's actually so attentive.

758
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,050
Ms. Chen,

759
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,340
I'm sorry for what I did before.

760
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,180
I value work very much.

761
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,790
Please forgive me for my offense.

762
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,650
It's OK.

763
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,250
I should apologize to you.

764
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,370
I was too impulsive before.

765
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,680
I didn't consider your feelings.

766
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,880
How about this?

767
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,090
Let's take this opportunity to get to know each other again.

768
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,430
OK.

769
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,100
Cheers.

770
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,970
Ms. Chen.

771
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
I made this steak.

772
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,460
I don't know if you like it or not.

773
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,300
I like it very much.

774
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,380
Try some.

775
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,990
I made the salad myself.

776
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,990
I wonder if it is to your liking.

777
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,580
You must like it.

778
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,590
Are you done eating?

779
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,960
I suddenly remembered that I have work to do.

780
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,460
It's okay. Go back to work.

781
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,980
He Zhengyu,

782
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,870
don't you have work to do too?

783
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,659
I don't.

784
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,820
If you have work,

785
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,710
go ahead.

786
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,040
I'll talk to Ms. Chen alone.

787
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,290
I...

788
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,900
You're almost done eating.

789
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,500
Work is important. Go ahead.

790
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,489
Mr. He,

791
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,159
your hands are so beautiful.

792
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,360
Let me read your palm.

793
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,380
Do you know what's missing in your palm?

794
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:49,940
What?

795
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,270
What are you talking about? Why are you laughing so happily?

796
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,780
He Zhengyu.

797
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,310
Do you know why you are here?

798
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,760
Chen...

799
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,430
Chen Jialan.

800
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,280
Are you eavesdropping?

801
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,460
Of course not.

802
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,170
I was worried you were too excited

803
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,620
and forgot the time.

804
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,070
I wanted to remind you.

805
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm not you.

806
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,720
I know what to do.

807
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,320
Chen Kexin has left.

808
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,630
She won't bother Jiang Shenghao anymore.

809
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,190
Really?

810
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,590
What did you tell her?

811
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,870
What else can I say? Just cater to her liking.

812
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,400
Be sensible and emotional.

813
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,580
Chen Kexin is a smart woman.

814
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,670
You don't have to make it clear.

815
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,900
Don't keep me guessing.

816
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,060
What did you say?

817
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:30,970
I...

818
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,120
What did you say?

819
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,580
Did He Zhengyu really sacrifice himself?

820
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,040
Jialan,

821
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,980
Aren't you hungry?

822
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,400
You've been checking your phone for a long time.

823
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,260
I'm not hungry.

824
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm at your company, reception desk.

825
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,880
Why are you here again?

826
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,680
I bought it for you.

827
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,010
Thank you for asking Zhengyu out for me.

828
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,960
Zhengyu.

829
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,450
Why are you calling him that?

830
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,840
What did He Zhengyu tell her?

831
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,490
How are you two now?

832
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,610
Pretty good.

833
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,680
Anyway, thank you very much.

834
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,100
Zhengyu is really nice.

835
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,130
We'll invite you to dinner

836
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,350
and thank you in person.

837
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,480
I won't disturb you.

838
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,570
Go ahead. Bye.

839
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,780
I remember.

840
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,320
On the night Sun Defeng and I opened the law firm together,

841
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,180
did I get drunk?

842
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,050
Did Sun Defeng say that

843
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,390
partners need to be compatible on birth time

844
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,190
and they should have the same interests?

845
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,920
He took away a lot of my privacy.

846
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,750
I remember you told him

847
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,760
you like drinking.

848
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,550
Of course.

849
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,900
Can I drink that much if I don't like it?

850
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,740
Did I say anything else that night?

851
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,510
Zhengyu.

852
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,500
I drank more than you that night.

853
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,830
I just turned 18.

854
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,000
I was still an ignorant teenager.

855
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,380
That's strange.

856
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,910
Even if I told Sun Defeng,

857
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,620
what does Sun Defeng have to do

858
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,740
with Chen Jialan?

859
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,680
I remember now.

860
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,960
You two were reciting poems that night.

861
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,220
You said you wanted get everything you want.

862
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,270
Be fair and impartial.

863
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,980
Didn't you drink more than me?

864
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,710
How do you remember so clearly?

865
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,120
I like literature.

866
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
He has no reason to tell Chen Jialan.

867
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,610
Speaking of which,

868
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,820
let me remind you.

869
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,870
In fact, Mr. Sun is quite dissatisfied with you.

870
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,930
He complained a lot behind your back.

871
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,470
You're being subjective.

872
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,910
I helped him make so much money.

873
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,970
Why would he be dissatisfied with me?

874
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,620
You two used to recite and create poems together.

875
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,280
Are you still reciting poems now?

876
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,010
All you create now is problems.

877
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,990
It's normal to have different views in work.

878
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,580
Didn't I have a great time working with him?

879
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,270
You liar!

880
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,150
Didn't you say

881
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,700
you don't like girls like Chen Kexin?

882
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,710
Why are you so close to her?

883
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,560
Chen Jialan.

884
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,450
Are you here to pick me up?

885
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,740
Stop pretending.

886
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,270
Tell me, why did you sell me?

887
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,920
Aren't you here?

888
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,300
How did she know all my schedule?

889
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,620
Why did you tell her?

890
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,090
How did you know?

891
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,830
Why did you do all this?

892
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:32,830
What are you up to?

893
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,690
You're so noisy.

894
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,060
Don't you feel guilty saying this?

895
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,950
You already have a girlfriend.

896
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,570
You got a bargain, stop selling yourself short.

897
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,300
Don't drink if you can't drink.

898
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,940
Stop talking nonsense here.

899
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,870
Shame on you.

900
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,050
Wait.

901
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,590
Are you new or old?

902
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,660
I think you're crazy.

903
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,390
Is it 2021

904
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,380
or 2022?

905
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,300
Let me tell you.

906
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,780
If Chen Kexin shows up in front of me again,

907
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,710
I'll sue you too.

908
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,700
You are the old one.

909
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,550
She's even more pitiful than me.

910
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,880
You don't even know you have a girlfriend.

911
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,710
Chen Jialan.

912
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,620
Chen Jialan.

913
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,410
Did you drink?

914
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,900
I'll drink when I want to drink.

915
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,430
It's none of your business.

916
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,050
You can drink,

917
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,380
but can you

918
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,120
not throw things everywhere?

919
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,540
I'm serious.

920
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,370
I don't want to see you and Chen Kexin

921
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,070
