Didn't you ask me to come to Wu Anwen?

When did I ask you to come to Wu Anwen?

If you didn't ask me to come to Wu Anwen,

why did you come here to tell me this?

Wu Anwen is being harassed by a debt collection agency.

34
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,360
It doesn't make sense.

35
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,340
All these years,

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,360
he has always been Jirong's agent.

37
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,420
He has earned a lot.

38
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,030
How could he be in debt?

39
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,140
Because he owes a lot of money

40
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,460
in a foreign casino

41
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,950
and dared not let Jirong know.

42
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,790
So he borrowed money from the loan company to pay it back.

43
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,840
Wu Anwen gambled?

44
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,530
And he owes a lot of money?

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,440
He Zhengyu,

46

How do you know Wu Anwen is in debt?

Some clients liked to gamble,

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,930
I know it's useless to say this now.

176
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,570
Zhengyu, you have to trust me.

177
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,100
I can solve this problem.

178
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,080
I will get rid of the debt collectors.

179
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,120
I won't get Jirong involved.

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,060
You are my brother.

181
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,760
I've never begged you, have I?

182
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm begging you.

183
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Keep this a secret for me.

184
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,090
Tell me honestly.

185
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,490
How much do you owe?

186
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,270
A hundred thousand.

187
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,680
Two million.

188
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,980
Two million, okay?

189
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,780
We can't delay this any longer.

190
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,070
Come to my company

191
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,280
tomorrow morning.

192
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,220
I'll manage to collect the money for you.

193
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,980
No, Zhengyu.

194
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,210
You can't...

195
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,670
I'm not doing this for you,

196
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,680
but for Jirong.

197
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,190
Okay.

198
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,940
I will

199
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,670
try my best

200
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,530
to pay you back soon.

201
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,430
Thank you, brother.

202
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,200
Zhengyu.

203
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,040
Anwen.

204
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:25,810
Sit.

205
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,070
There is 2.6 million

206
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,300
in this card.

207
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,320
This is all I have now.

208
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,870
Take it to pay your gambling debt.

209
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,930
Do it as soon as possible.

210
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,510
Okay.

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,130
Thank you, Zhengyu.

212
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,990
I didn't expect things to be so serious this time.

213
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,740
Yes, Jirong is a star.

214
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,500
She got much more attention

215
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,620
after she married into the Jiang family.

216
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,350
I caused her trouble this time.

217
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,920
After this,

218
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,450
cut all ties with those people.

219
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,460
I can't get over it.

220
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,100
When I get the chance, I will...

221
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,460
You want to gamble again?

222
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,880
No, no.

223
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,150
I didn't mean that.

224
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,340
Sign it.

225
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,120
I trust you.

226
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,590
But you still have to pay off your debt.

227
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,210
Yes.

228
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
[IOU]

229
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
[Signature of Borrower: Wu Anwen]

230
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,190
Thank you, Zhengyu.

231
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,730
I will find a way

232
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,990
to pay you back as soon as possible.

233
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,910
Also,

234
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,690
that day at the river,

235
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,340
Chen Jialan, Miss Chen was there.

236
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,610
She is a journalist.

237
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,380
-About my gambling debt... -I will talk to her.

238
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,660
You're meticulous.

239
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,100
I trust you.

240
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,980
I'm leaving.

241
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,120
Let me send you out.

242
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,360
No.

243
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,820
Thank you.

244
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,160
I didn't expect

245
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,120
you are such a warmhearted person.

246
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,050
You look cold normally

247
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,250
but you help people with all your heart.

248
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,020
You have a good heart.

249
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,960
There's no such thing.

250
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,040
I'm just worried about him.

251
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,650
I asked him to sign an IOU

252
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,000
to remind him to pay the money back in time

253
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,870
and start over.

254
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,800
How dare you

255
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,810
give money to gamblers.

256
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,670
It's like throwing a bone to hit a dog.

257
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,930
You know the gamblers.

258
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,640
The winners want to keep winning.

259
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,980
The losers want to win the money back.

260
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,150
If it's so easy to quit,

261
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,680
there won't be so many broken families.

262
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,500
Well said.

263
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,460
Why don't you stay and help me with my defense?

264
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,500
No, I was talking nonsense.

265
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,950
I've crossed the line.

266
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,510
He bet on money.

267
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,270
You bet on humanity.

268
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,060
Hello.

269
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,220
Hello, are you Mr. Wu Anwen?

270
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,970
Who are you?

271
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,160
I'm Sun Defeng.

272
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,980
I'm a partner of Fengyu Law Firm.

273
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,640
I know what happened just now.

274
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,460
I totally understand how you feel right now.

275
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,150
So I want to talk to you.

276
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,470
Are you crazy?

277
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
I have nothing to talk to you.

278
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,940
Zhengyu is my brother.

279
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,260
It's between us.

280
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,790
It's none of your business.

281
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,170
This is the third time Wu Anwen was summoned.

282
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,800
He is Jirong's brother.

283
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,150
It's normal.

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,500
As one of the people involved in the incident of Jirong,

285
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,680
theoretically,

286
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,880
he's a suspect like Jiang Shenghao.

287
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,000
And he hasn't

288
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,140
paid off his gambling debt.

289
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,140
We can't rule out the possibility of

290
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,340
them fighting over this and causing the tragedy.

291
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,500
They could have fought over

292
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,560
the gambling debt.

293
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,250
But the motive is not enough

294
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,250
for him to murder.

295
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,570
We need to wait for

296
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,450
the police to investigate.

297
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,360
I just said that there is such a possibility.

298
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,200
I called you here today

299
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,360
because Jiang Shenghao's lawyer, Sun Defeng,

300
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,760
submitted new evidence.

301
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,450
We need to confirm with you.

302
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,220
We hope to solve the case as soon as possible.

303
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,910
I hope you understand.

304
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,040
According to the materials,

305
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,560
you once owed more than eight million gambling debts.

306
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,110
Is this true?

307
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,300
Yes.

308
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,520
Did Wu Jirong help you pay your debt?

309
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,490
Yes.

310
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,560
Have you two ever had a quarrel

311
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,530
because of this?

312
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,180
Of course.

313
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,240
As her brother,

314
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,770
I owed so much money.

315
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,740
Of course we had a quarrel.

316
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,820
Officer,

317
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,220
what do you mean by asking me this question?

318
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,870
Are you suspecting me?

319
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,350
The so-called evidence

320
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,850
provided by Jiang Shenghao's lawyer

321
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,570
is to divert your attention

322
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,470
and delay your investigation.

323
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
That's my sister.

324
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,000
He's out.

325
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,320
Anwen, are you okay?

326
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,580
It's okay.

327
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,060
I just cooperated with the investigation.

328
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,670
What did the police ask you?

329
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,400
It's about gambling debt.

330
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,100
It might be Jiang Shenghao. He said something

331
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,540
to the police.

332
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,550
Anwen,

333
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,740
it's the fact that you owed gambling debts.

334
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,350
And it's the fact that you met Jirong

335
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,950
on the night of the incident.

336
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,380
The police are just making a reasonable hypothesis.

337
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,820
Reasonable hypothesis?

338
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,230
What do you mean?

339
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,590
Everyone can suspect me

340
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,420
except you.

341
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,450
You are my brother, Zhengyu.

342
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,430
Anwen,

343
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,349
I really hope you can tell me the truth.

344
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,630
What happened

345
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,089
between you and Jirong that night?

346
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,480
Tell me everything.

347
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,300
Don't leave any details.

348
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,660
I'm your lawyer.

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,880
Only in this way

350
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,430
I could know how to help you.

351
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,339
Okay, I'll say it again.

352
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,400
I went to take Jirong away that day.

353
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,790
I was afraid that Jiang Shenghao would hurt her again.

354
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,380
But Jirong didn't listen and refused to leave.

355
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,900
I had no choice but to leave.

356
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,500
That's it.

357
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,930
That's it?

358
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,530
That's it.

359
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,520
What about Chen Kexin?

360
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,650
What's going on between you and Chen Kexin?

361
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,460
Yes.

362
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,300
I did have contact with Chen Kexin.

363
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,610
But

364
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,340
that's because of her relationship with

365
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,870
Jiang Shenghao.

366
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,900
I'm afraid it will affect Jirong.

367
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,780
So I asked her

368
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,750
to stop pestering Jiang Shenghao.

369
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,470
I didn't tell you before

370
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,320
because I didn't want you to misunderstand.

371
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,150
If you don't believe me,

372
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,070
ask her yourself when you see her.

373
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,830
Liu Da.

374
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,720
come and help me

375
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,370
with the interview video.

376
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,820
There is something wrong.

377
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,420
Which one?

378
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,010
Come and take a look.

379
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,200
Which video?

380
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,130
The one you took last time.

381
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,390
In 2022,

382
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,990
you are Mu Shiming's girlfriend

383
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,720
and you're living a happy life.

384
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,370
How is that possible?

385
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,870
That's strange.

386
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,310
I only see Mr. Mu as my teacher.

387
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,700
Is he interested in me?

388
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,950
Chen Jialan, you're so narcissistic.

389
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,540
How could Mr. Mu like you?

390
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,670
It seems to work here.

391
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,690
Let me see.

392
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,860
-We can't meet ourselves. -We can't meet ourselves.

393
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,340
It has finally been verified.

394
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,040
So you can't see the other one

395
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,240
from the other space,

396
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,080
otherwise the time-space overlap will collapse.

397
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,050
Then what did you four months ago tell Wu Anwen mysteriously

398
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,840
last night?

399
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,430
How much did he owe?

400
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,090
Two million.

401
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,390
Two million. So much.

402
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,380
Actually, it was eight million.

403
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,240
Eight million.

404
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:22,860
Eight.

405
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,350
I was cheated by Wu Anwen last night.

406
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,420
I mean me four months ago was cheated.

407
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,320
He confessed everything today.

408
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,090
You mean he confessed everything

409
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,910
today in 2022?

410
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,780
He owed so much money.

411
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,680
No wonder he took the risk

412
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,790
and did so many unbelievable things.

413
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,380
By the way,

414
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,540
don't let me four months ago know

415
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,430
what happened.

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,300
If he knows this,

417
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,580
he will try his best to verify it.

418
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,570
Maybe something will happen.

419
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,840
The time we spend together every day

420
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,710
is so short.

421
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,410
It's only 46 minutes.

422
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
We can't let him make trouble again.

423
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,820
Also,

424
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,050
Wu Anwen four months ago

425
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,820
asked you

426
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,000
not to tell Jiang Shenghao

427
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,050
about gambling.

428
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,380
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

429
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,920
I don't want to affect the relationship between Rat and Jirong

430
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,450
because of this.

431
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:17,960
Okay.

432
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,150
I booked a restaurant tonight.

433
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,890
Dajun said their food is very delicious.

434
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,750
Let's go now.

435
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,010
Or it'll be too late.

436
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,770
Let's go.

437
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,020
Wait for me to get changed.

438
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,920
No need.

439
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,370
It's just a meal.

440
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,490
Just a meal?

441
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,040
Or what?

442
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,370
It's just a dinner?

443
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,860
Do you have anything to say?

444
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,600
Or

445
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,870
something special?

446
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,300
What?

447
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,470
He Zhengyu, don't pretend

448
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,930
nothing happened, okay?

449
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,640
No.

450
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,220
What do you mean?

451
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,540
What happened?

452
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,890
Stop pretending.

453
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,580
The day before yesterday,

454
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,340
you suddenly hugged me and you...

455
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,620
What do you mean?

456
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,360
What do I mean?

457
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,760
Isn't it obvious enough?

458
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,940
Obvious?

459
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,190
How would I know if you don't tell me?

460
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,450
Unless you tell me that

461
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,020
it's because

462
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,480
the time-space overlap is going to end

463
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,060
and we would never see each other again.

464
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,520
So you did it on impulse...

465
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,830
I could understand.

466
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
But the situation is different now.

467
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,370
I hope you can think it through.

468
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,660
I've thought it through.

469
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,500
What else?

470
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,350
Also,

471
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,830
I want to treat you to a meal.

472
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,320
Enjoy your meal.

473
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
You want to see me?

474
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,930
Let's talk somewhere else.

475
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,790
No need.

476
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,480
I know what you want to say.

477
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,500
You just don't want me to tell Jiang Shenghao

478
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,970
about Wu Anwen's debt, right?

479
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,770
You can go now.

480
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,840
Wait.

481
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,190
I have something else to ask.

482
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,890
Don't bother.

483
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,260
It's because I like you.

484
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,660
There's no other reason.

485
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,230
I haven't asked you.

486
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,480
Whatever it is,

487
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,380
it's all because

488
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,690
I like you.

489
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm obsessed.

490
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,820
You're handsome, rich and successful.

491
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,950
I can't control myself not to like you.

492
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,450
I admit the objective factors you just praised me.

493
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,060
But I don't

494
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,690
buy it.

495
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,640
Do you have proof that I'm lying?

496
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,870
Chen Jialan,

497
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,270
can we talk openly

498
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,830
like normal people?

499
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,370
We are talking openly.

500
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,960
But you don't trust me.

501
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,310
Unreasonable.

502
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,170
Bye.

503
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,190
Zhengyu.

504
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,050
How is it? Any news?

505
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,570
No.

506
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,240
I've been watching here.

507
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,960
Half an hour ago,

508
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,430
he took out some garbage.

509
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,310
Is the garbage still there?

510
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,200
Garbage?

511
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,750
It's still here.

512
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,550
What's wrong?

513
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,470
I think you did it on purpose.

514
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,790
These are

515
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,890
some dry waste,

516
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,420
fruit peels,

517
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,430
and some kitchen waste.

518
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,540
There's no clue.

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,880
Chen Kexin is here.

692
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,340
Even if we know she's here,

693
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,350
we can't get in.

694
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,520
I think she drove here.

695
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,800
Did you record her license plate number?

696
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,180
I did. It's in the memo.

697
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,440
Let's lure her out.

698
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,050
Miss,

699
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,130
I'm sorry.

700
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,900
When I was reversing the car,

701
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,449
I didn't see the car behind mine.

702
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,110
I accidentally scratched it.

703
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,980
Its license plate number is Fu EN1863.

704
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,300
I heard from the security guard that

705
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,500
the car owner is having a massage here.

706
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,860
Please tell her

707
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,560
the police will be here soon.

708
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,370
Ask her to come, okay?

709
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,060
Ask her to come. I'm in a hurry.

710
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,929
Wait, sir.

711
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,290
Please repeat the license plate number.

712
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,469
Fu EN1863.

713
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,810
Okay, thank you.

714
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,630
I'm in a hurry.

715
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,520
Fu EN1863.

716
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,290
It's Miss Chen's car.

717
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,420
Lisa, Lisa.

718
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,280
Can you hear me?

719
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,940
A man said he accidentally

720
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,480
scratched a car.

721
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,150
Please ask Miss Chen to come out and deal with it.

722
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,080
Copy. Okay.

723
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,350
Who is it?

724
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,870
He hit and ran?

725
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:54,190
Where is the scratch?

726
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,699
Where is it?

727
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,880
Chen Kexin.

728
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,310
I finally found you.

729
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,070
What do you want?

730
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
I just want to know

731
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,770
the secret

732
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,250
between you and Wu Anwen.

733
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

734
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,190
I don't know him well.

735
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,490
You don't have to tell me,

736
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,290
but you'd better tell the police

737
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,200
because the police are investigating the suspects

738
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,820
who caused Jirong's death.

739
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,600
Wu Anwen is also a suspect.

740
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,330
I have nothing to do

741
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,470
Wu Jirong's death.

742
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,030
You don't need to explain.

743
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,340
You can trust me now.

744
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,220
Because

745
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,710
I'm Wu Anwen's lawyer.

746
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,440
Tell me

747
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,090
what happened

748
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,500
between you and Wu Anwen,

749
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,020
otherwise, even if I don't ask you,

750
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,550
the police will come to you.

751
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,290
[Yuchen Law Firm]

752
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,910
Anwen, have a seat.

753
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
What would you like to drink?

754
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,780
Tea or coffee?

755
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,370
No need.

756
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,010
You don't call me here

757
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,410
to drink, do you?

758
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,140
There is something really important

759
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,070
I want to ask you.

760
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,100
Why are you so serious? Go ahead.

761
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,400
That day at the gate of the police station,

762
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,710
you swore to me that

763
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,610
you have nothing to do with Chen Kexin.

764
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,920
I'm your lawyer.

765
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,080
I'm also Wu Jirong's best friend.

766
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,630
Let me ask you one last time.

767
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,920
I hope you can tell me the truth.

768
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,030
What do you mean?

769
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,820
Did you find Chen Kexin

770
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,020
and heard something?

771
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,940
If so,

772
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,970
you can tell me directly.

773
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,580
Let me tell you a story.

774
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,100
There is this brother.

775
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,080
He worked hard to raise his sister

776
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,690
to a superstar.

777
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,240
And he became

778
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,860
a famous agent.

779
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,900
When he was in the full flush of success,

780
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,150
he was misled by some people

781
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,960
and indulged in gambling.

782
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,660
He suddenly owed a lot of debts.

783
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,330
But he didn't want to make it public

784
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,090
and he didn't want to affect his sister.

785
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,030
So he kept it a secret.

786
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,550
Because he knew

787
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,790
it was only a matter of time

788
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,410
to pay off gambling debts with the money his sister earned.

789
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,740
But he didn't expect

790
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,900
his sister suddenly got married

791
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,800
and retired.

792
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,220
It meant that

793
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,870
she couldn't help him make more money.

794
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,820
That meant she cut off

795
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,920
his source of money.

796
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,960
It was like pushing him to a dead end.

797
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,050
The debt collectors

798
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,710
could not let him off easily.

799
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,250
He had no choice

800
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,120
but to find a way.

801
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,920
What way?

802
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,060
That was to

803
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,690
jeopardize her sister's marriage.

804
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,630
He even colluded with

805
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,850
his brother-in-law's ex-girlfriend

806
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,130
so that his sister can return to the entertainment industry

807
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,660
and continue to make money.

808
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,000
Unexpectedly,

809
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,540
his sister found out his plot.

810
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,870
But he was her brother after all.

811
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,300
She chose to bear the humiliation

812
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
and hid it for him.

813
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,960
Then she got depression

814
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,680
and was hospitalized.

815
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,930
Maybe it was because

816
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,970
she bore too much psychological pressure,

817
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,170
she finally chose to confess everything to her lover

818
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,140
and escaped from the hospital.

819
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,440
And?

820
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,830
Anything else?

821
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,820
Did you send the message

822
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,880
to Jirong that day?

823
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,300
What message?

824
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,590
I don't know what you're talking about.

825
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,310
I sent Jirong

826
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,100
to Jiang Shenghao's house.

827
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,060
She promised to confess something.

828
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,920
But after she received a message,

829
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,420
she kept her mouth shut.

830
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,810
You texted Jirong, right?

831
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,840
You are afraid

832
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,940
Jirong couldn't help telling Jiang Shenghao the truth.

833
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,200
So, even if you were out of town,

834
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,640
you bought a plane ticket and flew back

835
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,770
to stop Jirong from telling the truth.

836
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,040
Zhengyu,

837
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,920
your story is getting more and more ridiculous.

838
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,330
What's next?

839
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,950
Let me make it up for you.

840
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,600
The brother killed his sister

841
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,380
to stop his sister from telling the truth?

842
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,010
You know how Jirong and I grew up.

843
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,920
You know how close we were.

844
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,420
Do you really think

845
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,780
I could do such a thing?

846
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,190
Fine, even if you think I could,

847
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,180
how do you explain the message Jirong sent me?

848
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,060
I left at 2:00.

849
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,520
She texted me at 2:30.

850
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,750
You know that.

851
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
How did I kill her?

852
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,260
I don't know.

853
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,050
That's why I'm here to ask you.

854
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,580
So you make up stories because you don't know?

855
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,410
You don't treat me as your brother. It's fine.

856
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,070
Jirong is your friend, right?

857
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,250
Do you think it's appropriate

858
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,180
to say this to me?

859
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,630
Because I'm Jirong's friend,

860
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,680
I'm here to ask you in person.

861
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,650
Otherwise,

862
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,640
I'll give the evidence to the police.

863
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,670
Zhengyu,

864
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,110
I owed a gambling debt

865
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,440
and dragged Jirong down.

866
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,020
But I didn't kill her.

867
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,280
You also said

868
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,800
the one who doesn't want anything to happen to Jirong

869
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,640
is me.

870
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,070
I know

871
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,780
you suffered a lot in your career

872
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,620
because Jirong overthrew her confession in court

873
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,530
in Jiang Shenghao's case.

874
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,280
You are not doing well now.

875
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,080
Now that Jirong is dead,

876
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,930
and this attracts a lot of social attention.

877
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,780
So you want to get up at the spot where you fell.

878
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,700
You want to take this opportunity

879
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,270
to get back to the top of the law circle.

880
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,070
I understand.

881
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,830
Then you should find evidence

882
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,380
to prove that it was Jiang Shenghao who did it,

883
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,760
instead of blaming me.

884
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,440
Anwen,

885
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,950
Chen Kexin has agreed to be a witness in court.

886
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,010
I'll wait for you at the police station tomorrow.

887
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,300
As long as you turn yourself in,

888
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,160
I will continue to be your lawyer.

889
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,800
I'll do my best to help you.

890
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,120
You give me this to eat?

891
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,240
At least add an egg.

892
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
Better than nothing.

893
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,660
Why am I so unlucky?

894
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,850
Why do I have to get involved with Wu Jirong's death?

895
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,430
I didn't do anything.

896
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,320
You didn't do anything?

897
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,900
You colluded with Wu Anwen

898
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,030
to frame Jiang Shenghao for cheating.

899
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,310
But I didn't want Wu Jirong to die.

900
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,120
Can you stop saying that word?

901
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,900
We should at least respect the deceased.

902
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,360
It's Wu Anwen's fault.

903
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,500
He insisted that as long as Jiang Shenghao

904
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,850
divorced Wu Jirong,

905
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,650
he will get a large sum of money.

906
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,390
And he will give me half then.

907
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,380
But in the end, Wu Jirong didn't get divorced

908
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,110
but also d...

909
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,120
Deceased.

910
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,090
I agreed Wu Anwen

911
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,490
on impulse.

912
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,140
I just want some money for

913
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,340
the living expenses.

914
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,250
I didn't mean to kill anyone.

915
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,440
In the end, I worked so hard

916
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,990
to get a deposit of tens of thousands yuan.

917
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,700
And I might end up in prison

918
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,140
because of the money

919
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,280
for a few days.

920
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,200
It will be more than a few days.

921
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,930
It will be a few years probably.

922
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,240
What did you say?

923
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,480
Let me see.

924
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,200
Several years for fraud, right?

925
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,700
Several years for blackmailing.

926
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,690
Not to mention the malicious slandering.

927
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,060
That's quite more years.

928
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,340
Now,

929
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,750
you'd better

930
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,010
to cooperate with us.

931
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,140
By then, Mr. He will say something nice in court

932
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,340
and it will reduce

933
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,200
your sentence.

934
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,580
Am I really going to jail?

935
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
No, I can't go to jail.

936
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,130
But he has to pay me back.

937
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,600
He has to have the spirit of contract.

938
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,840
You must be kidding.

939
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,880
