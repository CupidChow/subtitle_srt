00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,878
This drama series is fictional
and is not related in any way

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,923
to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings, and events.

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:16,891
Did you watch the show yesterday?

4
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,643
It was great. Did you see it?

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,854
The menu seems all right overall,

6
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,939
but please add more desserts.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,315
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,278
And let's change the wine selection set
for dinner on Wednesday and Thursday.

9
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,782
-Something that's not too strong.
-Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,534
Everything looks good.

11
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,746
Everything you told me that day.

12
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,330
I don't trust a word of it.

13
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,254
I'm going to keep suspecting you.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,890
Bring me evidence
if you want me to believe you.

15
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,120
Copying files

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,374
Red Swan

17
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,044
Why were you in there?

18
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,507
I was going to ask the butler something
but she wasn't in.

19
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,803
The vice-chairman is looking for you.
You should go to the second-floor study.

20
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,638
I will.

21
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,410
Come in.

22
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,923
Episode 4

23
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,634
Q1.

24
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,471
Seo Doyoon, was it?

25
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,182
Yes, that's right.

26
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,142
I'm asking because I really don't know,

27
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,520
but is a bodyguard supposed to do

28
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,480
something like that?

29
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,816
Meddle in their client's affairs

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,902
and hold them by force.

31
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,986
I'm sorry, sir.

32
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,280
Both of your safety is my priority.

33
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,532
Were you hurt by any chance?

34
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,995
Weren't you worried
that you might be fired?

35
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,080
I know that I went a bit overboard,

36
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,168
but I thought you'd understand
that it was for both of your safety.

37
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,671
I am rich,

38
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,423
but I don't boss people around.

39
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,300
Bossing others is embarrassing.

40
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,136
I got it. You may leave.

41
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,430
Go easy on me next time, all right?

42
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,282
I'll be heading out, sir.

43
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,449
Do it quickly.

44
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,296
Judging by the volume,

45
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,006
it looks to be
around $700,000 to $800,000.

46
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,966
That's a billion in Korean won.

47
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,388
What could it be for?

48
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,474
It's too much money to be paying
to have someone killed.

49
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,193
Siblings
Oh Hyunsoo, Oh Wansoo

50
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,362
First son Kim Yongkook
Lover Jang Taera

51
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:26,117
Late Kim Duo, Hwain's former chairman
Park Miran, Hwain's current chairwoman

52
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,848
Did you want to see me, ma'am?

53
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,266
Why did you put…

54
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,185
Chanhee's belongings here?

55
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,525
I couldn't throw them out,

56
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,986
and I couldn't return them to you either.

57
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,574
I'll store them elsewhere.
I should have put more thought into it.

58
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,452
Yes, you really should have.

59
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,373
Have Chanhee's stuff stored elsewhere

60
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,375
and throw out
all the furniture in this room.

61
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,544
And keep this door locked.

62
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,130
What?

63
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,968
She must think I'm a joke.

64
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,431
Okay.

65
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,475
Do as she wants.

66
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,311
We've got plenty of rooms here.

67
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,730
Yes, ma'am. I will do that.

68
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,483
-Call Mr. Han over.
-Yes, ma'am.

69
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,672
Did you want to see me?

70
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,298
Just as you've suggested,

71
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,969
I should have Yongmin become
the new director of the foundation.

72
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,180
Wise decision, ma'am.

73
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,724
Do a good job convincing him
so that he doesn't complain

74
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,685
that he's getting a useless title.

75
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,603
What about Director Oh then?

76
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,688
We'll have her resign.

77
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,191
Don't force it since public opinion
might sway against us.

78
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,027
Yes, ma'am. You don't need to worry.

79
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,289
What do you mean, a resignation speech?

80
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,875
Mr. Han sent it over, saying that it was
Chairwoman Park's order.

81
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,626
NOW FOUNDATION
Resignation speech

82
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,298
What's going on all of a sudden?

83
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,217
Yongkook has a son out of wedlock.

84
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,640
Did you know about this?

85
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,517
I'm sure you did too.

86
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,231
Leak it to the tabloids.

87
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,234
Tell them that Hwain Group's
Vice-Chairman Kim is having an affair

88
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,236
and has a 10-year-old son with the woman.

89
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,530
Tell all the tabloids immediately.

90
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,325
Are you going to divorce him then?

91
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,701
I won't divorce him.

92
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,204
I won't let them take away
NOW Foundation either.

93
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,582
Then why tell the tabloids?
We should be stopping any possible rumors.

94
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,712
Do you really want me to do it?

95
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,644
Ma'am.

96
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,395
You should see this.

97
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,236
What's this?

98
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,446
That darn…

99
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,493
Rumors of Hwain Group's Vice-Chairman Kim
having affair and with love child

100
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,081
There he comes.

101
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,375
Let's go.

102
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,881
What's this? What's going on?

103
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,841
-Take us to the underground parking lot.
-Yes, sir.

104
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,391
Here they come.

105
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,227
Excuse me.

106
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,812
Please wait.

107
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,695
Were you aware of this?

108
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,697
- Care to comment?
- A word, please.

109
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,246
Is it true
that he has an illegitimate son?

110
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,331
Are you aware that the photo
of the mistress was in circulation?

111
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,541
A word, please.

112
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,346
Wansoo.

113
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,609
Director Oh Wansoo

114
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,819
Wansoo. Did you hear about the tabloids?

115
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,154
I'm busy. Get to the point.

116
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,530
I mean,

117
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,449
don't you keep up with the news?

118
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,783
Stop them.

119
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,954
I thought you'd be happy.

120
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,083
I have a face that people can remember
from seeing just once.

121
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,919
I can't even go shopping anymore.

122
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,172
You should keep your neck straight
and carry on with your life.

123
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,341
You think so?

124
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,303
Then should we just let them
publish those tabloid articles?

125
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,763
We can't do that.

126
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,598
Do something.

127
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,267
-Me?
-Yes.

128
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,144
Right. An interview.

129
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,854
You should do an interview.

130
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,650
-An interview?
-Yes.

131
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,451
You called me over
because of those tabloid articles, right?

132
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,870
You get out of here.
I never asked to see you.

133
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,206
What do you mean? The article is about me.

134
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,750
My photo is plastered
all over messengers in Korea.

135
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,335
Get out!

136
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,380
You, sit down.

137
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,631
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,137
Wansoo… No.

139
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,432
Director Oh has to do an interview, ma'am.

140
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,310
She's not only the daughter-in-law
of the Hwain family,

141
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,062
but she's a celebrity.

142
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,398
You know what I mean, don't you?

143
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,733
Why you… I said get out. Get out of here!

144
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,784
Goodness.

145
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,914
We're looking for the source,
but it may be difficult to find.

146
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,462
At times like these…

147
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,549
silence is the best solution.

148
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,427
You should stay out
of the public limelight for now.

149
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,721
That's the best for all of us.

150
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,766
The stock prices of our five subsidiaries
have plummeted.

151
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,894
-Darn it.
-Why would that affect our stock prices?

152
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,771
Those darn apes.

153
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,231
You know how it is.

154
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,735
They want the group to be transparent
in its management and succession.

155
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,819
Moreover,

156
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,155
the business world holds

157
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,450
Director Oh's business acumen
in high regard.

158
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,243
Unbelievable.

159
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,037
Everyone must be worried

160
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,957
that she might end up divorcing Yongkook.

161
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,421
That will be all.

162
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,630
All of you, get out!

163
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,466
You head straight home.

164
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,051
Ma'am.

165
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,388
Please reconsider my resignation
as the director of the foundation.

166
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,310
Hey.

167
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,021
It's not even been a minute
since I told you

168
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,647
to stay out of the public limelight.

169
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,940
Do you think I'm a joke?

170
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,151
Quit your yapping

171
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,527
and keep your hands off the foundation

172
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,030
until things quiet down.

173
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,616
Just stay at home.

174
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,044
Schedule a press conference
for tomorrow afternoon.

175
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,420
I'm sorry?

176
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,925
I'll report this to Chairwoman Park first.

177
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,261
Do that after you schedule it.

178
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,180
Or I can ask someone else to do that.

179
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,153
The next day

181
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:57,044
NOW Foundation's Director Oh Wansoo
Emergency press conference

182
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,964
What are you doing?
It's almost time.

183
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,049
Let's go after I watch this.

184
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,259
We won't make it before tee time.

185
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,885
Dad hates it when people are late to golf.

186
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,428
It won't be that long.

187
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,721
What is it?

188
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,140
A live broadcast
of Oh Wansoo's press conference.

189
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,018
-Because of those tabloid articles?
-Yeah.

190
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,147
NOW Foundation's Director Oh Wansoo
Emergency Press Conference

191
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,692
Are rumors true that Hwain Group's
Vice-Chairman has an illegitimate child?

192
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,570
Exactly.

193
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,446
Marriage of the century to end in divorce?
Is Kim and Oh's marriage rocky?

194
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,907
She's been making waves abroad.

195
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,368
I've been following
all the articles they write about her.

196
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,870
Is that so?

197
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,539
Whenever she ever travels abroad,

198
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,916
the entire country is rife

199
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,878
with articles about her.

200
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,715
Director Oh is the pride
of all women in Korea.

201
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,092
Thank you.

202
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,095
The same goes for you too,
Chairwoman Park.

203
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,348
Nonsense.

204
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,142
You flatter me.

205
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,148
Do you need to be somewhere?

206
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,233
Not at all.

207
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,071
What could be more important
than to have a meal with you, Minister?

208
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,074
I'm a fan of yours.

209
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,911
No, the honor is all mine.

210
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,288
Please excuse me for a moment.

211
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,372
Of course.

212
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,916
Right.

213
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,669
The bathroom is over that way.

214
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,962
Hurry back.

215
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,589
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,639
You're such a philanthropist.

217
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,390
Me?

218
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,185
Not at all.

219
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,479
The chairwoman
might be coming down with a fever.

220
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,272
You should get her a blanket from the car.

221
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,732
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,698
I need to get to a press conference.

223
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,034
You two are truly an inspiration.

224
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,370
You should head out the back door.
I'll be right with you.

225
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,871
Is that so?

226
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,515
I'm sorry,
but could you drive a little faster?

227
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,599
Sure thing.

228
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,400
What?

229
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,819
-She's not in the parking lot either.
-Why you…

230
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,743
I guess she had somewhere to be after all.

231
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,245
Yes, it seems that way.

232
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,373
She's feeling a little under the weather.

233
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,166
I'm terribly sorry.

234
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,629
That ungrateful…

235
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,133
There she is!

236
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,862
NOW Foundation's Director Oh Wansoo
Emergency press conference

237
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,031
Hello, I'm Oh Wansoo.

238
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,325
This is my first time
having to address such an issue.

239
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,041
It's already been over ten years
since I retired from being a pro golfer.

240
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,626
I wanted to thank you for taking
such an interest in me

241
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,462
after all those years.

242
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,638
Turn the TV on.

243
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,271
I've been living life
as a common housewife,

244
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,733
but since news spreads
so fast online these days

245
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,194
and reporters have been visiting me daily

246
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,989
at the foundation in which I work,

247
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,910
I had no choice
but to make a public appearance again.

248
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,871
A lot of people…

249
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,541
seemed to be worried about my marriage.

250
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,004
There were talks of my husband
having an illegitimate child

251
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,506
with a woman he was having an affair with.

252
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,134
My answer to such allegations…

253
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,390
…is a resounding no.

254
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,434
- She says it's not true?
- Really?

255
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,852
Are you denying the rumors then?

256
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,938
There were even photos of his mistress.

257
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,023
Are you here today to refute the rumors?

258
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,488
I will tell you the truth.

259
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,118
The rumored illegitimate child
you've all been hearing about…

260
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,291
is actually the son
of my late father-in-law.

261
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,922
- What?
- You know him very well.

262
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,844
The late Honorary Chairman Kim Duo
is the son's father.

263
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,887
Why that little…

264
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,236
Has it been confirmed?
Did you do a paternity test?

265
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,114
Then are the rumors false?

266
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,700
Is he really Honorary Chairman Kim's son?

267
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,410
I must beg you

268
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,539
that you refrain from taking
too much interest in our family affairs

269
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,291
as of today.

270
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,126
That will be all.

271
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,920
Is everything you said here true?

272
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,548
Please give us a detailed explanation.

273
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,841
Is what you said true?

274
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,426
Please give us a word.

275
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,226
The late Honorary Chairman Kim Duo
is the son's father.

276
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,440
She's totally nuts.

277
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,859
- Mr. Kim, turn around and drive home.
- Yes, ma'am.

278
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,903
No, drop us off at the Grand Palace.

279
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,155
Quiet. Just drive us home.

280
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,364
What's with you, Mom?

281
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,700
We need to make a plan.

282
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,243
What will you do after you barge in there?

283
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,287
Why would we need a plan?

284
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,373
She's made me the concubine
of a man in his seventies.

285
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,626
The press conference live stream
will end shortly.

286
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,671
That was killer.

287
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,884
Wansoo must have lost it.

288
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,637
Dad?

289
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,597
We won't make it to golf today.

290
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,849
I won't have it.
Come here at once.

291
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,934
Wait.

292
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,854
My mom would be fuming right now.

293
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,731
Dad wants us there immediately.

294
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,066
Sure. We should be there.

295
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,611
You're just going to go?

296
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,404
Hello?

297
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,615
You've just got a new brother.

298
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,991
I can't wait to see

299
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,285
the looks on Yongkook and Mom's faces.

300
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,790
Is this situation funny to you?

301
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,185
Here she comes.

302
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,729
A comment, please.

303
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,940
Please give us a word.
A word, please.

304
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,316
Wait.

305
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,777
- Could you confirm your statement again?
- A word, please.

306
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,153
Did you run a paternity test?

307
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,363
Please comment
on today's press conference.

308
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,246
Incoming call
My husband

309
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,918
The chairwoman has asked me
to escort you home.

310
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,921
Let's go home then.

311
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,756
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,927
A moment, please.

313
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,095
Please wait.

314
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,468
I remember,
this is the kind of person you were.

315
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,845
That's right.

316
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,222
Do you want me to compliment you?

317
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,768
Answer me!

318
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:38,440
So this is how I get screwed over.

319
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,902
That was the best option I had.

320
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:46,198
Just what is your goal in life?

321
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,700
To create a better world.

322
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,457
You've got to be kidding me.

323
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,460
I've lived a life
where I was shunned by everyone.

324
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,587
It was cold and hungry.

325
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,464
Now, it's time for me…

326
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,674
to help them in return.

327
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,637
That's why you people
never climb out of the rut you're in.

328
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,013
You bottom-feeders and your mentality.

329
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,974
Help with what? Why? Help who?

330
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,268
What's yours is yours
and what's mine is mine.

331
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,399
You must consider yourself a saint.

332
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,567
But you know what?

333
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,530
All the money you're spending is mine,
not yours.

334
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:30,909
I do more work for Hwain than your son.

335
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,744
I am the face of Hwain Group.

336
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,246
Hwain is mine!

337
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,087
You must feel like you've won today,
don't you?

338
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,092
You really are a piece of work.

339
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,304
Resign from the position
of NOW Foundation's director immediately

340
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,640
and never take any part
in any of Hwain's business from now on.

341
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,100
If that's what you want…

342
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,103
I'll hold another press conference.

343
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,064
I'll tell the world

344
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,358
about the foundation and my role in it.

345
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,651
Your role?

346
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,903
What even is your role? Tell me.

347
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,489
I'd love to know what your role is.

348
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,949
The foundation is my everything.

349
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,410
I will make it a transparently run
international organization.

350
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,124
Stop sullying my life's work
with money problems, ma'am.

351
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,834
You…

352
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,797
Hold on a second.

353
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,799
Are you telling me

354
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,385
that you'll blackmail me…

355
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,388
using our slush fund?

356
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,600
You can ask the prosecution
and the police for help,

357
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,019
but it won't be easy for you
to stop the press.

358
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,564
You can't take away
the foundation from me.

359
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,900
I won't sit around and let you.

360
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,821
You really must have lost it.

361
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,412
Listen carefully.

362
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,917
You have no one else to blame
but yourself for everything

363
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,336
that is about to happen to you.

364
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,420
I understand.

365
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,089
As long as I can protect the foundation…

366
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,675
I'm willing to risk that.

367
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,680
Are you the same Seo Doyoon I know?

368
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,184
You need at least 10 security personnel
before you hold a press conference.

369
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,020
On top of that,
she left abruptly while she was meeting

370
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,188
with Chairwoman Park and the minister.

371
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,565
You should have told me at the least

372
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,528
and asked me to send more men
to guard her at the press conference.

373
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,366
I'm sorry, sir.

374
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,285
Sir.

375
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,747
I'll be at the headquarters
tomorrow morning

376
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,916
to monitor all of our CCTVs.

377
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,127
I'm the head of the RF team after all.

378
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,171
-Every one of them?
-Yes, sir.

379
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,674
I want to stop the reporters
from bothering the vice-chairman at work.

380
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,842
You don't need to worry
about the vice-chairman.

381
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,094
He has me.

382
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,097
-Yes, sir.
-What are you doing?

383
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,140
Are you trying to get ahead of me?

384
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,978
I wouldn't dream of it.
I'm just trying to give it my best.

385
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,774
Goodbye, sir.

386
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,535
Hello.

387
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,579
You're the new head of the RF team, right?

388
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,663
I am.

389
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,206
Jieun.

390
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:24,666
Yes, sir?

391
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,879
Please bring my dinner to the annex.

392
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,716
Yes, sir. I see that your dinner
was delayed quite a bit today.

393
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,426
My meeting
with the chairwoman dragged out.

394
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,219
I'll have it served right away.

395
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,391
Right.

396
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:45,353
You're the new head of the RF team
who guards Director Oh, right?

397
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,440
Yes. I'm sorry for the late introduction.
I'm Seo Doyoon.

398
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,610
You must have your hands full.

399
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,614
Keep up the good work.

400
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,174
A few days later

401
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,223
It's huge, right?

402
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,993
Look at me.

403
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,204
There you go.

404
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,876
Let's head inside.

405
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,565
Say hello to Chairwoman Park.

406
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,527
Hello, ma'am. I'm Jang Junhee.

407
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,410
Sit.

408
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,723
Sit down.

409
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,603
I asked her to join us.

410
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,564
You created this family tree,

411
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,234
so you should treat her with respect
as your other mother-in-law.

412
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,777
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,075
She has every right to live here

414
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,494
since she's my late husband's lover.

415
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,329
Show them to their rooms.

416
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,748
Yes, ma'am.

417
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,708
Excuse me, ma'am.

418
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,043
I mean, Miran?

419
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,214
I mean, Chairwoman Park.

420
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,634
Gosh, my head…

421
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,345
I'll leave you to it.

422
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,186
Junhee. Does Grandma scare you?

423
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,483
Just stick right next to Mommy, okay?

424
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,907
Where is my room?

425
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,576
I hope it isn't right next to yours.

426
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,787
I've prepared a much bigger room for you.

427
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,039
Please follow me, mistress.

428
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,123
Wait.

429
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,583
"Mistress"?

430
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,337
Why do you address me as mistress
instead of madam?

431
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,755
I'll show you the way.

432
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,721
You go ahead, Junhee.

433
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,107
Mom, it's me.

434
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,652
Wansoo just addressed me as mistress
instead of madam.

435
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,736
Why would she call me that?

436
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,655
What do you think she means by that?

437
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,573
She's calling you
a concubine to your face!

438
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,243
What? She is?

439
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,579
Mistress is another word for concubine.

440
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,791
The woman a man has an affair
and a love child with!

441
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,126
How could you not know that?

442
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,795
So she was mocking me?

443
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,173
I can't believe her!

444
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,387
Your clothes will be hung here, Junhee.

445
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,848
You should get changed
into something more comfortable.

446
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,433
A concubine?

447
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,228
-How could you call me that?
-Be quiet.

448
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,855
Mistress?

449
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,731
Do you think I'm some tramp?

450
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,233
How dare you call me a mistress?

451
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,903
There are so many other things
you could have called me.

452
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,406
How could you call me a concubine
right to my face?

453
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,450
Do you think I'm below you?

454
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,411
Junhee.

455
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,163
Why don't you wait out on the sofa?

456
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,757
Listen closely.

457
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,553
This is the only part of the house
that you can call yours.

458
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,307
Don't even think of joining us
at the dinner table.

459
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,391
Make yourself invisible.

460
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,061
Don't let me spot you
anywhere inside this house.

461
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,146
Am I clear?

462
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,152
But I'm supposed to be
your father-in-law's mistress.

463
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,196
Then I'm practically your mother-in-law…

464
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,782
Your second mother-in-law.

465
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,451
I don't think you get it.

466
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,580
Answer me.

467
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,208
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,175
Darn it! This is unbelievable!

469
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,229
I'm going out for a run.

470
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,398
Yes, ma'am.

471
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,222
What is it? Do you find me pathetic?

472
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,100
My husband's mistress
moved into the house with their child.

473
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,310
You must be wondering what I'm thinking.

474
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,272
What is it that you want to protect?

475
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,774
Is it money?

476
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,944
I doubt there's any money
in that house for me.

477
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,153
What is it then?

478
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,700
I took you to that press conference
because I thought it could help you.

479
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,244
I thought it was a way for you
to escape this family.

480
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,954
Did you think I'd announce my divorce

481
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,289
like the reporters expected?

482
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,667
You can only divorce someone

483
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,461
when you've married someone out of love.

484
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,632
My marriage was already ruined long ago.

485
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,469
Why are you protecting it

486
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,389
if it means nothing to you?

487
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,560
Just what is it that you want to protect?

488
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,858
Place your hand here to have it scanned.

489
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,288
It will be used by the bank
to confirm your identity.

490
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,249
What do you mean, Father?

491
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,295
The details will be revealed to you
when the time comes.

492
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,382
I am heartbroken…

493
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,635
about what happened to Chanhee.

494
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,098
Divorce must have…

495
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,934
crossed your thoughts,

496
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,978
but save it for later.

497
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,815
Much, much later.

498
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,611
Now is not the time.

499
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:37,116
There is something I must ask you

500
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,660
to do for me.

501
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,041
You know how much I trust you, right?

502
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,421
Please remain a member
of the Hwain family until then.

503
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,677
I have to protect NOW Foundation.

504
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,808
Even to the point of risking your life?

505
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,144
If someone threatens my life

506
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,064
because of the life I lead…

507
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,777
I'd much rather have that
than live wealthily while hiding…

508
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,658
and begging for my life.

509
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,956
Do you want to die that badly?

510
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,921
I'm asking you if you want to die.

511
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,969
Chairman Kim Duo did not die here
at the Grand Palace.

512
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,934
Didn't I tell you

513
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,603
that the same person who killed my friend
is now after your life?

514
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,771
It's not ISIS!

515
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,775
Someone in that house wants you dead.

516
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,861
What did you say?

517
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,989
Mr. L is coming?

518
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,826
A Korean policeman died
a few months ago in our area.

519
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,829
Mr. L did that.

520
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,915
He has another gig in Manila today.

521
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,001
-Where in Manila?
-Makati shopping district.

522
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,296
He'll be working alone.

523
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,847
A friend of mine
who I considered a brother died.

524
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,643
I was there at the scene as he died.

525
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,437
But…

526
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,607
the police
stopped investigating his death.

527
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,610
Although I volunteered
to investigate it myself,

528
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,069
they didn't let me.

529
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,367
He left me some videos.

530
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,077
What videos?

531
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,165
The proof that Chairman Kim Duo
did not die at the Grand Palace.

532
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,959
What?

533
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,672
My friend was investigating
Chairman Kim's death,

534
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,883
so that would mean
the person who killed him

535
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,303
is the same person
who attacked you in Manila.

536
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,264
And you're saying…

537
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,100
that it's someone at Hwain?

538
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,729
Yes. Murder for hire.

539
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,634
The car is ready.

540
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,223
This is the Nomanee Sophi
that the Chairwoman had us prepare.

541
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,101
It was bought at an auction yesterday
for 150 million won.

542
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,852
You can deliver the wine, Ms. Yoon.

543
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,231
The chairwoman wanted you
to deliver it personally.

544
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,826
We should go.

545
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,431
Director Oh Wansoo is here to see you.

546
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,674
You're here.

547
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,094
The chairwoman will be here any minute.

548
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,598
I was getting a massage.
I just need to get changed.

549
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,724
Daniel.

550
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,731
Oh, leave that.
Can you go fill up the bathtub for me?

551
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:19,857
Yes, ma'am.

552
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,487
You have a new butler.

553
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,405
He studied at the butler academy
in Switzerland.

554
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,574
Did Mother send us the wine?

555
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,703
She apparently bought it
for 150 million won at an auction.

556
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,420
That's 150 million…

557
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,551
My hand was slippery
from the aromatherapy.

558
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,054
You should have been more careful.

559
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,099
It's shattered.

560
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,102
You're right.

561
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,271
It broke.

562
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,067
I can see that.

563
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,198
Have a seat over there.
What tea would you like?

564
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,409
Earl Grey.

565
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,328
Daniel.

566
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,747
Can you get a cup of Earl Grey, please?

567
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,832
Yes, ma'am.

568
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,835
Are you okay?

569
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,212
I will clean it up right away.

570
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,383
Do we have the same wine in our cellar?

571
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,013
"Nomanee Sophi. Year 1986."

572
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,141
Yes, ma'am. We have it.

573
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,309
Oh, thank goodness.

574
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,313
Wansoo, I'll go and get changed.

575
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,616
Wansoo's here already.
You need to get over here.

576
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,662
How should I know?

577
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,165
I'm so annoyed I don't even want
to ask her about the press conference.

578
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,959
My phone wouldn't stop ringing
because of that.

579
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,795
Okay. Hurry.

580
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,677
- You've come a long way.
- Don't mention it.

581
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,513
I should visit more often.

582
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,115
The wine is a gift from my mother-in-law.

583
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,661
Please enjoy yourselves.

584
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,169
No, thank you. Pour them a glass first.

585
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,758
Does that make this wine
worth 200 billion won?

586
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,552
How witty of you.

587
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,932
You investing in our duty-free shops
is a win-win situation

588
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,308
for both our families.

589
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,102
Yes, and I'm grateful that you let us.

590
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,355
I've sent the papers
over to you for approval.

591
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,774
We're in the cosmetics industry,

592
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,319
so why should we have to invest
in their duty-shop business?

593
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,155
You don't have to
if you don't see the need for it.

594
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,076
That's right.

595
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,787
At the party you held in Manila,

596
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,040
how did your talk
with the Chinese Ambassador go?

597
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,625
There was progress, right?

598
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,468
Didn't he promise
to throw you a banquet in Seoul

599
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,637
with Chairman Seo and his wife as guests?

600
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,976
Oh! That's great news.

601
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,895
Director Oh is capable of doing
such great things.

602
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,939
For now…

603
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,233
it hasn't been confirmed yet.

604
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,448
Then you can get it confirmed.

605
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,158
As she should.

606
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,203
That's the only reason
Mr. Seo agreed to the investment.

607
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:05,040
That's right. Our cosmetics brand
has been having difficulties in China.

608
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,042
You have nothing to worry about.

609
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,129
She's a global celebrity.

610
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,631
She's great at making
the right connections.

611
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,300
You can trust her to get it done.

612
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:19,388
You're right. My friends always ask me
questions about Ms. Oh.

613
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,974
Daniel, I think it's time for main course.

614
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,058
Yes, ma'am.

615
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,519
Is that so?

616
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,230
Before we forget,
how about we make a toast?

617
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,315
Of course.

618
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,567
Would you do the honors?

619
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,235
I will, thank you.

620
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:38,073
Here's to Hwain
and Cosmo's eternal prosperity.

621
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,243
Cheers.

622
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,470
Hey!

623
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,810
Are you telling me not to meddle
in the foundation's affairs

624
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,104
by delaying that deal with China?

625
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,775
As long as you promise
NOW Foundation's independence,

626
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,028
I'll make sure that their brand
gets approved by China's FDA.

627
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,239
I'll have them allow us to open
our duty-free shop there as well.

628
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,617
Hmm…

629
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,663
How could you try to embarrass me

630
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,873
in front of my in-laws?

631
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,833
Do your job right!

632
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,103
I was wondering…

633
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,231
Is it true that Butler Byeon graduated
from Seoul National University?

634
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,275
Apparently, she went to law school.

635
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,695
No, she majored in English Literature.

636
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,279
But why did she become a butler
after graduating

637
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,447
from such a prestigious school?

638
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,740
Tell me about it.

639
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,159
The chairwoman's father

640
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,954
paid for her tuition
and her family's living expenses

641
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,958
since middle school so that she'd aid
the chairwoman for the rest of her life.

642
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,543
Then she'll be a servant all her life.

643
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,712
Were you talking about me?

644
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,384
I'm sorry, Ms. Byeon. I was out of line.

645
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,053
But Ms. Byeon.

646
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,848
Why are you spending
your entire life here?

647
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,561
Because I have enough time to read

648
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,273
and also because the people here
are in need of my service.

649
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,152
One more thing, Ms. Byeon.

650
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,112
How should we address that woman?

651
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,530
The woman with the child?

652
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,449
Yes.

653
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,368
How does Director Oh address her?

654
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,870
"Mistress."

655
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,997
Then you can address her as that.

656
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,625
So she's calling her a concubine?

657
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,462
You could say that.

658
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,672
Hey, you. Butler.

659
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:08,182
What are you staring at, butler?

660
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,559
-What is it, ma'am?
-Ah!

661
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,063
It must be because I'm not addressing you
as "Ms. Byeon," right?

662
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,482
Do you need something?

663
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:21,612
I'll be stepping outside to interview
my son's new private tutor.

664
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,238
I'll be the one to take care of that.

665
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,116
Ah… Wait.

666
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,786
A butler shouldn't pick out
his private tutor.

667
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:29,995
That's my job.

668
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,206
I can't just let anyone into this house.

669
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,540
Find something else to do for yourself.

670
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,544
Unbelievable.

671
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,425
Hey, you over there.

672
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,053
Me, mistress?

673
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,346
What?

674
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,473
What did she just call me?

675
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,892
Unbelievable.

676
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,354
How insulting.

677
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,358
Director Oh.

678
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,654
This is a gift
that Ms. Stephanie sent from New York

679
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,447
for you to wear at the opening ceremony.

680
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,575
It's from her newest limited collection
this season.

681
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,161
-Send her a photo of me wearing it later.
-Yes, ma'am.

682
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,164
She donated so much money
to the foundation every year.

683
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,791
I'll have to repay the favor.

684
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:23,465
NOW Welfare Center
Opening ceremony

685
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,761
Understood.

686
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,730
Where's Director Oh?

687
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,483
She's already arrived

688
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,985
-and is looking at the dormitories.
-Damn it!

689
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,280
Tell her to come here right away.
Let's get it over with.

690
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,951
Hello.

691
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,995
- Hello.
- Hello.

692
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,248
How does it feel
to be at the opening ceremony?

693
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,250
Well, I don't know.

694
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,376
- Ma'am.
- It feels very good

695
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:03,380
that our foundation is once again
making the world a better place.

696
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,364
Why you…

697
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,078
The weather is great, isn't it?

698
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,375
Beyond the running of this welfare center,

699
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,462
NOW Foundation promises
to carry on helping children in need

700
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,465
both within the country and abroad

701
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,008
through various business endeavors.

702
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,596
I would like to introduce to you
Hwain's Chairwoman Park Miran

703
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,891
who continually graced us
with her benevolent donations.

704
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,991
Please step forward.
We'd like a picture of you together.

705
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,451
Please come to the center of the stage.

706
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,577
Step forward, please.

707
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,412
- Please move forward.
- Step forward, please.

708
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,705
- Please.
- Please do that.

709
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,958
- Please move forward.
- Step forward, please.

710
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,751
- Please stand at the center together.
- At the center.

711
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,044
- Please stand together.
- Please.

712
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,171
- Closer.
- Please stand close together.

713
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,966
- Please link arms.
- Please link your arms.

714
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,093
Please link your arms.

715
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,303
- Please look this way.
- Smile, please.

716
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,889
Could you put your cheeks together?

717
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,225
- Now with a smile.
- Please.

718
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,394
- That's perfect.
- We'll take the photo now.

719
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,396
Please look over this way.

720
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,606
- Please smile.
- Now smile.

721
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,739
Darn it.

722
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,953
You. Step forward.

723
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,921
Come on.

724
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,725
You're all useless.

725
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,229
You.

726
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,689
Come here.

727
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,176
You smell nice.

728
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,595
That's right.

729
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,639
I like men who smell nice.

730
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,154
Darn it.

731
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,418
Hold still.

732
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,462
Let me catch my breath.

733
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,939
The thing about people…

734
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,567
is that you can tell a lot
about them by the way they smell.

735
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,448
You can tell what someone ate that day

736
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,118
by the odor of their breath,

737
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,497
but you can tell
what they've eaten all their life

738
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,124
by their body odor.

739
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,542
That means

740
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:12,546
that I can figure you out from head to toe

741
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,048
by taking a whiff of your smell.

742
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,260
I'm just a former cop
who grew up in an ordinary household.

743
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,469
Are you saying you grew up poor?

744
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,887
We were ordinary.

745
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:22,722
But for some reason…

746
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,268
you smell sweet.

747
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,857
We should do this again.

748
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,776
I liked how you didn't let me win
like the rest of them.

749
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,029
I was feeling miserable

750
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,157
since I was wearing
the same clothes as her today.

751
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,201
There's nothing like judo
to blow off some steam, right?

752
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,705
K1. Treat everyone
to a nice dinner tonight.

753
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,291
Yes, ma'am.

754
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,676
There's nothing like judo.

755
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,679
I feel much better today.

756
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,017
-Any irregularities?
-Nothing of note, ma'am.

757
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,768
Keep a close watch without them noticing.

758
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,562
-Yes, ma'am.
-Right.

759
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,564
Have Director Oh come and see me
in an hour's time.

760
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:13,648
Yes, ma'am.

761
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:25,702
Same clothes, different vibes? Oh turns
heads at welfare center's opening ceremony

762
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:32,918
Damn it.

763
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,339
Come in.

764
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,850
Ms. Stephanie sent it to me as a gift.

765
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,353
I didn't know you purchased one yourself.

766
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,114
Your mother…

767
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,117
You don't visit her, do you?

768
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,747
My brother is taking good care of her.

769
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,084
It must have been over 10 years
since you last saw her.

770
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,880
I see that Mr. Oh can hold a secret.

771
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,424
What do you mean?

772
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,556
Do you know that she's locked up
in a psychiatric hospital?

773
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,978
A locked ward at that.

774
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,276
Sit back down.
I'm not done talking.

775
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:47,325
Did you put her in there?

776
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,410
Me?

777
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,288
What right would I have to do that?

778
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,665
You're her daughter.

779
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,836
If people find out about this,

780
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:01,423
you'll be put in a difficult situation.

781
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,717
What are you trying to tell me?

782
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,276
You should be at her side for her death.

783
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,695
They say she could die any minute.

784
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,908
Wonbit Psychiatric Hospital

785
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,746
This place is just…

786
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,195
Wonbit Psychiatric Hospital

787
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,579
She may not recognize you.

788
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,625
She doesn't recognize me either.

789
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,543
Welcome, Mr. Oh.

790
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,421
Gosh.

791
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,428
This is a prison, not a hospital.

792
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,346
This was the best I could do.

793
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,724
It was Chairwoman Park's order.

794
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,773
Welcome. Please come in.

795
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,525
I want to see her alone.

796
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,947
I'll be in the car. Head inside.

797
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,594
She's in ward 3.

798
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:42,852
Ward 3

799
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,448
Mom!
