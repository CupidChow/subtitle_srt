00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,878
This drama series is fictional
and is not related in any way

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,923
to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings, and events.

3
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,949
What's going on?

4
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,310
Are you all right?

5
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,765
Ms. Oh.

6
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,439
Ms. Oh!

7
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,359
Oh Wansoo!

8
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,535
Ms. Oh.

9
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,049
Red Swan

10
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,930
Episode 6

11
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,354
Come this way! Hurry!

12
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,106
- Let's go!
- Hurry it up!

13
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,994
Do you know what happened?

14
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,204
Sir. Can you hear me?

15
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,337
We're at the scene
of the accident that occurred on Route 77,

16
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,881
the highway between Seoul
and Paju, Gyeonggi-do.

17
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,592
It is said that there was
an attempt on Ms. Oh Wansoo's life

18
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,635
as she was on her way back
from visiting NOW Foundation.

19
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,221
The police suspect
that her vehicle was attacked

20
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,639
by drones that carried explosives

21
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,518
as seen in terror attacks
around the world as of late.

22
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,980
Pull it out.

23
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,440
If the debris had lodged
a little deeper inside him,

24
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,608
it could have damaged his lungs badly.

25
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,984
How is he, doctor?

26
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,319
The operation was successful.

27
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,696
We'll transfer him to the recovery room
to see how he does

28
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,323
then perform a detailed checkup again.

29
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,950
Thank you.

30
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,456
I'll head down to the emergency center.

31
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,041
I was there just now.

32
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,294
Director Oh gained consciousness
and is now in a regular ward.

33
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,839
Q2 has only suffered fractures
to the arms, legs, and shoulders

34
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,507
and has no critical injuries.

35
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,968
He'll go into surgery in an hour's time.

36
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,886
Report this
to the chairwoman over the phone

37
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,180
and let me know how Doyoon is
once he's moved to a ward.

38
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,557
I'll go visit the vice-chairman

39
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,892
-and drop by the National Police Agency.
-Yes, sir.

40
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,710
Abrance Hospital

41
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,685
Sir.

42
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,647
Luckily, no one seems to be
in critical condition.

43
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,610
I see. I'm glad everyone is alive.

44
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,446
There are many reporters at the hospital.

45
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,573
The PR team is on its way here.

46
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,577
I said I get it.

47
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,076
What about him?

48
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,331
I mean the bodyguards.

49
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,004
They're both alive.

50
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,676
One of them had a successful surgery

51
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,136
and the other is about to have one now.

52
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,354
What?

53
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,029
What about the press?
Were there any articles?

54
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,364
Don't get up.

55
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,867
You're all over the news and the reporters
are lined up outside the hospital.

56
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,293
Mr. Oh will be here soon,

57
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,211
so I'll head back home.

58
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,178
The doctor tells me

59
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,390
that it was a miracle
that you weren't hurt.

60
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,730
Rest up.

61
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,065
I'll go take a look outside before I go.

62
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,700
Abrance Hospital

63
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,331
- How's Ms. Oh doing now?
- Please tell us.

64
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,958
- How is her condition?
- Please give a word.

65
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,044
The photo from the attack
and the press release

66
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,171
have been sent
to your respective company emails.

67
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,090
Director Oh won't be able
to answer your questions

68
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,009
as she needs
absolute rest for her recovery.

69
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:38,387
They say NOW Foundation has been receiving
more and more donations.

70
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,597
Is this true?

71
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,016
-How much have you received so far?
-Did you hear that, Mom?

72
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,434
Gosh.

73
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,020
She must have been born lucky with money.

74
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,522
We are unable to confirm.

75
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,608
We will send you the press release
at a later date.

76
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,612
- Can you tell us more?
- How is Ms. Oh doing?

77
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,781
Did her husband visit the hospital?

78
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,867
Please tell us more.

79
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,869
Excuse me, Mr. Reporter.

80
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,539
What are you doing?

81
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,334
Mom.

82
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,920
Mom!

83
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,213
Mom.

84
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,649
The mission failed.

85
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,818
I'm sorry.

86
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,113
Who did you say you were again?

87
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,240
Let's just go, Mom.

88
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,702
So what I was saying
is that she's my daughter.

89
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,287
And as for my daughter,

90
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,874
she is Hwain Group's Chairwoman Park's…

91
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,629
sister-in-law.

92
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,464
- Do you get what I mean?
- Ah.

93
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,341
-Would it be okay for me to record this?
-No, you can't.

94
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,052
We're not here to give you an interview.

95
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,181
What I'm saying is that she's here

96
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,100
to visit her daughter-in-law.

97
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,560
Then could I take a photo of you?

98
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,187
No. What do you mean, a photo?

99
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,273
You sure are bad at your job.

100
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,609
This isn't some photoshoot.

101
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,986
Make it look candid.

102
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,531
Right. I see.

103
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,949
Do you have a business card?

104
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,033
Hold on.

105
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,410
Here.

106
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,120
CBM Reporter
Hwang Sejun

107
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,914
Thank you.

108
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,254
This is my big break.

109
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,145
Are you sure we're going to be all right?

110
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,859
He's just doing his job as a paparazzi.

111
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,196
You need to keep being seen
so that they won't look down on you.

112
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,656
Go on. Smile.

113
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,659
Wait. You shouldn't smile. That won't do.

114
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,411
Pretend to be sad.

115
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,844
-How can I help you?
-I'm here with the commissioner general.

116
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,596
The commissioner general is here.

117
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,187
The Grand Palace

118
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,257
Mr. Han.

119
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,678
-Come in, sir.
-Thank you.

120
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,146
NOW Foundation's Oh Wansoo
attacked by drones

121
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,945
It's an honor
to be here, Chairwoman Park.

122
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,947
-Please sit.
-Yes, ma'am.

123
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:53,577
I thought the arrest rate for murder
in Korea was 99%.

124
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,704
I'll find the perpetrator
no matter what, ma'am.

125
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,918
But who could it be
for them to shoot guns and use explosives?

126
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,837
On top of that,
she was also attacked in Manila.

127
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,130
It's very concerning.

128
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,842
I'll find whoever did it.

129
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,969
I'm sorry, ma'am.

130
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,595
No need for such formalities.

131
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,390
-Sit down.
-Yes, ma'am.

132
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,769
The National Forensic Service
is working as quickly as it can.

133
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,104
Since it happened in Korea--

134
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,772
You're making my head ache!

135
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,733
I don't put up with excuses.
Just find out who did it…

136
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,735
and give them the death sentence.

137
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,155
Yes, ma'am.
There's no need for you to worry.

138
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,574
Why do you keep doing that?

139
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,411
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,956
This way, sir.

141
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,249
Sure.

142
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,668
Goodbye, ma'am.

143
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,023
I think ISIS could be behind this.

144
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,819
We'll need to investigate this thoroughly

145
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,363
since the attack took place in Korea.

146
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,490
Commissioner General.

147
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,492
Yes?

148
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,121
Failure to catch the culprit
is incompetence.

149
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,831
I'm sorry?

150
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,208
But choosing not to catch them
is resourcefulness.

151
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,919
I beg your pardon?

152
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:30,424
Every time she is attacked,
people pay Director Oh more attention

153
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:35,637
while our company's stock prices
go down by 5 to 10%.

154
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,766
Right.

155
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,018
Yes, yes, I see.

156
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,395
I understand what you mean.

157
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,688
So you're saying…

158
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,776
you want this dealt with quickly
so that there won't be any rumors.

159
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,029
Stock prices dropping

160
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,573
would negatively affect the economy.

161
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,785
You're right indeed.

162
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,455
But the National Intelligence Service
requested the intel we've gathered

163
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,415
since the attacks could lead to

164
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,917
-diplomatic tensions.
-Commissioner General.

165
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,670
Do I need to spell it out for you?

166
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,844
I'll be sure to deal with it.

167
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,681
Of course. You can count on me.

168
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,733
Abrance Hospital

169
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,488
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

170
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,281
Do you need anything, ma'am?

171
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,493
Where are my bodyguards staying?

172
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,829
Hold on. Excuse me, Kim.

173
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,971
Seo Doyoon

174
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,375
Here, Doyoon.

175
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,711
It's from Mr. Kim.

176
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,796
It's footage from all the CCTV cameras
near the site.

177
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,090
Thank you. I'll treat you to a meal later.

178
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,300
Take care of yourself.

179
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,218
I'll contact you if we get any updates.

180
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,561
National Police Agency

181
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,655
What did the police say?

182
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,409
They suspect ISIS to be behind the attack
but are yet to find any evidence.

183
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,041
A suspicious motorcycle was spotted nearby
during the time of the attack,

184
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,503
so they had 50 officers look over
all the nearby CCTV footage over the week,

185
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,088
but they lost track of it.

186
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,600
Here.

187
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,686
Just like the last time,
it's 70 bundles in US dollars.

188
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,563
It's for Eight Star Fortune
in Incheon, right?

189
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,733
Yes.

190
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,444
Understood, sir.

191
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,037
Should I look further into
the police's investigation?

192
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
If there are any updates,

193
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,381
report them to me right away.

194
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,966
Yes, sir.

195
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,579
Can you be sure

196
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,000
that the money you delivered
wasn't to hire a contract killer?

197
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,335
That's why Juhyuk died!

198
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,151
The vice-chairman
seems to be creating his own slush funds.

199
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,652
How much?

200
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,446
It's not much.

201
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,907
I think he's created around 100 accounts
that hold a billion won each.

202
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,244
Let him.

203
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,456
He must be in need of money
without me knowing.

204
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,293
But he seems to be dealing
with some dangerous people.

205
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,672
I can't tell if the money is being kept
as a slush fund or for something else.

206
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,757
Hold on.

207
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,760
Is 100 billion won chump change to you?

208
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,512
I'm sorry?

209
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,892
You can keep your mind off that for now.

210
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,353
What did Yongmin say?

211
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,190
Is he still being stubborn?

212
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,525
I'll go and talk to him.

213
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,779
He doesn't want the foundation

214
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,781
even after I said I'd give him
our duty-free business as well.

215
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,075
I just don't get it.
What more could he want?

216
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,535
Who does he take after to be so greedy?

217
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,308
Cosmo's Vice-President Kim Yongmin
still won't answer my calls.

218
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,228
Leave him be.

219
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,734
I asked Mr. Han if we could split off
our duty-free business

220
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,070
to give to him as convertible bonds,

221
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,949
but I don't think he's given up
on having Cosmo join us yet.

222
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,284
That Mr. Han…

223
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,204
Keep a close eye on him.

224
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,124
Yes, sir. I'll report back
if there are any updates.

225
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,092
That idiot keeps trying
to look the gift horse in the mouth.

226
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,514
- Damn it.
- Sit down.

227
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,975
Just tell me!

228
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,561
It's none of your business
whether we suffer a loss or not.

229
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,147
This involves
more than just Cosmo Cosmetics.

230
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,316
We're investing in the duty-free shop
so you can have it bequeathed.

231
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,027
Look, Mr. Han.

232
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,988
Either the vice-chairman or Wansoo

233
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,906
should come here
and beg us for forgiveness.

234
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,783
That's not important.

235
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,578
It might not be to you, but it is to me.

236
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,663
This is why one's lineage matters.

237
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,416
She's the daughter of some measly caddie.

238
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:23,170
How dare she interfere
in our new product launch?

239
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,338
And how many generations are required
to validate one's lineage?

240
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,132
Your grandfather also started out

241
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,134
as a peddler who used to sell
all-in-one cosmetics, Jiyeon.

242
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,595
You… Have you lost your mind?

243
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,014
Who do you think
you're speaking to right now?

244
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,434
Vice-President Kim

245
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,187
and President Seo.

246
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,398
This investment will be beneficial
to both of you.

247
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,194
And Director Oh will never listen
even if we tell her to apologize.

248
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,238
What has my dead father
or my mother done for me?

249
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,074
All they offered me
was that foundation run by Wansoo,

250
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,659
not even one of our subsidiaries.

251
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,161
You're practically telling me
to suck it up

252
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,330
and launder money
for Yongkook's inheritance.

253
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,916
I told you
that I'd explain everything later.

254
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,083
Shut it!

255
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,961
Who I hate more than my mom

256
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,797
is you who planned all of this.

257
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,718
I don't intend to involve myself
with you or Mom anymore,

258
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,472
so stop crossing the line to lecture me
and just leave.

259
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,061
You were so quick to dump him on us.

260
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,854
Why are you ordering him around now?

261
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,900
Have Wansoo have the Chinese FDA
approve of our cosmetics line.

262
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,486
Then I'll give it a second thought.

263
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,530
Yes, sir.

264
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,032
I beg you.

265
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,618
Please think carefully
about what I told you today.

266
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,964
Who does he think he is?
He's just the family lawyer.

267
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,257
I won't allow it.

268
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,467
I agree. I'm with you on that.

269
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,427
He was the one
who arranged for me to marry you

270
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,179
after my marriage with Yongkook
fell through.

271
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,473
He convinced my mom.

272
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,518
Yes, honey.

273
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,853
I'll be right down.

274
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,647
Can't you answer the phone outside?

275
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,983
You startled me. Have you lost it?

276
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,859
Why would you scream like that?

277
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,653
I'll turn a blind eye,

278
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,155
so help me keep doing that.

279
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,740
A blind eye to what?

280
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,416
Damn it.

281
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,043
Abrance Hospital

282
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,503
Your discharge procedure
has been completed.

283
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,879
We should go.

284
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:38,930
The chairwoman sent me here
to keep you safe.

285
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,517
You can wait in the car, Ms. Yoon.

286
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,103
I'll be there
after I visit the injured bodyguards.

287
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:46,896
Yes, ma'am.

288
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,870
Wait here.

289
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,413
I'll be quick.

290
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,748
Yes, ma'am.

291
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,193
Q2 is receiving his checkup.

292
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,611
Please come in.

293
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,870
You almost died.

294
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,456
Just another inch

295
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,375
and your lung
could have been seriously injured.

296
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,168
But you're safe.

297
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,174
Why do you keep
putting yourself in danger?

298
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,510
My mom told me once

299
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,972
that there's nothing more honest
than one's money and one's body…

300
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,895
since one's money and one's body
follow one's heart.

301
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,401
Our family used to be poor.

302
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,572
My mom kept putting money aside
to give me pocket money

303
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,492
and buy me new sneakers.

304
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,829
She also worked part-time
behind my father's back

305
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,997
to pack a hearty lunch for me and Juhyuk.

306
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,000
I yelled at her to stop doing that,

307
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,921
but she told me
that she was following her heart.

308
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,635
Why would you ever
let your heart follow me?

309
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,471
There's nothing we can do.

310
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,432
That's not true.

311
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,684
I saved you, didn't I?

312
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,399
It happened before I even knew it.

313
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,110
I'm just glad that you weren't hurt.

314
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,240
But I can't do anything for you in return.

315
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:08,121
A friend of mine in the police
sent me CCTV footage.

316
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,624
You don't need to show me.

317
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,587
-It's from the scene of the attack.
-I don't need to see it.

318
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,425
I trust you now.

319
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,972
I trust you.

320
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,175
There are bodyguards
waiting for me outside.

321
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,555
We'll talk more once you're discharged.

322
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,807
Get well soon.

323
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,520
Don't put yourself in danger for my sake.

324
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,773
Please.

325
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,751
Stem cells are useless.

326
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,128
And colostrum doesn't taste good.

327
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,796
But time flies by

328
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,466
so mercilessly.

329
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,903
I heard your car was totaled
and set ablaze.

330
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,030
You haven't got a scratch on you.

331
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,740
I was lucky.

332
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,867
I'm sorry for worrying you.

333
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,244
And the bodyguard?

334
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,540
He was seriously wounded,

335
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,584
but he's in recovery.

336
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,877
Did he…

337
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,922
put his arms around you like this
to protect you?

338
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,926
They only do that…

339
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,762
because we're paying them well enough.

340
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,808
Can you buy a person's life with money?

341
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,559
Of course. How could you not know that?

342
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,811
Then have you ever…

343
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,106
bought someone's life with money?

344
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,821
That's a trade secret.

345
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,157
Your life is your own to lead.

346
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,367
Don't ask me for advice.

347
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,495
Anyway…

348
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,540
you must have bad luck this year.

349
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,417
How many times has your life

350
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,836
come under threat already?

351
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,422
So why don't you

352
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,799
try to be a nicer person from now on?

353
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,926
Then good things will happen.

354
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,930
And solve that business with China.

355
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,600
Taera said she wanted to make
an investment in our duty-free business.

356
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,768
Your husband's mistress.

357
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,188
Or is she my husband's mistress?

358
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,982
Anyway,

359
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,902
her father is Jang Heungsoo,
the former justice of the Supreme Court.

360
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,864
-I know.
-Her mother isn't on the family register,

361
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,866
but Taera is.

362
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,536
Her half-brother is a famous fund manager
in Hong Kong.

363
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,955
She says she'll invest
in our duty-free business

364
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,209
if Yongmin's family pulls out
because of what you did.

365
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,962
-And you'll let her?
-That depends on you.

366
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,720
Mom. Hold on, Mom. Hold on.

367
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,346
I'll let you in. See you.

368
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,111
The lady of the house said
she'd be here to greet me.

369
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,198
Mom.

370
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,825
-Gosh, Taera. Hello.
-Mom.

371
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,368
Good grief.

372
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,206
-Let's go.
-Okay.

373
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,999
I can't let you do that.

374
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,794
Ms. Byeon, this is my mom.

375
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,755
-I know.
-So what do you think you're doing?

376
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,256
I'm afraid I can't let her in.

377
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,802
Wait. But why?

378
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,513
I could drop by
to say hello to the chairwoman.

379
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,974
You cannot enter
without the chairwoman's permission.

380
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,643
If you want to visit your daughter,

381
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,478
you can do so outside.

382
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,646
I'll do no such thing.

383
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,731
Follow me with those gifts my mom brought.

384
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,566
-Let's go, Mom.
-You can't do that.

385
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,403
Ms. Byeon, it's me.

386
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,197
- Let's go in, Mom.
- What's going on?

387
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,326
It's you, Wansoo!

388
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,788
You see, this woman here…

389
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:28,000
She doesn't realize who I am
and refuses to let me through.

390
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,003
Do you know who her father is?

391
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,297
Ms. Byeon. I'll talk to them.

392
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,592
I'll show you to the annex. Follow me.

393
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,803
Hey, you.

394
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,559
You should take these inside.

395
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,271
I've brought truffles and abalones

396
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,356
as big as my fist.

397
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,609
We can't let in food from the outside
that we don't know the origin of.

398
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,072
Follow me.

399
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,158
-Gosh, Mom.
-This is unbelievable.

400
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,243
Wait here.

401
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,439
A hedge fund manager in Hong Kong?

402
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,859
Yes, that's right.

403
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:43,367
Her brother is quite famous in Hong Kong.

404
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,869
And?

405
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,330
I heard that Yongmin's family
refused to make an investment…

406
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,708
ma'am.

407
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,752
Let me warn you.

408
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,421
Don't overstep your boundaries.

409
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,385
If you want anything, tell me.

410
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,679
What do you mean?

411
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,723
For staying out of our business.

412
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,226
Divorce him.

413
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:13,105
Try again with something that's possible.

414
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,274
Why are you doing this…

415
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,320
ma'am? My gosh.

416
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,404
Listen.

417
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,241
Do you want to be kicked out of the house
without your son?

418
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,539
Do you think I can't do that?

419
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,056
Regarding the terrorist attack,

420
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,850
we'll give you the details
after we've looked into it further.

421
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,561
-Yes, please do that.
-We're still checking.

422
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,188
We can't go into the details right now.

423
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,944
Why are you back already?

424
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,530
It was nothing serious.
I didn't need the rest.

425
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,449
But still…

426
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,368
are you sure you're all right?

427
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,332
What is it?

428
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,544
The original copies

429
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,462
of the foundation's ledgers
I mentioned before.

430
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,588
Give them to me.

431
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,300
Actually…

432
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,637
there are two of them.

433
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,140
The ledgers I have have been altered
for taxation purposes.

434
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,518
Then does Mr. Han have the real ledgers?

435
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,812
I thought you didn't want
to know about this.

436
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,772
Give them to me.

437
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,444
I'm a senior managing director at Hwain
despite not having a college degree.

438
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,820
Do you know what that means?

439
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,033
I take the fall should any problems arise.

440
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,286
I know.

441
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,954
And?

442
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,248
I'll think of something.

443
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,375
-Wansoo.
-Hyunsoo.

444
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,837
I hated our mother,

445
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,049
but I can't forget what I saw
when I visited her.

446
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,718
I did that. You had no part in it.

447
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,970
She paid too heavy a price.

448
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,722
And with the recent attack--

449
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,140
Is it revenge you want?

450
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,851
Do you want us
to dive headfirst into danger?

451
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,437
I'm not saying I'm going
to do something right away.

452
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,105
There's nothing people like us can do.

453
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,524
Chairwoman Park and Mr. Han
made sure of that already.

454
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,860
-Hyunsoo.
-What do you need the ledgers for?

455
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,030
You expose their slush fund, I go to jail,

456
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,823
and then what about you?

457
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,910
You're the director of NOW Foundation.
You'll go to jail too.

458
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,620
We'll both go to jail and that will be it.

459
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,581
-Is that what you call revenge?
-I'll think of something.

460
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,167
We need something
to be able to fight back against them.

461
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,296
Hyunsoo.

462
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,728
How long have you been standing there?

463
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,063
Not for long.

464
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,399
Go to bed.

465
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,987
But what if…

466
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,199
Father finds out?

467
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,702
He already knows.

468
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,080
Now go to bed.

469
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,174
Yes?

470
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,306
How are you feeling?

471
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,809
Why did you leave the hospital already?

472
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,355
I can receive outpatient treatment.

473
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,232
I'll get back to work
first thing tomorrow.

474
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,951
Was the video that Juhyuk left you

475
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,787
the footage of
the late chairman's body being moved?

476
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,247
Yes, sir.

477
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,293
Then you must already know
that I'm in that footage.

478
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,420
Yes, sir.

479
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,923
Why do you think he left it to you?

480
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,427
To let me know
that Chairman Kim Duo was murdered.

481
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,262
That's what he must have meant.

482
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,354
You said that you were there

483
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,356
on the day he died, didn't you?

484
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,316
-Yes, sir.
-Did you see the perpetrator?

485
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,777
It was the same person
who attacked Director Oh in Manila.

486
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,944
Did you see their face?

487
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,363
No, sir.

488
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,615
I found out
while staking out at Eight Star Fortune.

489
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,535
I noticed that the person had
a peculiar habit when using a knife.

490
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,662
And what's that?

491
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,879
You must still suspect me.

492
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,597
I ran another errand for the vice-chairman

493
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,307
to Eight Star Fortune.

494
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,768
Sir.

495
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,480
Go on.

496
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,901
Of all the people in Hwain,

497
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,698
who do you think wanted Chairman Kim Duo
and Director Oh gone the most?

498
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,574
I don't know.

499
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,326
How much do you think
the vice-chairman fits that profile?

500
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,454
The vice-chairman was loved
by the late chairman.

501
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,039
They had a great relationship.

502
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,417
He had no reason to do that to his father.

503
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,421
You went on an errand to deliver money
to Eight Star Fortune again.

504
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,341
I'm sure someone there
planned the recent attack as well.

505
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,970
Do you think the vice-chairman
could have had a part in this?

506
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,557
The vice-chairman? That's nonsense.

507
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,060
Doesn't the vice-chairman also need
NOW Foundation's slush funds to survive?

508
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,982
You should go back to the force.

509
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,985
If you want to find who killed Juhyuk,
you can do that as a policeman.

510
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,029
There won't be any trouble your way

511
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,991
if you had no part in Juhyuk's death.

512
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,701
You've given me plenty of trouble already.

513
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,827
I swear that I'll find…

514
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,121
the person who murdered Juhyuk.

515
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,791
I don't want to lose you as well.

516
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,214
Who had the most to gain
from Chairman Kim Duo's death?

517
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,216
-How should I know?
-What about the inheritance?

518
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,218
-How would I know that?
-Sir!

519
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,138
Please…

520
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,891
Please help me.

521
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,059
I'm begging you.

522
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,188
Eight Star Fortune…

523
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,857
The money you deliver there…

524
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,026
What is it for?

525
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,915
What the perpetrator is after

526
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,084
is NOW Foundation
where Hwain's slush fund is stored.

527
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,506
But why did they murder Chairman Kim Duo
who had nothing to do with the slush fund?

528
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,075
What are you doing here?
What about the CCTV?

529
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:53,787
Butler Byeon is the only one
who monitors the CCTVs here,

530
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,956
and she just left the house.

531
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,666
I'll get right to the point.

532
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,750
Go ahead.

533
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,421
The original copies
of NOW Foundation's ledgers

534
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,339
should be somewhere
in Mr. Han's study at the annex.

535
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,967
Please get that for me.

536
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,144
Be careful.

537
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,313
I'll leave now.

538
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,571
I'll take care of it,

539
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,031
so don't do anything.

540
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,033
You should go after
your friend's murderer.

541
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,160
I'll go after Hwain Group.

542
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,578
It's dangerous,

543
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,538
so please don't do anything.

544
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,832
I'm sure that the attacker is anxious
after failing again.

545
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,376
There's no telling what they'll do.

546
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,461
That's why…

547
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,005
we need something
that we can hold against them

548
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,632
in order to fight back.

549
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,985
Thank you

550
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,112
for coming back.

551
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,965
Two bags of onions
and two bags of cabbages.

552
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,344
- The same as last time?
- Yes, ma'am.

553
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,428
They're from the same grocer.

554
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,514
Grocery list

555
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,938
There are no CCTVs at the annex.

556
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,566
It's so that they can hide
whoever comes and goes.

557
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,528
This is where illegal meetings take place
and bribes are exchanged.

558
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,667
What are you doing there, K1?

559
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,047
It's nothing, sir.

560
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,727
What was she looking at?
I don't see anything.

561
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,440
Come here. Come here.

562
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,572
Good boy. Good dog.

563
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,086
Please scan your fingerprint again.

564
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,011
Ms. Byeon is looking for you.
You should head over.

565
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,055
The chairwoman asked me
to bring her some more water

566
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,514
since the meeting was dragging on.

567
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,933
Is that so? I'll do it.

568
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,059
Who's in there with her?

569
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,561
The chairwoman,
the vice-chairman, and Mr. Han.

570
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,812
Okay. You go ahead.

571
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:53,897
Okay.

572
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,940
You're the new head of the RF Team
who guards Director Oh, right?

573
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,975
Your fingerprint has been recognized.

574
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,697
What will you do about Cosmo Cosmetics?

575
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,949
I'll try to convince Vice-President Kim.

576
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,577
We'll split off our duty-free business
to leave to him as inheritance.

577
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,037
I don't see why not.

578
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,999
Then leave that to Mr. Han.
Pay no mind to Yongmin's antics.

579
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,216
Please enter the passcode.

580
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,940
Who? Seo Doyoon?

581
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,024
Yes, sir.

582
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,735
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

583
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,949
Head to NOW Foundation immediately.

584
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,992
-Keep a close eye and report to me.
-Yes, sir.

585
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,454
Ledger
Year 2022

586
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,170
NOW Foundation

587
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,254
Senior Managing Director Baek

588
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,843
Your fingerprint has been recognized.

589
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,988
The Grand Palace

590
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,997
The safe has been unlocked.

591
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,087
Hwain Group slush fund management ledger
Year 2022

592
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,393
Is the director in?

593
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,646
Mr. Oh told me to deliver this bag
to Director Oh.

594
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,023
But Mr. Oh is already here.

595
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,985
He just arrived.

596
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:34,988
Yes.

597
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,531
I know.

598
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,378
I've brought the bag
that you asked for, Mr. Oh.

599
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,838
What? I did?

600
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,006
Give it to me.

601
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,308
You can go now.

602
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,852
No.

603
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,353
Let me hold on to it.

604
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,521
What is it?

605
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,064
Give me a moment, Hyunsoo.

606
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,611
It's dangerous. I'll hold onto it.

607
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,705
Hyunsoo.

608
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,752
What is it?

609
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,089
I'll see you later.

610
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,304
- We're from the prosecution.
- Hey.

611
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,722
- You can't go in!
- Hold on!

612
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,140
We're from the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

613
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,976
What's going on?

614
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,398
This is a search and seizure warrant
for NOW Foundation.

615
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,692
We ask for your cooperation.

616
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,110
- Start searching.
- Yes, sir.

617
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,364
And…

618
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,659
this is an arrest warrant.

619
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:06,913
Mr. Oh. You're under arrest
for embezzling funds from NOW Foundation.

620
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,290
- Take him in.
- Yes, sir.

621
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,132
Come with us.

622
