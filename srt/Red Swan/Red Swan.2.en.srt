1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,962
This drama series is fictional
and is not related in any way

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:06,965
to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings and events.

3
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,903
Ms. Byeon!

4
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,613
Ms. Byeon! Ms. Byeon!

5
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,199
Ms. Byeon!

6
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,325
What happened?

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,869
Who died?

8
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,037
Did the bodyguard die?

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,874
The police are here
to investigate a murder case.

10
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,879
That's impossible.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,798
Who told you such a lie?

12
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,426
Ms. Oh Wansoo and her bodyguard…

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,012
Are you saying
that the two of them weren't lovers?

14
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,096
Lovers?

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,890
That's ridiculous.

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,433
Were they lovers?

17
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,311
What good is all this money?

18
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,065
What's the point of marrying into
a rich conglomerate family?

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,735
Their marriage seemed a little rocky.

20
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,112
How could you tell
that their marriage was rocky?

21
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,864
I can't tell you that.

22
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,866
Listen.

23
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,409
We're investigating a murder case.

24
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,691
Red Swan

25
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,239
Manila
COD Hotel

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,800
Episode 2

27
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,596
"Ladies and gentlemen."

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,724
"Welcome to tonight's festivities."

29
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,740
Hey.

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,006
Vice-Chairman Kim.

31
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,925
This is Seo Doyoon, who will be
joining our security team as of today.

32
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,178
Say hello.

33
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,063
I'm Seo Doyoon.

34
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,444
He saved Director Oh yesterday.

35
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,404
He was a senior inspector
in the police force.

36
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,449
Thank you for yesterday.

37
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,534
You can reward him accordingly.

38
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,079
He was also a junior of mine
at the Korean National Police University.

39
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,665
He quit the force not long ago

40
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,959
-and was in Manila for his vacation--
-That's great.

41
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,588
Keep up the good work.

42
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,500
Ladies and gentlemen.
Attention, please.

43
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,169
Please help me in welcoming in

44
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,047
NOW Foundation's Director Oh
and her husband

45
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,258
with a warm round of applause.

46
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,499
Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,751
Hello. Did you sleep well?

48
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,086
Very well.

49
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,254
Thank you.

50
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,403
I was born dirt-poor.

51
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:28,536
Year 1990

52
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,999
What a great shot, madam!

53
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,668
One more time.

54
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,046
Don't forget to say "thank you."

55
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,923
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,176
That shot was perfect, madam!

57
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,803
Great shot, sir!

58
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,847
- She's really good.
- She's adorable.

59
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,015
You're the best.

60
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,641
Let me give you two this time.

61
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,310
Stop giving her so much.

62
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,853
Great shot, madam!

63
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,605
My mom used to be a caddie.

64
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,109
Great shot, madam!

65
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,986
It's fine.

66
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,946
It's still on course.

67
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,413
You call that a great shot?

68
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,998
Do you really?

69
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,500
A great shot should fly straight.

70
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,668
That ball barely made it on course.
How is that great?

71
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,338
That really hurt, madam.

72
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,882
-Could you at least take off your gloves--
-You little…

73
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,675
Who are you calling "madam"?

74
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,968
Answer me!

75
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,514
This is my future mother-in-law.

76
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,308
I'm not just any "madam,"
I'm the vice-chairwoman!

77
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
- I'm so sorry!
- This woman who is throwing a fit

78
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:34,977
over being called "madam,"

79
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,065
is the only daughter
of the richest family in Korea,

80
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,736
and this man, the woman's husband…

81
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,655
…is the son of the president at the time.

82
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,115
Unbelievable!

83
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,367
Excuse me, madam.

84
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,744
Enough of that.

85
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,913
I'm so sorry, madam.

86
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,291
This man is a lawyer
who also works as the woman's secretary.

87
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,710
- I told you to get lost!
- And these children

88
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,921
are my future brother-in-law
and my husband.

89
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,590
I'm terribly sorry, madam, I mean…

90
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,926
I told you to stop addressing me that way!

91
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,553
"Don't call me 'madam.'"

92
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,012
"I am the vice-chairwoman of Hwain Group."

93
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,722
Just get lost. Scram.

94
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,850
Get lost, go!

95
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,226
Unbelievable!

96
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,562
Because my mom didn't know that…

97
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,524
she was fired that day.

98
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,185
Whose clubs are these, Mom?

99
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,979
They're yours now.

100
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,065
That old hag…

101
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,276
She'll be fuming
that her son's clubs are missing.

102
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,403
-They're mine?
-Of course.

103
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,071
Wansoo.

104
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,782
You'll start playing golf now, okay?

105
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,867
Okay!

106
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,169
Straighten your leg. Good.

107
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,254
Now, go.

108
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,300
You weren't keeping your eyes on the ball.

109
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,177
Don't take your eyes off the ball.

110
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,889
Very good.

111
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,474
Let's try again.

112
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,558
-One more time.
-Mom.

113
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,268
Can I stop now?

114
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,603
You can't.

115
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,979
You need to hit all 100 balls.

116
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,564
You only hit 30 balls.

117
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,281
That's it!

118
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,283
Well done.

119
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,202
Now let's try the driver.

120
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,753
Let's try that again.
Let me see your backswing.

121
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,172
Year 1998

122
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,177
Again. Your right shoulder is too tense
during your backswing.

123
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,720
Now, go.

124
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,305
Again. That was a draw.

125
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,182
Pull your head forward and keep it steady.

126
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,684
Watch your pelvis. Good.

127
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,856
Nice shot, ma'am.

128
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,983
Nice.

129
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,696
That was great.

130
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,827
I quit middle school
to start working as a caddie.

131
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,497
I made a living during the day
and practiced golf at night.

132
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,481
Just four years
after Pak Seri started learning golf,

133
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,651
she started putting her name out there
by winning various amateur tournaments.

134
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,905
While 15 and still a student
at Daejeon's Galma Middle School,

135
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,159
-she first took part…
-This is the last of the rice we have.

136
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,536
Hurry up and sit down.

137
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,247
What is it?

138
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,999
Look at that.

139
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,792
That's the US.

140
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,795
Well, I think
Pak Seri is quite the player.

141
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,797
- I think the most important thing…
- Quit caddying right now.

142
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,008
Why?

143
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,762
You should go to the US

144
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,597
and take the Playing Ability Test.

145
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,516
How are we supposed to do that?
We don't even have any money.

146
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
Shouldn't Wansoo go back to school?

147
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,604
You should keep studying.

148
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,357
She won't even earn 300,000 won a month
even if she gets a job now.

149
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,691
But look.

150
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,819
How much do you think Pak Seri got
from winning that tournament in the US?

151
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,738
She received a whopping 280 million won.

152
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,822
280 million won.

153
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,907
280 million won?

154
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,701
What good is putting her
through school going to do?

155
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,454
Wansoo.

156
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,498
You should become a pro
as soon as possible.

157
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,458
Don't you think so?

158
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,694
Year 2010

159
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,204
I earned my Tour Card
two years after I arrived in the US,

160
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,624
and I won 20 tournaments over 10 years.

161
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,631
After winning the Tour Championship,

162
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,551
I became a Hall of Famer

163
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,054
and returned to Korea
after my 12 years abroad.

164
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,690
Anika Campbell VS Oh Wansoo
First playoff hole

165
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,609
This is the final match
in the US Women's Open Championship.

166
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,196
Korea's Oh Wansoo and the US's
Anika Campbell ended the round in a tie

167
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,489
with a score of 11-under.

168
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,534
The two players have teed off
in the playoff hole.

169
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,371
If Korea's Oh Wansoo is to win today,

170
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,624
she will finally meet the requirements
to join the Hall of Fame.

171
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,795
The US's Anika Campbell
is taking her second shot.

172
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,964
The distance to the hole is 155 yards.

173
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,175
She chose the six-iron.

174
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,094
That was a clean shot.

175
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,308
- That was a great shot.
- Almost picturesque.

176
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,059
She landed the ball
right next to the hole.

177
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,729
Oh Wansoo must be
under a lot of pressure right now.

178
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,898
Oh Wansoo is now about
to make her second swing

179
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,816
on the playoff hole.

180
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,277
She has around 150 yards left to go.

181
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,613
There's some headwind,
which will be troublesome to deal with.

182
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,115
If her shot's a bit short,
the ball could land in a hazard.

183
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,869
I think she should use
a six-iron like Ms. Campbell did.

184
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,581
Um… Maybe number six here will do good.

185
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,461
No. Seven.

186
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,962
S-Seven?

187
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,047
- Yes.
- Oh.

188
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,925
- Thank you.
- All right.

189
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,510
Right here.

190
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,073
US OPEN championship winner
Hall of fame

191
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,665
Ms. Oh.

192
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:57,294
You used a seven-iron
although there was a strong headwind.

193
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,587
May we ask why?

194
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,173
When I first started golfing,

195
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:07,179
the only two clubs my mother had for me
were a driver and a seven-iron.

196
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,641
I practiced with nothing
but those two clubs for several years.

197
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,060
Then you picked out the club

198
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,437
you were most comfortable with
at the most crucial moment.

199
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,314
That's right.

200
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,817
Let's take a look at the legendary shot
she made that day.

201
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,943
SHOW! Star golf

202
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,730
Oh, my god.
You hit that! You see that?

203
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,160
You did that!

204
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,290
It was amazing
what you did there on number four.

205
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,208
-Yes.
-Over the lake!

206
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,628
- Right?
- Oh, my fucking god.

207
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,212
Ms. Oh.

208
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,131
Congratulations on your victory.

209
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,095
My boss wants to talk to you
about Ms. Shim Chunhee.

210
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,814
Though I made over 10 billion won
in prize money over those 10 years…

211
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,024
Wansoo.

212
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,985
…my mom ended up
taking all of my earnings.

213
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,406
She kept digging herself
into debt by gambling.

214
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,911
I ended up cutting all ties with her

215
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,790
and donated all of the money
that I earned thereafter.

216
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,252
- Wansoo!
- That was the moment

217
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,172
I went from being a pro golfer
to the angel of charity.

218
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,466
And now,
if we could have

219
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,677
the angel of charity herself
come up on the stage.

220
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,512
Director Oh. Please.

221
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,365
I'd like to introduce you all
to my husband,

222
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,909
Vice-Chairman Kim Yongkook of Hwain Group.

223
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,504
He donated 880 million won tonight

224
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:50,551
by buying me this necklace
at tonight's charity auction.

225
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,011
Thank you, honey.

226
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,897
Everyone.

227
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,443
Crown Prince Muhammad, who promised
to donate five billion tonight,

228
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:12,031
increased his donation as if to taunt
the terrorists who attacked me yesterday.

229
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,116
He just announced
that he would be making a donation

230
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,036
of 30 billion won
through the NOW Foundation.

231
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,956
Crown Prince Muhammad bin Amir Soleh.

232
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,052
I would also like to thank

233
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:37,347
each and every one of you
who has joined us tonight.

234
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,602
The support you have shown
through the NOW Foundation tonight

235
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,188
will be used to help
many children in need around the world

236
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,901
and the women
who have become victims of war.

237
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,404
I wish you nothing
but blessings and good luck

238
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,656
in all your future endeavors.

239
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,366
Thank you.

240
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,594
Hi.

241
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,221
Cheers.

242
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,388
You too, Junhee.

243
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,848
Cheers.

244
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,643
Didn't you host a photo exhibition

245
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,729
commemorating the 45th anniversary
of China's economic reform, Ambassador?

246
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,691
The foundation would love
to host that exhibition again.

247
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,944
- We'll be hosting a dinner in Seoul…
- How old are you?

248
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,570
I'm 11 years old.

249
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,655
What is your name?

250
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,240
My name is Junhee.

251
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,033
- Junhee?
- He's so cute.

252
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,577
You speak so well.

253
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,413
Cheers.

254
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,542
Follow me.

255
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,131
Just a moment, please.
Just a moment.

256
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,200
I can't stay here too long.

257
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,494
You looked amazing today.

258
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,037
You know that, right?

259
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,491
Honey.

260
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,244
It's just us two now.

261
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,956
Sure.

262
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,876
We'll do as you like today.

263
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,291
Honey.

264
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,418
Can you help me unzip my dress?

265
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,028
When will it be over? I'm sleepy.

266
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,993
Excuse me.

267
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,077
Hold on.

268
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,810
Wansoo.

269
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,611
It's not what you think…

270
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,738
Did you have to get caught?

271
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,828
Junhee is looking for you.

272
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,204
You should take him to his room.

273
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,498
What was that?

274
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,167
You already knew?

275
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,170
How long have you known?

276
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,925
You knew about us all along?

277
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,387
This place is full of reporters.
What if they saw you?

278
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,146
I asked how long you've known about us.

279
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,778
Is that so important right now?

280
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,058
Why are you just standing there?

281
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,166
You can leave.

282
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,834
But I have something to tell you,
Chairwoman Park.

283
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,086
Just do as you're told.

284
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,856
Would you like some as well,
Chairwoman Park?

285
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,361
Who do you think you're speaking to?

286
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,284
How long have you been
throwing stuff at people like that?

287
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,955
Since I was born.
What are you going to do about it?

288
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,470
What? Have you finally lost it?

289
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,597
What do you think you're doing right now?

290
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,766
Shouldn't I be the one
throwing things at you tonight?

291
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,185
What?

292
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,823
You must be mad.
You've lost your mind, haven't you?

293
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,325
I don't feel any better.

294
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,245
Why do you do such things
when they don't even make you feel better?

295
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,124
I was told
that you knew about them all along.

296
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,877
Judging by your reaction,

297
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,296
you must have known about it as well.

298
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,299
I took you in although you were dirt-poor

299
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,301
and made you who you are today.

300
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,052
I got here myself.

301
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,057
You…

302
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,602
You!

303
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,355
You had no intention of divorcing him
even though you knew.

304
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,024
Why would I do that?

305
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,442
I can't believe this.

306
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,235
Had I known…

307
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,950
Were you worried
that I might end up divorcing your son?

308
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,370
That's right.
That's why I'm fuming mad right now.

309
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,790
I was afraid that you'd drag
my reputation through the mud

310
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,874
if you decided to divorce.

311
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,126
Keep your hands off NOW foundation, ma'am.

312
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,337
-What?
-I heard you took

313
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,421
a hefty sum of the funds again.

314
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,548
-NOW Foundation isn't yours!
-It is.

315
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,217
My son…

316
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,430
I couldn't even take my son skiing once

317
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,767
because I had to fly all over the globe
to make it what it is today,

318
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,935
so it's mine.

319
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,979
-You really must have lost it.
-If I get divorced,

320
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,816
you'll be left
with a lot more to be worried about.

321
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,734
I'm sure you know why.

322
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,778
I hope you'll help me

323
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,905
so that I can keep focused on my job

324
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,698
and not end up divorcing your son.

325
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,325
Good night.

326
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,162
You worthless brat!

327
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,456
I ought to just…

328
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,002
Hey!

329
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,420
You!

330
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,175
I swear that I'll kill her someday.

331
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,407
Vice-Chairman Kim went to sleep
in a different room

332
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,870
since you'll need a good night's sleep
for your schedule tomorrow morning.

333
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,954
I understand.

334
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,582
-I'll stand guard at the door.
-You don't have to.

335
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,333
You may rest.

336
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,210
It's fine, ma'am.

337
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,797
Please leave.

338
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,151
I met my husband in Africa.

339
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,656
Year 2011

340
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,284
He was there
to personally hand over the donations

341
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,662
made by Hwain Group's NOW Foundation
since they sponsored my golfing career.

342
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,249
He spent ten days
doing volunteer work with us.

343
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,879
Hi.

344
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,768
After spending
most of the time quietly digging wells,

345
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,895
he asked me this question on the last day.

346
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,024
"Why don't you quit golf and marry me?"

347
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,693
Seoul

348
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,447
Hwain Group's Grand Palace

349
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,416
This way.

350
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,409
So this is what you look like.

351
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,079
Sit.

352
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,918
It's nice to meet you.

353
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,253
I heard your mom's a gambling addict.

354
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,130
Well, that's…

355
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,342
Only my brother keeps in touch with her.

356
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,928
Did you cut off all ties with her then?

357
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:38,349
She blew away all of my prize money
gambling in Las Vegas.

358
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,143
How could you tell me that
without any shame?

359
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,187
Because I'm not the one
who's in debt from gambling.

360
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,734
Your mom even caddied
at my golf course once.

361
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,486
Yes, briefly when I was young.

362
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,655
How do you know so much about us,

363
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,198
Chairwoman Park?

364
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,035
I can't let just anyone into our family
without doing some research beforehand.

365
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,288
You are right, ma'am.

366
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,041
How did you keep playing golf in the US

367
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,626
when your family was so dirt-poor?

368
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,048
Luckily, I won
the first tournament I entered--

369
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,216
You also sponsored her.

370
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,764
So I practically fed your entire family.

371
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,932
It was because I was a great golfer.

372
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,398
Huh.

373
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,611
You seem to have a spotless public image.

374
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,989
You're the model for
one of our cosmetics products, aren't you?

375
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,657
I am.

376
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,785
They've been flying off the shelves

377
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,536
ever since she won
the US Open Championship.

378
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,292
You know Ko Jinhee, right?
The one who died of a drug overdose.

379
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,586
I'm not sure.

380
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,339
She was either a model or an actor,
although I can't remember.

381
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,425
The one Yongkook used to date
before meeting you.

382
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,302
I'm sorry?

383
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,974
I killed her.

384
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,772
That crazy bitch wanted to marry my son.

385
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,623
Look at you.

386
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,085
Don't tell me you actually believed that.

387
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,171
How could I have killed her?

388
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,632
People might think it's true
when they see the look on your face.

389
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,301
- I'm in stitches.
- Ma'am.

390
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,054
You really had me there.

391
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,015
Goodness.

392
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,768
Yongkook says he loves you.

393
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,229
He does.

394
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,858
What a joke. What does he know about love?

395
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,158
You know that Hwain Group
runs a charity foundation, don't you?

396
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,327
Yes, I'm aware of it.

397
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,787
You could take care of that.

398
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,455
That's great.

399
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,251
Wansoo has been
a UNICEF sponsor for some time now.

400
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,921
Get the most expensive
wedding dress there is.

401
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,756
It's a once-in-a-lifetime occasion.

402
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,925
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,719
And you come with me.

404
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,304
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,819
Here's the prenup.

406
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,196
Prenuptial agreement

407
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,655
And the non-disclosure agreement.

408
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:44,327
And here is
your contract of employment, Mr. Oh,

409
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,995
along with other miscellaneous documents.

410
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,373
Yes, sir.

411
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,418
What about your mom?

412
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,838
-I'm sorry?
-The gambling addict.

413
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
Well…

414
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,885
Your mother…

415
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,512
Hmm…

416
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,350
I'm going to need you
to do something for me.

417
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,060
I'm sorry?

418
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,812
Tell your sister
that you found a place for her to stay

419
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,940
somewhere abroad.

420
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,985
I'm not sure I follow you, ma'am.

421
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,574
I'm Byeon Kkochbun.
I manage the household.

422
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,412
You can think of me as a butler.

423
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,580
All right.

424
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,001
Here are my contact details.

425
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,670
Feel free to call me anytime

426
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,088
if you need anything.

427
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,798
I will.

428
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,846
That's how my marriage began

429
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,766
and 12 years have passed by since then.

430
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,229
Why wasn't anyone on standby?

431
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,622
Where's the lady who was drinking here?

432
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,748
She went up.

433
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,834
Yes. Thank you.

434
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,127
You're welcome.

435
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,140
Are you sure

436
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,851
you were just passing by that day?

437
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,564
I'm not one of them.

438
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,107
I really was just passing by.

439
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,116
Maybe I should…

440
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,327
just sleep with you tonight.

441
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,768
Do you want to sleep with me?

442
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,892
Did you have to get caught?

443
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,823
Are you unhappy?

444
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,368
-No.
-Then…

445
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,037
are you lonely?

446
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,043
That's definitely not the case.

447
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,810
You should get some sleep, ma'am.

448
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,454
Let me, sir.

449
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,545
She overdrank at the bar.

450
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,306
Have a good night, sir.

451
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,328
Vice-Chairman Kim left for Hong Kong
on the morning flight.

452
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:17,913
I'm sure he did.

453
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,748
Chairwoman Park left early as well.

454
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,757
Let me look over the photos
taken at last night's party

455
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,509
before you upload them
to the foundation's website.

456
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,593
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,403
Director Oh.

458
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,154
I'll handle the checking out.

459
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,864
Have the car ready.

460
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,074
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,158
Follow me.

462
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:45,417
Seoul, Republic of Korea

463
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:57,262
The Grand Palace

464
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,928
Hwain Group's Grand Palace

465
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:43,892
Seo Doyoon's first day

466
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,314
This is the second basement floor

467
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,774
but there are windows.

468
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,193
That's where Ms. Byeon,
the overseeing manager, stays.

469
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,736
The maids stay here as well.

470
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,363
Hello.

471
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:57,948
They're our two chefs.

472
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,368
And these rooms
are for the RF Security Team.

473
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,038
-RF as in "Royal Family"?
-Yes.

474
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,082
Most of the RF team commute daily

475
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,501
but K1, Q1, and P1 live here.

476
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,627
I come and go.

477
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,645
Welcome, Q1.

478
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,277
What do K, P, and Q stand for?

479
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,445
They stand for King, Prince, and Queen.

480
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,698
The chairwoman, vice-chairman,
and Director Oh respectively.

481
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,159
I see.

482
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,704
I know you're the head of security here,

483
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,289
but you mostly work
with the vice-chairman, right?

484
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,957
That's right.

485
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,750
Then you must run
his private errands as well.

486
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,544
That's a given.

487
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,880
-What I mean is--
-What?

488
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,508
Regarding women?

489
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,511
-I'm sorry?
-Then what?

490
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,184
I'm here
with a delivery from the flower shop.

491
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,187
What is it that you want to know?

492
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,230
I mean, just in general.

493
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,317
Stop worrying and do your best
to get used to this place.

494
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,902
Yes, sir.

495
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,912
I found this in Juhyuk's room in Manila.

496
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,877
I hope he's doing well up there.

497
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,591
You said you spent three months in Manila.

498
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,176
Yes, sir.

499
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,344
Did you learn anything new?

500
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,638
No, sir.

501
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,184
It's unfortunate how he died while abroad.

502
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,812
We don't have jurisdiction there.
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

503
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,315
It'd be impossible for us
to find the killer there.

504
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,900
You're unbelievable.

505
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,571
Come in.

506
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,331
I'm Lee Jin.

507
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,417
I'm Seo Doyoon.

508
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,003
She used to be K1,
in charge of the chairwoman,

509
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:21,091
but she was reassigned to Director Oh
because of the terrorist attack in Manila.

510
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:24,302
Director Oh has asked to see you, Mr. Seo.

511
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,971
I'll be there right away.

512
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,070
There is…

513
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,156
something I must ask you

514
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,242
to do for me.

515
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,747
You know how much I trust you, right?

516
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:58,003
Please remain
a member of the Hwain family until then.

517
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,098
Go and see Director Oh.

518
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,891
Yes, sir.

519
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,366
Hang in there, Juhyuk!

520
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,743
Stay with me.

521
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,328
The photo…

522
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,393
Chairman Kim Duo CCTV

523
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,955
There's a secret
behind the honorary chairman's death.

524
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,542
That's why Juhyuk…

525
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,295
left these videos behind.
