Final episode

4
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,820
What do you think you're doing? Let go!

5
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,946
- Hey!
- Keep still.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,656
Come on.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,949
Damn it!

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,201
Ms. Park Miran, you're under arrest
for embezzling from NOW Foundation--

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,746
That was Mr. Oh Hyunsoo's doing.

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,164
Ma'am.

11
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,790
Can't you see they're trying to arrest me?

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,167
It's just a part of the process.

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,544
- What?
- We'll carry on.

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,255
You're under arrest and are charged
with embezzlement and breach of trust.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,051
Hey, let go of me.

16
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,178
I said let go of me.
Uncuff me this instant. Let me go.

17
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,055
Damn it. Take these cuffs off me!

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,183
What are you doing?

19
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,768
Why are you just standing there?

20
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,686
I'm being arrested!

21
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,897
Why are you just standing there?
Hurry and tell them.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,273
Damn it. Go on and tell them.

23
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,109
Tell them to get these cuffs off me! Hey!

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,360
Why are you just standing there?

25
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,488
-Hey, Sangil!
-What are you waiting for? Take her away!

26
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,906
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,115
Let go of me. Let go!

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,159
Hurry and tell them to uncuff me!

29
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,243
Why are you just standing there?

30
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,912
Hey, Sangil!

31
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,570
Red Swan

32
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,615
Hwain's Chairwoman Park
arrested for embezzlement

33
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,748
Did you see
the news about the chairwoman's arrest?

34
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,916
I did.

35
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,000
She'll be taken
to the prosecutor's office.

36
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,919
I'll head down and wait for you.

37
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,090
You're going there?

38
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,592
I'll need to hear
what Mr. Han has to say about this.

39
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,262
The prosecution is executing search
and seizure of the Grand Palace.

40
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,346
They'll find Mr. Han's safe.

41
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,435
But why did you have
my sister-in-law make the report?

42
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,147
You could have handed over the evidence
to the prosecution yourself.

43
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,651
I broke into the safe to get them,

44
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,070
so it will be considered
illegally obtained evidence.

45
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,572
It will be useless in a trial.

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,784
You should head to the Grand Palace first.

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,254
We're from the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

48
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,797
We have a search and seizure warrant.

49
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,465
Search and seizure warrant
Suspect: Han Sangil

50
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,011
Show them inside.

51
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,888
Yes, sir. This way, please.

52
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,494
We'll take any documents we see here.
Even the smallest scraps of paper.

53
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,871
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,460
Sir. What should we do with the safe?

55
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,337
- We'll take the entire safe.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,760
- Take every single document you find.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,596
We don't have much time. Hurry up.

58
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:42,972
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,975
What are you doing?

60
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,393
- I said hurry!
- Yes, sir!

61
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,514
What is it, sir?

62
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,474
Put your hands up
and start walking slowly.

63
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,443
The flower shop delivery is complete.

64
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,105
Do you see this?

65
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,565
This flash drive contains the video of you

66
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,693
killing Mr. Oh Hyunsoo
on a bank near the Han River.

67
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,446
Along with the scar on your back
that I left,

68
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,324
we now have plenty of evidence.

69
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,755
Let go. Let go of me!

70
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,050
Let me go!

71
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,120
It's your turn now.

72
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,917
With our evidence,
Lee Jin won't be able to deny the charges.

73
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,919
She'll tell us
who gave the orders soon enough.

74
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,507
And you'll be feeling the heat
since the prosecution has your safe.

75
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,763
Why did you do it?

76
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,558
-Do what?
-Was it money?

77
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,226
-What are you talking about?
-Or…

78
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,061
was it for your son, Kim Yongmin?

79
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,650
I could ask you the same question.

80
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,943
Because of what you did.

81
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,028
Mr. Seo Doyoon.

82
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,530
You used to be a cop, right?

83
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,660
Then you should know
how useless a mere suspicion is

84
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,206
and also know very well
what defamation is.

85
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,750
Hold on.

86
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,628
I don't think you know the law that well…

87
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,255
seeing how you stole the ledgers.

88
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,426
People ended up dying

89
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,471
because of you and Kim Yongmin's greed,

90
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,389
including my friend, Juhyuk.

91
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,100
Just you wait.

92
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,561
I'll see to it that you are punished.

93
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,611
Feel free to do that.

94
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,072
Under one condition.

95
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,034
It should be punishment
served out in a court of law

96
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,579
instead of something barbaric
like a physical assault.

97
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,509
It's been over an hour
since I asked them to let me speak to you.

98
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,261
What took you so long?

99
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,980
Things are looking grim.

100
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,148
What is?

101
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,026
They might be able to get
a warrant for your imprisonment.

102
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,361
Imprisonment?

103
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,071
Are you telling me
to go to prison right now?

104
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,572
I'll do my best,

105
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,450
but the prosecution got their hands
on the original ledgers.

106
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,788
Mr. Oh seems to have handed over
the ledgers to the prosecution.

107
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,458
I thought you said Wansoo's lover handed
the ledgers over to the prosecution.

108
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,210
I managed to sweep it under the rug

109
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,921
but Mr. Oh went ahead
and exposed the ledgers.

110
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,839
Are you sure that the ledgers
don't include anything incriminating?

111
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,217
Of course.

112
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,180
I'll do everything in my power--

113
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,390
You!

114
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,101
It was you, wasn't it?

115
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,770
What do you mean?

116
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,023
It was you!

117
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,110
-Could you be more specific?
-Damn it!

118
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,322
You're nothing but a lowly servant!

119
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,324
How dare you stab me in the back like this

120
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,785
when I've been nothing but generous to you
your entire life?

121
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,957
Would it hurt to stop calling me
a lowly servant?

122
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,054
You should look after your health.

123
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,684
Why don't you calm yourself
through meditation?

124
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,736
How long have you been preparing for this?

125
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,446
You're mistaken.

126
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,613
Were you behind…

127
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,700
my husband's death as well?

128
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,707
It was you who wanted
Oh Wansoo dead as well and I know why.

129
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,250
That's because you knew

130
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,211
that NOW Foundation would receive
the slush funds from Switzerland.

131
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,881
All I had was an inkling.

132
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,009
I didn't know it was that large a sum.

133
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,820
What did I ever do to wrong you?

134
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,491
You never treated me
as a fellow human being.

135
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,910
Then what about Yongmin?

136
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,622
Why did you have a child with me then?

137
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,374
It was revenge.

138
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,753
Since you didn't treat me
as a fellow human being…

139
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,297
I wanted to see how you did

140
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,382
when you gave birth
to the offspring of a servant.

141
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,067
What's this?

142
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:42,905
I'll have it so that you'll take the fall
for the contract killings.

143
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,741
Are you insane?

144
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,078
It was you who tried to kill Oh Wansoo!

145
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,955
Let's just say you gave the orders.

146
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,706
Hey, Han Sangil!

147
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,212
Do you know what this is?

148
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:04,093
The blood on the gold bar
is your husband's.

149
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,012
The bloody fingerprints

150
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,432
belong to your son, Kim Yongmin.

151
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,144
It was Yongmin

152
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,938
who killed your husband.

153
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,651
If I hand in this bloodstained gold bar
as evidence,

154
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:24,321
Yongmin will be charged with patricide.

155
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,031
What are you trying to say?

156
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,783
You should take the fall

157
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,202
for hiring someone
to have Oh Wansoo killed.

158
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,496
Then I'll bury this evidence

159
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,165
deep underground in return.

160
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,962
That way,
Hwain won't be dragged through the mud

161
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,550
since your son won't be charged
with such an appalling crime as patricide.

162
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,053
You must be out of your mind right now.

163
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,515
Yongmin… is your son!

164
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,186
And will you be okay
with everyone knowing that?

165
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,064
"I, Park Miran,

166
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,526
had a son out of wedlock
with my butler-lawyer.

167
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,361
And that son I had…

168
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,864
murdered my husband."

169
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,617
Will you be okay
with everyone knowing this?

170
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,163
If you take the fall
for making an attempt on Oh Wansoo's life,

171
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,791
no one will know
that you gave birth to your servant's son

172
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,835
and the world won't know

173
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,005
how your shameful son
murdered your husband.

174
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,134
It will all be forgotten
as if it never happened.

175
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,220
You're willing

176
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,015
to hold your own son against me…

177
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,517
to have me take the fall

178
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,647
for all the crimes you committed?

179
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,773
Then will you…

180
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,360
just let Yongmin go down in history
as someone who killed his father?

181
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,284
So all of this

182
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,828
was being driven…

183
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,667
by your insatiable greed.

184
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,798
And now you're using the crime

185
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:10,135
that your son committed to blackmail me?

186
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,180
You want me to take the fall for
hiring someone to have Oh Wansoo killed?

187
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,264
To be exact,

188
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,392
you'll be charged
with attempted murder by proxy.

189
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,186
Oh Wansoo is still alive, isn't she?

190
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,399
You won't have to serve that long.

191
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,609
I'll do my best to ensure that.

192
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,194
You…

193
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,862
How could you?

194
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,532
The affair that you had
with your lowly servant

195
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,702
sowed the seed that is Yongmin.

196
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,080
Kim Yongmin is the child
you had with the very servant

197
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,374
who you looked down on with contempt.

198
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,169
He's your son too.

199
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,673
Scrape together
whatever motherly instinct you have left…

200
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,592
and use that to cover up
your shameful past.

201
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,643
Let go of me.

202
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,499
You can have

203
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,626
everything you see here.

204
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,965
How much is it?

205
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,842
Around 100 billion won.

206
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,219
What?

207
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,678
I saved this money every chance I had.

208
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,514
Everything here is legal.

209
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
The bearer bonds,
the gold bars, and the cash,

210
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,392
all amount to 100 billion won.

211
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,818
This is all I can give you for now.

212
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,195
I can get more if you want.

213
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,037
Do you love Oh Wansoo that much?

214
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,961
So much that you're willing to give me
100 billion won?

215
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,131
I do.

216
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,966
But she doesn't love you.

217
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,551
-I know.
-Even though she doesn't?

218
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,890
It's unfortunate, but what can I do?

219
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,024
Was there ever a time…

220
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,237
when you really loved me?

221
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,410
There isn't.

222
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,223
Drink this.

223
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,023
I'll find a way somehow.
Don't worry.

224
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,608
You don't need to do that.

225
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,611
I'm sick of him.

226
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,280
That's just temporary.

227
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,866
You should live as the lady
of Korea's wealthiest family.

228
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,368
That's why I put up with you
being a concubine all those years.

229
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,703
I don't want to.

230
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,414
I'm telling you, I don't want that!
I really don't!

231
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,250
I don't want to, Mom. I mean it.

232
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,087
Goodness, my poor baby.

233
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,465
I don't want to live life like that.

234
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,219
You poor thing…

235
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,059
Application for confirmation
of divorce by consent

236
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,518
We'll need your signature.

237
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,606
Sign it.

238
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,776
Send the photos to the press.

239
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,110
I don't care.

240
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,406
Sign the paper.

241
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,104
That crazy bastard…

242
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,653
Move it!

243
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,831
Do you have a death wish?

244
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,262
What?

245
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,973
I have a friend in the prosecution
who served in the military with me.

246
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,810
I received word that the chairwoman
admitted to hiring a contract killer.

247
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,565
Then does that mean that she had K1

248
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,066
kill my brother as well?

249
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,528
They requested a warrant of imprisonment
for the chairwoman.

250
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,946
I'll look into it a bit more.

251
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,281
Visit the prosecutor's office in person.

252
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,657
Yes, ma'am.

253
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,368
Then come to the foundation
right after you do that.

254
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,620
-We have a lot to prepare for.
-Yes, ma'am.

255
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,296
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

256
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,344
We're comparing
the footage of Mr. Oh Hyunsoo's murderer

257
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,764
with the motorcycle rider
in the CCTV footage we obtained

258
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,850
when Ms. Oh Wansoo
was attacked using drones.

259
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,143
Thank you, sir.

260
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,482
Police officer personnel record

261
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:42,319
I can't believe that someone like her

262
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,613
is a Police University graduate.

263
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,074
According to Senior Inspector Oh
of the Intelligence Bureau,

264
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,785
she was naturalized
as a Korean citizen when she was 15.

265
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,204
So she was a Chinese emigrant

266
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,164
-who was born in Korea.
-Yes, sir.

267
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,833
That's how she had ties
to Eight Star Fortune.

268
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:01,088
We'll have you on board
as an advisor in the case

269
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,673
since you know all about
the people who are involved.

270
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,426
Help us sort out
the evidence we collected.

271
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,178
Yes, sir.

272
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,847
Do you have any thoughts
of coming back to work in the force?

273
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,683
I'll give it some thought…

274
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,561
after this Hwain case is sorted.

275
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,399
Get lost, all of you!

276
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,819
I said leave!

277
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,866
Take the staff outside.

278
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,619
What do you mean, sir?

279
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,248
Send everyone here
outside the premises of the Grand Palace.

280
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,792
Back to their rooms?

281
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,293
How many times must I repeat myself?

282
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,671
Take them outside the Grand Palace!

283
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,051
Follow me.

284
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,086
What is it?

285
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,714
Yongmin sent all the staff
out of the house.

286
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,840
He did?

287
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,717
He seems very agitated.

288
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,760
Yongmin.

289
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,465
Butler Byeon.

290
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,801
Ms. Byeon?

291
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,869
Stop.

292
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,416
Didn't I warn you

293
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,043
that I won't let you
cheat me out of my share?

294
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,846
Incoming call
Head of Security Seo Doyoon

295
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,472
Yes, Doyoon?

296
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,142
I'm on my way to the foundation.

297
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,978
No. I'm going alone without a bodyguard.

298
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,982
Sure. I'll call you when I get there.

299
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,164
-Yongmin…
-Where's my share of the slush fund?

300
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,419
I told you
that I won't give you a single penny.

301
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,379
Even with a fucking gun to your head?

302
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,425
Have it wired to my Swiss bank account.

303
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,469
-Yongmin…
-I don't need your help!

304
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,764
That's no way to treat your father.

305
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,351
I don't have a father!

306
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,192
-Did you hear that?
-Don't move.

307
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,864
He's just like his father.

308
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,784
A petty thief.

309
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,536
-Shut it.
-A thief who stole my fiancée.

310
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,248
Now he wants my money.

311
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,333
I told you to shut up.

312
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,670
You should have taught him better.

313
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,962
Shut up!

314
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,928
Give me the rifle.

315
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,596
Damn it. I said I didn't need your help.

316
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,056
I'll do it.

317
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,477
Let me do it.

318
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,453
You can treat me like a servant,

319
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,455
but that's where it ends.

320
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,085
Don't treat my son
like you would a servant.

321
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,434
You were lying in bed with my mother
right before my eyes!

322
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,185
You're no better than an insect!

323
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,937
You have no right to say that

324
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,397
when you're the one who wore down my soul!

325
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,364
You used my mother to get ahead in life,

326
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,200
and now you want to send her to prison?

327
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,294
No!

328
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,378
Please, no!

329
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,798
Yongkook!

330
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,674
Honey! Honey!

331
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,885
Yongkook…

332
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,386
Honey.

333
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,763
Honey.

334
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,231
You haven't called me…

335
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,983
honey in a while.

336
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,986
I miss those days.

337
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,244
Where am I supposed to hold down?

338
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,954
What do I have to do?

339
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,963
There's something…

340
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,967
I wanted to say to you.

341
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,391
I really

342
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,142
loved you…

343
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,731
…but I didn't know how to express myself

344
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,817
like a complete fool.

345
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,741
I really wanted to tell you this.

346
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,662
Hold on.

347
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,249
Try to hang in there
a little longer. Please.

348
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,794
Hang in there. Oh, no! No!

349
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,338
What do I do?

350
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,260
All I want is…

351
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,805
to look into your eyes

352
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,474
even for a few seconds longer.

353
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,387
This can't be happening!

354
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,892
Please, no!

355
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,604
Honey, please!

356
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,772
No!

357
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,822
Damn it…

358
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,076
Yongkook, please!

359
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,410
No!

360
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,912
What do we do now?

361
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,123
Shouldn't we call the police?

362
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,542
You just stay put.

363
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,295
Yongkook…

364
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,632
was killed by Oh Wansoo.

365
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,511
What am I to do now?

366
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,638
Yongmin.

367
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,765
Go.

368
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,725
Erase the CCTV footage
and get out of here.

369
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,895
Why? What are you going to do?

370
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,647
Get out of here!

371
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,107
Honey!

372
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,695
Damn it.

373
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,672
I'd like to report a murder.

374
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,801
What? A murder?

375
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,637
All right.

376
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,436
There's been a murder
at Hwain Group's family home.

377
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,105
Come again?

378
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,440
And the victim?

379
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,108
The victim is currently unknown.

380
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,674
Honey…

381
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,432
My husband died.

382
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,477
Ms. Oh.

383
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,499
It's locked.
What should we do?

384
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,167
Damn it. Climb over it.

385
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,183
Don't move! Stop right there!

386
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,685
Stay where you are.

387
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,190
We've arrived at the scene of the murder
in Pyeongdong-gu.

388
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,484
Ms. Oh.

389
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,323
You should invoke
the right to remain silent.

390
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,409
What do you…

391
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,245
mean by that?

392
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,707
I'm telling you that you should invoke
your right to remain silent

393
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,294
regarding Kim Yongkook's murder
that you committed.

394
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,242
Let go of me!

395
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,786
Let go of him.

396
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,831
Please stand back, Doyoon.
There's been a murder.

397
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,969
What happened here?

398
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,014
I witnessed the murder.

399
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,183
- What are you claiming to have witnessed?
- Doyoon, please.

400
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,154
Ms. Oh Wansoo shot her husband.

401
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,410
I barely managed
to take the rifle from her after that.

402
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,455
That's not true. He's lying.

403
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,842
You should both come down to the station

404
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,761
and give us your statements.

405
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,096
I'll do that.

406
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,586
Ma'am. You should come
to the station with us.

407
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,506
Let me talk to her for a moment.

408
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,299
Please make it short.

409
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,676
Okay.

410
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,136
Detective Lee.
Take him to the station.

411
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,429
Follow me.

412
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,308
Are you hurt anywhere?

413
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,896
Don't worry too much.
Everything will be okay.

414
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,787
Han Sangil…

415
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,791
Yongmin…

416
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,835
The rifle…

417
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,795
It went off…

418
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,673
Was it Kim Yongmin who fired the rifle?

419
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,469
I understand. I'll take care of this.

420
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,724
I'll check the CCTVs
and find where Kim Yongmin is.

421
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,351
Don't worry
and wait for me at the station.

422
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,369
The residents of the household
can now go back in.

423
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,789
However, do not approach the crime scene
since it needs to be preserved.

424
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,044
Ms. Byeon, we'll need to check
all the CCTVs we have installed here.

425
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,346
The system has been disabled.

426
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,186
Can you check if Kim Yongmin's car

427
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,354
is still in the parking lot?

428
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,360
There!

429
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,781
Mr. Kim's car is still in the parking lot.

430
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,455
We couldn't find
footage of Vice-President Kim leaving.

431
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,293
Then that would mean…

432
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,545
that Kim Yongmin is still here.

433
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,957
Don't move or you'll get hurt.

434
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,375
Get off me. Damn it.

435
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,545
-I'll take you to the police station.
-Get off me!

436
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,588
I warned you.

437
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,507
We should preserve
the gunpowder on his hands.

438
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,008
Get me some plastic bags.

439
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,429
Let go of me! Let go!

440
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,391
Damn it!

441
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,625
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

442
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,044
Hold it tightly.

443
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,129
Special investigation headquarters

444
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,012
Sir. The safe is open.

445
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,763
- Take everything out.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,738
Sir. I found a USB stick.

447
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,664
We have the forensics report.

448
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,045
Forensic chemical analysis report

449
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,129
Examinee: Oh Wansoo

450
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,839
Tested negative for gunpowder

451
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,717
Examinee: Kim Yongmin

452
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,677
Tested positive for gunpowder

453
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,513
This is the CCTV footage…

454
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,889
…after it was recovered from formatting.

455
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:00,684
Here, you can hear the gunshot
coming from within the Grand Palace.

456
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,188
As you can see, Ms. Oh Wansoo
heard the shot from near the garden.

457
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,446
Both the fact that Kim Yongmin
tested positive for gunpowder

458
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,323
and the video footage
that you've just watched

459
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,991
prove that Ms. Oh Wansoo was not there

460
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,202
at the scene of the crime
when Kim Yongkook was shot.

461
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:24,124
Hey. Don't get up. It's fine.

462
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,920
They issued the warrant of imprisonment
against Chairwoman Park Miran

463
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,713
for attempted murder by proxy.

464
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,924
-I'm sorry?
-She confessed herself

465
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,218
that she hired her bodyguard, Lee Jin,

466
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,221
to have Oh Wansoo murdered.

467
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,141
She did?

468
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,023
Corrections

469
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,910
I couldn't clear you of the charge

470
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,371
since they had footage of you
entering the Grand Palace.

471
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,708
But since the murder weapon
was the rifle that was being kept there,

472
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,669
I'll try to lessen your sentence
to involuntary manslaughter

473
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,254
instead of premeditated murder.

474
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,089
Trust your father on this
and hang in there.

475
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,456
What is it?

476
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,291
Are you here to lash out at me?

477
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,377
You're not the one who did it, ma'am.

478
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,801
I did it.

479
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,014
-Why?
-Because you crossed the line.

480
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,436
I should have never let Yongkook
marry you in the first place.

481
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,648
You're so different from us.

482
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,567
-How are we different?
-Everything…

483
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,155
from the world we live in, our lifestyles,
to the people we associate with.

484
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,241
Is that why you wanted me dead?
Because I was different?

485
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,790
I told you already…

486
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,625
…that you crossed the line with me.

487
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,710
It was you who crossed the line.

488
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,630
The line people don't dare to cross
out of common courtesy.

489
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,550
Do you think that I'm a joke
since I've ended up in prison?

490
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,260
-Apologize.
-To whom?

491
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,304
-To you?
-To all the people

492
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,223
who suffered
because you kept crossing the line.

493
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,850
-What?
-After you do that,

494
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,519
you should pay the price
for just the things you did.

495
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,146
Don't take the blame
for the things Han Sangil did.

496
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,984
Stop right there!

497
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,950
Who do you think you are
to be lecturing me around?

498
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,453
Don't give in to his demands

499
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,414
and come to your senses.

500
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,377
Why you…

501
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:27,683
Most of the executives accepted
the proposal to make Han Sangil

502
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,476
the CEO of Hwain Group.

503
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,604
The ones who did could have
borrowed-name slush fund accounts.

504
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,773
Han Sangil could have also promised
to give them one

505
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,234
or threatened to expose the transactions
made through the borrowed-name accounts.

506
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,988
I'm certain that Han Sangil blackmailed
Chairwoman Park to take the fall for him.

507
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,865
What could he have said to her?

508
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,116
I don't know.

509
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,245
But it was significant enough
to make her agree to his terms.

510
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,504
Do you think…

511
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,923
-What is it?
-About Chairwoman Park.

512
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,342
Weren't the foundation's ledgers
the evidence they used against her

513
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,802
to charge her with embezzlement?

514
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,179
That's right.

515
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,055
I have bodycam footage of the man

516
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,600
who received the ledgers
from Mr. Oh that night.

517
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,436
You have footage?

518
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,064
The footage of Mr. Oh

519
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,317
being murdered by K1.

520
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,945
Ah…

521
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,989
It should be Han Sangil

522
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,949
who gave the prosecution
the original ledgers.

523
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,911
If the chairwoman was the one
who gave K1 her orders,

524
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,955
she wouldn't have given the prosecution
the ledgers she killed your brother for.

525
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,791
She'd be incriminating herself.

526
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,252
You're right.

527
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,921
With this,

528
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,091
we'll be able to prove
that Han Sangil was giving orders to K1.

529
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:19,378
CEO HAN SANGIL

530
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,216
What do you think?

531
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,763
Do you think it suits me?

532
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:34,309
Do you still think
you can keep what you did a secret?

533
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,480
Rich people…

534
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,650
Rich people are weak.

535
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,487
They can never win
against someone like me.

536
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,073
All they know is greed.

537
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,201
They are clueless when it comes to things
like ambition or desire.

538
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,620
What you have inside you
is greed of the ugliest kind.

539
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:59,209
People died because of your greed.

540
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,254
I'm going to bring you to ruin.

541
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,381
I swear it on my friend, Juhyuk…

542
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,135
who you ruthlessly killed

543
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,596
because that's what justice is.

544
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,185
What is justice?

545
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,774
Who do you think
built up Hwain to what it is today?

546
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,110
Park Miran?

547
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,237
No, it was me.

548
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,656
I did that.

549
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,463
I'm rather interested
in the 18 trillion won

550
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,382
that NOW Foundation holds.

551
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:49,509
What will it cost for me

552
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,970
to buy out your love?

553
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,475
What?

554
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,101
If Oh Wansoo gives NOW Foundation to me,

555
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,355
I'll help you two settle down
somewhere abroad.

556
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,149
What do you say?

557
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,569
Or you can just take everything
for yourself without Oh Wansoo.

558
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,786
It's over for you already.

559
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,788
You've made…

560
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,499
a big mistake.

561
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,418
You were too greedy.

562
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,589
What do you mean?

563
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:28,674
The ledgers.

564
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,426
Your mistake was giving
the prosecution the ledgers.

565
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,847
-What?
-There's video footage of Mr. Oh

566
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,100
handing you the ledgers.

567
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,685
What did you say?

568
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,270
Had you not submitted the ledgers
to the prosecution…

569
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,565
Had you not framed the chairwoman
for embezzlement,

570
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:51,113
the fact that you were the one
giving K1 the orders…

571
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,241
might have stayed buried forever.

572
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,372
Mr. Han Sangil.
We're from the prosecution.

573
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,500
Mr. Han Sangil.

574
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,210
You're being arrested
for conspiring to murder

575
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,336
Shin Juhyuk and Oh Hyunsoo,

576
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,630
and for the attempted murder by proxy
of Oh Wansoo.

577
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,049
You have the right to an attorney

578
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,593
and can refuse to give testimonies
that might end up incriminating you.

579
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,761
Take him away.

580
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,013
Yes, sir.

581
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,272
I already submitted the video recording
of Mr. Oh's murder to the police.

582
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,607
The video also shows Mr. Han Sangil

583
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,360
being handed
NOW Foundation's ledgers from Mr. Oh.

584
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,195
Yes. We received it.

585
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,740
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

586
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,745
What are you waiting for?
Just get him out of here!

587
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,912
- Yes, sir. Come with us.
- Come with us.

588
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,031
What did you want to tell me?

589
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,165
Letter of resignation

590
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,629
This is…

591
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,007
It was an honor to serve you.

592
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,931
Will you be going back
to work for the police?

593
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,391
Most likely.

594
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,144
Even if I stop you?

595
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:51,316
I heard that the team in charge of
your security will be disbanded…

596
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,236
which means you're safe now.

597
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,990
I don't know how to thank you

598
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,368
for all the help you've given me.

599
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,247
Thanks to you, I was also able
to avenge my friend's death.

600
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,978
Thank you for everything, Doyoon.

601
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,208
Promise me that you'll be happy.

602
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,799
Hwain's Chairwoman Park Miran

603
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,384
will be put on trial under probation

604
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,261
as her custody period expired today.

605
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,472
She was cleared of
her attempted proxy murder charge,

606
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,474
but she is still scheduled

607
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,685
to be put on trial for embezzling funds
of an unknown amount from NOW Foundation.

608
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,231
The exact amount
will be disputed in court.

609
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,983
Reporting live for CBM News.

610
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,693
- This was Reporter Park.
- There she is!

611
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,111
- Quickly.
- There she comes.

612
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,740
Iam Correctional Facility

613
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,325
How do you feel right now, ma'am?

614
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,660
You begged to differ on the amount

615
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,827
you embezzled from the foundation.

616
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,580
Did Ms. Oh Wansoo not have
anything to do with the embezzlement?

617
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,290
It's said that the late Oh Hyunsoo

618
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,625
- had taken a large amount for himself.
- Tell us.

619
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,919
- Please comment.
- What will happen to NOW Foundation?

620
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,003
Can you answer us?

621
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,546
Do you admit to the charges?

622
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,507
- Tell us.
- Do you admit to embezzling funds?

623
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,883
Welcome back, ma'am.

624
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,261
You must think you won.

625
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,764
I don't care who wins or not.

626
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,558
It's not over yet.

627
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,103
You still haven't paid for your crimes.

628
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,653
I have to stop by somewhere.

629
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,280
Please take me there.

630
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,848
Mom.

631
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,393
Yongkook…

632
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,523
His death…

633
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,410
Let's just believe
that it was fate that took him.

634
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,833
The gold bar…

635
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:41,921
I saw it.

636
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,302
Do not trust…

637
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,472
Han Sangil.

638
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,434
Then…

639
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,271
was that why you took the fall for him?

640
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,815
He blackmailed me.

641
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,906
Damn it.

642
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,075
We'll forget about the gold bar…

643
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,952
as if it never existed…

644
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,124
…to begin with.

645
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,803
Don't listen to a word…

646
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,472
of what Han Sangil tells you.

647
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,518
Okay.

648
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,856
Stop him!

649
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,608
- Hurry!
- Defense!

650
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,901
Let's take back the offense!

651
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,905
Justice tomorrow

652
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,167
We need to talk.

653
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,386
Justice tomorrow

654
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,096
You used your son for blackmail.

655
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,848
How dare you do that to me?

656
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,143
Do you even know
why I made a mistake like that?

657
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,729
You're a parasite.

658
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,064
It was because of you.

659
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,401
Because of how worthless you are,

660
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,904
no one ever treated me with respect
my entire life.

661
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,783
So how could you use me like that?

662
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,703
You kept that gold bar all this time?

663
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,331
You've been hiding it in secret.

664
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,250
Yongmin.

665
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,211
Don't do this.

666
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,507
If you kill me,
you'll never get out of here.

667
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,135
I'll do everything I can

668
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,220
-as your father--
-Stop!

669
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,223
I told you that I'm not your son.

670
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,269
- And don't even call yourself a father!
- Over there.

671
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,937
Die!

672
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,105
Out of the way!

673
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,694
Get over here!

674
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,071
- Back off!
- Just die!

675
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,116
Why don't you just die? Die!

676
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,238
We will hold a vote to decide…

677
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,284
who'll become the CEO
of Hwain Bio's holding company

678
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,036
out of the list of candidates
as recommended by the board.

679
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,331
Also…

680
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,586
to uphold the late Chairman Kim's will,

681
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,171
the funds he collected to use
in the company succession…

682
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,348
will be given back

683
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,434
to society…

684
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,187
through NOW Foundation.

685
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,943
That will be all.

686
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,371
1 year later

687
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,840
We have a team of 30 people.

688
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,842
We'll be visiting Tanzania
and two other countries

689
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,345
over the course of 15 days.

690
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,513
We've prepared 50 boxes of relief supplies

691
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,350
and also prepared
another two boxes of emergency rations.

692
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,018
You did great.

693
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:50,229
- Would we need anything else?
- Hmm…

694
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,939
I think that will be enough.

695
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,276
The 18 trillion won
that was donated to the foundation

696
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,278
is being used
to make the world a better place.

697
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:02,450
I will do my best
to live my life to the fullest

698
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,118
and use that money

699
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,413
to aid and console
those who are in need of aid.

700
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,082
Ms. Oh Wansoo.

701
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,840
NOW Foundation's medical aid for Tanzania

702
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,687
We'll go ahead and load our cargo, ma'am.

703
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,771
Okay.

704
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,147
Let's keep going.

705
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:00,883
Long time no see.

706
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,555
But I don't need a bodyguard anymore.

707
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,223
And I'm no longer a bodyguard.

708
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,274
I'm here to do volunteer work.
