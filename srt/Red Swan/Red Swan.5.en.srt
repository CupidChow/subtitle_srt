00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,146
Mom.

5
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,875
Mom.

6
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,769
Mom.

7
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,647
There are men here to see you.

8
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,692
Tell them I'm not home.

9
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,158
Ms. Shim Chunhee!

10
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,334
Where's your mother, little girl?

11
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,920
She's not home.

12
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,547
I see that you're a feisty one.

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,467
-My brother will be home soon.
-Mm-hm.

14
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,013
Tell me where your mom is!

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,098
She went out to work!

16
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,058
She's not home!

17
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,643
Come on, guys.

18
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,022
Tell us where your mom is. Where is she?

19
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,524
Let go of me!

20
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,571
Where's your mom?

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,574
Tell your mom to come out.

22
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,619
Do you know how hard it was
to come up all the way here?

23
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,873
Ms. Shim. Your daughter is hurt.

24
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,834
Show yourself.

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,575
Madam.

26
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,786
Could you step closer?

27
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,969
Could you please

28
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,222
call my daughter?

29
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,059
Where's your daughter?

30
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,145
In the States.

31
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,940
She's a pro golfer.

32
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,777
Why do you want me to call her?

33
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,074
What do you want to say to her?

34
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,330
I want to tell her I'm sorry.

35
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,543
I want to tell her that I'm sorry
for taking all her hard-earned money…

36
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,132
and gambling it all away at the casino.

37
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,762
You still remember that?

38
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,100
Tell them I'm not home.

39
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,310
Get lost.

40
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,770
Gosh.

41
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,940
What are you doing, Mom?

42
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,443
Wan… Wansoo. Tell them I'm not home.

43
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,819
What do I do about those men?

44
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,488
Tell them I'm not here!

45
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,573
-Just come out, Mom.
-Tell them I'm out!

46
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,660
Ms. Shim Chunhee!

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,204
-Where is she?
-She's not here!

48
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,707
Where's she hiding?

49
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,256
Ms. Shim. Your daughter is hurt.

50
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,133
Tell them I'm not here.

51
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,718
Tell them I'm out.

52
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,876
Red Swan

53
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,925
I'm so sorry, madam.

54
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,261
I'll just live here quietly

55
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,806
and not make any noise.

56
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,267
All I want

57
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,186
is for you to send
my daughter to the States again.

58
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,440
Madam.

59
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,191
Madam.

60
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,278
Mom.

61
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,487
Mom!

62
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,822
Mom. Mom!

63
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,490
Hang in there, Mom!

64
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,783
Stay with me!

65
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,497
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Wansoo.

66
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,168
Mom!

67
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,551
Are they gone?

68
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,811
Wansoo. Get up, Wansoo.

69
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,362
Wansoo.

70
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,739
Do you know what this is?

71
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,958
So stop crying, Wansoo.

72
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,503
I…

73
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,838
Does this mean I can go to the US?

74
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,757
Of course.

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,217
We'll be off to the US.

76
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,971
Mom…

77
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,901
Mom.

78
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,695
I didn't know you were here like this.

79
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:50,201
I didn't even get
to tell you that I'm sorry.

80
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,746
Don't go. Please don't.

81
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,665
Don't go, Mom.

82
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,834
Mom!

83
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,171
Mom…

84
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,341
Mom!

85
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,688
Mom!

86
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,901
Mom!

87
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,279
Mom!

88
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,366
Mom!

89
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,161
Mom!

90
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,788
Mom…

91
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,877
Mom!

92
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,712
Mom!

93
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,301
Ward 3

94
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,306
Episode 5

95
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,983
You should head home first.

96
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,528
I'll sort things out and call you later.

97
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,155
What about the funeral?

98
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,282
We'll hold a small one for the two of us.

99
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,451
Chairwoman Park has ordered

100
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,870
that we shouldn't let anyone know.

101
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,976
Come in.

102
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,491
I heard about your mother.

103
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,244
I'm glad that you got to see her
one last time before she passed away.

104
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,458
Your brother will
take care of the funeral.

105
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,960
Tomorrow, you need to come with me

106
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,921
to Yongmin's meeting
with the Chinese ambassador.

107
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,841
I can't go tomorrow.

108
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,094
I need to say goodbye to my mother.

109
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,387
Are you nuts?

110
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,846
Are you saying your dead mother

111
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,933
is more important than a business deal
worth hundreds of billions?

112
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,184
I don't want to go.

113
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,025
If this business falls through,

114
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,779
I could have you locked up
without anyone knowing…

115
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,449
just like your mother.

116
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,915
Or your brother could be next.

117
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:58,008
Funeral hall

118
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,634
The cremation just ended.

119
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,179
Yes. Mr. Oh is here alone.

120
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,446
What about the funeral?

121
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,740
I can't go.

122
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,463
No, that's not true at all.

123
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,843
Thank you for arranging
this important meeting, Chairwoman Park.

124
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,179
Well, of course.
We're family after all.

125
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,182
I'm only doing what's right.

126
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,020
Thank you for making time
despite your schedule, Mr. Ambassador.

127
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,939
I'm honored to be
meeting such great people

128
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,899
thanks to Director Oh.

129
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,569
No, the honor is ours.

130
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:26,365
I've heard so many great things
about you through my daughter-in-law.

131
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,119
I think this meeting is an important step

132
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,997
in bettering the relationship
between China and Korea.

133
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,542
Director Oh has already told me a lot

134
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,379
about Cosmo Cosmetics.

135
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,090
I've told my connections in China
about your company

136
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,801
and they seem to be
very favorable to the idea.

137
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,886
Is that so?

138
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,139
Thank you so much.

139
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,515
Thank you very much.

140
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,142
If this deal is made,

141
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,227
it will be a great opportunity
for everyone,

142
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,645
both the Chinese government
and businesses.

143
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:03,068
I will do my best not to disappoint
Director Oh and all of you.

144
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,236
Thank you.

145
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,489
We should discuss this further
while we have the meal.

146
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,910
Would it be okay for me
to propose a toast to you, Mr. Ambassador?

147
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,495
It would be an honor.

148
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,580
Here.

149
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,664
Cheers.

150
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,166
Cheers.

151
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,632
This is great.

152
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,841
It's very good.

153
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,846
It is great.

154
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,401
I was ordered by Chairwoman Park

155
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,154
to store her ashes
in a cinerarium discretely

156
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,739
since we have many eyes on us.

157
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,055
Can you take me somewhere?

158
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,338
No one knows about the place
we're about to go to now.

159
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,508
I'll switch off the GPS tracking device.

160
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,017
You should switch off your phone.

161
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,060
I'll do the same.

162
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,650
Power off

163
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,659
This is my first time
disappearing like this.

164
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:21,957
I'll start the car now.

165
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,350
They've just left.

166
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,479
Yes, it's Q1.

167
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
What do you mean you've lost the signal?

168
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,442
The car's tracking device
and her phone are turned off.

169
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,526
Track them down, now!

170
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,572
-What about Doyoon?
-We can't reach him.

171
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,953
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

172
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,421
Construction approved
Secure our right to live

173
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,408
What on earth are you saying?

174
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,993
I'm sorry, sir.

175
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,786
What is the meaning of this?

176
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,830
Wansoo's disappeared?

177
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,291
She switched off all the tracking devices.

178
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,001
Find her at once.

179
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,004
Find her by any means necessary!

180
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,088
Yes, sir.

181
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:43,473
Warning
House to be demolished, do not trespass

182
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,294
Condolences

183
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,891
The place looks much smaller.

184
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,063
It's probably because I haven't
been here in a while.

185
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,565
No trespassing
Vacant

186
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,308
Wansoo. Tell them I'm not home.

187
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,977
Tell them I'm not here.

188
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,276
I'll tell them you're not here.

189
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,236
I'll do exactly that.

190
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,823
I went over to the States

191
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,159
and won many tournaments
to become successful.

192
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,706
That's enough, right?

193
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,417
It is, isn't it?

194
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,071
My son died.

195
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,201
He was adorable.

196
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,538
But I was too busy…

197
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,625
so I didn't get
to spend much time with him.

198
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,008
I thought he was in Switzerland.

199
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,304
That's what I tell myself.

200
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,175
Why aren't you crying?

201
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,968
It's okay to cry.

202
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,262
That way, your heart will ache less.

203
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,437
The late Shim Chunhee

204
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,907
Mom.

205
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,784
It must have been hard for you there.

206
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,081
You're now free to go wherever you want.

207
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,335
Don't feel sorry for me.

208
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,088
I've decided to forgive you now.

209
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:14,304
But as for the person who imprisoned you
there for over ten years…

210
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,351
I won't ever forgive that person.

211
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,047
The Grand Palace

212
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,911
Got it.

213
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,663
She's just arrived.

214
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,708
I've asked her bodyguard to come with her.

215
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,387
The chairwoman wants to see you.

216
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,459
-I'm home.
-Who the hell do you think you are?

217
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,591
-You disappeared with her.
-I ordered him to.

218
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,842
Take it up with me.

219
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,272
What is the job of a bodyguard?

220
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,149
What the hell are you trying to pull?

221
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,155
I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,208
You're fired.

223
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,834
Mr. Park!

224
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,213
Fire him right this instant.

225
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,574
Mr. Park. I'll see you in my study.

226
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,909
Yes, ma'am.

227
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,520
What is the deal with the new bodyguard?

228
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,813
Well, I…

229
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,690
-Give me his bio.
-Yes, ma'am.

230
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,692
He's a Police University graduate.

231
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,777
He moved up the ranks quickly and became--

232
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,154
Just the important things.

233
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,656
He doesn't have any family.

234
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,075
He was a very competent officer
of the force.

235
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,829
I'll have him work shifts
at headquarters instead of--

236
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,913
Hey.

237
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,874
The vice-chairman told you to fire him.

238
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,876
Well…

239
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,087
Do you take my son lightly
because I treat him however I want to?

240
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,464
No, ma'am. Not at all.

241
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,011
Director Oh will oppose him being fired.

242
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,472
She'll come up with some excuse.

243
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,225
Then you'll just do as she says.

244
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,478
Then what should I tell the vice-chairman?

245
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,605
-Tell him I want to see him now.
-Yes, ma'am.

246
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,190
Are you all right?

247
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,631
You are okay, aren't you?

248
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,884
Will you…

249
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,804
be my woman?

250
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,352
Why do you keep hurting yourself?

251
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,691
Why?

252
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,152
You did the same thing
on the day your mother passed away.

253
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,491
Why don't you be my man instead?

254
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,536
You should become

255
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,997
someone who I can trust instead.

256
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,791
Make it so that I can trust you fully.

257
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,462
I need you.

258
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,926
You need me?

259
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,636
You said your friend was killed

260
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,140
by the same person who orchestrated
that terrorist attack in Manila.

261
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,976
Show me proof

262
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,104
so that I can trust you.

263
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,522
I was the one who witnessed it.

264
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,566
I was there when Juhyuk died

265
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,484
and also when you were attacked.

266
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,403
I was there in both places.

267
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,906
You only saw the contract killer.

268
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,368
I'm asking you to get me the proof
that the person who wants me dead

269
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,579
is someone from this family.

270
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,855
You idiot. You fool. You moron!

271
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,111
Is that all you ever think about?

272
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,364
Didn't you hear her?
She cremated her dead mother.

273
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,241
Were you afraid that great wife of yours

274
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,744
was having an affair
with that damned bodyguard?

275
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,746
Did you suspect her
because you're always cheating on her?

276
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,499
That's enough. Mr. Park is here.

277
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:43,002
Did you or did you not hit him
while all the employees were there?

278
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,422
You hit him and asked him
where he's been with your wife!

279
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,342
I hear you.

280
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,135
I get what you mean.

281
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,430
I can't believe this.

282
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,059
Go and tell him

283
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,604
that the vice-chairman is sorry
and pay him off.

284
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,231
Yes, ma'am.

285
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,315
Now, get lost!

286
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,741
Darn it.

287
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,753
Jang Taera.

288
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,048
Are you going to keep her around here?

289
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,967
Director Oh brought this on herself.

290
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,762
Do you really want me to divorce her?

291
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,350
Your wife told me
that she'd never divorce you.

292
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,813
She's holding the foundation hostage.

293
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,316
That's where all our dirty laundry lies.

294
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,278
If Oh Wansoo exposes everything
after she divorces you,

295
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,238
you will lose your inheritance
and management rights.

296
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,322
Don't you get it?

297
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:01,789
The only way she has
of leaving this family

298
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,292
is through death.

299
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,794
Divorce is not an option.

300
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,255
If she won't do that,

301
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,092
I'll kill her myself

302
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,304
just like what happened to Ko Jinhee.

303
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,688
Chairman Kim Duo CCTV

304
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,151
What's this?

305
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,571
You asked me to make you trust me.

306
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,740
This is the CCTV footage

307
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,700
that was taken from the Nonhyeon-dong home

308
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,827
on the day Chairman Kim Duo passed away.

309
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,001
That's his body being transported
from the place.

310
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,961
That's definitely the Nonhyeon-dong home.

311
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,548
Are you saying that this man
being carried out is my father-in-law?

312
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,932
These are the videos that Juhyuk left me.

313
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,517
What happened?

314
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,521
Under the commissioner general's order,

315
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,481
Juhyuk was analyzing some intel

316
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,776
and found the mysterious circumstances
surrounding Chairman Kim's death.

317
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,195
He was following up on that
prior to his death.

318
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,366
He hadn't even reported it
to the commissioner general then.

319
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,953
Someone caught wind of that
and hired someone to have him killed.

320
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,831
But I'm sure…

321
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,334
that I heard he died at the Grand Palace.

322
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,297
That assassin
is now after your life as well.

323
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:38,136
That means that we have to find
who killed the honorary chairman

324
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,762
and now wants you dead.

325
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,182
The person who has something to gain
from you and Chairman Kim dying.

326
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,144
That person will be Juhyuk's killer.

327
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,897
Both my mother-in-law and my husband

328
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,276
don't have a clear motive
for killing Chairman Kim.

329
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,738
You just don't know it.

330
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,365
Whether it's either of them
or someone else,

331
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,742
there definitely is a motive.

332
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,704
What can they get out of killing me?

333
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,123
We'll need to find out.

334
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,465
But why do you need me?

335
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,509
What do you need me to do?

336
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,763
I need you to find out
more than what you know now,

337
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,891
then I'll tell you.

338
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,475
And for now,

339
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:32,064
it still has to be ISIS
who tried to gun me down.

340
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,192
That's the way it needs to be.

341
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,695
I don't know what you'll find out,
but keep going.

342
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,031
But until then,

343
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,450
it will be ISIS who attacked me.

344
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,454
What do you mean?

345
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,541
Is it fame or honor that you need?

346
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,959
Or vanity?

347
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,254
It's not like that.

348
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,883
I really want to help the children

349
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,385
who are suffering the same things I did

350
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,721
because of poverty.

351
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,182
To do that,

352
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,559
I need donations from a lot of people.

353
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,769
And I am the face of the foundation.

354
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,067
I understand.

355
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,696
I'll deal with you being fired.

356
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,869
This way.

357
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,954
Come in.

358
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,295
Why are you so startled?

359
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,463
I'm sorry, ma'am?

360
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,839
Come in.

361
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,966
Yes, ma'am.

362
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,725
I showed him the video

363
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,061
that ISIS sent me as a threat.

364
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,562
I received one more.

365
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,147
What did they say?

366
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,275
It's full of clichés.
There's no need for you to see it.

367
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,859
We can't afford to fire anyone for now.

368
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,903
You know why, don't you?

369
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:06,158
Yes. The vice-chairman sent me over
to apologize to him in his place.

370
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,119
He did?

371
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,453
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,580
I'll leave you to it.

373
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,666
I'll hire more people for security.

374
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,251
You can't do that.

375
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:18,004
We can't afford to trust anyone for now.

376
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,716
I trust Q1 since he saved
my life in Manila,

377
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,509
but I want to be wary of
everything else for the time being.

378
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,386
Yes, Director.

379
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,679
You should head upstairs.

380
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,391
I need to talk to him for a while longer.

381
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,517
Okay.

382
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,903
How could you?

383
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,834
I'm disappointed.

384
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,378
I know you haven't been here long, but…

385
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,506
You know what you've done
wrong today, don't you?

386
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,052
Aren't you going to answer me?

387
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,267
What kind of people live in this place?

388
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,144
Have you let them

389
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,730
influence you as well?

390
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,981
What did you say?

391
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,151
She didn't even get
to attend her mother's funeral!

392
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,904
She wanted to say
goodbye to her late mother,

393
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,322
so what do you expect me to do?

394
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,117
Before I'm a bodyguard,

395
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,078
I'm human.

396
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,662
The same goes for you too.

397
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,914
Damn it.

398
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,749
I don't think you are

399
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,919
the same person I used to know.

400
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,545
You should have let me know!

401
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,969
Are you hurt?

402
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,599
No, sir.

403
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,767
What video did she receive?

404
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,936
She showed me on her email,

405
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,354
but she logged out.

406
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,568
Stay out of the vice-chairman's
sight for the time being.

407
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,800
That's unbelievable, Mom.

408
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,553
How could she not hold
a funeral for her own mother?

409
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,555
It's great news for you.

410
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:37,226
That must mean their in-laws
are looking down on her.

411
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,061
Did Mother stop her
from holding the funeral, then?

412
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,565
Hang up for a second.
I should find out if that's true.

413
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,822
So that's why
she was so down in the dumps.

414
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,218
I need you to find out
more than what you know now.

415
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,471
I'm here with a delivery
from the flower shop.

416
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,980
I'll be heading out, sir.

417
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,161
The Grand Palace

418
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,379
You know
the Eight Star Gang, right?

419
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,758
Don't they run illegal gambling houses?

420
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,676
They dabble in gambling,
drugs, contract killings…

421
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,761
Anything that brings in money.

422
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,224
Hold on.

423
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,936
The bathroom is over that way.

424
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,480
I see. Hello.

425
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,649
I'm here to see the owner.

426
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,568
Who are you to be looking for the boss?

427
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,195
Tell him that someone
from Hwain is here to see him.

428
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,490
Where?

429
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,618
What the hell is "Hwain"?

430
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,745
He'll know if you tell him

431
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,205
that someone from Hwain is here.

432
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,383
You'll have to wait
until we hear back from the boss.

433
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,138
What? Hwain?

434
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,348
Yes, sir. That's what he said.

435
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,869
Send him back.

436
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,579
-Tell him we don't know such a thing.
-Yes, sir.

437
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,888
Incoming call
Incheon Eight Star Fortune

438
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,891
Someone new came
to see us from Hwain.

439
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,269
You should send me a copy
of the CCTV footage.

440
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,648
I'll get back to you after I look over it.

441
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,608
Then he's not from the flower shop, right?

442
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:14,610
Understood.

443
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,239
Damn it.

444
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,075
Who the hell is it then?

That punk…

447
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,855
Africa has the greatest area
that is colored in red.

448
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,818
Around 10% of the people in the area
are said to be vaccinated.

449
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,112
This is the graph showing the number
of people out of 100 in the population

450
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,197
who have received
all the necessary vaccines.

451
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,199
The number is noticeably low.

452
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,618
NOW Foundation aims to provide vaccines

453
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,788
to 54 countries in the African continent,
overall around 20%…

454
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,331
Mr. Oh is here looking for you.

455
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,918
Let's take a break.

456
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,425
What happened with the Chinese ambassador?

457
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,969
The permit for the duty-free shop?

458
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,847
Didn't things go well when you arranged
that meeting with everyone?

459
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,810
Tell me.

460
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,146
Hyunsoo.

461
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:37,776
What happens if Cosmo Cosmetics doesn't
get the permit to do business in China?

462
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,404
What do you think?

463
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,449
The 200 billion won they invested
would all be for nothing.

464
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,284
And what happens to us without it?

465
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,619
It won't affect us at all.
It's not like we don't have the money.

466
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,581
Yongmin of Cosmo
would end up looking like a fool

467
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,500
when he was finally about to prove
his worth to his wife's family.

468
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,964
Then Chairwoman Park's plan
would be foiled.

469
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,426
I need to step out for a bit.

470
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,098
Hello. It's me, Oh Wansoo.

471
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,226
I'm on my way
to your flagship store right now.

472
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,228
Are you at the store?

473
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,105
I'll see you soon then.

474
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,899
Yes, thank you.

475
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,574
Hello, Director.

476
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,036
It's been so long, hasn't it?

477
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:33,123
I was hoping to see you today.
Do you have time?

478
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,752
Then I'll see you then.

479
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,170
Yes. Thank you.

480
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,273
Mr. Park wants to see you.

481
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,442
He wants you back at the headquarters
after your work is done here.

482
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:02,945
All right.

483
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,297
Come in.

484
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,929
What were you doing here?

485
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,889
Did you come here to cause trouble?

486
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,563
You've received within a few hours
a photo of me visiting the place.

487
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,898
I'm sure you were aware of
all the CCTVs there.

488
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,775
You showed up there on purpose
so that I'd ask to see you,

489
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,402
so explain yourself.

490
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,072
Sir.

491
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:50,993
I know that you were at
the Eight Star Fortune Casino in Manila.

492
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,662
-Who told you that?
-I saw you.

493
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,123
-What?
-I was undercover there.

494
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,000
-What are you saying?
-The Eight Star Gang.

495
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,003
They're a notorious gang.
You know what they do.

496
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,254
Start making some sense.

497
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,345
Sir.

498
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,765
Do you have something
to do with Juhyuk's death?

499
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,100
What do you mean?

500
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,686
Gambling, drugs, contract killings…

501
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,187
The Eight Star Gang does it all.

502
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,397
Contract killings?

503
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,026
Are you saying that I hired them
to have Juhyuk killed?

504
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,862
-Didn't you?
-I don't have to answer that.

505
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,992
Why did you give them
a suitcase full of money?

506
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,368
A suitcase?

507
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,579
How could you--

508
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,872
The vice-chairman gave you
that suitcase, didn't he?

509
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,250
Was that the suitcase
you gave to Eight Star Fortune?

510
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,627
Tell me.

511
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,632
Listen carefully, you nutjob.

512
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,635
Contract killings aren't something
that can be done so easily.

513
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,220
You used to be a cop.

514
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,598
-How could you say something so absurd?
-Then what was that suitcase?

515
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,682
You little…

516
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,481
Incheon, Busan, Manila, Shanghai…

517
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,194
I was the one who ran errands
for the vice-chairman to launder money.

518
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,534
Money laundering?

519
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,458
Did the vice-chairman
order you to do that?

520
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,379
Since I know
what Juhyuk's death means to you,

521
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,632
I've gone way beyond my limit
to let you off the hook.

522
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:33,053
If you only joined Hwain
to get to the bottom of Juhyuk's death,

523
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,055
you're looking in the wrong place.

524
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,682
Hand in your resignation and leave.

525
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,685
Then can you tell me

526
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,020
where the former chairman, Kim Duo, died?

527
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,982
How far are you willing to take this?

528
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,900
That's why Juhyuk died!

529
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:47,985
What?

530
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:52,030
Juhyuk was investigating
the death of the former chairman.

531
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,282
You crazy bastards.

532
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,659
A heart attack at home.

533
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,036
That was all fabricated, wasn't it?

534
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,580
Do you think I'm a joke?

535
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,873
Is that what you think

536
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,292
because I'm playing butler
for the rich at my age

537
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,128
after graduating
from the Police University?

538
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,677
The person who killed Juhyuk…

539
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,929
What reason did he have

540
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,140
to kill Juhyuk?

541
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,769
Fine. Chairman Kim

542
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,146
died while away from home.

543
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,482
He died during intercourse.
You know what that means, don't you?

544
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,110
That's why his body was moved home.

545
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,654
We wanted to save him
from the ridicule on his deathbed.

546
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,073
Is that so bad? Is that a crime?

547
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,201
Heart attacks and coital deaths
are pretty much the same thing.

548
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:42,080
Is it so wrong that we made it look
as if he died peacefully at home?

549
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,500
Have you all gone nuts?

550
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,252
Damn it.

551
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,758
Do you know
why my position is so difficult?

552
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,470
Do you know why we never fire
or hire anyone that easily?

553
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,600
That's because this world is different
from the one we live in.

554
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,976
There are many secrets

555
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,395
and many things that we must
pretend not to have seen or heard.

556
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,482
But how could you suspect me?

557
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,358
For Juhyuk's death at that!

558
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,738
Can you be sure

559
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,784
that the money you delivered
wasn't to hire a contract killer?

560
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,035
Money for a contract killer?

561
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,579
Think whatever you like.

562
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,416
It's not like you'd listen to me
even if I asked you to stop.

563
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,047
But whatever happens from this point on,

564
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,883
I won't be able to cover for you.
Do you understand?

565
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,344
Get out of here.

566
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,931
Just quit this job
and have fun playing cop.

567
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,143
I will find whoever did this.

568
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,979
Not as an officer of the law,

569
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,065
but as Juhyuk's friend.

570
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,350
Now it's really begun.

571
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,076
Head of Security Seo Doyoon

572
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,327
Come to the employee dining room.

573
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,320
You should have let me know.

574
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,280
Did you have a craving for peanut butter?

575
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,577
I'll have it stocked upstairs
first thing tomorrow.

576
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,246
Why do I feel more at home
in the employee dining room?

577
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,001
It's fine. Come in.

578
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,922
Ms. Byeon.
I feel like instant noodles too.

579
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,882
-Instant noodles?
-I'll assist her.

580
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,759
I was going to grab a snack too.

581
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,011
- No, I'll do it.
- You're right.

582
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,890
Ms. Byeon, you should go and rest.
I'll head upstairs after I'm done eating.

583
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,188
Then I'll do just that.
Thank you for your kindness.

584
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,940
Sure. Have a good night.

585
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,525
Only use half of the seasoning.

586
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,541
I thought we might run into someone
if I went to your room again.

587
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,626
That's why I called you here instead.

588
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,505
According to Mr. Park,

589
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,383
Chairman Kim Duo died during coitus
at the Nonhyeon-dong home.

590
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,807
-And?
-That's why they moved his body back here.

591
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,978
Is it safe for you to question
Mr. Park directly like that?

592
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,563
I told him that I had a suspicion
about Juhyuk's death.

593
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,399
Did you ask him if my father-in-law
could have been murdered?

594
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,692
No, I didn't.

595
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:41,820
I just told him
that Juhyuk was looking into his death.

596
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,115
Is it okay to tell Mr. Park everything?

597
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,494
If Mr. Park is related to this somehow,

598
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,413
they'll come after me as well.

599
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,582
So you're going to use yourself as bait?

600
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,002
I'll find out no matter what.

601
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,801
You should look into Mr. Han as well.

602
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,679
He's in charge of managing
all the slush funds.

603
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,642
Aren't you going to eat?

604
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,810
I'm fine.

605
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,063
I knew it.

606
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,482
She has enough restraint
not to have late-night snacks.

607
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,038
Will you…

608
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,873
be my woman?

609
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,584
Why aren't you crying?

610
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,336
It's okay to cry.

611
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,379
That way, your heart will ache less.

612
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,176
Don't trust anyone from now on

613
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,385
and don't leave my side.

614
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,762
I'll protect you.

615
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,321
We'll begin the shoot.

616
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,282
Ms. Oh, are you ready?

617
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,450
- Yes.
- Okay.

618
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,411
Standby. Cue!

619
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,687
Moisturizing stick used by Oh Wansoo

620
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,188
Moisturizing stick used
by Oh Wansoo sold out

621
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,607
For when you're happy
For a brighter smile around the eyes

622
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,447
The chairwoman called you three times.

623
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,657
Tell her that I'm in a meeting.

624
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,242
I did tell her that,

625
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,535
but where were you?

626
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,995
She seemed very upset.

627
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,001
She's calling again.

628
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,505
Yes, ma'am.

629
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,507
I'll go to the house.

630
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,592
Come home right away!

631
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,218
Yes, ma'am.

632
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,636
Play it again.

633
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,019
It's gotten more moisturized.

634
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,437
Multi-purpose moisturizing stick.

635
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,022
Oh Wansoo's choice.

636
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,690
Can you lower the volume?

637
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,901
- For when you're happy.
- She must be nuts.

638
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,404
-Hey. I'm your mother-in-law.
-For a brighter smile around the eyes.

639
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,491
Do you know how much money
is riding on this?

640
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,659
A cute moisturizing stick
that fits in the palm of your hand.

641
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,787
That must be her.

642
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,331
Come in.

643
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,172
What's the occasion?

644
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,758
You're all gathered here.

645
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:36,679
Are you serious right now?

646
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,389
Did you do that on purpose?

647
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,267
Is this because of the advertisement?

648
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,521
I did that since I needed money
to buy vaccines to send to Africa.

649
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,981
-All the profits will go to--
-Hey!

650
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,817
Do you think you can walk all over me
just because I'm being nice to you

651
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,569
as my elder sister-in-law?

652
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,196
Be quiet. Shut up!

653
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:56,157
How dare you ruin
our business deal like that?

654
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,910
You were nothing but a lowly golfer.

655
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,871
What happened?

656
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,082
What's going on?

657
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:07,794
All of you. Go sit down over there.

658
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,481
Ms. Oh Wansoo.

659
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,275
What are you playing at?

660
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,278
Is that a way
to address your brother's wife?

661
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,946
Do you even know what's going on?

662
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,823
Mr. Han. Do something.

663
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,117
They might start throwing punches soon.

664
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:40,785
Director Oh.

665
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,956
Were you aware that today
was the release date

666
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,833
of Cosmo Cosmetics' new product?

667
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,835
Really?

668
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:50,878
Congratulations.

669
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,339
What more is there to talk about?

670
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,174
Let's just leave.

671
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,093
There's no talking to someone like her.

672
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,304
Jiyeon. You better watch what you say.

673
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,223
Ms. Oh Wansoo.

674
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,352
Did you know that I was going to
marry your husband

675
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,021
to strengthen business ties?

676
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,649
Gosh, why would you bring that up now?

677
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:15,403
But Yongkook was sleeping
with some junkie actress

678
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:17,822
and she bit the dust.

679
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:19,866
Who knows?

680
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,534
He could be an addict for all I care.

681
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,953
That's why my parents
called off the wedding.

682
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,038
That's enough!

683
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:28,916
Mother.

684
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,210
Get this sorted.

685
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,380
How dare a leech like you
step out of line?

686
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,882
- What?
- Get out.

687
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,884
Get out!

688
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,389
Get up.

689
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,141
Fucking idiot.

690
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,895
Wow!

691
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,731
Guess what?
I'm glad our wedding was called off.

692
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,441
You have no idea how grateful I am.

693
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,694
What are you doing?
Aren't you going after her?

694
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,372
I'll give you one more chance.

695
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:10,667
The Chinese FDA still hasn't approved
the sale of our cosmetics there.

696
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,585
Get it approved immediately.

697
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,629
Did you hear me?

698
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,215
Ask me politely.

699
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,593
What?

700
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:22,929
Get out.

701
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,014
-Get out of here, you punk.
-Don't touch me!

702
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,724
What are you going to do about it?

703
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,187
-Please stop.
-Out of my way!

704
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,814
Stay out of it!

705
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,652
If things go awry,

706
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,154
I'm going to kill you all.

707
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,157
You nutjob.

708
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,506
Damn it.

709
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,765
-Are you on a power trip?
-Because I can.

710
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,893
You better keep your word.

711
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,520
Don't leave any loose ends.

712
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,856
I'll do my best.

713
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,322
Did you see the way Yongmin acted?

714
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,908
Give it a break.

715
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,331
Those brats…

716
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,376
I don't like a single thing they do.

717
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,795
Damn it.

718
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,089
The product
Director Oh advertised

719
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,799
is said to have sold out completely.

720
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,262
What is it that makes her
act like she owns the world?

721
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,015
I guess she's trying
to interrupt your plan

722
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:53,102
by stopping Cosmo
from investing in our duty-free shop.

723
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,856
What will you do?

724
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,942
Why that little…

725
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,654
How dare they
act out in front of me like that?

726
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,823
Damn it.

727
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:10,995
Yes, Mom.

728
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,748
Taera. Did you know?

729
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,960
Chairwoman Park is in need
of money right now.

730
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,420
Money?

731
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,256
They have more money
than they have toilet paper here.

732
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,800
That's not what I meant.

733
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,719
The duty-free shop fell through.

734
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,222
Apparently, their second daughter-in-law

735
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,557
barged into the house
and started screaming at Wansoo.

736
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,937
I hear there's been a huge commotion.

737
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,106
How is it that you know better than I do
when I'm the one living here?

738
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,651
You should make a call to Hong Kong.

739
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,319
To Taesoo?

740
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:46,322
Your half-brother is still your brother.

741
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,200
And it's not like
we're asking for a handout.

742
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,077
Tell him
that we'll pay him back with interest.

743
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,578
Why would we borrow money?

744
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,250
Technically speaking,
I'm also their in-law.

745
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:01,045
We should go for it since we now have
a chance to win them over.

746
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,798
Will Oh Wansoo file for divorce?

747
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,217
Her advertisement coincided
with the release of Cosmo's new product

748
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,428
A new article has been
published about you, ma'am.

749
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,597
You should take a look at it.

750
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,227
Oh Wansoo

751
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,312
Tensions between Oh and in-laws rising

752
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,773
NOW Foundation's Oh Wansoo
puts a stop on her in-laws' Cosmo

753
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,318
I get it, so go and get the car ready.

754
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,070
I've canceled
your visit to the welfare center.

755
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:28,614
No, we won't cancel anything.

756
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,285
I promised them a month ago
that I'd join the children for a meal.

757
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,037
Yes, ma'am.

758
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,502
Honey.

759
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,549
Why did you do this?

760
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,050
I told you.

761
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,845
I needed money to send vaccines to Africa.

762
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,489
One, two, three.

763
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,762
I need to go
since I'm wanted at the foundation.

764
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,347
They're so pretty.

765
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,433
Thank you. Thank you.

766
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,687
These are amazing.

767
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,083
- Goodbye.
- We'll miss you.

768
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:47,545
I'm sorry, ma'am.

769
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,075
What's going on?
