1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,878
This drama series is fictional
and is not related in any way

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,965
to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings, and events.

3
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,179
Are you awake? How are you feeling?

4
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,768
I was hiding here
in case the attacker showed up again.

5
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,818
Are you hurt anywhere?

6
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,321
Are you all right?

7
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,702
I'm fine.

8
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,088
I promised…

9
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,008
that I'd protect you.

10
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,439
Red Swan

11
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,786
Episode 8

12
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,125
Hey, Doyoon!

13
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,419
Damn it.

14
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,175
-Hello, sir.
-What happened?

15
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,802
Why didn't you have your phone on you?

16
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,429
There was an accident yesterday.

17
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,348
An accident?

18
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,524
Were you with him all night?

19
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,527
Did you finish the work you had left?

20
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,285
Don't tell me you two were together.

21
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,372
I was alone
since you didn't come yesterday.

22
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,040
I was attacked by someone.

23
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,542
By who?

24
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,467
I think it's more important

25
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,969
to find out who gave the order
than to find the attacker.

26
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,889
They got away.

27
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,224
I don't know anything.

28
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,149
We'll now begin the shoot.

29
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,942
Great.

30
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,736
Now a more loving pose, please.

31
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,613
That's good.

32
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,618
How can a pro golfer be this beautiful?

33
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,913
- She looks great, doesn't she?
- She looks stunning today.

34
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,290
We'll start shooting again.

35
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,960
That's great.

36
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,130
Now look this way.

37
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,007
Great.

38
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,550
I'll go again.

39
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,802
Good.

40
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,640
Very good.

41
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,075
I noticed their signature again yesterday.

42
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,370
The attacker had you
as their target as well yesterday.

43
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,632
I have the original ledgers,

44
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,595
so it must be someone
who needs those ledgers.

45
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,141
The chairwoman?

46
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,185
The one who called back all the security
who was supposed to accompany you.

47
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,354
The one who held
the vice-chairman back in Seoul.

48
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,483
But the slush funds in the ledgers
all lead back to the chairwoman.

49
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,652
That's why it couldn't have been
Chairwoman Park.

50
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,112
Why so?

51
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,324
If we're killed and the ledgers
either disappear or are made public,

52
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,700
she'll take a great loss.

53
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,037
Then are you saying
that it's either my husband

54
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,997
or his brother?

55
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,249
If you're no longer here,

56
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,710
who succeeds the foundation?

57
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,337
That would be Yongmin.

58
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,882
But he fought the chairwoman
because of that very reason.

59
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,843
He complained
that the foundation was worthless.

60
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,182
He didn't seem to know that the foundation
held such a large amount of slush funds.

61
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,772
Are you certain that Mr. Han
is Chairwoman Park's right-hand man?

62
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,357
Of course he is.

63
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,984
Then why did he manipulate the ledgers

64
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,196
so that the slush funds
would lead back to Chairwoman Park?

65
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,453
We'll look over them one by one.

66
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,122
- Great job.
- Great job, everyone.

67
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,624
We're done.

68
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,296
Shall we review the photos?

69
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,553
You don't have to follow me.

70
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,542
I don't think I ever saw you

71
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,419
sleeping that soundly before.

72
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,422
Did you have a nice dream?

73
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,801
Your brother Yongmin…

74
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,848
Was he born out of wedlock?

75
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,981
Why do you ask?

76
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,151
I guess he really is
since you're asking me why.

77
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,446
So that's why Mother

78
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,823
hated Yongmin so much.

79
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,702
Father did too.

80
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,753
We should start
with the vice-chairman first.

81
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,339
Ask him these two questions
during the shoot later.

82
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,592
-Ask him what?
-We need to figure out the succession.

83
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
Ask him about his relation to Kim Yongmin.

84
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,887
What do you mean?

85
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,556
They might not be full brothers.

86
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,518
In that case, the fight for succession
will become even fiercer.

87
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,939
And what's the other question?

88
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,733
It's about the honorary chairman's death.

89
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,237
Did you know…

90
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,490
that Father didn't die at home?

91
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,039
It was disgraceful.

92
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,753
So that's what they told you as well.

93
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,844
What do you mean by that?

94
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,058
Did you ever think

95
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,186
that your father could have been murdered?

96
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,292
Director!

97
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,130
You should see this article
before you head to the airport.

98
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,590
What article?

99
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,723
This is driving me nuts!

100
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,725
Mr. Han will be here shortly.

101
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,603
You should calm down first.

102
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,273
It's hot!

103
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,984
Are you nuts?

104
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,611
Drink this, ma'am.

105
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,910
What's taking that bastard so long?

106
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,828
I'm taking care of it.

107
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,292
-How?
-If we can hide the fact

108
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,712
that the money came from the foundation,

109
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,380
the gossip will die down quickly.

110
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,342
We were the victims after all.

111
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,676
Of course!

112
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,470
I'm the victim here!

113
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,014
How dare that fraud of a shaman

114
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,601
sell me that 1,000-won saline solution…

115
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,606
for 300 million won?

116
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,982
I ought to just…

117
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,402
That scumbag!

118
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,030
The fraud ring
that has been targeting the wealthy

119
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,699
to sell them the so-called
Water of Life from Switzerland

120
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,159
has been arrested.

121
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,452
The police revealed

122
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,830
that the ringleader, Ms. Kim,
is a shaman who pretended to be an agent.

123
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,416
-She was aided by two accessories…
-We saw her before.

124
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,377
…two foreigners
who work in acting and modeling…

125
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,212
Turn that off.
What do you think you're doing?

126
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:09,218
You know the white doctor
from Switzerland who visited us?

127
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,553
They say he's an actor, not a doctor.

128
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,931
And the ringleader was that shaman
the chairwoman was close with.

129
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,267
They were giving her
a 1,000-won saline solution all this time.

130
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,394
Watch what you say.

131
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,355
Goodness.

132
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,524
They sold it for 300 million won?

133
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,276
And they say that they sold it to others
for only ten million won.

134
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,114
They charged other people 10 million won
while the chairwoman spent 300 million?

135
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,199
I can't believe how upset I am.

136
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,659
- I also--
- Stop yapping

137
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,786
and make yourselves busy. Quietly.

138
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,830
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,256
Water tends to leak
even from the smallest crack.

140
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,757
Why do these things keep happening?

141
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,680
Should we release
the article about her divorce now?

142
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,683
We should publicize her affair first

143
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,810
or the photos we took
would be going to waste.

144
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,064
Did they sleep together last night?

145
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,774
That depends on how we write it.

146
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,903
Go ahead then.

147
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,739
It's a good thing.

148
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,866
I was so mad that I couldn't find
a single fault on her

149
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,992
even after her mother died.

150
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,327
But if we end up going to court,

151
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,371
the photo won't be enough
to prove her affair.

152
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,999
Fabricate it then.
Do I have to tell you to do everything?

153
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,209
Release the article

154
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,336
so that the news about me will die down.

155
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,964
Then we'll deal with
Oh Wansoo and her brother

156
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,341
once and for all.

157
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,761
There's someone I'm worried about.

158
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,972
Who?

159
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,767
That damn bodyguard? Why?

160
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,769
He has a grudge against Hwain.

161
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,228
A grudge?

162
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,190
A policeman died.
A friend of his, apparently.

163
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,150
And who killed that policeman?

164
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:54,364
The policeman was investigating
the death of Honorary Chairman Kim Duo.

165
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,201
What? Why would he do that?

166
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,417
Did you kill him?

167
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,337
Who do you mean?

168
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,423
The policeman who died.

169
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,763
Did you ever see me kill someone?

170
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,727
But why would they investigate
my husband's death?

171
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,690
Does he know that he died during coitus?

172
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,069
-What should we do?
-About what?

173
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,779
Director Oh's divorce.

174
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,909
When's the will being disclosed?

175
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,328
The end of this month.

176
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,664
That senile old man.

177
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,627
I hope he hasn't left a large fortune
in Wansoo's name.

178
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,711
Even if he did,

179
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,463
if she does end up divorcing,

180
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,341
we could fight for the claim
to the legal reserve of inheritance.

181
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,219
It would have gone over
much more smoothly…

182
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,638
if Director Oh was dead.

183
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,642
If we publicize the affair,

184
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,813
Yongkook will have to divorce her.

185
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,483
Hurry it up. Quickly. Go, just do it.

186
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,695
Are you waiting for the prosecution
to keep digging into our books

187
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,072
so that I'll land in jail?

188
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,243
I'm sorry, ma'am.

189
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,472
Did you have a nice time in Busan?

190
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,807
No.

191
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,685
Did something happen?

192
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,272
There was an accident.

193
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,065
There was an attempted robbery.

194
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,609
What?

195
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,611
Are you all right?

196
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,321
Yes,

197
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,782
except for the fact that I missed
the robber when I almost had them.

198
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,203
I'm glad to hear that.

199
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,872
But Q1 must have done
a terrible job guarding you.

200
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,956
More than that,

201
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,083
I think the rest of the security team

202
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,544
who didn't accompany me to Busan
for no reason is the problem.

203
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:17,925
I see.

204
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,012
My brother's been held by the prosecution
for two days now.

205
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,223
He'll be released, right?

206
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,601
Yes, he should be.

207
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,063
Thank you for looking after him.

208
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,914
I took you in when you had nowhere to go.

209
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,958
Is this the best you can do?

210
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,378
You've been killing people with knives
since you were 13!

211
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,008
Aren't you worried about
the well-being of your family in China?

212
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,303
If you fail again,

213
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,472
I'll send you back
to the slums you came from.

214
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,685
Eight Star Fortune
seemed to be missing you.

215
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,396
I'll get the job done, sir.

216
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,024
This is a special order
from the chairwoman.

217
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,318
There can be no mistakes.

218
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,280
Prepare for another attack.

219
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,991
Yes, sir.

220
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,987
Close the door.

221
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,660
Close the door!

222
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,668
- There he is!
- There he comes!

223
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,212
- Please give us a comment, sir.
- Vice-Chairman Kim!

224
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,256
Could you give us a word?

225
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,799
Sir, a moment of your time.

226
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,760
- Please tell us.
- Vice-Chairman Kim.

227
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,261
Is it really true?

228
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,138
- Sir!
- Tell us if it's true.

229
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,848
- Are the rumors true?
- A word, sir!

230
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,029
What do you think you're doing?

231
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,489
I'm just as shocked.

232
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,449
Your hunch was right.

233
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,078
You've been suspecting that bodyguard,
haven't you?

234
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,084
Hwain Group's Oh Wansoo
in a shocking affair with her bodyguard?

235
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,710
Do you want to see more?

236
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,093
Did you have her tailed?

237
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,221
You photographed her…

238
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,015
and had them write articles.

239
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,478
I had them tailed
because you suspected them,

240
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,731
and the photo was taken
while they were out on a date.

241
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,108
As for the tabloids,

242
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,152
I did that because she would never agree
to a divorce.

243
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,237
I'm not getting divorced.

244
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:28,824
Hey.

245
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,785
Are you not going to divorce her
even after seeing this?

246
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,997
Wansoo isn't a filthy cheater like you!

247
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,008
You…

248
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,302
Do you have a death wish?

249
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,971
You should have done that

250
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,473
or just not have given birth to me.

251
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,517
You should have killed me
after giving birth to me.

252
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,019
Why did you have to let me
catch you in the act?

253
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,855
Why? Tell me!

254
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,679
I had to…

255
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,640
become a daughter-in-law

256
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,186
to the president against my wishes.

257
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,189
I was just doing as my parents told me.

258
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,651
But your father…

259
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,821
looked at me like I was some insect.

260
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,949
Then you shouldn't have…

261
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,870
let me catch you in the act.

262
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,789
And once you were caught,

263
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,667
you should have felt sorry…

264
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,255
so that I'd be able to understand you…

265
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,133
and forgive you.

266
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,971
Why should I have to do that for you?

267
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,389
Because I'm your son!

268
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,684
You gave birth to me.

269
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,562
Even if it hurt your pride,

270
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,648
you should have done that to me.

271
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,859
You should've pretended to hide it,
pretended to feel sorry…

272
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,654
and pretended to be ashamed.

273
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,156
You should have done all those things!

274
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,827
I am the one who built everything here.

275
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,665
I sacrificed myself for my marriage.

276
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:45,335
This family, Hwain Group…

277
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,797
I am the one who made it what it is today.

278
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,674
Everything…

279
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,261
Everything that will be yours eventually…

280
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,013
The entire Hwain Group!

281
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,557
What's the point of all that?

282
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,393
I'm already broken.

283
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,437
My heart is already in pieces!

284
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,361
I don't even know how to express
my feelings toward the woman I love.

285
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,321
I've grown up to be a complete fool.

286
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,782
It was you

287
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,493
who tore my soul into a million pieces

288
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,744
so that I can no longer

289
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,956
express affection to the one woman I love.

290
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,916
I'm just a shell of a man!

291
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,923
So you're saying…

292
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,178
that I am to blame for how much
of an idiot you've turned out to be?

293
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,389
How can you take such photos…

294
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,393
and spread them for everyone to see?

295
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:48,231
How can you do this to me?

296
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,069
Ma'am.

297
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,446
It's from that gentleman over there.

298
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,200
Thank you. Thank you.

299
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,824
Hello, ma'am.

300
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,576
I am your son-in-law,

301
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,121
Kim Yongkook.

302
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,298
I'm your husband.

303
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,008
I know.

304
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,345
Were you never going to tell me

305
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,181
that your mother passed away?

306
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,601
But you've never met my mother.

307
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,690
-I haven't.
-My mom

308
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,442
has nothing to do with you.

309
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,404
This is how you treated me
when Chanhee died.

310
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,697
You never…

311
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:02,991
shared your sadness with me.

312
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,284
You're right.

313
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,869
I didn't want to do that with you.

314
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,328
You were alone then as well.

315
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,251
Is there no way…

316
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,712
for us to set things right again?

317
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:18,423
Between you and me?

318
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,716
How is this normal?

319
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,136
What did I do that was so wrong?

320
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,638
Is having an affair that big of a deal?

321
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,226
I guess this is why

322
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,812
we were able to stay married.

323
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,648
Because we no longer love each other.

324
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,557
I don't even know how to express

325
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,768
my feelings toward the woman I love.

326
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,770
I've grown up to be a complete fool.

327
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,442
Let's go, Junhee.

328
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,451
What are you doing this late?

329
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,037
What's all that?

330
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,373
Hi, Junhee.

331
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,127
- Don't forget the seat belt.
- Okay.

332
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,213
Here. Put on the seat belt.

333
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,262
What is it? Did you fight with someone?

334
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,931
There isn't anyone in that house
who I can fight.

335
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,224
What?

336
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,976
Everyone ignores me.

337
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm like a ghost. I'm invisible.

338
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,355
And?

339
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,279
I'm not loved.

340
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,284
But I do.

341
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,952
Not you, Mom.

342
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,250
Did you tell them you were leaving?

343
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,168
Who am I supposed to tell?

344
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,422
No one cares whether I'm there or not,

345
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,798
so who am I supposed to tell?

346
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,720
Goodness.

347
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,597
We'll talk when we get home.

348
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,765
Let's go.

349
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:50,283
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

350
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,650
What took you so long?

351
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,197
The original ledgers
were with someone else.

352
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,367
I had no reason to hurry.

353
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,040
I have the contents of the ledgers
in my head.

354
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,795
And I remember telling you that I had
evidence of bribes being exchanged.

355
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,755
It was uncalled for how you
tipped off the press about the shaman.

356
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,342
But it was enough
to shake up the chairwoman.

357
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,761
Remember your promise?

358
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,475
The borrowed-name accounts
under your name…

359
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,772
I'll give you that much.

360
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,692
Have them laundered and wired
to a Canadian bank account.

361
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,777
Once you do that,

362
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,989
I'll disappear after I hand over
the evidence to you.

363
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,198
Fine.

364
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,908
But first…

365
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,160
I want to add another condition.

366
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,246
Tell me.

367
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,291
The foundation's original ledgers
that Director Oh's lover has…

368
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,544
Bring them to me as well.

369
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,088
I'm sorry?

370
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,550
Are you shocked by the task I gave you

371
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,926
or the fact that she has a lover?

372
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,102
Come in.

373
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,153
You wanted to see me, sir?

374
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,614
Are you dating my sister?

375
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,784
You should know your place.

376
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,587
What were you doing
during those many times

377
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,047
your sister's life was in peril?

378
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,507
-What did you say?
-You asked me if I was dating her.

379
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,219
You know that we can never be together
even if we are really in love.

380
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,680
She's married.

381
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,433
Enough of your riddle.

382
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,976
It's impossible for me to do anything

383
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,562
since I'm too busy keeping her alive.

384
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,647
That's a given since you're her bodyguard.

385
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,401
If you're done, I'll take my leave.

386
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,487
Hey!

387
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,532
Bring me the original ledgers.

388
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,081
What do you need them for?

389
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,291
-Bring back what you stole.
-Then report me for theft.

390
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,584
Why did you steal them?

391
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,257
I'll be done for
if the ledgers are made public.

392
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,718
It was made so that me and my sister
would take the fall.

393
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,928
That's not true.

394
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,388
You're wrong about the ledgers, Mr. Oh.

395
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,018
-What?
-I went through all the ledgers.

396
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,978
If the ledgers go public,

397
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,189
Chairwoman Park will be arrested.

398
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,235
Is that true?

399
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,238
Didn't you know?

400
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,073
I only manage the slush funds.

401
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,576
-The original ledgers--
-They were kept by Mr. Han.

402
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,245
In that case,

403
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,665
the person who wants to remove
the chairwoman and take over Hwain…

404
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,167
is Mr. Han.

405
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,842
How did you get released…

406
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,512
when I was the one who had the ledgers?

407
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,181
What was the deal you made with him?

408
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,357
Your fingerprint has been recognized.

409
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,543
All the circumstances
are pointing toward Mr. Han.

410
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,795
Is it for money?

411
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,339
Or could there be another reason?

412
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,726
The safe has been unlocked.

413
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,429
Revenue of trust certificate

414
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,598
Trustee: Han Sangil
Recipient: Kim Yongmin

415
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,267
What's this?

416
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,269
Then is Kim Yongmin

417
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,230
Han Sangil's son?

418
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,700
Hey.

419
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,624
Did you eat?

420
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,630
Good boy.

421
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,340
You like that?

422
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,273
Your fingerprint has been recognized.

423
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,637
I went through your room.
I was ordered to look for the ledgers.

424
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,848
Call me if you've got something to say.

425
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,479
I can give you the ledgers
but under one condition.

426
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,355
Help me find who planned this.

427
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,982
The one who planned it?

428
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,110
You'll be giving the ledgers
back to Mr. Han, right?

429
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,572
Things could get dangerous
from this point on.

430
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,491
How so?

431
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,118
Did you really think you'd be safe?

432
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,997
I will tell my wife

433
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,957
just in case something happens.

434
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,293
What do you mean?

435
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,377
If anything happens to me,

436
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,880
she'll have something for you.

437
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,258
Remember that.

438
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,721
Everything was orchestrated by Mr. Han.

439
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,850
Now I need decisive evidence.

440
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,510
Sit down, Han Sangil.

441
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,537
You killed my father, didn't you?

442
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,749
He didn't die during coitus.

443
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,630
You told Mom that he died a shameful death
since he passed away during intercourse

444
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,759
so it should look
as if he died at home of a heart attack.

445
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,311
He did die during intercourse.

446
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,355
We had to move his body
to the Grand Palace after his death

447
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,109
so that his death could be made
to look more honorable.

448
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,861
Why did you kill my father?

449
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,283
Did you kill him…

450
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,828
because my father

451
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,372
treated your son with contempt?

452
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,251
I have…

453
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,670
a son?

454
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,963
Kim Yongmin.

455
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,884
He's your son.

456
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,268
You must be drunk from the wine, Yongkook.

457
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,148
You should stop drinking.

458
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,817
Sit back down.

459
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,238
If you didn't kill him
because he despised your son…

460
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,658
I see.

461
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,119
It must be for the inheritance.

462
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,455
To legally claim
his share of the inheritance.

463
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,752
So my father arranged to have
his will executed on a specific date

464
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,504
to prevent that from happening.

465
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,425
The execution is at the end of this month…

466
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,429
and your son won't receive a single penny.

467
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,224
The stocks, the borrowed-name accounts…

468
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,267
When I end up inheriting everything…

469
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,813
what will you do then?

470
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,148
File a lawsuit?

471
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,528
Don't mess with Yongmin.

472
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,073
He's your brother.

473
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,325
I bet he begs to differ.

474
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,827
If you do anything to Yongmin…

475
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,206
I will put an end to you.

476
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,929
You know what's funny?

477
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,516
Everyone who has the slightest clue

478
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,018
suspects that Yongmin…

479
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,813
is my father's illegitimate son.

480
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,067
Do you know why?

481
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,491
It's because Mom…

482
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,619
despises Yongmin.

483
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,165
-That's enough.
-What reason does she have

484
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,583
to hate a child she gave birth to?

485
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,294
I'll tell you why.

486
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,965
Because Mom considers you her servant.

487
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,468
Her lawyer and lackey.

488
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,261
A lowly servant.

489
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,972
That's what she's so ashamed of.

490
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,725
She had a child with her manservant.

491
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,936
Yongmin is the living proof
of her shameful past

492
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,855
when she shared a bed with her manservant!

493
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,402
So you won't admit it.

494
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,615
Do you really think your son wouldn't know
who his real father is?

495
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,326
People know those things by instinct.

496
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,622
So why is it that Yongmin…

497
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,917
looks down on you like some insect?

498
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,003
It's obvious that you're his father.

499
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,297
So why does he pretend not to know?

500
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,051
That's because even your son…

501
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,721
considers you his servant.

502
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,016
Get out.

503
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,771
You leave…

504
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:58,774
Oh Wansoo alone.

505
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,612
I don't care if it's you or your son.

506
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,573
Anyone who harms her…

507
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,077
I'll kill them myself.

508
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,082
I won't even bother asking
why they decided to harm her.

509
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,002
They'll die by my hands.

510
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,094
I won't bother asking questions.

511
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,849
I'll just kill them.

512
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,205
Ma'am.

513
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,707
What is it?

514
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,001
Mr. Park has imprisoned Seo Doyoon.

515
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,629
-What?
-The vice-chairman ordered him to.

516
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,964
Where?

517
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,978
Hwain Group's Oh Wansoo
in a shocking affair with her bodyguard?

518
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,632
It'll make me
look like a coward if he's tied up.

519
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,802
I told you to confine him, not tie him up.

520
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,013
Untie him.

521
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,565
- I untied him, sir.
- You may leave.

522
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,651
Go back upstairs.

523
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,071
Yes, sir.

524
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,106
How far did you go with Wansoo?

525
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,612
Didn't you sleep with her?

526
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,032
-Why?
-To remain respectable.

527
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,659
How am I supposed to find you respectable?

528
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,035
In my eyes, not yours.

529
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,829
Why did you approach Wansoo?

530
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,874
To find the person who killed my friend.

531
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,710
And that person

532
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,045
is within Hwain.

533
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,050
Who was it that killed your father?

534
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,099
Are you saying
that my father was murdered?

535
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,435
Can you prove it?

536
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,688
My friend left me
a video of your father's body being moved.

537
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,148
How does that prove anything?

538
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,984
They could have just been moving the body
from there to here.

539
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,485
But it doesn't make sense logically.

540
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,697
If they were just moving
his body back home,

541
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,408
why would they hire someone

542
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,911
to murder the policeman
who was investigating his death?

543
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,710
My friend was killed

544
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,588
before my eyes with a Bikram knife.

545
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,882
His artery was cut open
with a single slash.

546
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,094
If there weren't any secrets
behind your father's death…

547
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,598
they wouldn't have had to kill
a policeman like that.

548
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,268
Did you find…

549
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,271
-who killed my father?
-Almost.

550
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,441
-You did?
-I have circumstantial evidence.

551
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,693
Revenue of trust certificate

552
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,237
Trustee: Han Sangil
Recipient: Kim Yongmin

553
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,074
Circumstantial?

554
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,241
Circumstantial?

555
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:27,751
I found out who the father
of your brother, Kim Yongmin, is.

556
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,420
The original ledgers were written

557
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,798
so that Chairwoman Park
would be charged with embezzlement.

558
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,882
Is that so?

559
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,469
Then who is it that had my father killed?

560
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,055
It will be revealed
once I find out who killed my friend.

561
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,266
Wansoo is mine.

562
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,851
Just stick to protecting her.

563
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,104
That's enough.

564
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,065
Don't touch it! I'll shoot!

565
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,949
What do you think you're doing?

566
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,370
Get out! Get out of here!

567
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,871
Calm down.

568
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,332
Do you really have a death wish, you punk?

569
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,251
Shoot me instead.

570
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,419
-Please don't.
-Shoot me.

571
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,675
Do you love this bastard?

572
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,802
I do.

573
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,849
And does he love you too?

574
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,893
- No.
- Wansoo!

575
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,229
Snap out of it!

576
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,190
Did you know that he came here
with an ulterior motive?

577
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,317
He only got close to you

578
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,361
to avenge the death of his friend!

579
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,280
I know. I know everything.

580
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,823
Do you think he's told you everything?

581
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,783
That doesn't matter.

582
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,410
Come to your senses!

583
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,751
- You should stop and hand the gun over.
- Don't move!

584
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,714
My mind is as clear as ever.

585
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,925
I almost died multiple times and met him.

586
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,302
That woke me up completely.

587
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,637
My mind has always been clouded

588
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,098
ever since I got married to you.

589
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,518
But after Mom's death
and Hyunsoo's arrest,

590
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,188
my mind couldn't be any clearer.

591
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,653
I trust that it wasn't you who did it.

592
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,157
You're not someone
who's capable of killing their own father

593
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,618
and me as well.

594
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:31,583
We should let him find
the person who did it.

595
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,668
He's gathering evidence.
He'll definitely catch them.

596
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,853
I trust you.

597
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,051
Two weeks later

598
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,263
Steven. Did you get the documents?

599
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,266
I prepared my will while I was there.

600
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,476
Then does that mean

601
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,979
that no one in the family knows
the contents of your will?

602
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,564
I'm sure you know the reason

603
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,191
why I've taken such a measure.

604
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,860
Could it be because of the slush fund

605
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,321
that's kept in the Swiss bank account?

606
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,114
Do you know how much is in there?

607
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,660
All the slush funds and the money
in my borrowed-name accounts

608
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,537
were accumulated through illegal means,

609
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,623
so there won't be much
that your son will be able to take legally

610
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,501
even if he were to file a lawsuit…

611
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,298
I'm sure you've prepared for that.

612
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:49,763
Did you really think I wouldn't know

613
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,390
who Yongmin's father was?

614
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,145
You're a smart man,

615
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,732
so I won't bother worrying
about your son's future.

616
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,986
I'm sure
you've put something aside for him.

617
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,665
Vice-President Kim Yongmin

618
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,798
- It's me.
- What is it?

619
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,385
The lawyers arrived here from New York
to execute your father's will.

620
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,054
Right.

621
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:32,972
Okay.

622
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,938
Is something up?

623
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,732
My father's birthday is next week, right?

624
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,026
Is it?

625
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,821
Some lawyers from New York
flew here to execute his will.

626
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,031
That's weird.

627
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,700
Isn't a will usually executed

628
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,744
as soon as someone dies?

629
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,081
I know.

630
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,334
Maybe he knew he'd die early.

631
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,044
What do you mean by that?

632
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,923
It's nothing.

633
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,926
I just found it strange
that he said he'd have his will executed

634
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,636
on his 70th birthday

635
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,555
whether he was alive or not.

636
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,481
Right. This is all done.

637
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,899
But the schedule is rather tight.

638
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,068
Do you think this summary is appropriate?

639
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,361
-It will be okay.
-Yeah, it's fine.

640
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,572
-I think we can do it.
-Yeah. No problem.

641
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,365
But could we have a look at the will?

642
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,159
All right.

643
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,619
Please keep it well.

644
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,248
- So I told you about this one.
- Yeah.

645
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,208
- Inside the USB stick…
- USB stick?

646
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,835
- Double-check it.
- Double-check.

647
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,003
Ailee.

648
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,422
Could we have a quick word?

649
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,174
Oh.

650
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,634
Sure. This way.

651
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,281
You still can't tell me what's on the will

652
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,575
under any circumstances?

653
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,328
I already gave you a hint
where the money's going.

654
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,788
Obviously, I can't tell you
anything more than that.

655
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,708
Do you know how many contracts
I helped you sign all those years?

656
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,420
In English, please.

657
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,596
At least tell me how much
is going to the foundation.

658
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,057
A deal is a deal,

659
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,184
and I already gave you a hint.

660
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,978
What would it take for you to tell me?

661
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,397
It's out of the question.

662
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,525
Will that be all?

663
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,657
I'll see you on the day of.

664
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,014
There is

665
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,517
something I must ask you

666
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,686
to do for me.

667
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:31,067
Please remain a member
of the Hwain family until then.

668
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,405
The day has finally arrived.

669
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,032
I've done my best

670
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,202
to protect NOW Foundation until now
as you asked me to.

671
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,830
After today…

672
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,917
I'll be free to live the life I want.

673
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,093
It's time for you to go.

674
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,799
Let's go.

675
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,105
The chairwoman will be here shortly

676
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,524
and the lawyers from New York
will be here soon as well.

677
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,630
Has it started?

678
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:17,590
Yes. The staff
have been dismissed as well.

679
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,303
I'm not going inside. Don't worry.

680
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,937
Good. Everyone is here.

681
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,439
Well, then…

682
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,316
Let's begin.

683
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,029
Should I continue in English?

684
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,739
I can translate if necessary.

685
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,658
Everyone here understands.

686
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,826
Just get on it already.

687
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,411
I'll proceed in Korean then.

688
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,664
- I'll do it, Steven.
- Okay.

689
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,845
This document is the written will

690
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:08,474
and this flash drive contains the video
of the deceased reading the will.

691
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,733
"I, Kim Duo,

692
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:21,571
declare the following
to be my last will and testament.

693
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,323
I, Kim Duo,

694
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,243
-whether living or deceased…"
-…whether living or deceased,

695
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,245
I will have this will executed

696
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:33,958
on the 70th anniversary of my birth,

697
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:38,671
which will be June 18, 2023.

698
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:51,726
-"I have illegal slush funds…"
-I have illegal slush funds

699
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,103
amounting to 16 trillion won

700
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,981
and 2 trillion won
stored in borrowed-name accounts.

701
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,483
What?

702
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,529
How much?

703
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,824
18 trillion won?

704
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,159
Jesus.

705
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,787
That crazy old man!

706
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,080
Where did all that money come from?

707
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,957
I'd appreciate it if you let me finish.

708
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,334
You should sit down.

709
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,630
This is insane.
He must have been out of his mind.

710
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,174
"I will have the entire 18 trillion won…"

711
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,471
I will have the entire 18 trillion won…

712
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,766
donated to the NOW Foundation.

713
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,267
"…donated to the NOW Foundation."

714
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,191
What the fuck?

715
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,068
My slush fund of 16 trillion won

716
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,778
is being kept at Celli Bank in Switzerland

717
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,531
and can only be retrieved
if Ms. Oh Wansoo visits in person

718
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,366
and signs for its withdrawal.

719
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,628
Last will and testament
