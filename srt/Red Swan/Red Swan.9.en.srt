This drama series is fictional
and is not related in any way

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,923
to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings, and events.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,729
Do you know why I called you here?

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:21,980
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:26,443
You will take note of the people
the president meets privately.

6
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,945
Senior Inspector Shin will secretly
investigate the slush funds

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,198
kept by those
who met the president in private

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,243
and report your findings
to me and no one else.

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,786
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:46,880
Restricted area

11
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,392
Why did you want to see me?

12
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,105
Before his death, Senior Inspector Shin
was looking into Hwain's slush funds.

13
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,607
And?

14
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,404
Do you still despise me for what happened?

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,574
You covered up his death.

16
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,829
That was because Senior Inspector Shin
failed to find any evidence.

17
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,749
How was I supposed to arrest those behind
Eight Star Fortune without evidence

18
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,125
when they were based in Manila?

19
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,919
Back then,

20
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,254
I wrongly suspected you.

21
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,881
Just come out and ask me

22
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,508
if I was in cahoots with Hwain Group.

23
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,137
I can't say
that I still don't suspect you.

24
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,975
It's all in the past now.

25
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,978
So why did you want to see me?

26
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,480
I'm here to report to you

27
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,441
about Hwain's slush funds and the suspect
behind the recent terror attacks.

28
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,026
But first,

29
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,279
there's intel I've obtained
about Hwain through the NIS.

30
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,617
It is said the former president
has hidden away

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,995
a large amount of his slush fund abroad
through his son, Chairman Kim Duo.

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,164
I'm sorry?

33
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,459
They must plan to use it
to make Hwain's first son the successor.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,088
Find out how they plan
to bring the money back from Switzerland.

35
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,881
That's what you should do first.

36
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,053
Senior Inspector Shin's attacker

37
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,765
must be related to
Chairman Kim Duo's slush funds somehow.

38
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,879
Red Swan

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,389
Episode 9

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,143
Do you want something, sir?

41
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,020
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

42
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,606
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

43
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,690
Could I get some water, please?

44
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,774
- Sure.
- Thanks.

45
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,868
Peter.
I'm going to Switzerland right now.

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,287
There's an important matter
I'd like to discuss,

47
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,208
so please let me know
when we can talk privately over the phone.

48
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,756
Are you left-handed?

49
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,091
No, I'm not.

50
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,218
How tall are you?

51
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,221
I'm 5 ft 8 in.

52
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,806
Why?

53
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,021
The flower shop delivery is complete.

54
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,736
It's nothing.
It's just that you look taller than that.

55
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,155
Wait.

56
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,449
Can you speak Chinese by any chance?

57
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,287
Not at all.

58
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,330
Why do you ask?

59
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,918
Never mind. It's nothing.
You should get back to work.

60
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,823
How could I have not thought
that Mr. L could be a woman?

61
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,219
Why do you ask?

62
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,682
Evidence…

63
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,476
I need evidence.

64
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,025
Zürich, Switzerland

65
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,295
My slush fund of 16 trillion won

66
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,507
is being kept at Celli Bank in Switzerland

67
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,093
and can only be retrieved
if Ms. Oh Wansoo visits in person

68
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,928
and signs for its withdrawal.

69
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,578
This way.

70
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,567
It's a great pleasure to meet both of you.

71
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,071
Ms. Oh.

72
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,907
Before we begin,
we do need to check some information.

73
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,469
Thank you very much.

74
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,556
Your biometric information
is a perfect match

75
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,683
with the data we have
from the late Mr. Kim.

76
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,687
However, we do need
to proceed with caution

77
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,899
as the amount of money involved here
is quite substantial.

78
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,484
Of course.

79
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,371
A few days ago

80
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,498
Oh, my fucking lord!

81
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,417
Can you believe this?
It's 18 trillion won!

82
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,002
- Can you?
- Be quiet for a second.

83
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,212
Both of you sit down.

84
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,554
Even if we split it
between the three of us,

85
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,722
we'll be getting over five trillion each.

86
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,807
Right?

87
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,016
Between the three of us?

88
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,768
Didn't you listen to what the will said?

89
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,104
So you're going to keep it
all for yourself?

90
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,481
Can't you punks shut up?

91
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,817
We've got a problem on our hands

92
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,736
that we might not be able to solve
even if we were to put our heads together.

93
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,700
That senile fool is giving me trouble
even from beyond the grave.

94
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,578
Don't stress yourself too much, Mom.

95
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,454
Listen. There's 18 trillion won,

96
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,707
and 16 trillion of it
is from an illegal slush fund.

97
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,251
Even the remaining 2 trillion is stored in
illegal borrowed-name accounts.

98
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,296
That's not a small amount.
It won't be easy to launder all of it.

99
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,965
We won't ever get it done
with the launderer that we have.

100
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,718
Without help from the launderers
in Hong Kong or New York,

101
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,136
there's no way it can happen.

102
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,262
He donated the money.

103
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,264
You don't have a share.

104
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,645
You can't do that to me.

105
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,731
So you'll keep everything for yourself?

106
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,109
Whoever ends up getting it,
we'll need to launder it first.

107
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,986
We should split it three ways
to keep things fair.

108
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,404
We can't split it three ways.

109
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,282
Yongkook's succession
needs to go smoothly,

110
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,534
so most of that money
will be spent on that.

111
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,744
You can't be serious!

112
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,996
I don't intend to let anyone

113
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,789
have more than an exact three-way split.

114
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,835
Father donated the entire amount
to NOW Foundation

115
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,712
so that Wansoo could use it
for a good cause.

116
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,921
Are you nuts?

117
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,757
This isn't some chump change.

118
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,177
You're going to give it all to Wansoo
so she can waste all of it?

119
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,512
What can we do
when that's what Father wanted?

120
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,222
That's not what he wanted at all!

121
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,850
It's a slush fund
that was illegally acquired.

122
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,810
There's no way for us to retrieve it.

123
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,648
He only said he was donating it
because he had no way of giving it to us.

124
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,860
So he donated it to the foundation
so we can launder it little by little

125
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,571
to use in your succession

126
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,698
and also make good use of
the money he left us.

127
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,077
He just had it siphoned
through the foundation.

128
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,037
Stop getting ahead of yourselves

129
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,622
and stay out of it.

130
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,499
Let Wansoo do what she wants with it.

131
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,836
I said I would never let that happen.

132
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,838
How dare you try
to con me out of my share?

133
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,298
You must have lost it.

134
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,509
-How dare you touch me?
-It's not a small amount.

135
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,886
You're not even a member of the family.

136
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,726
-What was that?
-Both of you.

137
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,728
Be quiet!

138
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,397
If you understand what I meant,

139
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,233
just keep living quietly like a mouse.

140
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,281
Why don't I just report you?

141
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,534
I'll tell everyone
that the former president's son

142
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:45,079
had been keeping a slush fund
worth 16 trillion won in Switzerland.

143
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,331
Do you want the entire world
to know about that?

144
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,083
Don't you dare threaten me!

145
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,174
Fine.

146
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,634
We'll split it in half.

147
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,095
Forget about Mom.
We'll split the money in half.

148
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,847
Hey. You're not getting any.

149
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,849
Why would you need
all that money at your age?

150
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,475
You really must have gone nuts.

151
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,185
That's right. I'm completely nuts.

152
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,187
There's no telling what I'd do

153
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
unless you give me half of that money!

154
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,025
Keep that in mind.

155
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,278
Do you think that's the only thing
I have on you two?

156
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,947
I'm warning both you and Mom.

157
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,324
Unless you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison,

158
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,827
you better give me my fair share.

159
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,709
I was told that Father

160
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,253
could have been murdered.

161
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,468
Do you know who killed him?

162
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,429
How the fuck should I know that?

163
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,515
You…

164
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,809
What did you just say?

165
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,395
Are you saying I killed him?

166
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,355
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,441
That's strange.

168
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,151
I said he could have been murdered.

169
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,487
Shouldn't you be surprised to hear that?

170
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,785
Do you know who did it by any chance?

171
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,745
How would I know who killed him?

172
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,748
What about Mr. Han?

173
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,002
Does he know who did it?

174
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,214
Hey. Have you gone insane?

175
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,548
Prison?

176
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,926
You're the one
who should be worried about that.

177
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,636
Fucking hell! Seriously!

178
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,972
You're the one who's trying
to keep the money for yourself!

179
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,767
"Fucking hell"?

180
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,478
It doesn't matter how much.

181
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,316
I will never let you get your hands
on my father's money.

182
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,069
Not a single penny.

183
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,490
Get lost.

184
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,965
Damn it.

185
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,521
He's a complete thief.

186
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,857
What are you going to do?

187
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,278
What are you staring at me for?

188
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,364
Why did you do it?

189
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,448
What?

190
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,659
To Chairman Kim Duo.

191
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,669
You're asking me that now?

192
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,006
Why didn't you say anything then?

193
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,050
I was so shocked…

194
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,970
that I couldn't ask you then.

195
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,140
Who are you to ask me why I did that now?

196
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,225
Forget about it.

197
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,770
If I kill Oh Wansoo,
NOW Foundation will become mine.

198
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,691
And after you kill her?

199
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,652
It will be easy to siphon the money
from the foundation and have it laundered

200
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,112
although it will take long.

201
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,866
Fine.

202
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,368
Should I have Oh Wansoo killed?

203
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,371
Why would those terrorists
stop in the middle of their attack?

204
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,416
It would have been great
if she quietly died in Manila.

205
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,711
If that happened, we would have never
found the money in Switzerland.

206
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,005
Is that so?

207
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,924
I'm sure he made it so the money could be
accessed even after her death.

208
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,008
It's complicated.

209
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,427
She was to withdraw the money,
not inherit it.

210
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,054
Enough of that nonsense.

211
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,974
Once Oh Wansoo retrieves
the money from Switzerland,

212
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,852
wouldn't it be okay to kill her then?

213
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,941
You've been the lawyer of this household
for over 30 years.

214
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,109
So how did you not know
that the old man had that much money

215
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,612
and that he planned to give it all
to the foundation?

216
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,073
Let's give it some thought.

217
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,908
Be quiet for a second.

218
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,118
Don't order me around.

219
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,204
Please leave, sir.

220
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,040
I have a lot on my mind.

221
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,460
Get it done, okay?

222
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,879
I'll look into the places
where we can launder the money.

223
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,931
Now that I think about it,
that was out of the blue.

224
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,312
Did you see me kill the old man?

225
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,148
He just dropped dead.

226
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,402
You pretended to believe me then.
Why are you accusing me now?

227
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,320
You've ruined my mood.

228
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,574
Sir.

229
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,410
Sir…

230
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,918
He… He just fell.

231
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,546
He was talking to me then he just…

232
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,590
He suddenly collapsed.

233
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,015
What are you doing here?

234
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,392
You should have told me.

235
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,061
I'm telling you, he just collapsed.

236
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,395
He really did!

237
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:50,944
You should

238
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,365
take Jiyeon with you
to the vacation home in Yongpyeong.

239
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,159
Why would she go on a trip with me?

240
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,243
Just take her

241
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,579
and buy her a gift
like a necklace or something.

242
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,498
Just get out of here!

243
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,751
You were never here today.

244
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,194
Mr. Park. Where are you?

245
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,489
Come to Nonhyeon-dong.

246
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,929
Let me take that for you.

247
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,855
- You're so pretty, Wansoo.
- Hello.

248
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,148
I'm such a fan.

249
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,819
Did you have a nice trip?

250
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,196
Yes.

251
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,330
The car is parked over there.

252
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,464
All right. Take a seat over there.

253
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,521
I gave it some thought

254
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,482
and I think I have a great idea.

255
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,401
Please go on.

256
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,909
We'll use Oh Hyunsoo.

257
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,828
Oh Wansoo's brother.

258
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,288
How so?

259
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,541
We'll have him launder all the money

260
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:56,505
that Wansoo brought back from Switzerland.

261
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,509
What is she going to do
when her brother is involved in it?

262
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,427
And?

263
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,513
We'll launder the money

264
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,474
and use it to purchase Hwain Bio stocks
under Yongkook's name.

265
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,642
It's a holding company.

266
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,687
With simple legwork,

267
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,982
his succession will become very easy.

268
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,068
What about Mr. Oh then?

269
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,239
He will decide to take his own life
out of guilt for embezzlement.

270
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,825
Perfect, right?

271
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,290
What's this?

272
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,668
Are you trying to negotiate with me
so that I'll share the money with Yongmin

273
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,461
in return for your help?

274
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,466
I'll think about it.

275
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,803
I come to you with a helpful idea
and this is what I get.

276
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,017
Yongmin is sure to receive
a small share of the money.

277
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,069
That damn mooch.

278
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,032
Both father and son are so greedy.

279
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,534
Why would he want what's mine?

280
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,537
What right does he have?

281
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,207
He should be grateful
that I'm willing to give him even scraps.

282
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,129
How dare he try to get in my son's way?

283
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,509
He's nothing but a lowly servant.

284
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,304
How dare he?

285
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,600
I'll make a deal with them
using the ledgers.

286
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,144
That's too dangerous.

287
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,442
These ledgers…

288
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,694
How about we just hand them over
to the prosecution right away?

289
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,904
Just leave it to me.

290
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,114
This is too big for us
to take on ourselves.

291
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,742
There's no talking to you, is there?

292
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,036
We'll hand over the ledgers
to the prosecution

293
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,830
and tell the world about the donation
that the former chairman made.

294
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,208
We can't do that
without any solid proof.

295
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,502
They'll destroy what they can't have.

296
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,796
And the money from Switzerland
is from an illegal slush fund,

297
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,464
so it won't be easy
for the prosecution to trace it.

298
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,841
They'll just accuse her of lying
because she wants a divorce,

299
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,927
kill her, and make it look
like an accident.

300
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,137
But it's too dangerous for us
to contact them now.

301
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,680
We could end up losing the ledgers.

302
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,099
I'll make a deal with Mr. Han.

303
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,019
Listen closely.

304
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,482
Your sister's life was in danger
all this time because of that money.

305
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,404
The ledgers are the only way
that we can find whoever is behind this.

306
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,280
The person behind this? Who?

307
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,699
Mr. Han?

308
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,076
Yongmin?

309
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,578
They're all innocent
according to the ledgers, so how?

310
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,872
They already know we have the ledgers
so they're useless.

311
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,083
We need to get our hands on new evidence.

312
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,721
About Kim Yongmin…

313
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,057
It's true that he was born out of wedlock,

314
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,269
but he bears no relation
to the late chairman.

315
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,854
-I'm sorry?
-What?

316
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,197
I found this in Mr. Han's safe.

317
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,868
His entire fortune
was put into a trust.

318
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,250
And the trustee is Kim Yongmin.

319
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:25,088
Are you saying that Yongmin was born
between the chairwoman and Mr. Han?

320
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,673
They're after NOW Foundation
for the slush fund

321
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,884
since it didn't seem likely
that he'd become Hwain's successor.

322
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,428
That's why they've been after your life.

323
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,182
So that's why Yongmin
reported the embezzlement.

324
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,308
Revenue of trust certificate

325
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,061
Then the person
who tried to kill me was Yongmin?

326
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,646
It could have been him

327
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,983
or it could have been Mr. Han
who wanted his son to receive that money.

328
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,697
Lee Jin the bodyguard…

329
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,699
Is she a Chinese emigrant?

330
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,992
I don't know.

331
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,827
All I know is that she graduated
from the Police University.

332
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,329
Why do you ask?

333
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,247
Watch out for her.

334
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,208
Don't ever let yourself be alone with her.

335
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,376
I'm trying to find evidence against her.

336
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,504
But she's loyal to the chairwoman.

337
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,006
She doesn't work for Mr. Han or Yongmin.

338
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,966
Her loyalty to the chairwoman
could be a cover.

339
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,012
Are you saying that K1 was behind
all the attacks ever since Manila?

340
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,264
She can handle all those weapons?

341
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,351
I'm looking into it.

342
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,269
First of all,

343
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,563
I'll give you the ledgers.

344
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,441
Remember what I said.

345
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,068
You have to be careful

346
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,986
of Mr. Han.

347
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,616
Both of you too.

348
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,036
Stay safe.

349
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,205
Let me know when you go to see Mr. Han.

350
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,012
Okay.

351
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,847
I hear what you're saying.

352
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:02,519
So it's difficult to bring
everything into Korea at once?

353
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,729
Yes. We'll need to make some arrangements.

354
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,691
And there will be a hefty commission
that you can't avoid to pay.

355
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,193
Let's keep in touch.

356
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,319
Bye.

357
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,662
Vice-Chairman Kim Yongkook

358
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,372
Where did you go?

359
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,833
Now you ask me where I am?

360
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,376
Where are you?

361
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,255
Okay. I understand.

362
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,426
What did he say? Is he coming here?

363
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,094
He is,

364
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,388
but he's going to take
Junhee out for a moment.

365
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,182
Junhee? Is he going to kidnap Junhee?

366
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,685
He's Junhee's father.
Why would he do that?

367
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,729
Officially speaking,
he's Junhee's brother.

368
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,814
Whatever.

369
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,066
But think about it.

370
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,194
The late Chairman Kim Duo
left them an enormous fortune,

371
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,739
and you're his supposed second wife.

372
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,824
And as for Junhee,

373
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,202
he's Chairman Kim's son
officially speaking.

374
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,622
I guess he has a claim to the inheritance.

375
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,293
Get over here.

376
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,546
Vice-President Kim Yongmin

377
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,381
-Now!
-Managing Director Jin.

378
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,592
I'll talk to you later.

379
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,972
What's with you?
Where are your manners?

380
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,017
Did you embezzle the company's funds
to buy Hwain Bio stocks?

381
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,395
-Who told you that?
-Did you buy them or not?

382
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,399
I just thought I should buy them
while the prices were down

383
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,651
after Wansoo's brother was arrested.

384
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,986
My company's money isn't yours.

385
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,698
How is this your company?
This is your dad's company.

386
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,909
You must be dying to go to prison.

387
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,453
Prison? Did you say prison?

388
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,538
You better return
the money you took right away.

389
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,540
Buying their stocks
would only do them good.

390
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,334
I didn't buy them to help them.

391
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,418
Wake up.

392
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,337
You can never win against Yongkook.

393
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,006
Why do you think you were
married into our family?

394
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,592
Your family was taking the trash out
and dumping it on us.

395
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,968
Why you…

396
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,888
I'm going to report it to Dad if you don't
return the money in three days.

397
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,348
Snap out of it.

398
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,142
Report it.

399
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,769
Go ahead.

400
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,690
I'm not the same Yongmin
you used to know yesterday.

401
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,567
Don't you know how much my father
has saved up in his slush fund?

402
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,237
-I see.
-Didn't you tell your father yet?

403
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,363
And they'll share it with you?

404
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,658
To you? Your mom is going to do that?

405
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,952
I won't be asking for handouts
like some beggar.

406
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,830
I don't think you know me that well.

407
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,124
Bring me the money then.

408
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,586
You don't think I can do it.

409
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,505
When your family dumped you on us,

410
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,424
she didn't even bother to give you
a single subsidiary.

411
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,468
I know that she's afraid
to split up the group,

412
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,012
but how could she send you
to us empty-handed?

413
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,681
I'm going to take over Hwain!

414
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,183
Bring back the money you took!

415
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,560
Do you still not understand?

416
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,644
You fucking deaf?

417
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,166
Hello.

418
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,628
Are you here alone?

419
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,840
You told me to come alone
so the driver brought me here.

420
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,926
Right. How about we go for a walk?

421
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,511
Okay.

422
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,820
Why did you want to see me?

423
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,575
I have something to tell you.

424
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,327
I also wanted to ask you some questions.

425
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,245
Go on and tell me.

426
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,477
Do you know who I am?

427
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,021
You're the vice-chairman.

428
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,693
Dad…

429
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,495
You knew?

430
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,050
Hey, duck! Get down, come on!

431
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,220
Mom. We're too beautiful.
Hiding won't do anything for us.

432
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,476
I guess we're not in the wrong
since we came here worried about Junhee.

433
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,065
I wonder what they're talking about.

434
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,321
You see…

435
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,076
I'm going to…

436
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,788
break up with your mom.

437
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,091
I understand.

438
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,803
I wanted to ask you something.

439
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,515
Who I want to live with?

440
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,811
I see

441
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,855
that you take after me.

442
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,609
You're quick-witted and brave.

443
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,528
And you don't let anyone know
when you're hurting inside.

444
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,198
I'll live with Mom.

445
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,328
You have a big family at the Grand Palace.

446
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,332
If I go to live there,
Mom won't have anyone else.

447
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,169
We'll live with Grandma.

448
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,421
I'll live with Mom and Grandma.

449
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,763
I might…

450
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,893
never be able to visit you or your mom

451
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,312
ever again.

452
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,068
Would that

453
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,861
still be okay?

454
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,948
We can meet later

455
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,283
when I grow up, right?

456
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,702
Of course.

457
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,537
Then it's fine.

458
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,622
Goodbye.

459
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,249
Wait. Why are you leaving already?

460
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,448
I'll be meeting him
at ten tonight

461
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,199
under Haengju Bridge at the Han River.

462
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,333
Are you going somewhere?

463
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,420
It's late.

464
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,965
Yes. I was going out
to see a friend of mine.

465
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,135
Sure. Have fun.

466
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,012
Yes. I'll see you later.

467
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:43,623
There aren't any CCTVs
in that area by the Han River.

468
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,583
I'll be watching nearby

469
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,418
but please be careful.

470
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,393
Calls

471
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,477
Calling
Seo Doyoon

472
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,941
Mr. Oh Hyunsoo
Recording call

473
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,060
The money was moved
to the Canadian account safely.

474
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,896
I saw the deposit.

475
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,106
Are you planning never to come back?

476
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,150
I don't know.

477
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,446
Does your sister know

478
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,284
that her brother is taking money
and leaving for Canada to hide?

479
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,369
I should tell her now.

480
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,624
Give me the ledgers.

481
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,422
Let me ask you one thing before I do that.

482
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,637
Was Chairman Kim Duo murdered?

483
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,721
What?

484
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:05,890
Cut the nonsense.

485
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,725
Who was it that tried to kill Wansoo?

486
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,143
What is it that you want to know?

487
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,353
Can you promise Wansoo's safety

488
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,814
if she gets a divorce and gives up
all her rights over NOW Foundation?

489
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,491
What are you planning to do
with Chairman Kim Duo's slush fund?

490
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,077
It's none of your business
since you'll be leaving.

491
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,495
What price must Wansoo or I pay…

492
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,333
for you to assure
that Wansoo will be safe?

493
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,876
Why are you asking me that?

494
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,087
I can convince her to get a divorce,

495
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,257
but I won't be able to talk her into
giving up the foundation completely,

496
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,341
even more so now.

497
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,634
Director Oh has always valued

498
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,221
the foundation even more so than her life.

499
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,017
You should just keep
looking out for yourself.

500
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,094
Mr. Oh Hyunsoo
Stop recording

501
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,739
Emergency Medical Service.

502
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,990
I'm on the bank of the Han River.

503
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,242
Can you track my location
and send an ambulance?

504
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,410
His main artery has been cut.

505
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,246
-Hey…
-You shouldn't talk.

506
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,254
Is this the Central District
Prosecutors' Office?

507
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,258
I wanted to make a report

508
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,302
regarding Hwain Group and NOW Foundation.

509
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:38,269
The Grand Palace

510
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,192
Good evening.

511
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,528
I'm Prosecutor Seo Jinsoo from Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

512
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,321
What is the meaning of this at this hour?

513
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,782
Do you have a warrant
for search and seizure?

514
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,742
We're not actually here to do that.

515
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,871
I'm here because there's something
I need to tell the chairwoman in person.

516
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,665
Don't you think it's rude
to visit without letting us know first?

517
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,917
I'll tell Mr. Han.

518
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,379
Wait. He's not in right now.
I saw him go out earlier.

519
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,672
Should I call him?

520
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,756
I'll do it.

521
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,428
Please wait.
We'll discuss it with our lawyer first.

522
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,889
Sure thing. I'll allow that much.

523
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,816
Goodbye.

524
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,612
- Please wait.
- Take your time.

525
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,533
He's not answering.

526
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,370
Stay there for a moment.

527
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,247
Please wait a little longer.

528
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,833
We did our best not to look conspicuous.

529
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:43,959
We won't take long.

530
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,503
I told you to wait.

531
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,300
Why isn't he answering his phone?

532
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,886
I've called him over 20 times now
but he's not answering.

533
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,514
Twenty? Keep calling him.

534
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,563
Vice-Chairman Kim.
Where are you right now?

535
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,947
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

536
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,119
There she is.

537
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,582
What's going on here?

538
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,086
Where's Mr. Han?

539
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,923
Are prosecutors allowed to
do things like this at such a late hour?

540
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,800
We thought it'd be best
to tell her in person,

541
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,343
since she's such an important figure.

542
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,678
What's he on about?

543
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,263
Hello, ma'am.

544
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,557
I'm Prosecutor Seo Jinsoo of Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office.

545
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,725
And?

546
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,480
We have your summons.

547
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,233
I came here
to hand it to you personally.

548
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,943
- Summons?
- Yes, ma'am.

549
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,071
Should I wait for your lawyer
and speak to him before I go?

550
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,449
It's fine. Give the summons to me.

551
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,909
Here you go.

552
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,459
Leave if you're done here.

553
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,795
Our lawyer will contact you soon.

554
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,464
Well, then…

555
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,591
Let's go.

556
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,009
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

557
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,002
The killer…

558
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:52,880
is K1.

559
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,925
Whose order could she be following?

560
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,844
That's who we're after.

561
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,601
I'm sorry.

562
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,186
We did our best,

563
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,021
but the patient has passed.

564
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,568
What's going on?

565
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,213
Hey.

566
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,591
Still no word from Mr. Han?

567
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,386
His phone still seems to be switched off.

568
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,512
That nutjob.

569
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,766
Where could he be
and what could he be up to?

570
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,893
Keep calling him.

571
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,063
We've been calling him nonstop overnight.

572
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,983
He must be clueless about the state
this family is in right now.

573
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,776
He's supposed to be our lawyer.

574
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,237
Jeez.

575
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,099
I'll step inside.

576
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,736
First, you should sit down.

577
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,461
I'm sorry.

578
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,130
Two hours ago…

579
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,509
No…

580
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,427
I thought

581
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,847
I should tell you this in person.

582
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,977
Two hours ago…

583
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,231
Mr. Oh…

584
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,193
passed away.

585
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,498
Where?

586
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,167
On a bank near the Han River.

587
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,546
He was taken straight to the hospital…

588
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,674
but he had lost too much blood.

589
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,261
-Where is the morgue?
-The reporters have gathered outside.

590
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,846
Ms. Yoon told me

591
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,265
that the chairwoman
is going to the prosecution soon.

592
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,766
That's why the reporters must be here.

593
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,101
You should leave after she does.

594
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,207
I'm sorry.

595
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,050
This is hell.

596
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,847
I think I might go insane.

597
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,267
I feel so suffocated
that I might lose my mind.

598
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,688
My poor brother…

599
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,984
What do I do now?

600
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,571
I've lost my brother as well.

601
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,325
What am I to do now?

602
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,925
12 missed calls from Ms. Yoon
7 missed calls from Ms. Byeon

603
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,134
16 missed calls from Mr. Park
14 missed calls from Ms. Yoon

604
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,219
One new unread message

605
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,657
Look at you.

606
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,706
What took you so long to get here?

607
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,251
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I took some cold medication and…

608
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,627
So you were sleeping soundly

609
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,005
while this house was turned upside down?

610
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,673
We should go.

611
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,341
I've made the preparations.

612
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:16,013
The prosecution will just ask you
a few simple questions.

613
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,307
You don't need to do anything.
I'll take care of everything for you.

614
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,979
What's gotten into them?
Why would they summon me?

615
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,274
Don't tell me they're going to arrest me.

616
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,403
Mr. Oh

617
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,406
seems to have handed over
the ledgers to the prosecution.

618
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,491
He did?

619
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,202
It's not a big deal. I'll take care of it.

620
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,370
Wait.

621
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:45,834
I thought you said Wansoo's lover handed
the ledgers over to the prosecution.

622
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,505
I managed to sweep it under the rug

623
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,341
but Mr. Oh went ahead
and exposed the ledgers.

624
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,596
Keep your head clear
and follow me to the prosecutors' office.

625
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,681
All you need to do is sit there.

626
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:03,977
Are you sure

627
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,189
that the ledgers don't include
anything incriminating?

628
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,609
Of course. We should go.

629
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,822
The reporters have gathered outside.
I'm going to end up photographed.

630
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,701
There's no telling
how the public will react to this.

631
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,703
I've also taken measures against that.

632
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,624
It's time. Hold on.

633
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,637
Oh Wansoo's affair

634
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,766
The news about
the slush fund was covered up

635
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,142
with news of Oh Wansoo's affair.

636
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,853
The car is ready outside the gates.

637
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,774
You must now walk out the front gate
and deal with the reporters.

638
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:55,612
All you have to say to them is,
"I don't know anything about that."

639
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,073
Just what is going to happen to me?

640
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,950
We should head out for now.

641
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,245
Don't forget to keep looking confident.

642
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,291
You want me to leave like this?

643
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,259
Hey. There's been breaking news.

644
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,593
-What is it?
-Let me see.

645
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,679
-What's that?
-There was breaking news.

646
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,763
Let's check.

647
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,431
- What's this?
- Was this uploaded just now?

648
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,766
Oh Wansoo's affair?
Siphoned off slush funds with lover

649
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,101
It was uploaded just now.

650
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,352
It must be true.

651
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,187
No way.

652
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,272
-There she comes.
-There she is.

653
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,107
-She's here.
-She's coming.

654
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,693
- There she comes.
- There she is.

655
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,492
Move… Please.

656
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,918
I am sorry
for the inconvenience I've caused.

657
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,130
I will fully cooperate
with the prosecution's investigation

658
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,674
so that this misunderstanding
can be resolved.

659
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,010
Is the news
about Ms. Oh true?

660
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,054
Is her affair related to the slush funds?

661
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,308
The rumors spread by tabloids
have now been plastered all over the news.

662
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,434
Is it true?

663
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,853
Remain dignified. They're taking photos.

664
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,939
Then was the slush fund
at NOW Foundation

665
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,317
created by Director Oh,
who was planning to divorce her husband?

666
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,028
Is the news of Ms. Oh's affair true?
Who is the man she's with?

667
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,113
Why would you ask me that?

668
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,407
Is Ms. Oh in the house right now?

669
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,492
Will she be divorcing her husband?

670
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,704
Well, I really don't know
anything about that.

671
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,956
- We should go.
- Wait.

672
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,584
- Please give us a word.
- Talk to us.

673
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,377
- Chairwoman.
- Please answer us.

674
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,963
- Can you give us some answers?
- Please tell us.

675
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,182
Will Ms. Oh be coming out?

676
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,709
There still are
a lot of reporters outside.

677
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,421
Should I tell the chairwoman
about Mr. Oh's passing?

678
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,423
No. That won't be necessary.

679
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,759
She won't attend his funeral anyway.

680
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,388
But shouldn't you at least tell
the vice-chairman about this?

681
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,474
That won't be necessary.

682
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,938
I don't think you should
head out right now.

683
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,941
That's right. The news sites have
been plastered with articles about you.

684
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,234
You should wait upstairs for now.

685
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,569
-Please take her upstairs.
-All right.

686
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,450
Hyunsoo's wife should be
arriving at the airport.

687
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,702
I'll go to meet her.

688
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,704
You should head upstairs.

689
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,053
Vice-president's office

690
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,389
I got the news. Wansoo's brother died.

691
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,099
We're getting divorced.

692
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,519
You've put up all of my stocks as well
as my father's stocks as collateral

693
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,813
to buy even more Hwain Bio stocks.

694
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,399
You're a complete con man!

695
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,236
I told you already.

696
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,156
Before I divorce you,
I should report you to the police first.

697
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,077
Give me a break!

698
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,371
Your father gave me his permission.

699
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,415
What?

700
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,917
Father allowed me to do that.

701
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,211
What did you say?

702
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,016
What's all this?

703
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,976
Photos of you cheating on me.

704
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,187
I showed Father every last one of them.

705
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,817
You backstabbing punk.
You blackmailed him?

706
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,819
You punk. You bastard.

707
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,030
You jerk. You deceitful prick!

708
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,410
Did you film me having sex as well?

709
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:16,373
Yes.

710
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,516
I'm not getting a divorce.

711
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,227
I won't let you divorce me.

712
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,188
-Yongmin.
-And I'm putting everything into Hwain.

713
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,108
I won't let you off
if you ever get in my way.

714
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,490
You've messed with the wrong person.

715
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,575
Those photos?

716
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,578
Send them over to the press
and not just my dad.

717
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,997
Spread it worldwide for everyone to see!

718
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,249
I'm rich enough.

719
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,751
Cheating isn't reserved for men.

720
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,503
I'm going to be just fine.

721
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,047
As for you,

722
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,299
I'll make sure that you end up
crawling in the gutters.

723
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,553
You've messed with the wrong person.

724
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,312
I'm going to make you
lose everything you've got!

725
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,857
I won't ever forgive you.

726
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:38,079
We offer our condolences

727
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,670
The late Oh Hyunsoo

728
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,926
Here she comes!

729
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,930
PROSECUTION SERVICE

730
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,849
Will Hwain Group
be investigated as well?

731
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,769
-This is unbelievable.
-Were you aware of Ms. Oh's affair?

732
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,021
- How is Ms. Oh involved?
- Is it true?

733
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,190
-Please give us a word.
-What will happen to Hwain Group?

734
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,692
Just one comment, please.

735
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,318
Is Ms. Oh involved
with the slush funds?

736
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,153
- Tell us about the foundation's funds.
- How much is there?

737
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,906
- Answer us, please.
- Can you please tell us?

738
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,242
-Give us a word.
-Please wait.

739
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,577
About those reporters…

740
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,662
There weren't as many as I expected.

741
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:47,875
Did they all go
to report on Oh Wansoo's affair?

742
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,335
That would be for the best.

743
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,256
Let's stop by for some dumpling soup.

744
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,550
Yes, ma'am.

745
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,637
You should stay
at a hotel for the time being.

746
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,683
There's work to be done
with the reporters and everything else.

747
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,643
Work?

748
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,118
Why did you kill
Oh Wansoo's brother?

749
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,627
He embezzled money

750
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,962
and he was a gambling addict.

751
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,631
I guess a loan shark killed him.

752
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,384
Will everything be over then?

753
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,594
I'm doing my best.

754
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,139
You're sure

755
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,600
that I'll be safe, right?

756
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,120
We've even

757
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,622
had a son together.

758
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,792
I know I can trust you.

759
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:04,637
I felt bad that I couldn't give
something big to Yongmin.

760
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,681
I can see

761
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:09,809
how you might find that upsetting.

762
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,270
But you see,

763
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,940
I've built this company up
by entering a loveless marriage.

764
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,776
I need to protect Hwain.

765
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,196
Who succeeds the company
to protect it in the future

766
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,158
is what's really important.

767
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,122
Don't tell me

768
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,082
that you wanted Yongmin

769
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,461
to succeed the company
instead of Yongkook.

770
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,379
Is there a reason why he shouldn't?

771
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,470
Who in the world would have
the son they had with their concubine

772
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,307
succeed the company?

773
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:55,146
Does that make me a concubine?

774
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,607
Of course you are one.

775
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,532
My gosh.

776
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,121
Yongmin's in-laws have plenty of money.
That's more than enough for him.

777
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,588
So you're saying he has enough

778
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,466
for the son of a concubine?

779
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,580
Please enter the passcode.

780
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,753
The safe has been unlocked.

781
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,009
He told me to give it to Mr. Seo Doyoon

782
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,637
should something happen to him.

783
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:11,556
Well…

784
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,391
I actually have another favor to ask you.

785
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,370
Please tell the prosecution

786
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,540
that the evidence your husband prepared

787
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,502
is inside Mr. Han Sangil's safe at Hwain.
