This drama series is fictional

to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings, and events.

00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,384
Arrest warrant

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,554
May 18, 2023
Name: Oh Hyunsoo

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:13,847
This is an arrest warrant.

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,476
Mr. Oh. You're under arrest
for embezzling funds from NOW Foundation.

7
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,061
Take him in.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,354
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,694
Come with us.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,993
I was told they were tipped off.
We're still looking into it.

11
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,911
I don't need to be worried, right?

12
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,913
About Mr. Oh talking to them.

13
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,999
You don't have to worry about that.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,917
I'll report back to you.

15
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,478
Yes.

16
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,605
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,524
Mr. Han will be headed
to the prosecutor's office.

18
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,151
-I'll go too.
-Get the car ready.

19
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,235
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,919
We'll hide the ledgers first.
Then I'll look into what's going on.

21
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,546
He's the only family I have left.

22
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,596
Calm down.

23
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,056
He'll be all right.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,971
Incoming call
Vice-Chairman Kim Yongkook

25
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,226
What is it now?

26
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,690
Did you just order us to come here?

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,525
This is my office you're in.

28
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,504
What were you thinking?

29
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,590
You didn't ask for permission beforehand!

30
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,844
Why should I ask permission from you?

31
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,139
You should have asked if it was okay

32
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,349
and how you should have gone about it,

33
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,894
including when, why, and how!

34
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,523
You should have asked me that
and waited for my permission.

35
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,401
Have you lost it?

36
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,403
Did you forget your position?

37
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,948
I've got nothing but parasites around me.

38
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,910
-Vice-President.
-I'm sick of it all!

39
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,703
Why don't you give it a rest?

40
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,748
Mr. Han. What's gotten into him?

41
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,417
-Did he cause trouble?
-You better be quiet.

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,668
Hey, Yongmin.

43
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,381
We'll talk again
after I deal with everything.

44
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,467
From this moment on,

45
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,135
don't do anything.

46
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,511
What was that?

47
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,723
And you should give the investment
the green light already, President Seo.

48
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,559
I beg your pardon?

49
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,519
We'll continue this conversation later.

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,193
What's gotten into you? What did you do?

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,945
It's none of your business.

52
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,655
He said he'd deal with it.

53
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,365
What on earth did you do?

54
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,062
Red Swan

55
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,650
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

56
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,529
Episode 7

57
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,994
Interrogation room

58
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,208
I barely managed to get in.
They gave me three minutes.

59
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,960
Don't worry about me.

60
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,254
Just make sure none of this
gets leaked to the press.

61
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,256
If things look dire,

62
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,008
tell them Chairwoman Park ordered you.

63
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,759
Don't take the blame for everything.

64
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,679
All right, Wansoo.

65
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,307
Why are you so laid back?

66
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,269
What did you say?
You want to get revenge on the chairwoman?

67
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,937
Goodness.

68
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,981
Do you see now that it's impossible?

69
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,568
Hwain has a tight grip on my life.

70
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,653
So why are you so laid back?

71
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,826
Because I also have
a tight grip on Hwain's life.

72
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,844
You should leave.

73
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,387
I'll wait at home.

74
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,158
Kim Yongmin was the one
who did this, wasn't he?

75
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,036
Why would he do such a thing?

76
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,790
It was just NOW Foundation,
so please take good care of it.

77
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,834
I will do as you instruct
and cooperate with the investigation.

78
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,130
Let me access all the borrowed-name
and secret accounts under my name.

79
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,427
All you need to do is let me have access
to the bank accounts under my name.

80
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,596
Is that going to be enough?

81
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,890
We have 550 bank accounts
created using borrowed names.

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,684
I have the full list of the accounts.

83
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,230
That's practically suicide.

84
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,606
The worst I'll do is probation.

85
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,109
But have me released on bail first.

86
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,985
Have me investigated without detention.

87
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,364
Sure.

88
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,700
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

89
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,202
Does Vice-President Kim Yongmin know

90
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,164
that the chairwoman has borrowed-name
accounts worth over two trillion won?

91
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,916
That's enough.

92
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,544
Don't be so quick to make assumptions.

93
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,879
Yes, sir.

94
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,631
Understood.

95
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,431
It seems I've taught you too well.

96
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,684
Don't miss out on a bigger chance
for something so trivial.

97
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,191
The prosecution doesn't know about
the bribes we gave…

98
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,653
to the commissioners
of the KCS and the NTS.

99
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,823
Oh…

100
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,700
You must have made
backups of the evidence.

101
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,163
Hold on to them well.

102
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,084
Right.

103
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,214
Director Oh's bodyguard

104
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,802
seems to have taken the original copies
of the foundation's ledgers from my study.

105
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,056
Could it be him
who tipped off the prosecution?

106
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,435
I thought I should tell you,

107
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,482
or you would have kept arguing
that Vice-President Kim was behind this.

108
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,623
Oh Wansoo

109
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,168
Oh Wansoo
Director, former pro golfer

110
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,052
NOW Foundation's Oh Wansoo
invested 8.4 billion won in CSR last year

111
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,061
What was Mr. Han talking about earlier?

112
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,188
The one who tipped off the prosecution…

113
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,066
about the NOW Foundation is me.

114
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,484
What for?

115
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,069
I read a tabloid article

116
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,364
about how Mom began
to work on Yongkook's succession,

117
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,368
so I leaked a small portion
of the dirt I've gathered on them

118
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,203
with a little exaggeration.

119
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,622
Wasn't his succession a done deal?

120
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,375
Hey, do you expect me
to let Yongkook take everything?

121
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,337
You're invisible to the people of Hwain.

122
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,838
Everything there belongs to your brother.

123
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,008
-Says who?
-Your mother won't split Hwain in two.

124
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,890
I don't want to split Hwain in two either.

125
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,517
What do you mean?

126
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,645
Let's just sit back and enjoy the ride.

127
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,106
Then what about Wansoo's brother?

128
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,400
Who do you think is in charge
of Mother's slush funds?

129
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,651
Wasn't it Mr. Han?

130
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:33,114
Mr. Oh also has a hand in managing
the borrowed-name accounts.

131
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,950
How much is there in total?

132
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,203
I couldn't find that out.

133
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,331
That's why I prodded them a little.

134
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,876
You should go ahead with the duty-free
shop investment as Mr. Han said.

135
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,462
He promised that it'll be bequeathed
to us later down the line.

136
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,798
-I don't want to.
-Damn it.

137
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,967
You may not need the money,

138
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,261
but I want to beat Yongkook at his game.

139
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,558
Whatever.

140
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,935
Why did you come home so early?

141
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,564
I'm going out again.

142
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,570
Be careful not to spread any rumors.

143
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,535
Are you sure that Mr. Oh
will be the only one taking the fall?

144
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,078
Of course, ma'am.

145
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,289
What did Mr. Oh say?

146
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,833
There's no need for you
to be worried about that.

147
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,418
I'll deal with it myself.

148
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,591
And Taera's half-brother…

149
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,426
He'll be coming to see me from Hong Kong.

150
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,136
What should I do about that?

151
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,639
I'll take care of it.

152
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,434
Have the press keep quiet

153
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,227
so that I don't get dragged
through the mud.

154
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,153
Have I ever let your name
get dragged through the mud?

155
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,326
One more thing.

156
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,205
We should find out
who blew the whistle on us.

157
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,882
Actually, I already have
a suspect in mind.

158
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:25,142
Ledger
NOW Foundation

159
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,784
Company status
Financial status

160
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,956
Representative: Park Miran

161
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,169
Representative: Park Miran

162
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,632
Confirmation of representative director

163
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,384
May 15, 2023
NOW Foundation

164
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,177
Hwain Group
Chairwoman Park Miran

165
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,931
I thought Mr. Oh
and Director Oh would be listed

166
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,392
as the managers of the slush funds.

167
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,912
Sit down.

168
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,999
You should sit down as well, Mr. Han.

169
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,550
Tell me.

170
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,052
What's the relationship between you two?

171
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,472
I'm sorry?

172
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,391
That damn bodyguard.

173
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,062
Aren't you going to answer me?

174
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,356
I'm talking about your bodyguard.

175
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,819
What is the relationship you have
with Seo Doyoon, the bodyguard?

176
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,702
I'm highly offended,
but I'm sure you have a reason to ask.

177
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:11,332
NOW Foundation's original ledgers
have disappeared from my study.

178
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,337
You don't have
anything to do with this, do you?

179
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,217
My study is the only place here
without any CCTVs.

180
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,427
I am aware.

181
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,180
But thankfully, there was a witness

182
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,849
who told me that it was Seo Doyoon
who stole the ledgers.

183
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,209
Aren't you going to tell me

184
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,212
what's going on between you two?

185
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,259
I told him to do it.

186
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,262
I asked him to bring me the ledgers.

187
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,557
-Why you--
-But this photo isn't what it looks like.

188
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,392
As you already know,

189
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,937
the photo was taken on the day
I scattered my mother's ashes at sea.

190
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,814
I could barely stand up.

191
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,440
He was justâ€¦

192
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,068
doing his job as a bodyguard.

193
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,319
I understand

194
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,574
since I know very well
where and how your mother died.

195
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,536
So regardless of
whether your brother lived or died,

196
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,746
you stole NOW Foundation's ledgers

197
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,124
to give to the prosecution?

198
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,375
No, ma'am.

199
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:40,170
I only wanted them so that I could
go over them before I made NOW Foundation

200
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,798
an international organization.

201
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,134
My brother kept a lot of secrets from me.

202
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,052
Do you trust your bodyguard?

203
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,974
Mr. Park told me he could be trusted
since he used to be a competent policeman.

204
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,767
Don't let your bodyguard
take advantage of you.

205
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,145
- You should watch your words, Mr. Han.
- Forget it.

206
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,522
Fire him immediately then.

207
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,274
He has the original ledgers.

208
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,027
The ledgers he gave the prosecution
should be copies.

209
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,865
Then have him killed right away.

210
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,409
-But ma'am--
-What will you do about this?

211
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,622
How could you have let him
get his hands on the foundation's ledgers?

212
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,832
Have you completely lost it?

213
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,335
There was no telling
what he'd do with those ledgers.

214
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,589
This will go way beyond
just your brother rotting in jail.

215
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,090
He wouldn't have done that.

216
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,884
I'm sure that it wasn't him.

217
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,887
"That can't be true.
He wouldn't have done that. I trust him."

218
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,306
Are you two in love or something?

219
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,142
You've let your emotions
get the better of you.

220
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,436
You'll ruin us all.

221
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,938
Please stop, ma'am.

222
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,731
I've seen this photo long ago already.

223
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:45,069
The photo of you and your damn bodyguard
in a loving embrace.

224
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,032
I thought you were just paying him
a little extra for physical services.

225
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,368
That wouldn't have been a problem

226
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,953
as long as it was kept discreet.

227
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,829
That's why I just let you.

228
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,581
A couple of flings
would have been fine

229
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,707
but you took things too far.

230
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,792
Now look at you.

231
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,461
"I asked him to steal the ledgers for me."

232
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,545
You fool!

233
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,216
He graduated
from the Police University with honors.

234
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,885
He's at least 15 times
smarter than you are,

235
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,554
but you left the fox
to guard the henhouse.

236
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,640
-Do you have a death wish?
-I'll sort it out.

237
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,724
How will you do that?

238
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:23,107
The foundation's ledgers
are in the wrong hands right now.

239
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,150
Will you

240
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,361
kill him yourself?

241
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,446
He didn't have time
to give the prosecution the ledgers.

242
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,531
I'm sure of it.

243
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,325
I taught Mr. Oh everything
although he wasn't qualified for the job.

244
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,369
Why do you think I did that?

245
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,454
Because he was tied to us
through marriage.

246
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,915
Mr. Oh can never betray Hwain

247
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,584
and Hwain won't ever betray
you and your brother either.

248
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,337
We can trust each other.

249
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,217
But what did Seo Doyoon tell you

250
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,723
so that you'd trust him
and have him steal the ledgers?

251
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,853
After you retrieve the ledgers,

252
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,273
make sure to deal with him accordingly.

253
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,152
And you should come to your senses now.

254
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,822
I'll get the ledgers from him
and return them to you.

255
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,658
Please take care

256
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,702
of Hyunsoo for me.

257
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,047
What if they already slept together?

258
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,007
You shouldn't worry too much.

259
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,469
I'll deal with
both the bodyguard and the ledgers.

260
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,721
How can I not be worried right now?

261
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,099
Damn it.

262
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,836
Q1. I hear you used to be in the force.

263
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,671
Yes, sir.

264
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,134
So why did you come to work for Hwain?

265
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,720
Is there something you're after?

266
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,056
Not at all, sir.

267
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,641
Are you sure?

268
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,392
Yes, sir.

269
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,193
Return the ledgers.

270
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,572
Men of the law shouldn't be
coveting other people's property.

271
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,041
What if I don't want to?

272
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,509
It's always the reckless ones
who end up hurting themselves.

273
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,638
Be careful.

274
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,610
He was the one
who created the ledgers.

275
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,529
What could he be after?

276
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,332
You surprised me.

277
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,084
May I have a moment?

278
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,554
I hear Wansoo's brother was arrested.

279
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,348
Hong Kong's hedge fund manager
Jang Taesoo…

280
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,144
Yes. That's my half-brother.

281
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,105
Do you think Hwain
is some neighborhood corner store?

282
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,110
-I'm sorry?
-Does it look like we need money urgently?

283
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,989
But I heard that Wansoo ruined
the launch of Cosmo's new product

284
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,449
and Cosmo backed out of the investment.

285
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,534
Does it look like we need money urgently?

286
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,414
Listen, Mr. Han.

287
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:11,668
I'm ranked the second-highest
in this family after the chairwoman.

288
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,879
You should know your place.

289
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,762
Why that…

290
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,723
Unbelievable.

291
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,810
I was so startled.

292
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,938
I thought I'd be getting caught.

293
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,399
What did he say?
Is Wansoo's brother going to prison?

294
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,109
I forgot to ask him that.

295
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,527
Then what did you talk about?

296
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,490
They didn't need our money
and told me to know my place.

297
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,995
I didn't offer them the money
because they didn't have any.

298
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,832
I was just trying to help them out
as their in-law

299
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,211
so that we could strengthen the bond
between the two families.

300
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,837
Maybe they don't want to do that with us.

301
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,673
How ridiculous.

302
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,842
All they have
to their name is their wealth.

303
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,803
Goodness.

304
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,399
I'm going out for a run.
Wait for me at the front gate.

305
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,468
I guess you have something to tell me.

306
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,055
Do you have evidence to prove to me

307
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,433
that the same person was behind
the attack in Manila and the drone attack?

308
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,643
Can you be sure

309
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,230
that I was attacked by the same person
who killed your friend?

310
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,944
You suspect me.

311
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,612
You saved my life.

312
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,115
You even risked your own life to do so.

313
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,617
But you still suspect me.

314
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,702
That's why…

315
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,915
I thought I should suspect you even more.

316
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,377
That's reasonable.

317
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,212
-Give me the ledgers.
-I can't.

318
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,050
Mr. Han and Chairwoman Park already know
that it was you who took the ledgers.

319
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,301
K1 reported it.

320
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,179
Mr. Han believes
that my brother was arrested

321
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,599
because you gave the copies
of the ledgers to the prosecution.

322
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,726
You know that isn't true.

323
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,813
I went over the ledgers.

324
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,815
It's not what you suspected.

325
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,942
What do you mean?

326
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,737
You said that the chairwoman and Mr. Han
arranged it so that the slush funds

327
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,989
would be led back to you and Mr. Oh.

328
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,991
My brother told me

329
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,410
that it was to keep us hostage at Hwain.

330
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,996
It was completely off the mark.

331
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,248
Then who?

332
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,667
Representative: Park Miran

333
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,879
Hwain Group
Chairwoman Park Miran

334
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,384
The chairwoman.

335
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,930
You said that Mr. Han
managed the original ledgers himself.

336
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,893
Yes. My brother only wrote up
the ledgers that were manipulated.

337
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,607
All the slush funds within Hwain
flow through NOW Foundation

338
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,025
and into other accounts.

339
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,986
I still don't know
whether those funds are being kept

340
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,781
to be laundered or to be used
for the vice-chairman's succession,

341
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,200
but all the funds in the ledgers

342
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,993
lead back to the chairwoman.

343
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,538
Why? For what purpose?

344
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,499
I don't know yet. I'm looking into it.

345
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:41,837
I told them that I was the one

346
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,131
who made you steal the ledgers.

347
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,470
I told you not to do such a thing!

348
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,264
As long as I have the ledgers,

349
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,099
they can't do anything to me rashly.

350
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,976
-They can't even fire me.
-You're wrong.

351
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,853
They could still kill you.

352
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,229
I can take care of myself.

353
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,276
You didn't need to tell them
that it was your order.

354
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,778
Give me the ledgers.

355
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,613
We have the original ledgers.

356
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,575
We can find who was behind the attacks
and expose their slush funds.

357
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,326
-We need to return them.
-No.

358
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,413
We need them in order for us
to fight back against them.

359
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,333
What are you saying?
They're already on to us.

360
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,002
Trust me.

361
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,463
When the car exploded,

362
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,423
what do you think ran across my mind?

363
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,925
I vowed

364
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,761
that I would rescue you
from this hell on Earth.

365
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,056
I can protect you.

366
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,976
I'm sure of that.

367
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,111
He came home a moment ago.

368
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,949
He went upstairs
after dropping by to see Junhee.

369
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,744
Why should I care
whether he sleeps with his wife or not?

370
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:41,206
But he always slept
at his apartment ever since you moved in.

371
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,584
I guess he was anxious because of
what happened to Wansoo's brother.

372
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,044
Forget it, Mom. I'm hanging up.

373
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,379
You know what?

374
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,925
The press doesn't seem to know
what happened to Mr. Oh yet.

375
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,052
Why would that matter to us?

376
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,304
Come on, you fool.

377
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,976
This could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance
that you can't afford to miss.

378
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,602
A chance?

379
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,853
A chance for what?

380
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,556
Bring me an espresso
and have Mr. Han come here right away.

381
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,640
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,102
-I'd also like a cup of coffee.
-Yes, sir.

383
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,814
What is all this?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

384
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,524
Will NOW Foundation's embezzlement case
affect Hwain Group?

385
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,359
What if things end up getting out of hand?

386
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,528
I've instructed our legal team
to prepare a press release.

387
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,780
I've already talked to Mr. Oh
so that he'd refuse to talk

388
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,741
without the presence of his lawyer.

389
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,951
I'll pay a visit to the prosecution now.

390
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,453
Once people begin talking,

391
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,080
no one will be able to help us.
Not even the prosecution.

392
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,672
Did Oh Wansoo know about
Oh Hyunsoo's embezzlement?

393
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,176
Rumors of Oh Wansoo's
impending divorce reignited!

394
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,479
We're preparing a press release
to refute the rumors of your divorce.

395
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,274
-Is there anything else--
-Hold on.

396
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,026
Let me think.

397
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,094
HWAIN
Hwain corporation

398
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,242
Will NOW Foundation's embezzlement case
affect Hwain?

399
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,744
What will happen
if we cut off ties with Mr. Oh?

400
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,623
As long as the charges
don't lead them back to Hwain,

401
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,668
we won't have to lose Mr. Oh.

402
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,212
Why are they talking about
me getting divorced?

403
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,965
-I know they're just guessing, but--
-You're making my head hurt!

404
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,520
Put them in the basement.

405
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,646
Yes, ma'am.

406
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,987
Hey. What are you doing?

407
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,909
What are you doing here
in broad daylight?

408
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,036
I'm so anxious I can't stay there.

409
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,913
What is it? What are you so anxious about?

410
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,959
What if the chairwoman finds out
that we tipped off the press?

411
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,337
Could Oh Wansoo be involved
in Hwain's Oh Hyunsoo's embezzlement?

412
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,008
How would Chairwoman Park know that?

413
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,926
She's not a psychic
and neither is she clairvoyant.

414
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,262
You have no idea what she's like.

415
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,805
They have their people everywhere,

416
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,599
even in the prosecution,
the police, and the press.

417
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,393
Don't worry about it.
Money will solve everything.

418
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,189
Do you know how much I paid that reporter?

419
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,691
He swore never to tell anyone
that he heard it from me.

420
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,861
Hurry back home
before they start suspecting you.

421
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,758
When is the warrant being examined?

422
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,177
Can you promise me that I will be
investigated without detention?

423
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,065
I can promise you that.

424
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,530
Since you were involved
in creating the borrowed-name accounts,

425
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,699
I doubt you'll be telling them about that.

426
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,079
Where are you keeping the evidence
of the bribes we gave

427
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,166
to the National Tax Service
and the Korean Customs Service?

428
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,710
I'll hand that over
once this ordeal is taken care of

429
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,878
and I am released from here.

430
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,257
You have to keep your word, Mr. Oh.

431
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,384
Once everything is handled,

432
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,386
you will hand over the files to me.

433
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:50,932
Does the chairwoman know

434
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,561
that Vice-President Kim
blew the whistle on us?

435
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,356
Didn't I tell you that he wasn't the one?

436
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,607
The whistleblower was

437
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,485
Director Oh's bodyguard
who stole the foundation's ledgers.

438
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,864
You're wrong.

439
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,033
The prosecution
doesn't know a thing about the ledgers.

440
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,786
They didn't even get
anywhere near our slush funds.

441
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,871
All they're hanging onto

442
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,915
is the mere hundreds of billions
that they were tipped off about.

443
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,335
I suggest you stay out of it.

444
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,588
That has nothing to do with--

445
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,714
You can rest assured

446
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,841
that I won't involve myself
in that business.

447
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,511
You better do that

448
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,264
if you want to get

449
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,892
everything you want out of us.

450
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,621
I've managed to silence Mr. Oh.

451
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,915
I'm also talking to the prosecution to
have him investigated without detention.

452
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,876
Our issue is the public.

453
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,671
We need news that's big enough
to cover up the embezzlement.

454
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,131
What do you suggest?

455
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,887
We should have NOW Foundation's
Director Oh Wansoo resign.

456
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,223
Do you think those vultures
from the press will quietly step back

457
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,100
by removing her from the foundation?

458
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,978
We won't be removing her.
We'll make her step down herself.

459
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,939
But she refuses to do that.

460
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,441
She also has that deal
with the Chinese ambassador over us.

461
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,864
What about her affair?

462
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,533
-What do you think?
-What?

463
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,786
What if Oh Wansoo, the people's hero
and the angel of charity,

464
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,081
is exposed to the world
for having an affair with her bodyguard?

465
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,167
That should be enough to cover up
the embezzlement case.

466
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,128
She will also have to step down
from her position as director.

467
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,131
Then what does that make Yongkook?

468
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,675
He'll be humiliated.

469
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,011
You should convince him
that it couldn't be helped

470
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,889
to ensure that he succeeds Hwain
without a hitch.

471
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,698
-I've brought Director Oh.
-Right.

472
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,032
You…

473
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,867
I need you to travel to Busan.

474
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,706
She wants you to attend the first
anniversary of Hwain Resort in Busan.

475
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,876
You and your husband
should do a photoshoot together

476
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,420
so that rumors of divorce die down.

477
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,090
You can also invite
some people in need to the ceremony

478
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,134
and give them donations.

479
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,388
That's right.

480
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,641
You should do that
to shut the reporters up.

481
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,060
For your brother's sake.

482
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,771
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,692
Then you should go there with Q1 first.

484
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:53,031
The vice-chairman still has some paperwork
left to do for Hwain Securities.

485
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,699
He'll leave after you do.

486
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,201
Sure.

487
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,383
Have the PR team
let the reporters know of our photoshoot

488
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,094
and also send them the schedule
for the charity in Busan.

489
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,304
Yes, ma'am.

490
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,265
The vice-chairman is still in a meeting
with the company presidents.

491
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,184
I will head for Busan tomorrow
after I prepare your wardrobe.

492
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,518
All right.

493
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,062
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yes, ma'am.

494
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,621
I hope your trip to New York
has been enjoyable, sir.

495
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,167
I prepared my will while I was there.

496
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,880
Why did you do that
without discussing it with me?

497
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,008
You don't expect me to discuss
such matters with you, do you?

498
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,349
I don't want to live for too long.

499
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,975
Living until 70 is more than enough.

500
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,145
Now that I've taken care of everything,

501
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,774
I won't have any regrets
if I live another couple of years.

502
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,534
Even if I die today,

503
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,121
I've arranged it
so that my will is to be disclosed

504
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,289
on my 70th birthday.

505
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,376
It will happen on that day

506
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,961
regardless of when I die.

507
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,548
I want you to read it out
to my family when the time comes.

508
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,515
But why did you
go all the way to New York?

509
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,810
I don't think there are

510
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,231
any law firms in this country
that you don't have influence over.

511
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,902
It was so that it would be
kept a secret until that day arrived.

512
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,155
Then does that mean

513
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:02,034
that no one in the family
knows the contents of your will?

514
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,494
That's right.

515
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,291
I'm sure you know the reason

516
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,127
why I've taken such a measure.

517
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,173
Could it be…

518
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,678
because of your father's slush fund
that's kept in the Swiss bank account?

519
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,231
Hello, Mr. Han.

520
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,861
It's so good to see you.

521
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,449
I asked to see you
since I learned that you'd be visiting.

522
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,034
Don't mention it.

523
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,661
I should come running anytime
if Hwain wants to see me.

524
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,580
You've been a client
at our law firm for 20 years.

525
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,043
Decaf, double shot with Yirgacheffe beans?

526
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,005
I can't believe you remember that.
That's exactly what I want.

527
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,842
I can see that you haven't
changed at all over the years

528
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,469
both in looks and your taste in coffee.

529
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,101
Thank you.

530
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,897
Decaf, double shot with Yirgacheffe beans.

531
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,357
Yes, sir.

532
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,278
What urgent business did you have?

533
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,864
We would have met next month
to execute the will anyway.

534
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,951
Hmm…

535
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:31,332
On top of the money your law firm
receives for laundering Hwain's funds,

536
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,878
I'd like to pay you
another 1% as a commission.

537
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,173
For me?

538
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,926
Without your firm knowing.

539
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,762
Where's the money
coming from? Is it from Hwain

540
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,846
or you, Mr. Han?

541
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,932
Whoever it may be,

542
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,102
I can guarantee the 1%.

543
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,104
What's the catch?

544
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,814
Hmm…

545
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,693
I'd like to know the content of the will

546
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,612
before it's executed.

547
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,328
I cannot do that, unfortunately.

548
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,164
Attorney-client privilege.

549
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,251
Well…

550
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,087
Money of this size…

551
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,215
We're going to need
some time to arrange it.

552
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,010
Thank you.

553
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,184
Mmm…

554
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,729
The coffee here still tastes good.

555
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,902
Mr. Han.

556
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,406
We've known each other
for a long time, haven't we?

557
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:50,161
Yes. We would have known each other
for over twenty years next year.

558
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,997
I already told you all I could
because of our friendship.

559
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,709
"Big money is headed
toward NOW Foundation."

560
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,669
I refuse to tell you any more than this.

561
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,600
I convinced Dad.

562
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,311
He says he'll consider
wasting money on Hwain.

563
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,231
Good job.

564
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,525
Mr. Han will grow the duty-free business
and hand it over to us,

565
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,152
ensuring we get
double the amount we invested.

566
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,446
They'll also give us something else
as promised, right?

567
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,783
I don't want something
as small as NOW Foundation.

568
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,869
Something major along the lines of
construction or chemicals would be great.

569
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,414
I'm not after their subsidiaries.

570
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,166
It's the head office I want.

571
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,461
You should stop dreaming
and start being more practical.

572
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,089
Goodness.

573
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,840
I'll see you at home.

574
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,842
Right. See you.

575
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,016
Incoming call
Mr. Han

576
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,938
I took care of the duty-free shop.
I'll see you tomorrow.

577
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,274
I'll see you at 8 o'clock tonight
in the basement room at Wyndham Hotel.

578
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,944
I can't today.
I have to be home later.

579
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,988
Your life is on the line,
so be there no matter what.

580
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,538
Seriously?

581
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,582
I can't believe this man.

582
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,593
This Water of Life
is all the rage across the country.

583
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,262
You know what?

584
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,639
I don't think
it's as effective as it used to be.

585
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,600
I still feel tired even after I take it.

586
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,352
Oh my. Is that so?

587
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,106
I'll double the dosage this time then.

588
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,485
One more bottle.

589
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,825
Hurry.

590
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,665
We're administering it now, ma'am.

591
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,875
All right.

592
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,921
That's what I'm talking about.

593
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,257
I think I'm starting to feel better.

594
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,009
Hmm…

595
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,679
Hey. Keep giving me
double the dosage from now on.

596
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,805
Don't worry about the cost.

597
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,893
I'll do that, ma'am.

598
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,811
Good.

599
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:31,280
Busan

600
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,751
Did you rent a convertible on purpose?

601
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,129
Yes, so you can enjoy
watching the sea as much as you want.

602
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,777
What is it? What's on your mind?

603
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,200
Hyunsoo is under arrest right now.

604
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,035
But still…

605
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,497
it's nice to be by the sea.

606
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,375
That's what I was thinking.

607
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:47,314
What are we doing here?

608
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,202
Come out. Breathe the air in
as much as you want.

609
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,226
I didn't realize the sea could be so sad.

610
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,442
Do you think the sea
where I scattered my mom's ashes

611
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,737
ended up here in the end?

612
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,906
You should never forgive the people

613
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,701
who did that to your mother.

614
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,412
I, too,

615
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,707
won't ever forgive

616
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,252
the people who did that to Juhyuk.

617
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,100
Why? You've never seen
anyone do this before?

618
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,606
You should begin

619
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,402
once you photograph their affair.

620
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,861
Yes, sir.

621
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,571
Oh Wansoo is your only target.

622
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:04,076
And don't forget to leave his prints
at the scene and on the knife.

623
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,120
-Yes, sir.
-Don't forget.

624
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,664
I won't allow you

625
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,457
to make any more mistakes.

626
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,112
Welcome, Director.

627
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,196
Hello.

628
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,281
This way.

629
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,924
If you leave
a paper trail like this,

630
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,762
why would we go through the trouble
of creating borrowed-name accounts?

631
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,432
Print out the list of all the accounts
that you're respectively in charge of!

632
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,060
What are you waiting for?

633
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,398
And don't print them out here!

634
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,900
Do it at home!

635
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,276
Yes, sir.

636
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,661
I'm sorry, sir.

637
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,123
I think the meeting will be delayed.

638
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,097
Is that so?

639
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,599
I understand.

640
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,559
Wait, Ms. Yoon.

641
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:56,021
Let me know if there are any updates
regarding Mr. Oh's investigation.

642
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,732
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

643
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,863
The vice-chairman won't make it today.

644
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,698
It was Ms. Yoon calling
to let you know, right?

645
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,201
You're right.

646
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,259
I guess it's just us two.

647
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,636
I guess so.

648
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,930
You should get some rest.
I'll take you to your room.

649
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,017
Oh, no.

650
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,435
My goodness.

651
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:37,855
Are you all right?

652
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,148
I'm fine. We should head up.

653
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,030
It must have been hot.

654
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,962
You should begin
once you photograph their affair.

655
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,202
What are you doing?

656
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,579
Guarding you overnight.

657
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,582
I'll turn off the light
once you're in bed.

658
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,043
You should sleep in your room.

659
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,173
You're going to stay here?

660
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,008
Yes. You're still in danger.

661
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,801
You should get some rest.

662
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:19,957
I'm sorry.

663
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,230
I'll have my heart

664
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,316
on hold for the time being…

665
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,987
so you'll have nothing to be ashamed of.

666
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,907
It's me who should do that

667
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,410
so that you can remain dignified.

668
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,293
Sleep tight.

669
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,045
I'll take a look outside.

670
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:13,088
Listen, go out the window
and get as far away as you can.

671
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,937
Just accept NOW Foundation quietly.

672
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,190
-What are you trying to pull?
-Next month,

673
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,609
Chairman Kim Duo's will
is going to be executed.

674
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,656
My old man never liked me anyway.

675
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,041
Listen, Mr. Han.

676
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,002
It's Hwain I want,

677
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,672
not some foundation
that launders money for Yongkook.

678
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,132
I will give you Hwain.

679
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:09,514
Kim Duo left a large amount of money
for the NOW Foundation.

680
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,517
If you get your hands on that money,

681
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,186
I'd say you have a good chance
against Yongkook

682
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,231
in succeeding the group.
