00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,920
This drama series is fictional
and is not related in any way

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,965
to actual places, persons,
organizations, settings and events.

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,389
There's a secret
behind the honorary chairman's death.

4
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,142
That's why Juhyuk
left these videos behind.

5
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,668
I'll get straight to the point.

6
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,503
I'm not comfortable with you here.

7
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,756
Someone tried to kill you, Director Oh.

8
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,884
-Are you even listening?
-They failed.

9
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,886
-And?
-We're up against professionals.

10
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,721
If I were them, I'd try again.

11
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,264
What are you saying?

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,933
I'll protect your life.

13
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,773
You asked me if I was
really just a passerby in Manila.

14
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,816
What if I wasn't?

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,782
A friend of mine died in Manila.

16
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,701
The person who killed my friend

17
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,163
is the same person

18
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,248
who attacked you in Manila.

19
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,917
What did you say?

20
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,213
Listen.

21
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,256
It was an international act of terrorism.

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,428
It wasn't.

23
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,430
It wasn't ISIS who attacked you.

24
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,226
Then who was it? Why do they want me dead?

25
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,685
We'll ask them once we catch them.

26
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,064
What are you trying to pull?
Are you threatening me?

27
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,776
So what you're saying is

28
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,530
that the terrorist who tried to kill me
also killed your friend

29
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,949
and that they'll be back again to kill me?

30
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,077
So you're going to wait beside me
for them to strike again?

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,537
That's one thing I can be sure of.

32
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,831
I saw their signature.

33
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,768
Don't trust anyone from now on
and don't leave my side.

34
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,228
I'll protect you.

35
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,233
Red Swan

36
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,989
Episode 3

37
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,464
2 years ago

38
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,183
Restricted area

39
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,278
Ten-hut. Salute.

40
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,031
At ease. Senior Inspector Seo Doyoon.

41
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,658
Senior Inspector Shin Juhyuk.

42
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,034
Lower your voices.

43
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,579
Do you know why I called you here?

44
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,789
No, sir.

45
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,421
Senior Inspector Seo will be assigned
to the Presidential Security Service.

46
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,007
You will be guarding
the president at close quarters.

47
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,550
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,179
You will take note of the people
the president meets privately,

49
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,848
the dates he meets them,
how long he meets them for,

50
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,934
and also what they discuss if possible,

51
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,103
and report back to me.

52
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,692
Did you not understand?

53
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,946
All the information I come across

54
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,573
during my duty is to be kept confidential
to my understanding.

55
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,372
Who am I?

56
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,208
You are the commissioner general
of the National Police Agency.

57
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,253
I am responsible
for all the investigations we perform.

58
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,171
Do you understand?

59
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,966
I do, sir.

60
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,221
Senior Inspector Shin

61
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,182
will be assigned to Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency's Intelligence Office 1.

62
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,186
Based on the intel
Senior Inspector Seo brings us,

63
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,522
you will secretly investigate
the slush funds

64
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,066
kept by those
who met the president in private

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,237
and report your findings
to me and no one else.

66
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,488
Understood?

67
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,742
Are we secretly investigating
the slush funds kept by the conglomerates?

68
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,994
That's exactly what we're doing.

69
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,164
No one else can know of this
other than you two

70
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,459
and myself.

71
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,004
Don't forget it.

72
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,216
Why have you packed so much?

73
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,427
You're right.
I think I went a bit overboard.

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,763
I've got new intel.

75
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,639
-You know the Eight Star Gang, right?
-I do.

76
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,308
The gang of Chinese emigrants in Incheon?

77
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,976
They're not just in Incheon.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,270
They're also active in Busan,
Shanghai, and Hong Kong,

79
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,772
and have their headquarters in Manila.

80
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,107
Don't they run illegal gambling houses?

81
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,109
They dabble in gambling,
drugs, contract killings…

82
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,486
Anything that brings in money.

83
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,155
So you've got intel
on the Eight Star Gang in Manila.

84
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,700
You said you were investigating the death
of Hwain Group's Chairman Kim Duo.

85
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,619
Was he really murdered?

86
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,288
I haven't gotten anything solid yet.

87
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,167
I received intel that Hwain Group
launders their slush funds

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,586
through the Eight Star Fortune Casino.

89
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,130
Then are you saying

90
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,676
that Chairman Kim's death has something
to do with their money laundering scheme?

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,553
Whatever it is,
I have to look into it first.

92
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,431
Juhyuk!

93
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,731
Commissioner General's office

94
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,816
How can I help you?

95
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,526
Excuse me. Excuse me!

96
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,653
You can't just barge in here like that!

97
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,122
He died for nothing.

98
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,040
Why have you stopped the investigation?

99
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,584
I'll carry on the investigation
to get to the bottom of it all!

100
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,295
Are you talking
about the death of Shin Juhyuk?

101
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,925
Sir.

102
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,718
Please let me investigate.

103
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,597
Juhyuk's death would be in vain
if we close the case now.

104
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,267
But we don't have
any leads about the killer.

105
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,532
Send me to Manila.

106
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,825
I'll catch the killer.

107
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,785
Stop being unreasonable.

108
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,759
Shin Juhyuk

109
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,557
Don't trust anyone from now on
and don't leave my side.

110
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,477
I'll protect you.

111
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,072
I've shipped out
all the vaccines from Hwain Bio.

112
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,740
I've heard.

113
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,372
Yongmin wanted to see me
so I went to talk to him.

114
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,918
About what?

115
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,962
I hear he'll be investing
in our duty-free shops.

116
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,505
It seems that way.

117
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,341
You agreed to help them launch
their cosmetics line in China in return.

118
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,511
I met with the Chinese ambassador.
It's underway.

119
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,596
Keep a close eye on Yongmin.

120
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,307
He's living with his wife's family
but keeps meddling in our affairs.

121
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,767
More importantly,

122
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,478
we need to change accounting firms.

123
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,772
What?

124
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,983
We should prepare to make the foundation
an international organization.

125
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,901
What are you saying?

126
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,737
We need to stop Chairwoman Park
from taking our funds.

127
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,155
What?

128
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,866
The foundation needs to be transparent and
turned into an international organization.

129
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,244
You already agreed
not to interfere in our business…

130
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,248
…and I won't beat around the bush
since I'm your brother.

131
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,126
We're just here to launder money for them.

132
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,837
I didn't know until now,

133
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,338
and I don't intend to find out more.

134
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,591
It's not that simple of a matter.

135
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,634
Do you know why I still haven't
divorced my husband?

136
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,888
We'll no longer launder money for them.
Not anymore.

137
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,309
Do you know how much money
your husband needs

138
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,768
to inherit the management rights?

139
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,437
I said I wouldn't do it.

140
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,190
There's a lot you don't know about.
It really isn't that simple.

141
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,068
I've also prepared a lot.

142
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,530
NOW Foundation will be made
an international organization.

143
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,370
Does the chairwoman know?

144
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,164
She does. I told her.

145
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,248
What did she say?

146
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,382
The terrorist attack in Manila…

147
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,469
Was ISIS really behind it?

148
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,806
I don't know. We didn't catch the culprit.

149
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,559
Did the attack happen after or before
you told her about the foundation?

150
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,732
After.

151
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,489
Are you worried that Chairwoman Park
might have ordered the attack?

152
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,079
I doubt it.

153
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,332
Hand me the ledgers.

154
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,459
I can't let you have them.

155
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,910
We've arrived, ma'am.

156
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,496
Should I escort you inside?

157
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,665
It's fine. I'll be okay.

158
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,507
Director Oh is here.

159
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,322
Stop that racket
and tell me what you're here to say.

160
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,244
Why did you quit playing the harp?

161
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,787
You already know why, so why ask?

162
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,465
You said you met Junhee's father
while you were studying abroad.

163
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,508
How long have you known about us?

164
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,969
When you first showed me Junhee.

165
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,890
You're unbelievable.

166
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,224
Why didn't you say anything?

167
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,560
How did you not know
that I knew all along?

168
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,398
What are you going to do now?

169
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,318
Should I be doing something?
Shouldn't it be you?

170
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,071
-Aren't you going to divorce him?
-If I was going to do that,

171
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,365
I would've made it clear sooner
that I already knew.

172
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,994
Why won't you get a divorce?
You don't even sleep with him anymore.

173
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,204
Shut it.

174
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,455
Come on, Wansoo.

175
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,165
And you didn't even lock the doors.

176
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,751
The place was full
of reporters with cameras.

177
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,835
Did I really have to

178
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,798
endanger my marriage and reputation
because of someone like you?

179
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,260
Is that what you're upset about?

180
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,596
Because of your reputation?

181
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,099
Are you not mad
that I stole your husband from you?

182
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,769
You can't steal anything from me.

183
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,313
I've always known
what you were capable of.

184
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,941
So why did you keep pretending
not to know anything?

185
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,069
To avoid having this talk with you.

186
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,905
Had I known, we'd have talked
about this much earlier.

187
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,241
-After what happened to Chanhee--
-You shut your trap.

188
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,665
Frankly speaking,
you should be thanking me.

189
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,542
Every time Yongkook had an affair,

190
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,710
I followed him
and dealt with all those girls.

191
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,838
Who do you think
dealt with the mess he left behind?

192
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,964
What about you then?

193
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,800
-How are you different from them?
-Wansoo.

194
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,218
Go to Switzerland.

195
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm going to talk to Chairwoman Park.

196
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,640
And tell her what?

197
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,891
That's a secret.

198
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,896
You don't have a child,
so who will inherit Hwain?

199
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,064
Why would you worry about that?

200
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,607
Do you even want to have another child?

201
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,948
I'm thinking of having
another child with Yongkook.

202
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,411
-Like a surrogacy?
-What?

203
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,745
Leave and take Junhee with you.

204
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,289
There are a lot of great schools
in Switzerland.

205
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,250
You should divorce him instead.

206
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,544
I won't divorce him.

207
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,131
I met Yongkook before you did.
I met him even before you married him.

208
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,382
I know.

209
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,509
Junhee was a year older than Chanhee.

210
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,512
The only reason I treated you
nicely all these years

211
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,932
was because Junhee was a year older
and I pitied you.

212
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,937
Should I tell you…

213
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,400
a little secret?

214
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,947
-Go on.
-You might not want to hear it standing.

215
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,699
Why don't you sit down?

216
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,453
Do you know why Yongkook

217
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,288
decided to marry you?

218
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,211
What?

219
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,299
He met you while volunteering in Africa.

220
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,594
He asked for your hand in marriage
under the starry skies of Africa

221
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,346
where you two fell in love.

222
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,349
Is that what you think happened?

223
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,185
What do you mean?

224
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,273
You really must have thought
that was how it happened.

225
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,319
Just come out and say it.
What is it you're trying to say?

226
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,529
You're hurting me.

227
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,240
I was pregnant with Junhee then,

228
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,493
so I was in Japan
to get away from Chairwoman Park.

229
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,329
That's when Yongkook used to date
Ko Jinhee, the celebrity.

230
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,706
He woke up after spending
a night with her at a hotel

231
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,625
to find her dead next to him.

232
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,294
What?

233
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,462
Drugs.

234
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,172
She overdosed.

235
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,342
The successor to Hwain Group

236
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:12,346
did drugs with a celebrity in a hotel room
and the woman ended up dead.

237
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,556
Wouldn't that have caused a commotion?

238
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,266
Other than me,

239
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,230
Yongkook had a fiancée
who his family had arranged for him then.

240
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,982
The marriage fell through.

241
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,402
The woman's family had the intel,
so they found out in the end.

242
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,488
You had a great public image then.

243
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,573
You went from rags to riches.

244
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,450
You were Oh Wansoo the Angel of Charity.

245
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,787
So Yongkook hurriedly left
for Africa with all that money

246
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,414
at Chairwoman Park's order.

247
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,125
Doesn't that hurt your pride?

248
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,169
You were used.

249
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,134
And yet you're his concubine.

250
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,344
Doesn't that hurt your pride?

251
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,472
I have to put up with it

252
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,391
since I'm raising a child of his.

253
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,566
Aren't you going to divorce him?

254
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,568
I'm not.

255
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,236
You're not?

256
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,821
You can live as a concubine
for the rest of your life.

257
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,580
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

258
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,874
We should bring that kid home.

259
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,126
Are you talking about Junhee?

260
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,588
Yes.

261
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,048
Wasn't this the reason

262
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,093
why you pretended not to know
all this time?

263
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,928
But bring him where?

264
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,305
Here. To my house.

265
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,224
-As Yongkook's son.
-You can't do that.

266
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,433
Don't you talk back to me.

267
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,811
I will deal with
both Jang Taera and her child.

268
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,395
Just stay out of this.

269
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,357
This isn't your business.
This has nothing to do with you.

270
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,441
This is my business.

271
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
Honey.

272
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,125
We need to talk.

273
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,267
Am I nothing to you?

274
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,770
You knew all about Jang Taera.

275
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,481
You even knew that Junhee was my son,

276
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,109
so how could you have
pretended not to know anything?

277
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,236
Why did you marry me?

278
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,905
Because I fell in love
with you at first sight.

279
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,116
Don't you know that?

280
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,828
I want you as my wife.

281
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,330
You're mine.

282
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,833
No matter what happens,

283
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,335
I won't divorce you.

284
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,729
Have Jang Taera

285
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,399
sent away to either the US
or Switzerland along with Junhee.

286
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,650
I'll talk to Mother.

287
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,486
You don't need to do that.
You can send them away yourself.

288
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,617
You can't even do that?

289
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,412
You must think I'm incompetent as well.

290
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,625
I'm not incompetent. I'm irresponsible

291
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,544
because I never had to take responsibility
for anything my entire life.

292
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,796
That's the natural order of things.

293
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,481
Ms. Jang Taera.

294
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,775
You can't come here
without an appointment at this hour…

295
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:35,859
I said it was important.

296
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,444
I need to talk to Chairwoman Park.

297
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,489
Fine.

298
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,116
Wait in the study.
I'll tell her you're here.

299
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,020
You were the first person
who came to mind when I found this,

300
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,649
so I came straight to you
the moment I returned to Korea with it.

301
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,027
This is the Water of Life
from Switzerland.

302
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,948
It's all the rage across Europe.

303
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,202
Is that so?

304
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,956
It does seem effective.

305
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,043
I felt refreshed
the moment it entered my body.

306
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,211
I know.

307
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,298
If it was any cheaper,
I would visit you with it more often.

308
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,799
It's not even that expensive.

309
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,342
Cheap things are cheap for a reason.

310
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,095
Money never lies.

311
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,306
You're right, ma'am.

312
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,975
Two to three hundred million won
isn't a small amount of money,

313
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,769
but it sure is worth the money, isn't it?

314
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:56,982
So if you find stuff like this,
bring them straight to me.

315
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,942
Of course, ma'am.

316
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,154
Come in.

317
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,622
Ms. Jang Taera is in the study
saying she needs to speak to you.

318
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,083
Jang Taera?

319
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,461
Can you believe her?

320
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,052
That's all I needed to tell you.

321
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,429
Okay.

322
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,389
You may go.

323
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,559
You have to give me an answer.

324
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,228
Wansoo keeps threatening me.

325
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,646
I'm not going to Switzerland.

326
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,483
All right. I'll sort it out.

327
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,068
What will you do?

328
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,695
What's this?

329
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,447
Are you expecting me to report to you?

330
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,824
And stop addressing her by name!

331
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,785
You two will look too friendly.

332
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,870
Then what should I call her?

333
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,497
Should I call her sister-in-law?

334
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,332
Get out.

335
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,710
I said get out!

336
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,720
Yes, Chairwoman Park.

337
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,722
Did you get the document, Mr. Han?

338
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,769
Yes, I've received it.

339
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,104
Leave it on my desk in my room.

340
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,730
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,525
Let's sort everything out tomorrow.

342
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,110
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,252
This way.
Have them spaced out evenly.

344
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,510
Pull that chair out
to the front a little more.

345
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,974
Good. Let's leave.

346
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,771
Move that light toward the center.
That's right.

347
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,190
Yes?

348
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,946
Director Oh.

349
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,782
What about my husband?

350
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,867
Well…

351
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,035
He's in the garden.

352
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,975
Junhee.

353
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,643
Your shirt.

354
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,067
Who's that kid sitting in that chair?

355
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,070
It looks like Jang Taera's son.

356
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,323
Who's she?

357
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,742
Yongkook's old secretary.

358
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,453
The one he met in New York
and brought on as his secretary.

359
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,665
Isn't that the woman who used
to hang around Wansoo all the time?

360
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,670
This is going to be fun.

361
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,255
What do you mean?

362
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,801
We're taking the family photo, remember?

363
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,225
Oh, my gosh.

364
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,486
Hello, Wansoo.

365
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,895
Unbelievable.

366
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,147
How could she have pretended
not to know all this time?

367
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,524
She must be out of her mind.

368
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,874
I thought we were taking
a family portrait.

369
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,216
Here's the paternity test result.

370
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,969
The result is accurate.

371
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,638
What do you want from me?

372
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
Why would you take a photo like this?

373
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,561
It's been five years since Chanhee died.

374
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,813
Just as you wanted,

375
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,440
I kept it a secret to the world outside.

376
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,986
Are you trying to have that child

377
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:54,779
replace Chanhee?

378
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,991
You didn't want the world to know
how you lost your child.

379
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,868
Then they can carry on not knowing.

380
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,330
We were fine for the past five years
without making the family portrait public.

381
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,166
And how long
do you think that's going to last?

382
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,588
The child lived his entire life
with his mother's surname as Jang Junhee.

383
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,632
It's time we gave him a new surname.

384
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,761
Give him his father's surname,
or the entire group for all I care.

385
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,845
But I…

386
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,848
just can't bring myself…

387
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,852
to raise that child as my own.

388
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:30,190
Why would you care
what people think about a single photo?

389
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,776
You're still the lady of Hwain Group.

390
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,736
Or you can have another child!

391
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,407
We aren't some commoners.

392
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,620
Just what is inside that head of yours?

393
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,290
At least don't get in the way
of making your husband the new chairman.

394
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,835
You won't have another child,
you won't divorce him,

395
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,546
and you don't even care if your husband
becomes the next chairman or not.

396
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,843
Just what is it that you're scheming?

397
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,721
It doesn't matter what you say.

398
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,765
Nothing you can say

399
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,267
will turn that child into Chanhee.

400
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,480
Today is the day

401
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,982
we shoot our family portrait.

402
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,360
We'll take that photo

403
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,822
and people will be free to think
what they want when they see the photo.

404
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,281
If people see that photo,

405
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,117
they'll think the child is Chanhee.

406
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,743
That's why we're taking it.

407
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,746
How clearer do you want me
to make this for you?

408
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,751
We'll begin the shoot.

409
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,212
I'll take the photo now.

410
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,258
One, two, three.

411
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,887
Move the lights back a little.

412
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,472
Wait.

413
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,311
Smile. You have to smile.

414
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,772
We're ready.

415
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,609
We'll go again.

416
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,572
One, two, three.

417
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,629
Revision proposal of the management
and regulation of NOW Foundation's funds

418
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,431
What is it?

419
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:31,603
Nothing of note happened after
the PR team uploaded the family photo,

420
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,981
save for a reporter
visiting us in the morning.

421
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,983
About what?

422
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,862
Tell me.

423
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,533
They were tipped off
about Chanhee's skiing accident.

424
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,038
Stop them at all costs.

425
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,831
I'll give the word to our PR team.

426
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,128
I'm going to call it a day.
Call off today's meeting for me.

427
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,421
Yes, ma'am.

428
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,228
It's the room farthest
to the left.

429
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,654
We were told to move Junhee's furniture…

430
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,950
into Chanhee's room upstairs.

431
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,328
Where is the chairwoman?

432
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,080
She's out on important business.

433
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,960
I won't be answering any calls
for the time being.

434
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,971
Incoming call
Ms. Byeon

435
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,765
Seo Doyoon speaking.

436
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,060
Mr. Seo.
Hurry outside and tend to Director Oh.

437
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,864
Oh, no!

438
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,622
Hey,
watch where you're going!

439
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,379
What are you doing?

440
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,924
Get out.

441
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,509
Just drive.

442
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,179
It's dangerous to go alone.

443
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,513
But I want to be alone.

444
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,058
Pretend I'm not here.
You're here all alone.

445
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,973
Mr. Seo.

446
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,017
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,685
I don't trust people.

448
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,188
Trusting someone
is a sign of one's competence.

449
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,357
The ability to trust others,

450
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,067
and the ability to be happy…

451
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,860
They're all rare qualities.

452
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,905
Then I guess I'm still incompetent,

453
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,366
although people
don't seem to realize that.

454
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,535
You hide it well.

455
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,873
Everything you told me that day.

456
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:27,917
I don't trust a word of it.

457
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,921
I'm going to keep suspecting you.

458
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,424
Bring me evidence
if you want me to believe you.

459
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,803
Why your friend died,
who it was that killed him,

460
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,388
and what that has to do with me.

461
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,643
I'll tell you that with time.

462
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,061
And from now on…

463
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,442
just keep to your duties as my bodyguard.

464
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,239
Of course.

465
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,604
The vice-chairman seems to be here alone.

466
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,857
This is a vacation home

467
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,360
that my aunt gave us as a marriage gift.

468
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,862
It's my first time here with you.

469
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,409
I had a feeling that you'd come here.

470
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,412
What do you want?

471
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,372
So you don't want…

472
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,917
to have another child?

473
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,172
Do you have to ask me about things
Taera told you about?

474
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,716
Is it me you don't want

475
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,634
or my child?

476
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,972
Think about what you did to me.

477
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,056
Is that why…

478
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,309
you never let me touch you?

479
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,645
This topic is below us.
Let's not talk about it.

480
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,036
So I'm nothing to you.

481
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,872
I was told

482
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,084
that you only needed me
to cover up your dirty scandal.

483
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,794
That's why you hurried to marry me.

484
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,421
That's what my mother thinks.

485
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,049
I married you because I really loved you.

486
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,596
Let's have another child of our own.

487
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,140
I love you.

488
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,559
What do you think you're doing?

489
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,271
I'm your husband.

490
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,657
You said you wouldn't divorce me.

491
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,667
You're mine!

492
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,835
Let go of me!

493
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,880
Why did you pretend
to not know about my affair?

494
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,048
Why?

495
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,271
Calm down, sir.

496
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,275
Let go.

497
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,374
If Director Oh gets hurt,

498
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,001
it could end up putting everyone
in a difficult place.

499
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,962
Drive for me, Q1. Let's go.

500
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,861
Come in.

501
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,117
Good morning, ma'am.

502
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,668
You have three prior arrangements
in the afternoon.

503
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,419
We've prepared two sets of clothes,

504
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,005
and you'll be needed
at the foundation by 1:00 p.m.

505
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,090
Thank you.

506
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,725
The vice-chairman
returned to the apartment at dawn.

507
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,228
He will be
going to work from there.

508
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,724
The vice-chairman has a guest.

509
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,268
This isn't the first time.

510
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,228
Open up.

511
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,063
Hey.

512
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,023
Hey.

513
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,943
Get dressed and go home.

514
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:17,946
Who are you?

515
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,449
His second wife.

516
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,953
I said go home.

517
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,545
Hey.

518
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,386
How old are you?

519
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,514
What in the…

520
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,773
I asked you how it went.

521
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,608
I have to go to work.

522
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,570
Did you ask her? You did, right?
Did she say she won't have another child?

523
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,329
You're killing me. Answer me, will you?

524
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,508
This is Hwain IS.

525
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,308
This way.

526
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,770
This is Hwain's video security room.

527
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,980
This is where we monitor
the security of our VIPs,

528
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,524
Hwain's headquarters, and subsidiaries.

529
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,592
Did you get a good look?

530
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,760
Yes, sir.

531
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,056
Listen.

532
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,726
This is Seo Doyoon,
the head of the RF Team.

533
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,561
I'm Seo Doyoon.

534
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,068
How about a little exercise?

535
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,229
I want a rematch.

536
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,866
Come on.

537
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,576
Come at me, you punk!

538
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,228
It wasn't easy since it's been too long.

539
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,650
You're just as quick
and accurate as before.

540
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,780
You've been guarding the vice-chairman
for a while now, haven't you?

541
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,324
I'd say it's been around seven years.

542
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,743
I see.

543
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:20,999
Go take a shower.

544
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,084
Yes, sir.

545
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,920
When they took the family portrait…

546
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,463
Oh, the kid?

547
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,298
Pretend you didn't see anything.

548
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,342
They used to have a son, didn't they?

549
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,887
Officially, he's studying abroad
in Switzerland.

550
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,639
I'm sorry?

551
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,557
I'll let you in on anything
that's strictly necessary for your duty.

552
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,226
Sir.

553
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,940
The former chairman
died of a heart attack, didn't he?

554
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,650
Yes. What about it?

555
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,735
He died at the Grand Palace, right?

556
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,279
Why do you ask?

557
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,240
It's just that

558
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,743
a junior of mine from
the Police Intelligence Bureau asked me.

559
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,453
What? The police?

560
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,914
-Yes, sir?
-Who at the police?

561
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,668
A junior from the Intelligence Bureau.

562
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,046
Tell them to read the papers.

563
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,798
You can find the articles online.

564
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,092
Yes, sir.

565
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,975
Here you go, sir.

566
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,104
This is the two weeks' worth of footage
we have of P's whereabouts.

567
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,313
Thank you. I'll treat you someday.

568
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,151
But why did you need this, sir?

569
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,946
Getting acquainted with my work.

570
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,407
Will you be put in charge
of the vice-chairman from now on?

571
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,118
Don't you know that I'm in charge
of the entire Royal Family?

572
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,661
I'm looking at everyone
including Q, P, and K.

573
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,746
I see.

574
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,289
Understood, sir.

575
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,373
Keep up the good work.

576
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,104
Chairman Kim Duo CCTV

577
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,801
This isn't the Grand Palace.

578
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,555
Chairman Kim died somewhere else.

579
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,641
You said you were investigating the death
of Hwain Group's Chairman Kim Duo.

580
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,226
Was he really murdered?

581
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,311
Whatever it is,
I have to look into it first.

582
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,730
He was murdered.

583
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,233
They killed Juhyuk
while trying to cover it up.

584
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,863
Whoever did it

585
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,657
is someone at Hwain Group,
who has something to do with these people.
