1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,936
It's Hong Jin-kyung.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,638
We'll uncover everything
about Entrepreneur Hong Jin-kyung.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,906
Don't you think Bibigo is good too?

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,241
What the heck are you doing?

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,377
-We weren't talking about Bibigo.
-Hit him, Jin-kyung.

6
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,445
We'll have a session
to present new business ideas.

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,646
The business idea I prepared

8
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,547
is The Sukbak.

9
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,883
-Jin-kyung's closet will become yours.
-Hey!

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,486
All the choruses
will feature Jin-kyung's voice.

11
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,421
The gimbap will be two meters.

12
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,156
Pay 50,000 won for their transportation.

13
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,624
How am I benefiting from this?

14
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,459
"Hong Jin-kyung's The Puff Up."

15
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,229
It's shapewear that can give the breasts
volume they've never had before.

16
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,563
MALFUNCTIONING REACTIONS

17
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,765
They'll get filled up.

18
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,467
-What is this?
-What?

19
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,404
The final winner is
Hong Jin-kyung's The Kitchen.

20
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,105
WITH 14 POINTS
CHO SAE-HO, 1ST PLACE

21
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,007
Who's the person
that voted for The Sing More?

22
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,109
JANG WOO-YOUNG IS IN LAST PLACE
WITH JUST 1 VOTE

23
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,211
By the way, Producer Park,

24
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,913
-I have something to say.
-Go ahead.

25
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,049
-We're the Deconstruction Show, aren't we?
-Yes.

26
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,284
I bared myself all the way to rock bottom.

27
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,252
YOU WERE RELENTLESS WITH ME

28
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,455
Why do I feel like
Jin-kyung hasn't reached rock bottom yet?

29
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,190
Are you treating us differently?

30
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,892
-That's just how you feel.
-Yeah.

31
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,126
-It's how you feel.
-She is--

32
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,096
I bare myself to rock bottom all the time.

33
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,565
So I don't think it's necessary
to show it today as well.

34
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,667
You guys aren't really digging into her.

35
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,670
We're filming this
before the Chuseok holiday so--

36
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,872
-But it isn't late to start now.
-Right.

37
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,775
-Let's dig really into Jin-kyung.
-Okay.

38
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,411
Should we play Shouting in Silence then?

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,779
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT

40
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,548
There's no battery. Is that okay?

41
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,887
SHE IS ABOUT TO GET EXPOSED
PIECE BY PIECE

42
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,224
We're about to test all of you to see

43
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,793
whether you have the qualities
of a true entrepreneur.

44
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,864
An entrepreneur should be able
to respond quickly and wisely

45
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,399
to whatever crisis they face.

46
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,101
So the game we prepared

47
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,736
is The Very Easy Quiz show.

48
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,206
Also known as Easy Quizzy.

49
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,207
-Easy Quizzy.
-Okay.

50
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,975
-I like how it sounds.
-I see.

51
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,378
There's a segment that got
very popular on YouTube called

52
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,413
Downfall Quiz Show.

53
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,014
I've seen it on Psick University.

54
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,649
-The one on Psick University?
-That's it.

55
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:01,788
This Easy Quizzy is an homage
to Downfall Quiz Show.

56
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,823
No matter how troublesome the question is

57
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,026
you have to answer it anyway in this quiz.

58
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,027
I'm just

59
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,230
going to be straightforward.

60
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,398
-I don't worry about those things.
-Okay.

61
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,900
However,

62
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,568
-it won't be forceful.
-Of course not.

63
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,505
-If you can't pick an answer,
-Okay.

64
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,508
-we'll give you a chance to get out of it.
-There's a way out?

65
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,910
-We aren't bad people, you know.
-I knew it.

66
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,113
Somehow Sae-ho ended up keeping
the 500,000 won for the team dinner.

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,716
-Yeah.
-It's safe in my bank account.

68
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,650
Yeah, Woo-young.

69
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,951
Somehow you ended up

70
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,154
-taking on the role of treasurer.
-Yeah.

71
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,756
If the quiz participant gives up
trying to answer,

72
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,057
they must immediately send Sae-ho

73
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,560
100,000 won for the team dinner.
What do you think?

74
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,594
That's the way out.

75
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,562
Per question?

76
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,763
-Per question.
-Geez.

77
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,866
-Yes.
-The cash gets transferred immediately.

78
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,270
Since it's a quiz where you may
need to pay 100,000 won,

79
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,139
it can be called
the 100,000-won Showdown Easy Quiz Show

80
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,875
or the Easy Quizzy Pay-up show.

81
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,343
It sounds aggressive.

82
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,145
No, it's just shortened.

83
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,147
-Easy Quizzy Pay-up?
-Easy Quizzy Pay-up.

84
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,483
Since it's per person,
call it Easy Quizzy Pay-up Jerk.

85
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,185
No, we can't call it that.

86
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,120
-That's too aggressive.
-Pay up, jerk.

87
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,789
We can just slowly say Easy Quizzy Pay-up.

88
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,925
-Pay-up.
-Okay, got it.

89
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,093
All right. Here are the rules.

90
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,964
Each person will take turns
answering the questions.

91
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,135
The crew will vote to
rank your risk management skills.

92
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,904
We will see who handles crises most wisely

93
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,608
and gets over them with their words.

94
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,009
This will be hard.

95
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,779
You are all on equal footing,

96
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,181
-but since Sae-ho has been on quiz shows,
-Yes.

97
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,717
we'd like to ask you to host
The Easy Quizzy show.

98
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,519
-Will he participate too?
-Of course.

99
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,021
When Sae-ho is answering the quiz,

100
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,290
-Sook can take over.
-Okay.

101
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,160
So for Sae-ho, she'll be the one
hosting the Easy Quizzy show.

102
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,829
And he's the original host
of Easy Quizzy show.

103
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,231
From him to her.

104
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,332
Yes, I'll do it.

105
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,271
THE 100,000-WON-AT-STAKE
EASY QUIZ SHOW

106
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,441
There has never been a quiz this easy.

107
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,944
You can be on Easy Quizzy Pay-up too.

108
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,648
The Easy Quiz with 100,000 won at stake.
The Easy Quizzy.

109
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,583
The first contestant is

110
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,885
Hong Carrot. Welcome.

111
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:13,953
Hello.

112
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,522
Hello.

113
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,391
I'm Hong Jin-kyung from Pyeongchang-dong.

114
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,492
-You got this.
-Okay.

115
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,762
Hong Jin-kyung's Easy Quizzy.

116
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,332
Let's begin with the first question.

117
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,102
Show us the first question.

118
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,807
"Of the following,
when does Screwballs air every week?"

119
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,243
WHEN DOES SCREWBALLS AIR
EVERY WEEK?

120
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,144
Wait.

121
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:39,779
Hang on.

122
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,314
Gosh, this is fun.

123
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,682
SHE LEAVES THE SCREEN

124
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,083
Is she for real?

125
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,551
-She doesn't know?
-She's paying up?

126
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,919
-She doesn't know?
-Jin-kyung.

127
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,554
-You see…
-Is there any food?

128
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,525
-I'm hungry.
-As you may have felt, this is so easy.

129
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,294
-This one's really easy.
-Is she for real?

130
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,396
-That's right.
-Listen, she may have…

131
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,199
She may have gotten confused
because she can't read Korean.

132
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,467
BEGGING FOR THE ANSWER

133
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,371
What a disgrace. She needs to
pay up 200,000 won for this.

134
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,573
-It should be 200,000 won.
-It should.

135
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,208
Look at that. Pay up.

136
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,879
THEY'RE JUST TELLING HER TO PAY

137
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,215
CONTESTANT HONG JIN-KYUNG
ALREADY FACING CRISIS FROM THE START

138
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,285
If you take too much time,
we'll add 10,000 won to the 100,000 won.

139
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,320
Is that okay?

140
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:25,658
"Of the following,
when does Screwballs air every week?"

141
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,493
NO WAY

142
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,996
-Jin-kyung.
-Jin-kyung.

143
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,298
-Jin-kyung, just pay the 100,000 won.
-Number four.

144
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:36,169
She chose number four,
"Sunday at six o'clock."

145
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,006
She chose number four,
"Sunday at six o'clock."

146
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:40,907
OH…

147
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,543
"Of the following,
when does Screwballs air every week?"

148
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,610
It is

149
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,114
number three, "Sunday at five o'clock."

150
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,849
Stop lying.

151
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,351
SERIOUSLY, STOP LYING TO US

152
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,852
I watched it at six o'clock.

153
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,888
I watched it at six o'clock.

154
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,391
Are you in another time zone?

155
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,026
Yes, there's a time difference.

156
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,394
DUE TO THE TIME DIFFERENCE
IN PYEONGCHANG-DONG

157
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,464
If you would like to reshoot this scene,

158
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,532
please transfer 100,000 won.

159
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,536
If you send 100,000 won,

160
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,606
we can keep it as a memory just for us.

161
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,743
What is your choice, Jin-kyung?
One, two, three.

162
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,944
-100,000 won.
-100,000 won.

163
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,579
PLEASE FORGET THE PREVIOUS SCENE!

164
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,681
-100,000 won. Thanks.
-Great risk management.

165
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,985
"Of the following,
when does Screwballs air every week?"

166
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,086
Number three.

167
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,755
Number three? That is correct.

168
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,189
Yeah!

169
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,858
THE FAKE SCENE BOUGHT WITH 100,000 WON

170
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,793
-Air the original version.
-Okay.

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,262
Jin-kyung.

172
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,297
Number four was right.

173
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,432
You fell for it.

174
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,668
-Actually, the answer was number four.
-That's right.

175
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,871
Right? I knew I saw it at six o'clock.

176
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,173
-I saw it every week at six.
-Jin-kyung.

177
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,542
Jin-kyung, it's on Sunday at five o'clock.

178
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,377
-Yeah.
-Stop.

179
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,346
I'M STRUGGLING HERE

180
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,215
Let's move on to question number two.

181
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,683
This is hard.

182
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,320
"Of the following, which one is
Screwballs' production company?"

183
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,722
WHICH ONE IS SCREWBALLS'
PRODUCTION COMPANY?

184
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,824
IN A HIPPOCAMPUS STATE
WHERE SHE EVEN FORGOT THE TIME IT AIRS

185
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,860
CAN SHE GUESS THE PRODUCTION COMPANY?

186
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,796
Number one, Studio Twoppl.

187
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,198
-Twoppl?
-Twoppl.

188
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,801
-Twoppl. That is correct.
-Yeah.

189
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,805
Currently, the production company
of Screwballs is Studio Twoppl.

190
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,872
That was an easy one.

191
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,642
Show us the next question
that Jin-kyung must answer.

192
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,577
REVEALING THE NEXT QUESTION

193
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,845
"Of the following,

194
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:30,316
-which one is not a K-pop idol group?"
-Which one isn't?

195
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,519
-All right.
-She's going to have to pay up.

196
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,488
Unbelievable.

197
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,024
The question cannot be easier than this.

198
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,426
Number one, VERIVERY.

199
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,862
All right. You answered VERIVERY.

200
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,230
VERIVERY has a lot of fans.

201
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,033
Shouldn't you at least
act like you pondered over it?

202
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:47,934
Okay.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,237
You know, what if the fans
of VERIVERY see this?

204
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,538
They'll be very, very angry.

205
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,473
I MUST LISTEN TO THEM THIS TIME

206
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,740
Wait.

207
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,641
Hang on.

208
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,676
100,000 won.

209
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,245
-You can't do it with 100,000 won.
-200,000.

210
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,113
She's going to pass on this one
after paying up.

211
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,515
I'll pay 200,000 won to pass.

212
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,117
I'll pay 200,000 won to pass.

213
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,152
300,000 won.

214
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,420
HELP ME OUT

215
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,387
-Look.
-300,000 won.

216
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,290
If you didn't know,
you can learn about them now.

217
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,925
I would pay up for this one.

218
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,095
"Of the following,
which one is not a K-pop idol group?"

219
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,263
-Pay up.
-I agree.

220
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,664
400,000.

221
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,034
Here's the last question.

222
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,136
"Which one is not a K-pop idol group?"

223
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,638
VIVIZ, number three.

224
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,708
You said, "Number three, VIVIZ."
The answer is…

225
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,579
number four ZEROBASETWO.

226
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,014
There is a ZEROBASETWO.

227
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,816
-You mean, ZEROBASEONE.
-ZEROBASEONE.

228
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,819
First of all,

229
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,489
to VIVIZ members who may be watching this,

230
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,559
I'd like to make an apology
on behalf of Jin-kyung.

231
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,263
-And I believe ZEROBASEONE has many fans.
-Unbelievable.

232
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,364
-They have so many.
-Yes.

233
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,367
You're so famous that you have concerts
at Gocheok Sky Dome.

234
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,569
-I apologize instead of her.
-I'll pay one million won.

235
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,671
-Come on.
-I'll pay one million won.

236
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,673
-VIVIZ members.
-Let's agree on one million.

237
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,807
Let's make a deal.

238
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,743
Let me introduce the girl group VIVIZ.

239
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,112
VIVIZ is a trio from BPM Entertainment.

240
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:10,283
This group is made up of
Eunha, SinB, and Umji from GFriend.

241
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,018
They made a comeback in July of 2025

242
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,387
with their title "La La Love Me."

243
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,788
Even now,

244
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,590
they are actively working as a trio.

245
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,325
It's this one, isn't it?

246
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,393
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?

247
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,928
VIVIZ members,

248
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,162
-once again…
-Jin-kyung.

249
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,898
It sounds weirder when you do that!

250
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,367
I'd like for you to understand that

251
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,535
Jin-kyung's age

252
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,939
makes it hard for her to be familiar
with K-pop idol groups.

253
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,542
I think it's also because
the brand Bibigo is a competitor of hers.

254
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,844
I'm a bit sensitive to the similarity,

255
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,279
so I did keep my distance.

256
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,448
-Eunha, SinB, and?
-Umji.

257
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,150
Umji. That's right.

258
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,586
I'll engrave their names on my bones.

259
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,486
-Good.
-Yes.

260
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,688
Eunha, SinB, Umji.

261
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,122
I'm going to ask you in 30 minutes.

262
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,791
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU IN 30 MINUTES

263
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,694
-Come on. Why is he picking on me?
-All right.

264
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,396
Let's continue Jin-kyung's Easy Quizzy.

265
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,198
Give us the next question.

266
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,737
"Find Young K in the following pictures."

267
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,440
FIND YOUNG K IN THE FOLLOWING PICTURES

268
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,242
YOUNG K VISITED US
WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS

269
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,044
FOR SOOK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL

270
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,047
JIN-KYUNG WELCOMED HIM RIGHT NEXT TO HIM

271
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,816
She wrote, "What does Young K do?"

272
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,018
BUT SHE HAD AN UNFORTUNATE
HIPPOCAMPUS ISSUE OCCUR IN THE PAST

273
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,887
SHE'S IN BIG TROUBLE
IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW HIM NOW

274
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,888
Let me see.

275
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,958
They all look alike.

276
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,094
-Hang on.
-Take your time!

277
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,262
-This is Lee Yi-kyung.
-Hey.

278
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,364
That's Yi-kyung?

279
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,264
Be serious.

280
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,199
It isn't him?

281
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,634
-Take your time.
-Look carefully.

282
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,534
Take your time.

283
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,802
-Yi-kyung.
-She thinks it's him.

284
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,704
This one is Cho Seung-youn.

285
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,573
This one is Cho Seung-youn.

286
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,142
I'm his fan.

287
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,444
THEN WHY…

288
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,113
-Take your time.
-Then, it must be number one.

289
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,180
THEN THIS PERSON IS YOUNG K

290
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,915
Jin-kyung, what's your choice?

291
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,320
NUMBER 1 SEEMS TO BE YOUNG K…

292
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,688
BUT WHY IS THE MOOD SO COLD?

293
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,989
Which one is Young K?

294
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,658
Wait.

295
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,027
I'll give you 1.5 million.

296
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,662
I'LL GIVE YOU 1.5 MILLION

297
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,564
-We'll get to eat beef at this rate.
-"Who's Young K?"

298
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,166
We're going to eat beef.

299
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,437
Even after his concert, Young K came

300
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,205
despite being exhausted.

301
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,074
He came right after his concert

302
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,677
to shoot Screwballs with us

303
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,547
in the middle of the night.

304
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,149
I CAN'T MISTAKE HIM AGAIN

305
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,483
We're running out of time.

306
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,386
"Find Young K in the following pictures."

307
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,489
FIND YOUNG K IN THE FOLLOWING PICTURES

308
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,590
Number one.

309
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,993
She chose number one. The answer is…

310
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,862
number three.

311
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,664
This one's Young K?

312
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,433
Number three is Young K.

313
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,567
This one's Young K?

314
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,870
Number one is I.N from Stray Kids.

315
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,240
I'd like to apologize
to the Stray Kids' fans around the world.

316
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,077
-I.N even came on our show.
-He did.

317
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,278
He was on our show.

318
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,147
-Look. Let's make a deal.
-I apologize on her behalf.

319
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,717
I'll pay for a trip to Guam.

320
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,252
ATTEMPTS TO BUY OFF THE CREW

321
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,821
Do you like Guam?

322
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,689
-I love Guam.
-Do you like palm trees?

323
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,791
You like palm trees. Okay.
Do you like the sea?

324
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,093
Don't you like the sea?

325
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,662
NOT EVEN GUAM COULD COAX THEM TO EDIT IT

326
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,099
So that's Stray Kids.
Then, which group is Young K a member of?

327
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,236
Come on. You should know this one.

328
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,838
This is your chance to make up for it.

329
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,439
-Yeah.
-Make up for it.

330
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,441
PLEASE MAKE UP FOR IT

331
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,478
-Day?
-Day.

332
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,246
-Days.
-Days?

333
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,315
Day6.

334
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,616
Day6.

335
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,152
Can you please air me saying "Day6"?

336
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,488
-Day6? Okay. Can you say it confidently?
-Okay.

337
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,956
Which group is Young K a member of?

338
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,858
-Day6.
-Oh, Day6.

339
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,926
-That's right.
-Of course, I know Day6.

340
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,495
I'm sure they'll use the previous cut.

341
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,196
SORRY, WE DID

342
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,798
This makes sense only if they do that.

343
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,801
It's a bit early,
but can we go back to VIVIZ?

344
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:53,205
May I ask you for the names
of the three members of VIVIZ?

345
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,475
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.
It has only been four minutes.

346
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,044
Umji.

347
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,679
-Umji.
-SinB.

348
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,714
-SinB.
-Yes.

349
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,681
Ye-sol.

350
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,683
YE-SOL?

351
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,286
That's a nice name. You pick good names.

352
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,654
-That's a good one.
-What was it?

353
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,256
-SinB, Eunha,
-Eunha.

354
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,624
-and Umji.
-Oh, Eunha.

355
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,493
I'll make sure to remember
Eunha, SinB, and Umji.

356
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,496
Now, I am looking forward

357
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,565
to this next question with Jin-kyung.

358
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,801
-She's getting it all wrong.
-Unbelievable.

359
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,135
Hong Jin-kyung's Easy Quizzy.

360
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,870
-Show us the next question.
-It's dizzying.

361
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,072
Wow.

362
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,274
"Of the following,

363
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,409
which kimchi tastes the best?"

364
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,280
-Gosh.
-This one's too easy.

365
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,917
How can she not know this one?
It's her line of work.

366
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,618
-How do I tell just by this?
-She started

367
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,187
this business in 2005.

368
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,888
-You guys are cruel.
-In 2023,

369
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,891
the sales of her company reached

370
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,893
-Why are you doing this to me?
-310 billion won.

371
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,096
-THE KIMCHI that Koreans love.
-My gosh.

372
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,465
That delicious kimchi.

373
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,302
What will THE KIMCHI CEO
Jin-kyung's choice be?

374
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,039
-You must pick one.
-Pick one immediately.

375
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,007
-What will it be?
-Two.

376
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,243
-What will it be?
-Two.

377
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,611
-Which one?
-Number two.

378
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,046
-Looks like three.
-Two.

379
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,280
I think it's three too.

380
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,217
-You chose number two…
-Yes.

381
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,551
-Isn't it too red?
-Yes.

382
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,220
-…as your answer.
-I think it's three.

383
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,921
-Number two?
-Number two.

384
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,857
All right. Show us

385
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,859
the answer.

386
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,328
SMIRK

387
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,463
OF THE FOLLOWING,
WHICH KIMCHI TASTES THE BEST?

388
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:26,932
She got it.

389
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,601
You made up for it in this one.

390
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,170
I got a feeling by the color.

391
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,672
If a VIVIZ member says
they want to eat THE KIMCHI,

392
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,341
which member do you want to send it to?

393
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,277
-Ye-sol?
-SinB,

394
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,411
Eunha,

395
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,713
and Umji. I'll send it to all three.

396
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,114
Very good.

397
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,515
May I do this while kneeling?

398
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,651
I'll do it on my knees.

399
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,187
We can rip off 400 million from her
in 10 minutes.

400
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,890
All right. Then, let me give you
the last question.

401
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,424
-Okay.
-Show us the question.

402
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,893
REVEALING THE LAST QUESTION

403
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,830
"Of the following, who do you think
was the most popular to the opposite sex?"

404
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,931
-Most popular.
-One,

405
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,133
Lighting Director Kwon Gi-jong.

406
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,369
Two, Audio Director Lee Nam-jae.

407
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,272
Three, Fixed-camera Director Song Man-ho.

408
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,241
First of all, do you know who they are?

409
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,610
-You're dead meat.
-Wait.

410
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,045
Wait. Hang on.

411
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,246
You have a death wish?

412
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,881
-Jin-kyung, come over here.
-What?

413
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,983
-Let go of me.
-Look.

414
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,385
I quit!

415
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,654
-He's being weird.
-Bring them here.

416
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,889
He's going too far.

417
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,924
-Bring them here.
-I'm…

418
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,558
You must know at least one.

419
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,027
This is the easiest question.

420
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,728
-You must know this.
-How do you not know?

421
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:30,930
-She knows.
-She has to.

422
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,265
-I cannot…
-Gosh, this is…

423
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,800
Wow. Is she for real?

424
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,770
Do you really think I don't know?

425
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,072
We've worked together for years.

426
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,207
Okay. Then, just bring one of them.

427
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,309
All right.

428
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,112
Who do you think was the most popular?
One, Lighting Director Kwon Gi-jong.

429
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,481
-Two, Audio Director Lee Nam-jae.
-She's on her knees.

430
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,151
Three, Fixed-camera Director Song Man-ho.

431
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,953
Let me give you a hint.

432
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,355
Director Kwon Gi-jong

433
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,124
-has been on air many times.
-He's been with us pretty often.

434
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,025
Okay.

435
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,694
-Yes.
-Is she for real?

436
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,662
Director.

437
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,497
Director Kwon Gi-jong is in the back.

438
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,900
Director Kwon Gi-jong. That is correct.

439
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,768
Next up, Audio Director.

440
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,303
Where's our audio director?

441
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,705
Audio Director Lee.

442
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,139
Audio Director Lee.

443
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,207
AN UNPLANNED SEARCH PROJECT

444
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,243
Audio Director. Please raise your hand.

445
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,445
NOT FALLING FOR IT

446
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,080
Where are you? There you are.

447
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,181
Raise your hand?

448
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,683
-Audio Director Lee.
-Fixed-camera Director. Last one.

449
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,418
Director Song Man-ho.

450
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,953
SHE ONLY HAS TO FIND ONE MORE PERSON

451
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,121
Director Song Man-ho.

452
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:30,789
Go and get him.

453
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,057
Director Song Man-ho.

454
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,793
Director Song Man-ho, where are you?

455
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,195
APOLOGIZING WHOLEHEARTEDLY

456
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,629
Come on. Where is he?

457
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,998
Why are you hiding?

458
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,367
Fixed-camera, right?

459
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,402
Then, he isn't here.

460
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,970
THE WOO-JAE DETECTOR HELPS HER OUT

461
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,975
WITH THE HELP OF WOO-JAE DETECTOR
THE INVESTIGATION INTENSIFIES

462
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,513
Please tell us your name!

463
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,714
I'm Song Man-ho.

464
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,282
SHE SUCCESSFULLY GUESSED
THE FIXED-CAMERA DIRECTOR

465
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,687
Again, "Of the following, who do you think
was the most popular to the opposite sex?"

466
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,957
WHO DO YOU THINK WAS
THE MOST POPULAR TO THE OPPOSITE SEX?

467
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,325
-I think…
-Go on.

468
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,630
Director Kwon Gi-jong was the most popular

469
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,866
because he has a good sense of humor.

470
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,601
-That's right.
-So I think he was popular with girls.

471
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,370
-Then, what about the rest?
-All of them.

472
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,541
-He's really funny.
-Director Lee has a wife too.

473
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,111
And so, Jin-kyung,
there has never been a quiz this easy.

474
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,247
Easy Quizzy has ended. Thank you.

475
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,581
THE QUIZ ENDS SAFELY(?)

476
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,183
I feel dizzy.

477
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,154
The next contestant on Easy Quizzy

478
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,022
is Kim Sook. Come on up.

479
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,157
Welcome.

480
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:39,725
You got this, Sook.

481
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,561
I've lived a full life.

482
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,397
I'll answer the quiz
to the best of my ability.

483
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,133
If you're in a pickle,
all you have to do is send 100,000 won.

484
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,502
-It was hard, wasn't it?
-The easy quiz with 100,000 won at stake.

485
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,371
-Easy Quizzy Pay-up.
-Yes.

486
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,273
Here goes the first question.

487
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,274
KIM SOOK

488
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,310
"Of the following,
who would you like to kiss?"

489
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,315
"Someone who didn't brush their teeth
before leaving their house."

490
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,217
Two,

491
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,619
"Someone who doesn't flush
after number two."

492
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,122
Three, "Someone who doesn't
wash their hands after number two."

493
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,758
Who would you like to kiss?

494
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,260
Is it just kissing?

495
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,264
Well…

496
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,567
What happens after the kiss

497
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,968
is up to you.

498
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,104
She would definitely pick this one.

499
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,038
SHE'D DEFINITELY PICK NUMBER 2

500
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,806
Why?

501
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,610
Touching is involved,
so she wouldn't pick number one or three.

502
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,946
What is your choice, Sook?

503
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,380
Someone who doesn't flush.

504
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,015
I would like to kiss that person.

505
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,651
-Sook prefers someone
-Do they already know her answer?

506
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,653
-to kiss someone who doesn't flush.
-Who I prefer?

507
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,222
after number two.

508
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,523
But it isn't my preference.

509
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,493
You decided the person you'd like to kiss.

510
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,628
She loves guys
who don't flush after number two.

511
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,531
Now, all of us know your preference, Sook.

512
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,199
-This isn't my preference.
-Second…

513
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,568
-So that's your type.
-Show us the second question.

514
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,873
"Of the following, which man
is the type you'd want to marry?"

515
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,308
-Number one, two, or three.
-I like this question.

516
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,611
There are three men

517
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,880
who look very cool

518
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,716
and are dressed in a very stylish way.

519
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,717
OBSERVING CAREFULLY

520
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,285
-I pick number one.
-Gosh,

521
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,653
this guy's dressed too tight.

522
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,189
Number three is too tight.
It's like the old Woo-jae.

523
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,457
The totally tight style.

524
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,059
I'm sure many are
paying close attention to this.

525
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,930
These photos will reveal
what her style is.

526
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,100
I'll go with number one.
He's dressed stylishly.

527
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,769
I'll go with the guy
who has an Italian feel to him.

528
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,938
Let's see who they are.

529
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,673
Show us!

530
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,478
The style that you chose…

531
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,682
was Kim Young-chul.

532
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,754
THE MAN WHO KIM SOOK WANTS TO MARRY
IS KIM YOUNG-CHUL

533
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,390
There are going to be
many articles about this.

534
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,826
Gosh, I really couldn't tell who it was
when you had the faces covered.

535
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,361
-Wow.
-That is shocking.

536
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,865
If I had to choose from those three,
I would choose Young-chul.

537
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,402
Even if you revealed their faces,
I'd choose Young-chul.

538
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,538
Very good. Sook, you are doing
a very good job on this quiz.

539
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,874
Then, let's move on to the next question.

540
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,179
"Of the following,
which one is Screwballs' theme song?"

541
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,415
Number one, "Let's reboot."

542
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,350
Number two, "Now is the time to reboot."

543
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,686
Number three, "Reboot."

544
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:25,057
This theme song plays
towards the end of our show.

545
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,193
We should remember
the title of this song, right?

546
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,361
-We--
-Before that…

547
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,596
Before that,

548
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,631
-Jin-kyung--
-Stop!

549
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,167
It isn't my turn!

550
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,401
DON'T ASK ME ANYTHING

551
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,036
-Before filming today,
-I can see that.

552
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,439
-Sook had an interview
-You see…

553
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,241
with a reporter.

554
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,677
She told the reporter that Screwballs
is such a precious show to her

555
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,181
and that she is always grateful for it.

556
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,918
Now, we only have one theme song
for our show Screwballs.

557
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,621
Just one song.

558
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,222
I'll give you one last chance.

559
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,057
"Which one is Screwballs' theme song?"

560
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,560
Number three, "Reboot."

561
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,296
I think that's what it was.

562
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:05,964
The answer is…

563
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,769
number three "Reboot." You are correct.

564
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,740
I GOT IT RIGHT!

565
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,575
-She guessed it right though.
-Jin-kyung,

566
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,311
you know these things
when you love your show.

567
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,046
Of course, I knew the answer, Sook.

568
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,481
-You knew, didn't you?
-Of course.

569
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,550
-I was so nervous you wouldn't get it.
-Really?

570
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,352
-We really love this show.
-You did well, Sook.

571
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,587
-Good job.
-Right?

572
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,922
When it was Jin-kyung's turn earlier

573
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,824
during the question on when our show airs…

574
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,426
I don't know if you saw, but Sook said…

575
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:35,827
Is it number four?

576
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,397
No way. What are you saying, man?

577
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,599
But I didn't criticize you, Jin-kyung.

578
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,967
I watch it at six too.

579
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,201
I watch it at six too.

580
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,505
-I'm too busy at five.
-I don't catch it right on time.

581
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,074
Then, let me ask you a question.

582
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,143
We actually changed the time once.

583
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,110
What time was it?

584
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,413
WHAT WAS THE TIME BEFORE IT CHANGED?

585
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,381
It was…

586
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:58,850
on a weekday.

587
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,855
I don't think you know, Sae-ho.

588
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,124
-He doesn't know.
-The time has

589
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,259
-never changed.
-Never.

590
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,927
THE TIME HAS NEVER CHANGED

591
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,229
-From the beginning, Screwballs aired
-Jin-kyung.

592
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,864
-on Sunday.
-Sunday at five o'clock.

593
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,368
Every week, it aired
on Sunday at five o'clock.

594
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,804
Then, let's move on to the next question.

595
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,038
Smooth transition.

596
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:27,846
"Of the following, what is the reason for
Screwballs not achieving better results?

597
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,514
One, "Netflix's ability."

598
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,116
-Geez.
-Two, "The fans' love."

599
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,451
-What's going on?
-Three,

600
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,154
"The dedication of the production team,
who tirelessly brainstorm day and night,

601
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,623
working with everything they have
to create better ideas."

602
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,326
One, Netflix's ability.

603
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,729
Two, the Tool Box fan club's love.

604
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,930
-I can answer now.
-Three,

605
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,467
"The dedication of the production team,
who tirelessly brainstorm day and night,

606
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,769
working with everything they have
to create better ideas."

607
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,507
-I'll pay 100,000 won.
-Thank you for the 100,000 won.

608
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,211
We need more money
to eat together, don't we?

609
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,879
I can answer this question,

610
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,814
-but I think it's better
-Definitely.

611
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,450
to contribute to the team dinner.

612
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,388
All right. Show us
the next question for Sook.

613
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,423
-Another?
-Next question.

614
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,625
"Of the following, which content has…

615
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,628
the weakest…

616
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,231
artistic value?"

617
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,266
This is not so Easy Quizzy.

618
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,535
You want her to choose? Gosh.

619
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,637
-One,
-You can't do this to her.

620
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,807
"Sister's Slam Dunk."
Producer Park worked with you on this.

621
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,010
Two, "Beat Coin."
Producer Park worked with you on this too.

622
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,914
Three, "Screwballs." Producer Park
ambitiously took on this show with you.

623
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,252
If she could turn back time,
she would not go on that show.

624
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,620
That's not good enough.

625
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,888
Just call it a crappy show.

626
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,360
You know, let's eat a lot.

627
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,028
LET'S EAT A LOT

628
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,596
100,000 won more? Thank you.

629
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,964
Let's eat a lot.

630
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,668
-Currently, you are on many shows.
-Yes.

631
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,336
Which show do you like the most?

632
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,505
-Of course, it's Screwballs.
-Okay.

633
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,374
Give Sook a round of applause.

634
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,276
THANK YOU

635
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,478
Thank you. We raised 200,000 won.

636
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,246
Next up is Woo-jae.

637
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,448
OH!

638
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,252
-I want to get it over with.
-I feel dizzy.

639
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,521
There has never been a quiz this easy.
Easy Quizzy.

640
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,458
Joo Woo-jae's Easy Quizzy.
Tell us your resolution.

641
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,993
FOR NOW,
HE'S STILL RELAXED AND JOKING AROUND

642
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,628
In my case,

643
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,163
I won't look at the question.

644
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:29,000
-You ask, I answer, you ask, I answer.
-Okay.

645
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,836
-I'll answer immediately.
-Please.

646
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,838
Easy Quizzy with Woo-jae.

647
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,441
Joo Woo-jae's Easy Quizzy.
Show us the first question.

648
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:40,212
"Of the following,
which Screwballs' digital signage was not

649
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,748
displayed at Sinchon station
last September?"

650
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,384
GETTING A GLIMPSE OF
HOW MUCH HE LOVES THE FANS WITH THIS

651
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,420
He's a piece of trash if he doesn't know.

652
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:53,124
Our fan club Tool Box
pitched in to display this.

653
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,760
If he had gone to Sinchon Station,

654
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,598
-he could have seen it for himself.
-Of course.

655
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,201
-Of the digital signages
-Yeah.

656
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,238
that were filled with their love and care,

657
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,307
which was the digital signage that
they couldn't prepare?

658
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,209
-He has to get this right.
-It's so detailed.

659
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,011
-The fans are watching.
-I know this one.

660
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,646
I'm truly sorry.

661
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,883
I was planning on going anyway,

662
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,986
but I looked them up on social media.

663
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,420
I've seen them already.

664
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,155
Which one is it?

665
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,991
It's number two.

666
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,893
WOO-JAE CONFIDENTLY CHOOSES NUMBER 2

667
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,194
-Number two.
-Number two?

668
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,395
Oh, no. Poor guy.

669
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,665
"Of the following,
which Screwballs' digital signage--"

670
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,634
This one's right. I saw this one
and this one too.

671
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,002
WOO-JAE IS FEELING THE PRESSURE

672
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,937
Is it this one that I didn't see? Hang on.

673
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,007
-It's one of these two.
-The fans are watching.

674
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,775
HOW CLOSELY DID WOO-JAE
LOOK AT THE FANS' GIFT?

675
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,377
-I'll go with number two.
-Yeah.

676
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,445
All right. The answer is…

677
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,813
THE ANSWER IS?

678
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,717
-Number two.
-Come on!

679
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:53,985
Wow.

680
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,054
HE'S MAINTAINING A GOOD IMAGE LATELY

681
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,689
-He's smart.
-That was sharp.

682
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,925
I actually saw them all on social media.

683
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,594
I saw everything that you guys posted.

684
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,430
The fans shared their pictures too, right?

685
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,033
Actually, I even cried once.

686
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,167
I wiped my tears

687
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,102
and saved those images in my heart.

688
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,872
I engraved each image in my heart.

689
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,108
But of all those beautiful memories,
number two wasn't there.

690
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,044
WE GET IT, YOU'RE SO GREAT

691
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,380
-What can I do? I just knew.
-It's okay. We have more questions.

692
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,650
I'd like to thank
our fan club Tool Box once again.

693
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,218
Give us the next question.

694
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,286
REVEALING QUESTION NUMBER TWO

695
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,291
"Arrange the options below in order
from least useful to most useful."

696
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,461
One, "The monetary gift that
the new youngest writer, Kim Seung-hyun,

697
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,763
prepared for her parents
with her paycheck."

698
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,067
Two, "The props for
this shoot's game that were

699
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,935
made overnight by the production team."

700
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,937
Three, "The preview edit file
for Episode 19

701
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,774
that was carefully crafted
by Assistant Director Seo Yeon-joo."

702
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:53,345
Four, "The supportive comments that fans
leave every time a video is uploaded."

703
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,615
Arrange them in order
starting with the least useful.

704
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,951
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE ARE PRECIOUS

705
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,421
HOW WILL WOO-JAE ARRANGE THEM
IN ORDER FROM LEAST TO MOST USEFUL?

706
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,824
The most useless one is number one.

707
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,094
-How can he say that?
-That's mean.

708
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,762
He said that so confidently.

709
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,731
-To our youngest writer?
-Let me tell you why.

710
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,898
She works so hard.

711
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,967
-She's still new.
-Let me tell you my reason.

712
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,836
From her parents' perspective,

713
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,505
they cannot travel abroad comfortably

714
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,474
with their precious daughter's
first paycheck.

715
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,475
How could he?

716
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,677
-How can he say that?
-He went too far.

717
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,578
You don't get it!

718
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,779
He's a piece of trash.

719
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,081
How could you think of giving that?

720
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,117
-He's a piece of trash.
-How dare you!

721
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,251
This is his downfall.

722
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,088
For the most useless one, Woo-jae chose

723
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,525
our new youngest writer's…

724
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,626
He's acting emotional.

725
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,061
Kim Seung-hyun's

726
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,431
-monetary gift to her parents
-Why are you acting?

727
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,801
with her first paycheck.

728
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,904
It's too much. Her parents won't
feel comfortable about the trip.

729
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,675
There's no mention of that so why do you
keep saying they're going on a trip?

730
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,309
Wait. There's no trip?

731
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,478
What was I talking about then?

732
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,049
THERE IS NO TRIP?

733
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,684
I thought she booked a trip for them.

734
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,619
It isn't too late to apologize.

735
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,387
-How could you say that it's useless?
-Hey.

736
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,156
There's no time. You must choose.

737
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,657
-You can't choose two either.
-Okay.

738
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,894
I've already damaged one person
so it's too late to take it back now.

739
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,066
-It isn't too late.
-I'll just send

740
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,034
Writer Kim Seung-hyun 100,000 won.

741
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,703
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

742
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,104
Do you agree with that?

743
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,238
Give her more.

744
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,775
-You hurt her. 100,000 won isn't enough.
-This is called risk management.

745
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,812
Jin-kyung, can you name
the three members of VIVIZ?

746
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,981
Can you name the three members of VIVIZ?

747
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,917
Umji, Gumji, SinB.

748
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,752
SINB, GUMJI?, UMJI

749
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,088
-You turned that into something funny?
-You're a genius.

750
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,422
-You made that funny?
-Gosh.

751
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,391
-You're a genius.
-Who's Gumji?

752
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,259
Good one.
You won't get chewed out for that.

753
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,794
Is it a finger?

754
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,463
-You're a genius.
-You really are.

755
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,364
SHE FINALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON

756
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,667
PLEASE FORGIVE ME

757
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,802
Show us the next question.

758
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,605
OF THE FOLLOWING,
WHICH MODEL DO YOU THINK YOU SURPASSED?

759
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,776
"Of the following,
which model do you think you surpassed?"

760
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:05,744
One, "Cha Seung-won."

761
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,012
Two, "Gang Dong-won."
Three, "Kim Woo-bin."

762
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,048
1. CHA SEUNG-WON
2. GANG DONG-WON, 3. KIM WOO-BIN

763
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,516
Have confidence, Woo-jae!

764
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,551
-He's right.
-Just be straightforward.

765
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:18,923
Which model do you, Woo-jae,
think you have already surpassed?

766
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,526
I SEIZED THE OPENING
AND MADE IT ALL THE WAY UP HERE

767
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,362
-Just be confident.
-You said you'd do this speedily.

768
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,530
-Yeah.
-And be direct.

769
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,534
WHICH MODEL DOES WOO-JAE
THINK IS BENEATH HIM?

770
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,238
You're going to drink alcohol
during the team dinner, aren't you?

771
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,242
Shouldn't I contribute
about 30 bottles of soju?

772
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,143
30 bottles?

773
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,612
You can get 30 bottles with 100,000 won.

774
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:44,315
If you got people that I could
actually compare myself to, I'd try but…

775
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,583
JOO WOO-JAE
"I CAN TAKE ON OTHER MODELS"

776
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,685
-Thankfully,
-He's humble.

777
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,687
-Woo-jae offered to
-The amount keeps growing

778
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,090
-contribute 100,000 won.
-The amount is growing.

779
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,324
Show us the next question.

780
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:58,997
"If there's no life in my eyes,
this is probably the reason."

781
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,132
One, "I made enough money,
so I lack the motivation."

782
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,503
Two, "I'm worried about
my secret wife's morning sickness."

783
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,739
Three, "I plan to join a political party,

784
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,908
so I want to shed my entertainer image."

785
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,610
Four, "I'm seriously considering
leaving Screwballs."

786
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,279
-Wow.
-"If there's no life in my eyes,

787
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,747
this is probably the reason."

788
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,781
Which number is it?

789
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,552
WHY IS THERE NO LIFE IN WOO-JAE'S EYES?

790
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,954
-First of all--
-Go with number one.

791
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,522
I'll go with number four.

792
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,257
I'M SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
LEAVING SCREWBALLS

793
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,594
We spent a long time together.

794
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,363
-Tool Box even made our digital signage.
-You went too far.

795
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,199
We met a reporter just today

796
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,134
and shared how we felt

797
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,603
-about working together on Screwballs.
-About our teamwork.

798
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,971
-Yes.
-You choose number four?

799
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:40,872
Yes, number four.

800
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,707
-But…
-Is that to avoid paying up?

801
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,643
You have to remember that
if you leave our show,

802
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,414
the camera director and writer
who are assigned to you must leave too.

803
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,218
-Did he think about that?
-He discarded them like garbage.

804
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,820
-How could he pick four that quick?
-Let me be honest.

805
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,488
Live as if today is my last day.

806
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:58,623
We're all trivial to him.

807
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,292
As if it's your last
As if it's your last

808
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,228
Are you seriously going with four?

809
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,330
One of us has to end up
looking like trash, right?

810
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,332
Look. They're crying.

811
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,000
-Are they crying?
-Oh, man.

812
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,336
CRYING

813
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:12,871
You piece of trash!

814
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,007
I do this with the mindset that

815
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,877
if I let my guard down even a bit,
I could get kicked off the show.

816
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,212
Thank you very much, Woo-jae.

817
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,647
Geez.

818
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,882
Well done.

819
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,717
Whose turn is it now?

820
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,086
-Woo-young's turn.
-You're dead, man.

821
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,388
WANTING TO CRY

822
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,123
I'm going to be vicious.

823
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,093
There has never been a quiz this easy.

824
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,029
The next contestant is Jang Woo-young.

825
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,098
Give us a word of your determination.

826
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,200
-I am--
-Let's make him look like a total scumbag.

827
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,301
PFFT

828
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,004
As a reader,

829
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,173
I'd like to let you know
that I won't let myself waver

830
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,375
by any emotional turmoil.

831
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,878
I'll give you answers that are
cool, crisp, and totally rational.

832
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,413
All right. As our youngest member,

833
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,516
you love the members of Screwballs
more than anyone.

834
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,151
To our youngest Woo-young,

835
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,853
here's the first question!

836
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,621
All right. Hit me.

837
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,324
"Jang Woo-young is
currently seeing someone."

838
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,358
One, "Yes."

839
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,594
Two, "Yeah."

840
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,363
Three, "How did you know?"

841
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,836
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

842
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,305
Nice!

843
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,539
-The first one.
-Who was it?

844
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,474
-We kept it nice and neat
-Nice

845
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,043
-with only three choices.
-Okay.

846
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,778
Just relax and pick one.

847
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,279
Pick one out of those three.

848
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,747
Many people are curious about

849
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,350
-whether he's seeing someone or not.
-Yes.

850
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,652
Just relax and answer
with one of the options.

851
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,220
Which number will you choose?

852
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,455
Look at his face.

853
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,389
WHAT IS HIS ANSWER?

854
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,658
100,000 won.

855
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,027
LAUGHING

856
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:43,928
First of all,

857
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,730
let's start with…

858
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,098
Since we're all working so hard,

859
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,666
let's start with eating a delicious meal.

860
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,368
I'm going to pay up first.

861
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,104
For the first question,
he simply paid the 100,000 won

862
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,773
-for our team dinner.
-Everyone had already contributed

863
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,508
-Yes.
-so I should start off by paying.

864
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:58,676
-Yes.
-I'm not bragging.

865
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,244
-It's just for our team.
-Okay.

866
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,947
-That was very cool of you.
-I didn't even read the question.

867
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,917
-He said he didn't read it.
-I just paid up the 100,000 won for you.

868
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,452
-We will gladly
-To lighten it up.

869
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,720
-accept the 100,000 won.
-Okay.

870
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,055
-Then, show us the next question.
-Yes.

871
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,690
I'll take the next one seriously.

872
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,258
They're really vicious.

873
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,662
"What is the age range
of Jang Woo-young's girlfriend?"

874
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,998
One, "Same age."

875
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,099
Good one.

876
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,101
-Two, "Older."
-Good one!

877
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,069
Three, "Younger."

878
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,772
Whoever he's seeing,
they'd fit into one of those categories.

879
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,773
-Yeah.
-They have to.

880
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,941
That's right.

881
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,676
It isn't difficult.

882
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,277
What's the age range of his girlfriend?

883
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,912
One, "Same age." Two, "Older."

884
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,381
Three, "Younger."

885
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,616
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

886
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,451
I don't want you to think

887
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,589
that my reaction indicates
whether I really have a girlfriend or not.

888
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,858
But let me pay 100,000 won more…

889
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,960
Let me pay up first.

890
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,362
I'm a member of 2PM, right?
I think it's best

891
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,830
-if I pay in twos.
-Twice?

892
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,033
So let me pay 200,000 won up front.

893
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,568
It'll be awkward for me
to answer this question, right?

894
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,070
-Yeah.
-Some may get the wrong idea.

895
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,639
-But paying up seems awkward too.
-I know.

896
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,907
Wait, is it?

897
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,575
You scumbag.

898
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:05,943
CHUCKLE

899
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,080
-Look.
-You know what?

900
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,916
You left me with no way to get out of it.

901
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,585
From the way it's going,
Woo-young will be paying 500,000 won.

902
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:15,820
SMIRK

903
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,655
Okay. Show us Woo-young's next question.

904
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,992
You know, people really may
get the wrong idea, guys.

905
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,329
"Of the following, which TV network
would you not want to appear on?"

906
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,765
One, "SBS."

907
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,233
Two, "KBS."

908
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,968
Three, "MBC."

909
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:34,372
-How can he possibly decide?
-All three networks watch Netflix.

910
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,408
You call this boycotting, don't you?

911
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,177
This isn't just a downfall.

912
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,145
Are you actually trying to ruin my future?

913
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,281
You can wisely get out of it.

914
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,583
-It's not that you won't appear.
-Okay.

915
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,585
It's that you don't want to appear on it.

916
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,022
To be honest… I'm going to speak my mind.

917
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,424
When I think about our time on Beat Coin,

918
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,959
it breaks my heart,

919
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,894
but let me pay 100,000 won more.

920
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,597
THAT POSITIVE PSYCHO

921
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,366
I'll quickly pay it all at once.

922
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,535
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

923
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,738
PLEASE WATCH
KBS'S NEW VARIETY SHOW AS WELL

924
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,675
-Sook, can you be vicious?
-Let's do this.

925
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,377
-Oh, my gosh.
-I haven't seen the questions either.

926
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,812
-All right.
-You know,

927
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,982
-she is the most vicious.
-She's the worst.

928
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,717
There has never been a quiz this easy.

929
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,087
You may have to pay up one day as well.

930
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,188
SHE'S GOOD

931
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,590
100,000 won is at stake!

932
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,493
The easy quiz show. Easy Quizzy.

933
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,129
Welcome, contestant Cho Sae-ho.

934
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,730
CHO SAE-HO

935
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,366
Why don't you tell us
your determination for this quiz?

936
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,302
I have always felt proud

937
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,638
-of being a member of Screwballs,
-Yes.

938
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,273
so I'll answer them with modesty.

939
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,243
Cho Sae-ho's Easy Quizzy.
Here's the first question.

940
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,878
CHO SAE-HO

941
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,882
"Of the following, who is not
one of the executives of Netflix?

942
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,850
One, "Spencer Wang."

943
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,153
Two, "Elizabeth Stone."

944
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,021
-Three, "Kim Min-young."
-How would I know?

945
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,089
Four, "Milo Lee."

946
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,258
-You should know this.
-How am I supposed to know?

947
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,993
-You know,
-Gosh.

948
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,661
-you work with them,
-You should know.

949
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,562
so you should know.

950
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,398
Sae-ho, you're running out of time.

951
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:08,666
I HAVE TO KNOW THIS?

952
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,902
-You know, in life,
-This is crazy.

953
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,304
we should know the executives
of a TV network, right?

954
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,274
They love Screwballs so much
that they always watch it.

955
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,742
-I hope so.
-Number two!

956
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,676
Two?

957
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,578
-Elizabeth Stone.
-Elizabeth Stone.

958
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,479
For real?

959
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,847
Okay. Elizabeth Stone.

960
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,348
-You're unbelievable.
-Okay.

961
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,051
-You should have paid up.
-You chose number two.

962
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,820
Elizabeth Stone.

963
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,291
That's incorrect.

964
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,627
-You should have just paid up.
-She must be so offended.

965
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,895
That's wrong?

966
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,830
Ms. Elizabeth Stone is an executive?

967
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,500
Ms. Elizabeth Stone is… Gosh.

968
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,902
Everyone knows Ms. Stone.

969
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,437
The answer?

970
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,306
Elizabeth Stone

971
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,209
is the chief technology officer.

972
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,410
SHE HAPPENS TO BE THE CTO!

973
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,645
-And lastly, the other executive is
-But…

974
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,347
Ms. Kim Min-young.

975
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,916
I really like Min-young too.

976
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,851
How could you not know her?

977
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,187
-He's unbelievable.
-When did you meet Milo Lee?

978
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,690
-Gosh.
-When did you meet Milo Lee?

979
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,391
Doesn't he look like a Milo Lee?

980
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,027
Right?

981
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,164
-Doesn't he look like a Milo Lee?
-You're right.

982
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,499
If she is the CTO,

983
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,902
what can happen to Sae-ho?

984
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,203
He can disappear from this.

985
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,205
How can he disappear?

986
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,674
-They could blur him out.
-Blur him out?

987
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,545
Ms. Elizabeth Stone,
I'm so sorry, but I love you.

988
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,913
I should have just paid up.

989
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,582
-Next question.
-His head might get cut off.

990
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,184
You got the next question.

991
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,418
-Yes.
-We can only hear him.

992
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,853
-Hang in there.
-He has no head.

993
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,588
Give us the next question.

994
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,656
Wow.

995
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,124
-"Of the following,
-You don't know?

996
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,426
which one isn't a writer on Screwballs?"

997
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,029
-You don't know this?
-One, "Nam Da-yoon."

998
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,530
Two, "Jeong Da-yeon"

999
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,432
-Gosh.
-Three, "Goh Eun-byeol"

1000
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,434
THEY SPENT ABOUT 7,296 HOURS TOGETHER

1001
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:55,239
COUNTLESS TEAM DINNERS

1002
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,908
THIS ONE IS PRACTICALLY A GIVEAWAY

1003
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,445
-Gosh.
-Would you like me to be funny or serious?

1004
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,214
-Serious.
-Yeah, the serious one.

1005
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,415
If you want serious,

1006
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,150
I'll pay 100,000 won.

1007
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,518
DO YOU REALLY NOT KNOW?

1008
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,254
-I really don't know.
-Hey, Milo Lee!

1009
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,622
Hey, Milo Lee!

1010
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,024
I know who it is in my heart,

1011
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,793
but I don't want to guess it
and deprive you of the 100,000 won.

1012
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,995
-Let me just treat you all!
-100,000 won!

1013
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,330
Give him a round of applause.

1014
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,332
Is there a writer you remember?

1015
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,300
Please stop.

1016
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,536
-My head still hurts from Elizabeth.
-Okay.

1017
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,371
Show us the answer.

1018
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,374
It's number one, Writer Nam Da-yoon.

1019
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,943
Right. There is no writer
called Nam Da-yoon here.

1020
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,911
UNBELIEVABLE

1021
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,579
She doesn't exist.

1022
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,580
Let's move on.

1023
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,350
Here's the next question.

1024
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,586
"Of the following, which person
would you not need in your life?"

1025
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,623
-One, "Wife."
-Good one.

1026
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,758
-Yeah, good job.
-Two, "Yu Jae-seok."

1027
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,759
-Good.
-Nice.

1028
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,461
-Three, "G-Dragon."
-Good job.

1029
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,929
This feels great.

1030
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,899
Someone you can
totally live without in your life.

1031
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,834
Would you like me to be funny or serious?

1032
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,604
-Do you want me to be funny?
-Stop asking us.

1033
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,806
Be funny.

1034
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,374
-Be funny?
-Yes, be funny.

1035
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,943
I'll be funny by paying 100,000 won.

1036
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,612
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

1037
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,049
Since Da-yeon and Eun-byeol work so hard,

1038
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,584
how could I pay so little?

1039
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,486
I'll gladly pay 100,000 won more

1040
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,489
so we can have
a wonderfully lavish team dinner.

1041
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,325
Why do you keep paying 100,000 won?

1042
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,293
-Yeah.
-What?

1043
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,994
Just be cool and give us an answer.

1044
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,963
You can rank them, can't you?

1045
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,997
My wife comes first.

1046
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,165
-Your wife is first.
-Yes.

1047
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,100
-Okay.
-She's first.

1048
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,868
-Who's next?
-They're both in second place.

1049
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,037
-For real?
-Then, what if

1050
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,905
Jin-kyung is added to the mix?

1051
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,110
I'll pay 100,000 won more.

1052
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,579
LAUGHING

1053
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,215
IS THAT OKAY?

1054
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,351
-You'd better pay.
-We're accumulating a lot of money.

1055
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,553
Let's move on to the next question.

1056
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,723
My questions are different than yours.

1057
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,394
"Of the following,
what is the least valuable?"

1058
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,664
"The first letter Woo-jae's niece
wrote him after learning Korean."

1059
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,166
Oh, Ah-rin.

1060
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,367
After learning Korean?

1061
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:08,038
Two, "The energizing herbal medicine
that Sae-ho's wife got for Sae-ho."

1062
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:08,939
-Oh, my.
-Three,

1063
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,875
"The first birthday seaweed soup

1064
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,444
-that La-el made for her mom."
-La-el made it?

1065
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,712
-This is
-Four,

1066
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,547
-too touchy.
-"The coffee truck that

1067
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,417
HOTTEST prepared for Woo-young."

1068
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,951
This one's precious too.

1069
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,154
-Five,
-Why are there so many?

1070
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,190
"The congratulatory message for
Sook's 30th year of debuting

1071
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,125
and birthday message her dad left her."

1072
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,660
-The least valuable?
-The cheapest.

1073
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:30,694
There's another one.

1074
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,997
What the heck? There's a sixth one?

1075
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,698
Why are there so many for him?

1076
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,535
"The Sinchon Station digital signage

1077
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,971
that Tool Box pooled
their pocket money to put up."

1078
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,742
Which one does Sae-ho think
is the most cheapskatey?

1079
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,811
WHICH ONE IS THE MOST CHEAPSKATEY?

1080
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,112
The shabbiest.

1081
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,747
THEY'RE ALL PRECIOUS THOUGH

1082
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,215
You see,

1083
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,784
since it's talking about
the least valuable thing,

1084
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,153
maybe we can think about the cost.

1085
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,788
Think however way you want.

1086
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,023
Yeah, choose whichever one.

1087
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,925
-The one that's least valuable.
-The cost?

1088
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,061
-Do you want what's funny or touching?
-Do what you want.

1089
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,530
-Come on, Milo Lee.
-Touching.

1090
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,431
Touching.

1091
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,167
Let me touchingly pay 100,000 won.

1092
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,736
How touching.

1093
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,905
Hang on. We accumulated
too much for our team dinner.

1094
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,774
-How could I choose?
-Where should we go?

1095
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,542
-How?
-We can really eat beef.

1096
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,611
I think we have too much money now.

1097
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,146
-Sae-ho.
-Milo Lee.

1098
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,347
Here's the last question.

1099
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,882
-Please pick one this time.
-Milo Lee.

1100
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,116
Okay, I'll try.

1101
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,017
You didn't pick any.

1102
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,919
I'll definitely try
to choose one this time.

1103
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,120
Okay. Next question.

1104
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:34,191
"Of the following,
who is most often spotted taking a break?"

1105
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,328
One, "Kim Sook's manager, Goh Ji-hoon."

1106
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,830
Two, "Joo Woo-jae's manager,
Jeon Sang-hyeop."

1107
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,233
Three, "Hong Jin-kyung's manager,
Park In-seon."

1108
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,236
-It means that the manager is lazy.
-Yes.

1109
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,172
Just pick the one you think
has the easiest job ever.

1110
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,307
-Just…
-They have it so easy.

1111
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,977
Just pick someone
who has a super easy job.

1112
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,411
A lazy bum.

1113
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:58,182
"That's too much. How are they a manager?"
Someone like that.

1114
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:02,887
Five. Four. Three. Two.

1115
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,955
One. Please choose.

1116
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,691
-The truth is…
-Be funny,

1117
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,627
This person may deny it,

1118
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,196
but I have seen this person
asleep in the car.

1119
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,597
What? He's building it up.

1120
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,598
-Who is it?
-Yeah?

1121
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,433
-You're doing it?
-You're doing it?

1122
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,002
-Do it, Milo Lee.
-You see…

1123
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,203
-Just do it.
-Wait.

1124
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:23,574
I saw someone sleeping during break time.

1125
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,242
You're going to expose them?

1126
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,343
Who is it?

1127
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,079
WHO IS THE PERSON THAT SLEPT IN THE CAR?

1128
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,881
I won't reveal their name.

1129
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,683
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

1130
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,452
I won't reveal their name.

1131
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,687
Then, what's your choice?

1132
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,689
I will pay 100,000 won.

1133
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,491
BOO

1134
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,159
-Come on.
-How am I supposed to choose

1135
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,295
when I saw Ji-hoon sleeping!

1136
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,797
…when I saw Ji-hoon sleeping!

1137
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:48,666
What?

1138
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,567
My manager?

1139
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,801
No, what I meant was…

1140
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,102
He's taking care of an infant.

1141
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,805
-You fell asleep that one time. Gosh.
-He's busy raising a child.

1142
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,974
Okay! He doesn't have to pay 100,000 won.

1143
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:57,975
We won't accept it.

1144
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,878
-No, wait.
-Kim Sook's manager, Goh Ji-hoon.

1145
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,315
-He was asleep in the car one time. Oops.
-Gosh.

1146
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,484
-He happened to doze off briefly.
-How could you?

1147
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:08,752
Sook's manager, Mr. Goh.

1148
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,121
I saw you sleeping.
Didn't you sleep in the car once?

1149
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,357
What's wrong with sleeping?

1150
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,391
He's caring for a baby.

1151
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,393
-It's exhausting.
-So that's why you fell asleep.

1152
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,362
-So that's why.
-The baby just turned one.

1153
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,664
And he takes care of
one of the biggest celebrities

1154
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,866
-in the entertainment world.
-For 10 years,

1155
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,568
-Ji-hoon took care of me.
-He doze off.

1156
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,003
That's why you fell asleep.

1157
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,638
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

1158
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:28,739
-So that's why.
-Gosh.

1159
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,841
He went too far. How could he choose him?

1160
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,042
Goodbye, man.

1161
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,211
You went too far, man.

1162
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,913
All right. Thank you.

1163
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,050
THANK YOU

1164
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,952
Gosh, that was so funny.

1165
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,053
It was so funny.

1166
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,522
-That was insane.
-Pardon me,

1167
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,225
but for whose benefit are we doing this?

1168
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,727
We're only left with scars.

1169
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,462
Mine was the worst, wasn't it?

1170
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,696
Mine was the worst.

1171
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,764
Ji-hoon,

1172
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,399
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, man.

1173
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,567
I'm sorry. It's just comedy.

1174
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,003
-I actually chose an answer.
-Thank you, Ji-hoon.

1175
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,005
None of them chose an answer, so I did.

1176
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,640
But no one chose besides me.

1177
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,074
Well done.

1178
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,343
Actually, we prepared this
rather mischievously.

1179
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,780
-It was kind of like torture.
-It was so funny though.

1180
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,482
It was so fun.

1181
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:15,019
-Easy Quizzy was so fun.
-You guys must have worked hard on this.

1182
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,855
I get that you worked hard on this,
but to be honest,

1183
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,658
I think you guys had
so much fun while you came up with this.

1184
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,894
I can just see you giggling
as you came up with it.

1185
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,462
Were you watching us?

1186
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:26,764
-I can only imagine.
-So funny.

1187
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,799
Let me announce the result. Gosh.

1188
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,834
It is a rather surprising result.

1189
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:34,071
The first place is leading
by a lot more than we expected.

1190
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,372
Who is it?

1191
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,542
A total of 23 people
participated in the vote.

1192
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,644
Third place is Sae-ho who got three votes.

1193
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,745
Thank you.

1194
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,347
-Milo Lee?
-Yes, Milo Lee.

1195
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,448
-Milo Lee.
-Yes.

1196
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,983
-Milo Lee got three votes?
-Yes.

1197
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,152
-He got three votes.
-Shouldn't he be blurred out now?

1198
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:49,186
You're right.

1199
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,555
Fourth place is Kim Sook with two votes.

1200
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:52,856
Okay.

1201
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,391
Sook is fourth place?

1202
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,726
Wait. Then,

1203
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,994
-am I in last place?
-But I

1204
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,962
answered soundly and swiftly.

1205
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,864
And I'm a K-pop idol too.

1206
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,332
This person got one vote.

1207
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,001
Congratulations, Woo-young.

1208
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,069
5TH PLACE JANG WOO-YOUNG

1209
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,336
Who is it?

1210
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,506
-What's going on?

1211
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,308

1217
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,653
Congratulations, Jin-kyung.

1218
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,688
1ST PLACE HONG JIN-KYUNG

1219
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,223
Guam worked.

1220
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,025
-Wait. Come on.
-Guam worked.

1221
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,593
Aren't you looking for some skills?

1222
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,395
-She just used her money.
-He's right.

1223
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,130
-She used money.
-I was surprised too.

1224
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,232
-What the heck?
-She just used money to resolve it.

1225
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,701
-You just want us to pay for the dinner.
-He's right.

1226
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,503
Look, I didn't use money to resolve it.

1227
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,138
I resolved it with my knees.

1228
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,206
Yeah, her knees.

1229
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,108
-I used my knees.
-Am I second place then?

1230
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,976
-Woo-jae is second place
-I'm happy with it.

1231
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:47,711
with four points.

1232
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,748
Okay. Let me tell you the final score.

1233
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,282
Congrats, you won joint first place,

1235
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,385
Thank you.

1236
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,088
I love that you're here with me.

1237
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,723
But there's a gap between us.

1238
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,158
What do we get?

1239
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,694
-We told you that there's a huge prize.
-The huge prize.

1240
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,363
Give the prize to the joint winners.

1241
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,465
-It must be food.
-What?

1242
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,669
From the global food company
THE KIMCHI and THE MANDOO.

1243
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,271
-Yes.
-THE KIMCHI.

1244
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,240
-We prepared these as the prize.
-I love them.

1245
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,975
I'm going to eat them right away.

1246
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,743
I want to take some too.

1247
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,914
Since it's Chuseok, we'll share it.

1248
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:24,982
-Will you?
-Yes.

1249
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:25,983
THE DAY OF FILMING WAS CHUSEOK

1250
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,485
-Can I have some green onion kimchi?
-Take it.

1251
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,287
-Gatkimchi for me.
-I want green onion kimchi.

1252
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,855
I just want the cut kimchi.

1253
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,490
How touching. It feels like Chuseok.

1254
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,858
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1255
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,494
-Thanks.
-That's the end of our shoot. Good work.

1256
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,329
-Good work.
-Good work.

1257
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,767
On the next episode of Screwballs.

1258
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,670
THE ORIGINAL BEAST-LIKE IDOL

1259
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,176
Our show is uploaded at five o'clock,
so we'll call it 5PM.

1260
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,911
I was such a huge fan of 2PM.

1261
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,445
It feels like my dream came true.

1262
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,515
I want to become a member of 2PM!

1263
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,117
JYP's pride and joy, the organic menus.

1264
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,251
There's no MSG.

1265
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,186
HEALTHY DIET

1266
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,021
-Avoid the paparazzi.
-It's so good.

1267
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,990
AVOID THE PAPARAZZI'S PHOTOS

1268
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,427
PASSIONATELY DANCING FOR FANS
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE

1269
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,062
HOWEVER

1270
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,764
-What do we do?
-It's too hard.

1271
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,865
It's too hard.

1272
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,401
Get some Coke Zero from the first floor.

1273
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,102
-Woo-jae.
-I'm talking here.

1274
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,137
Don't cover your eyes.

1275
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,538
You are so rude.

1276
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,207
I will be back

1277
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,808
CONTROVERSY OVER THEIR LIVE SINGING

1278
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:26,643
CONTROVERSY OVER THEIR DANCING

1279
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,478
-You have to take the lead.
-I'm so annoyed.

1280
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:29,913
LISTEN TO THE LEADER!

1281
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,349
If you break up the beat,
you can add all of it.

1282
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,451
How can you call yourself a leader?

1283
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,853
Can't you just let me stay as 2PM?

1284
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,322
There's an error with 5PM.

1285
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,724

I hate you so much!

1289
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,496
CAN WOO-YOUNG TURN 5PM
INTO AN IDOL GROUP?

1290
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:51,435
