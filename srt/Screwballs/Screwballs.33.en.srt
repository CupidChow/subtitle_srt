1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on Screwballs.

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,437
GOD OF TALK

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,139
We are going to take the time

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,675
to find out who is the God of Talk
by doing a thorough examination.

5
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,944
ROUND 1 - THE GOD OF TALK
THAT THE STAFF CHOSE

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,412
Congratulations, Mr. Cho Sae-ho.

7
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,613
CHO SAE-HO IN 1ST PLACE

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,782
ROUND 2 - THE GOD OF TALK
THE ENTERTAINERS CHOSE

9
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,917
Engineering College, Hongik University.
Are you so great?

10
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,453
I have 1.32 million subscribers.
You think you're so great?

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,756
Fine, I only have 120,000.

12
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,591
Mr. Cho Sae-ho,

13
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,059
is your wife your first love?

14
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,528
Answer the question.
Is she your first love?

15
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,429
She's my last love.

16
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,897
Can you guarantee that?

17
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,666
The God of Talk that
the entertainers chose is

18
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,934
Ms. Kim Sook. Congratulations.

19
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,371
KIM SOOK CAME IN 1ST

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,873
HIGH-CLASS CELEBRITY CLUB

21
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,742
ROUND 3 - WHO IS THE GOD OF TALK
THE VIEWERS CHOSE?

22
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,311
The last round of God of Talk

23
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,180
is "Giving counsel to the viewers."

24
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,249
Giving counsel.

25
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,217
Speaking well is important,

26
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:55,055
but you must listen to others well
and truly empathize when giving counsel.

27
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,323
Then, you could truly be called
the God of Talk.

28
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,195
So we received requests
for counseling from viewers beforehand.

29
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:05,065
There were so many people
that sent in their stories.

30
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,534
We would love to
be able to hear all of their stories,

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,537
but since we have a limited time,
we chose six people.

32
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,138
After it's over,

33
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:16,276
the viewers will choose the member
who they think was the most helpful.

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,412
The person who received the most votes
will win first place.

35
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,049
So the viewers will choose the God of Talk

36
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,118
-in the last round.
-This is the most important one.

37
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,621
All right, let's go ahead
and hear the first story.

38
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,290
Can you put up the keyword first?

39
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,158
I LIKE SOMEONE
WHO IS 24 YEARS OLDER

40
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,227
-24 years older?
-24 years older…

41
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,296
OH…

42
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,197
24 years apart.

43
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,833
So they are 24 years apart, right?

44
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,068
Does she like much older men?

45
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,605
ALREADY ROUGH
FROM THE FIRST STORY

46
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,207
SERIOUS

47
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,708
Even if she's 20,

48
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,076
wouldn't he be 44 years old?

49
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,079
Let's hear her out first.

50
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,814
Hello.

51
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,916
Hello.

52
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,586
Can you briefly introduce yourself?

53
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,788
I live in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul.

54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,757
I'm in my third year of middle school.
My name is Kang Ji-yoon.

55
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,126
Third year of middle school?

56
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,261
Yes.

57
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,264
From the keyword we got,

58
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,134
I don't think someone your age
should send something like this.

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,002
If he is 24 years older,

60
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,270
could it be

61
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,172
-your teacher?
-You shouldn't feel that way.

62
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,376
What I'm worried about is that
a lot of friends of mine

63
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,378
are fangirling over idol groups.

64
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,647
-Yes.
-But I'm the only one who likes

65
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:31,217
Woo-jae, who is much older than me.

66
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,355
MAN, UNBELIEVABLE

67
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,256
Yes.

68
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,992
-I fangirl over him.
-He's going to get cocky about this now.

69
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,460
I can't stand him.

70
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,363
What do you like so much
about our Woo-jae?

71
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,032
DON'T MAKE THAT FACE

72
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,668
First of all, he is very tall.

73
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,636
GROSS

74
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,571
He's very smart too.

75
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,672
DOUBTFUL

76
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,008
He is quite witty too.

77
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,445
-He is charming and perfect to me.
-He's 24 years older?

78
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,680
What are you doing?

79
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,482
-What was your name?
-What's he doing?

80
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,651
My name is Kang Ji-yoon.

81
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,219
Ji-yoon.

82
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,787
-Yes?
-Ji-yoon.

83
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,755
-Yes?
-Look at him.

84
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,023
It's me, Woo-jae.

85
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,458
It's me, Woo-jae.

86
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,128
HE MUST'VE LOST HIS MIND

87
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,563
EVEN WITH A LINE LIKE THAT

88
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,764
I'm so nervous.

89
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,765
Are you very nervous?

90
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,233
Hearing his voice gets you nervous.

91
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,669
What made you like him so much?

92
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:26,239
On my YouTube algorithm, I came across

93
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,175
a footage of him playing a drinking game

94
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,045
-with other members of the show.
-Yes.

95
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,747
The Woo-jae I saw then

96
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,685
was different from
the Woo-jae I knew as a model.

97
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,956
That different side of him
made me fall for him.

98
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,625
To summarize, you went crazy
about my unexpected charms.

99
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,828
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

100
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,565
I get that you went crazy for me
after seeing that.

101
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,600
-He gets it?
-He gets it?

102
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,636
She didn't say
she's crazy about you, Woo-jae.

103
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,704
Are you crazy?

104
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,172
-She didn't say that.
-You're crazy.

105
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,940
Then, let me ask you one thing.

106
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,208
How did your friends react?

107
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,044
What my concern is,

108
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,580
whenever I speak
with my friends about fangirling,

109
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,482
they keep nagging me about why I like

110
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,684
an old guy like him.

111
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,054
AN OLD GUY LIKE HIM

112
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,222
I totally get it.

113
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,958
-Your friends are thinking clearly.
-I totally get it.

114
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,061
-I completely understand.
-Then, what do you tell your friends

115
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,730
when they say that to you?

116
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,633
The Woo-jae that I like is kind of old

117
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,334
and has a lot of life experiences,

118
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,104
so compared to the guys you like,

119
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:36,042
he can help me
with my resolutions and studies.

120
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:36,943
She's so nervous.

121
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,078
-Things like that.
-She's so nervous.

122
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,715
He's an awesome person
who can share his experience with me.

123
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,350
That's how I refute them.

124
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,653
Gosh, thank you so much.

125
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,855
From what we heard,

126
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:49,989
you even made Woo-jae merch?

127
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,057
-What?
-Wow!

128
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,360
-You see, I like making stuff.
-You're a student. You have no money.

129
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,929
THE MERCH SHE MADE HERSELF

130
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,832
-Wow.
-For real?

131
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,234
Is it really this?

132
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,635
Wow!

133
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,536
What is it?

134
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,937
You must be so thankful.

135
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,807
Wow! For real?

136
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,243
-Is it a T-shirt?
-Isn't this a jersey?

137
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,647
Yes, I put your name
on the back of the shirt.

138
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,716
I'll wear this right now.

139
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,319
-How touching.
-Really?

140
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,787
EXCHANGING TOUCHING MOMENTS

141
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,954
Who is…

142
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,457
Isn't it yours, Ji-yoon?

143
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,591
It's small.

144
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,294
It kind of fits.

145
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,362
CHUCKLE

146
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,563
DID SHE EVEN GET THE SIZE RIGHT?

147
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,732
-Gosh.
-It's funny that it fits.

148
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,934
She even printed out all the photos.

149
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,272
I printed them out
so that I can keep them.

150
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,506
-To keep them?
-Gosh, this is…

151
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,308
-But it is…
-Let's see them.

152
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,978
A MUST-HAVE FOR FANGIRLING,
PHOTOCARDS AND ID PICTURES

153
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,950
HER WORLD IS FILLED WITH WOO-JAE

154
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,953
-Wow.
-Look, the fact that you really like me

155
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,822
and even sent a story…

156
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,824
-The fact that you did that…
-I know.

157
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,094
Actually, I don't have that many fans

158
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,564
-who make stuff like this for me.
-How thankful you are.

159
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,700
So I can't joke about this.

160
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,402
I joked about it earlier,

161
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,838
but I'm just so thankful.

162
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,141
FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT,

163
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,177
WOO-JAE COULDN'T TAKE
HIS EYES OFF OF THOSE THINGS

164
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,879
-Ji-yoon.
-Yes.

165
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,117
Pardon me,
but may I ask how old your mother is?

166
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,552
She was born in 1980.

167
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,621
She's like an older sister to me.

168
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,091
-1980?
-Does your mother understand?

169
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,394
No, my mom doesn't seem to

170
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,964
understand why I like
someone who's so frail.

171
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,566
Come on. I thought you were his fan!

172
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,935
But you keep saying
hurtful things about him!

173
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,772
No, that's not what I meant.

174
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,974
-I thought I should be honest.
-These days,

175
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,842
people speak their minds.

176
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,945
YOUR MOTHER JUDGED HIM CORRECTLY

177
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:57,517
Who were you a fan of
before you liked Woo-jae?

178
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,551
Who did you like?

179
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,721
Well, I liked Monsta X.

180
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,589
Oh, Monsta X.

181
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,858
WOW

182
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,859
From Monsta X to him?

183
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,995
-How--
-She's consistent.

184
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,296
HER TYPE CHANGED DRASTICALLY

185
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,865
The Monsta X guys and I are…

186
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,100
-Are what?
-What?

187
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,168
-Just…
-Nothing similar.

188
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,804
You couldn't tell us apart
if you mixed us up.

189
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,305
Aren't you just X?

190
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,607
-Not Monsta X.
-Then,

191
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,743
let's say

192
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,480
-you met Woo-jae on the street.
-Okay.

193
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,416
What is the first thing
you'd like to do with him?

194
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,919
WHAT IF SHE MET WOO-JAE
ON THE STREET?

195
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,254
-Well…
-He's alone too.

196
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,823
-But…
-You ran into him.

197
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,057
-Oh, he's by himself?
-Yes.

198
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,793
Then, without being a nuisance,

199
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,564
I'd ask him to take a photo with me.

200
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,465
How kind of her.

201
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,999
-Would that be enough?
-Just a photo?

202
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,236
-Oh.
-Do you need some allowance?

203
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,439
-Look.
-Yeah, she needs some allowance.

204
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,641
-She has to buy books.
-Look, your story is about

205
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,377
liking a much older guy.

206
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,412
-Right.
-Then,

207
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,648
if he could send you a gift,
what would you like to get?

208
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:08,020
Well, the only thing that
I can think of right now

209
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,990
is that I would happily keep

210
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,627
anything Woo-jae gives me
for the rest of my life.

211
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,462
OH, MY GOODNESS

212
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,031
Just by hearing your voice,

213
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,033
I can tell you're smiling from ear to ear.

214
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,502
HER JOY CAN BE FELT IN HER VOICE

215
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,971
-Ji-yoon,
-Yes?

216
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,606
I'll send this through our staff.

217
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,642
There's this bag that I designed.

218
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,412
I've kept two or three of those
because I value them.

219
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,714
-Wow.
-Really?

220
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,916
-Along with--
-His unwashed towel.

221
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,251
WH-WHAT?

222
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,185
An unwashed towel.

223
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,186
PLEASE, JIN-KYUNG

224
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,087
What?

225
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,656
TO EVERYBODY
WE ARE SORRY

226
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,590
What about this?

227
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,126
What about this? I just thought of it.

228
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,028
What grade are you in, Ji-yoon?

229
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,296
Third year of middle school.

230
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,098
Then, why don't you

231
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,368
support her financially
from high school to college?

232
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,003
WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT HER
THROUGH COLLEGE?

233
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,406
THE BEST FAN SERVICE

234
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,307
That's the best.

235
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,442
He's 24 years older.
What do you think, Ji-yoon?

236
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:07,780
-I think your mother would love him.
-Of course.

237
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,184
Even my indifferent mom
would end up loving Woo-jae.

238
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:16,022
But your love is enough for me, Ji-yoon.

239
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,392
Seriously though, I'll gather a few things

240
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,227
and pass it on through the staff.

241
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,430
I'll send a bag for you
so that you can use it

242
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,065
-at your new high school.
-Nice.

243
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,800
I'll also send other various items.

244
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,436
Thank you so much, Ji-yoon.

245
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,939
The honor is all mine.

246
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,408
-She speaks so sweetly.
-Lastly, Ji-yoon…

247
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,444
-Yes?
-…can you give Woo-jae

248
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,780
-some encouraging words to cheer him on?
-Yes.

249
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,017
I don't know how encouraging

250
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,820
one person's words can be for you.

251
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,221
-So much.
-I hope…

252
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,725
I hope you can

253
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,395
stay active and healthy in various fields.

254
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,599
Listen carefully, Ji-yoon.

255
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,236
Up until yesterday and the day before,

256
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,638
-I have been…
-Yes.

257
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,607
…doing repetitive things

258
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:11,777
-on television lately.
-Yes.

259
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,913
But recently…

260
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,483
I've been wondering

261
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,320
if the viewers were tired of me
or didn't think I was funny.

262
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,757
I don't often feel insecure,

263
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,027
-but I kind of felt that way lately.
-Lately?

264
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,496
But thanks to your call, Ji-yoon,

265
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,598
I've gone to the moon.

266
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,867
I've gone to the moon.

267
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,039
I've recovered from everything.

268
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,110
TO A CELEBRITY,
A FAN'S LOVE MEANS EVERYTHING

269
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,012
-I get it.
-Your insecurity disappeared.

270
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,613
-I had lost my dream…
-Yeah.

271
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,982
…but all of those thoughts disappeared.

272
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,419
-I feel like I overcame all of it.
-That's it.

273
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,820
-Really.
-Oh.

274
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,158
I am so happy to hear that.

275
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,194
You won't get any sleep tonight.

276
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,396
-Right?
-She's right.

277
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,431
I don't think I can sleep.

278
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,999
-Thank you so very much.
-Lastly.

279
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,235
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH

280
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,339
-And, Ji-yoon…
-Yes?

281
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:17,043
…if you can,
please root for him until the end.

282
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,446
-If you can?
-What does that mean?

283
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,347
What does that mean?

284
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,616
You never know. Because of this…

285
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,618
-Why did you make it conditional?
-You never know.

286
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,920
Anyway, thank you so much, Ji-yoon.

287
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,790
I'll make sure to keep my promise.

288
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,158
Thank you.

289
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,659
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

290
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,828
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

291
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,363
She waited so long.

292
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,466
You look so proud, Woo-jae.

293
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,734
I'm done.

294
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,969
I don't have to do anything else today.

295
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:45,971
-Done.
-Okay.

296
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,139
That felt good.

297
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,474
And so, you have heard…

298
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,642
How precious.

299
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,011
-…the first story.
-We're so thankful.

300
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,315
A FEW HOURS AFTER THE SHOOT

301
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:01,387
HE SIGNS AN AUTOGRAPH
AND WRITES A NOTE FOR JI-YOON

302
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,824
TO JI-YOON!

303
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,992
YOU REALLY CHEERED ME UP
BE THE HAPPIEST IN THE UNIVERSE

304
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,029
THE GIFTS THAT
THE MUCH OLDER GUY SENT

305
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,998
WE HOPE THAT THESE GIFTS BRING
JI-YOON A HAPPY DAY AS WELL

306
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,533
Let's move on.

307
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,470
Let's see the keyword
for the second story.

308
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,806
"How far have you gone
because you couldn't say no?"

309
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,775
"How far have you gone?"
What does that mean?

310
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,844
It must be someone who can't say no.

311
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,180
-How sad.
-Let's hear what they have to say.

312
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:29,949
CONNECTING THEM THROUGH

313
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,284
The younger you are,
the harder it is to say no.

314
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,220
-Hello.
-Get used to it.

315
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,121
Can you hear me?

316
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,756
-Hello.
-Hello.

317
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:37,923
Hello.

318
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,926
Can you introduce yourself
and tell us where you're from?

319
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:41,827
Yes.

320
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,963
I live in Daejeon.

321
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,165
My name is Kim Seo-yeon
and I'm 22 years old.

322
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,233
22-year-old Kim Seo-yeon.

323
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,834
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

324
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:53,339
-Nice to meet you.
-You sound pretty decisive, but you said,

325
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,008
"How far have you gone
because you couldn't say no?"

326
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,576
Yes, that's right.

327
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,812
Sounds like she can't.

328
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,147
Shall we hear her out?

329
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,518
Even when I am trying to choose a menu,

330
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,019
I can't eat spicy food,

331
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,587
but if my friends want to eat it,

332
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,556
I'd say, "Great, let's do it."

333
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,258
-So I'd eat it.
-You can't say no.

334
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,360
-No, you'll ruin your stomach.
-Oh, no.

335
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,797
Then, I would suffer
from an upset stomach the next day.

336
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,266
Then…

337
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,200
Yes?

338
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,302
…can you really

339
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,070
not say no?

340
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:29,575
I feel like the other person
would be so disappointed if I say no.

341
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,344
-I've experienced that too.
-I just can't do it.

342
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,213
Aren't you kind of

343
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,714
-like that too, Sae-ho?
-Yes.

344
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,517
Yes, I have a hard time saying no too.

345
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,852
I know.

346
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,087
-She knows? Wait.
-So,

347
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,925
I've studied on some methods lately.

348
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,159
-Tell me.
-You studied it?

349
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,764
Relationships are
very important in life, aren't they?

350
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,698
-Yes.
-Right.

351
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,836
And, of course, they are friends
that I really like, aren't they?

352
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,004
-Right.
-Sorry, are you Shin-chan?

353
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,708
-Doesn't she sound like Shin-chan?
-She sounds cute.

354
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,045
For someone who cannot say no easily,

355
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,913
-you'll need courage.
-And practice.

356
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,748
Yes, you're right.

357
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,217
GIGGLING

358
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,351
"You're right."

359
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,619
SHIN-CHAN KEEPS MAKING
AN APPEARANCE

360
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,822
You need to have that courage because--

361
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,123
-Yes.
-Hang on.

362
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,693
-Seo-yeon.
-Yes?

363
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,229
Are you having a hard time
saying no to Sae-ho right now?

364
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,230
OOPS

365
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,132
Well, I'd like to hear
what Woo-jae has to say as well.

366
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,301
-Who?
-She wants to hear from you.

367
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,136
She wants to hear from you.

368
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,371
-She's nice.
-She's nice.

369
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,272
-She's so nice.
-Yes.

370
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,674
So this is the method I came up with.

371
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,809
-They didn't hear her.
-Okay.

372
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,612
-If it's someone I like very much…
-Yes.

373
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,349
…I figure they could hear me out
when I am having a hard time too.

374
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,217
Right. Me too.

375
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,151
Yes, so…

376
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,453
That was fake.

377
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,454
Seriously though,

378
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,957
-regarding food…
-Yes.

379
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:56,395
…I think you can tell them,
"Can we get mild food next time?"

380
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,030
I think that's a good idea.

381
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:58,998
Also…

382
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,400
I think that's a good idea.

383
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,535
THAT DIDN'T SOUND SO GENUINE

384
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,571
Do you mean it?

385
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,107
I mean it. I can't lie.

386
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,142
Basically, she's a kind person.

387
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,411
Let's hear another episode.

388
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,312
What's the worst one?

389
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,282
The furthest you've gone
because you couldn't say no.

390
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,416
Yes.

391
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,585
I've been on the phone for seven hours.

392
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,653
-What?
-Seven hours?

393
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,456
I've been on the phone for seven hours.

394
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,826
I enjoyed the call
for the first three hours,

395
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,229
but after that, it became tough

396
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,131
and I showed signs of being tired.

397
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:36,068
So my friend said,
"If you're tired, we can hang up."

398
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,370
"But I so enjoy
talking to you on the phone."

399
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,372
So I said, "Really?"

400
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,709
"Then, let's continue.
I'm enjoying it too."

401
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,345
That's how I ended up
on the phone for seven hours.

402
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,648
Didn't your friend lose her voice?

403
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,553
TO HER, THIS REALITY CAN BE
VERY CONCERNING

404
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,123
I think you need to
go through some training.

405
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,960
-Think of me as your friend.
-Yeah,

406
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,161
-let's do that.
-Sounds good.

407
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,462
Try saying no to me.

408
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,564
We've been on the phone
for about six hours now.

409
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,465
Okay.

410
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,068
Aren't our chats so much fun?

411
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,136
Yeah, they're so much fun.

412
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,272
-You have to turn me down.
-She can't.

413
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,773
-You have to say no.
-Seo-yeon.

414
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,409
-You have to turn me down.
-That's right. Sorry.

415
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,911
Turn him down, Seo-yeon.

416
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,679
-That's right.
-Don't you think so?

417
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,583
By the way, remember the movie we saw?

418
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,584
Yes.

419
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,986
Are you tired right now?

420
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,388
A little?

421
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,723
I'm a little tired,

422
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,491
but if you're tired, we can hang up.

423
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,827
-If you're tired?
-I'm not tired at all.

424
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,628
I love being on the phone with you.

425
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,997
I can do it for 24 hours.

426
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,865
-Really?
-Yeah.

427
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,833
HOW WILL SHE RESPOND?

428
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,402
Then, let's talk for 24 hours tomorrow

429
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,870
and hang up for now.

430
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,638
Nice.

431
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,539
-Good job.
-Then…

432
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,342
Then, you have to talk with me
for 24 hours tomorrow.

433
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,479
-Sure. I can do it tomorrow.
-Promise me right now.

434
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,747
I really promise.

435
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,815
-What if he calls you tomorrow?
-Don't promise him.

436
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,517
What if I really did that?

437
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,818
WHAT IF SHE HAD TO
TALK FOR 24 HOURS?

438
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,687
Seo-yeon, you know what I think?

439
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,889
-Yes?
-Everything aside,

440
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,492
what you need now

441
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,029
is to truly love yourself.

442
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,363
You're right.

443
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,632
Not your friends or your family.

444
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,536
You must learn to
take care of yourself and love yourself.

445
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,073
Oh, okay.

446
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,776
I don't think you're on your own side.

447
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,346
I do think of others a lot.

448
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,814
Why are you on their side?

449
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,084
You must come first
in order to care for others.

450
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,520
-Yes.
-When I'm tired,

451
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,789
what I want, what I don't want.

452
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,590
You have to know how to

453
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,692
listen to yourself
and take care of yourself.

454
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,727
Yes.

455
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,296
I hope you can remember
what I am telling you.

456
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,498
Thank you.

457
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,203
Seo-yeon,
of the five members of Screwballs…

458
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,304
Yes?

459
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,306
…whose advice do you want to hear more of?

460
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,541
I want Woo-jae.

461
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,909
-Wow.
-Woo-jae?

462
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,746
I said so many good things for you.
But you chose Woo-jae in the end?

463
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,748
-Jin-kyung.
-Seo-yeon.

464
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,416
Is it him in the end?

465
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,251
Woo-jae is very proud right now.

466
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,555
He may not understand you that well

467
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,191
since he says no really well.

468
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,826
-Really?
-Listen carefully, Seo-yeon.

469
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,060
-Okay.
-Take notes.

470
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,428
You're alone in life.

471
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,699
-Of course, it's nice to have friends.
-Yes.

472
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,436
But you have to know
how to stand up for yourself.

473
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,206
That way, your friends can
stand by your side.

474
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,709
If you treat your friends
with so much caution

475
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,145
because you're afraid of losing them,

476
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,147
you may lose yourself instead.

477
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,851
I'll say this again.
You're alone in life anyway.

478
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,054
Jin-kyung ended up alone as well.

479
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,124
In the end--

480
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,658
Have you lost your mind?

481
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,528
You're alone in life anyway.

482
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,429
He's right!

483
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,431
-He's crazy.
-Learn to stand on your own.

484
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,967
Learn to stand on your own.

485
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,302
-That way, your friends can stand by you.
-Hey, you bastard.

486
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,237
STANDING TALL

487
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,739
-So I'm alone in life anyway?
-He's driving me up the wall.

488
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,108
There isn't much to life!

489
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,277
Just say, "Come at me, world!"

490
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:06,979
Be tough!

491
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,480
Try to train yourself that way.

492
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,149
-I like that.
-Seo-yeon.

493
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,084
Did you like Woo-jae's advice?

494
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,552
I love it.

495
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,621
He has such a nice voice too.

496
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,689
CAN'T BELIEVE IT

497
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:18,857
Thank you.

498
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,293
-Hang in there, Seo-yeon!
-We're rooting for you!

499
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,028
-Thank you.
-Be strong, Seo-yeon!

500
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,696
-Okay.
-Just be selfish.

501
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,831
WE ARE ROOTING FOR YOUR REFUSAL

502
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,799
-Thank you.
-Bye.

503
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,700
She's too nice.

504
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,271
Do you know what
Seo-yeon said the most during the call?

505
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,172
"You're right."

506
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,274
-She's such a kind person.
-"Yes."

507
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,675
-"You're right."
-She's so pure.

508
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,776
-She's so nice.
-Yes.

509
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,311
She's too nice.

510
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,212
Who's up next?

511
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,281
Let's see the next keyword first.

512
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,516
I WAS BORN TO PERFORM
SO SHOULD I KEEP STUDYING?

513
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,552
"I'm born to perform
so should I keep studying?"

514
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,854
-Woo-young should take this one.
-This one's for him.

515
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,123
Woo-young wouldn't know. He didn't study.

516
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,691
SHOULD I KEEP "STUDYING"?

517
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,592
Someone who studied--

518
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,060
You got something wrong.

519
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,063
I WAS BORN TO PERFORM
SO SHOULD I KEEP STUDYING?

520
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,232
-Hello.
-Hello.

521
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,366
Hello.

522
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,135
-Oh, my.
-Hello.

523
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,970
Please introduce yourself.

524
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,106
I live in Gangneung, Gangwon-do.

525
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,742
I'm someone
who really, really loves Jin-kyung.

526
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,878
-Wow!
-My name is Baek Su-min.

527
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,047
-Hey!
-Oh, my. Thank you.

528
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,415
How old are you?

529
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,883
I'm in second year of high school.

530
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,685
I see. So you're 18 years old.

531
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,254
-What do you like about Jin-kyung?
-I know.

532
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,523
I want to be like her in every single way.

533
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,125
Did you recently… Never mind.

534
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,229
YOU SCUMBAG

535
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:31,830
WHY YOU JERK

536
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,466
They aren't my buddies.
They're my enemies.

537
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,202
-They're my enemies. Geez.
-You have to watch out.

538
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,471
You need a limit
to what you want to imitate.

539
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,673
-Geez.
-Su-min,

540
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,209
did you notice
that you were born to perform

541
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,144
-or did others tell you?
-Right.

542
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,179
I'm curious to find out.

543
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,580
I think it's both.

544
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,015
-Really?
-Wait,

545
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,186
are you part of a dance group
at school or something?

546
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,087
No.

547
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,991
So how did you find out
that you were born to perform?

548
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,760
When we had a school festival
in my third year of middle school,

549
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,096
I think I was quite thrilled

550
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,298
-to dance on stage.
-Kind of…

551
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,469
Did it feel like you were alive
for the very first time?

552
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,837
Well…

553
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,738
It wasn't like that.

554
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,008
So you felt like you were alive
from a long time ago.

555
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,643
Didn't you say you wanted to be like her?

556
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,977
-She's funny.
-That's right.

557
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,113
She said she loves Jin-kyung…

558
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,648
-My fans…
-…but she won't agree.

559
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,783
-That was cold.
-They're cold and opinionated.

560
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,884
What did she perform?

561
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,986
-What kind of performance was it?
-What did you do?

562
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,323
I danced to LOONA's song.

563
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,424
Oh, LOONA.

564
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,326
-I'd like to see her dance skills.
-That's tough.

565
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,327
-You can.
-We can?

566
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,728
So, there's footage.

567
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,629
Let's see.

568
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,597
Is that her?

569
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,600
"SIMPLE DANCE" BY JANG WOO-YOUNG

570
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,801
It's Woo-young's dance.

571
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,805
BOOM-CHICK BOOM-CHICK

572
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,140
-That's my move.
-You know what?

573
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,877
HER MOVES ARE LIGHT BUT PRECISE

574
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,312
She really is different.

575
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:54,980
What the heck?

576
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,581
What? Why is she so good?

577
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,816
She really dances well.

578
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,217
Wow! She looks like Woo-young.

579
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,654
Her dance moves are so pretty.

580
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,896
PERFECT SYNCHRONIZATION

581
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:16,134
AN ACTUAL DANCE COVER THAT PUTS
THE TERRIBLE COVERS TO SHAME

582
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,770
I get the feeling that
she was born with this talent.

583
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,705
For real.

584
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,806
SHE WAS BORN TO PERFORM

585
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,544
SHE PROVED THAT SHE WAS BORN TO PERFORM

586
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,645
-Thank you.
-Hang on.

587
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,113
-Su-min.
-Your moves are so pretty.

588
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,514
-Yes?
-Woo-young, be objective.

589
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,249
-Tell us what you think.
-Su-min.

590
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,552
-Yes?
-Who's the man that keeps passing by?

591
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,654
That's my younger brother.

592
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,689
-Oh, your younger brother.
-He's the scene stealer.

593
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,925
Su-min, I'm not kidding when I say this.
Including the five of us,

594
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,660
you look the most like a celebrity.

595
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,561
For real.

596
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,197
I wonder, did someone teach you this

597
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,698
or did you learn how to do it?

598
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,302
On Woo-young's Instagram account,

599
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,939
I got it from the dance
he did with Hwang Chan-sung.

600
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,808
Have you ever attended
a dance school or anything?

601
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,077
I used to be a BTS fan.

602
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,546
They said they'd teach me
my favorite group's dance,

603
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,483
so I went there to learn those dance moves
for about a month.

604
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,751
-No way.
-I've done that.

605
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,352
-She's talented.
-She is just…

606
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,222
When you're born to do something,
it means your body is made for it.

607
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,490
-You're born with it.
-Yes.

608
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,560
I think she is far more talented
than others.

609
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,662
-Thank you.
-We shouldn't just let this slide.

610
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,831
-Gosh.
-I'm curious about something.

611
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,767
-She's really good. I'm shocked.
-Su-min.

612
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,169
-Yes?
-Do you get good grades?

613
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,105
I think I'm about average
or above average.

614
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,342
Since you are so good at dancing,

615
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,444
-why are you hesitant?
-Exactly.

616
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,880
Since I'm in
my second year of high school,

617
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,381
-it's a very important period.
-Yes.

618
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,649
You're right.

619
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,451
-Because of school?
-Because of school.

620
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,519
I was wondering.

621
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,055
What is your final goal, Su-min?

622
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,992
-Would you like to be in an idol group?
-Yeah, that's important.

623
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,161
-Or do you want to be a dancer?
-Or do you want to dance?

624
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,396
I'd like to be in an idol group.

625
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,131
Then, what about this?

626
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,268
Since you're in your second year
of high school, you should be studying.

627
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,236
If you're not careful, you could

628
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,373
-end up losing out on both of them.
-Right.

629
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,710
And, to be honest, it is
late for you to aim for an idol group.

630
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,645
-Yes.
-It's too late.

631
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,181
-Since you have to train for a long time.
-Exactly.

632
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,917
But I hope you don't give up on dancing.

633
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,618
Whether you work

634
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,488
or have some other kind of work,

635
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,058
you can take what you enjoy
along with that, right?

636
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,128
-Yes.
-Recently,

637
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,763
I've been reading Rick Rubin's

638
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,966
The Creative…

639
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,668
Is it The Act of Being Creative?

640
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,869
I don't recall the title.

641
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,905
Anyway, I've been
completely absorbed in that book.

642
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,607
Shouldn't she know the title then?

643
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,344
Go ahead.

644
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,080
He's a world-renowned producer.

645
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,949
-I see.
-Yes, you recommended that book to me.

646
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,418
Do you know what he said?

647
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,554
He said that there are
many ways one can live as an artist.

648
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,258
One of them is maintaining your livelihood

649
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,027
and having a stable life.

650
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,463
Only then, you can do what you want.

651
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,466
If you give up everything
and focus on just one path,

652
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,871
it can be harder to become creative.
That really resonated with me.

653
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,472
-Oh.
-I like that.

654
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,808
ART CAN SHINE EVEN BRIGHTER ON
THE FOUNDATION OF A STABLE LIFE

655
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,410
I think this is why I like you, Jin-kyung.

656
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,415
If you give us your address,

657
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:21,086
I'll underline the points I like
and send you the book.

658
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:23,855
Thank you.

659
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,025
You know, when I look back
and think of when we were 18 years old,

660
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,793
nothing had been set.

661
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,664
But I have become a celebrity

662
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,300
and have experienced so many things.

663
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,003
I think that you have enough time

664
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,639
to try at least one or two things.

665
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,609
I wouldn't say this if you weren't
that good at dancing.

666
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,578
But since you're so good at it,

667
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,147
you should give it a shot
at least once or twice.

668
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,951
Even if it doesn't work out, I think
she'll get back to studying in no time.

669
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,352
But to do that,

670
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,588
-being in high school is--
-Too late?

671
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,525
-She doesn't have enough time to study.
-She's right. That's the reality.

672
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,928
When would she have time
to prepare and go to auditions?

673
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:03,895
She lives far, too.

674
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,131
Shall we hear
Woo-young's objective advice?

675
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,034
-He's closest to that business.
-Go ahead.

676
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,269
Su-min, you enjoy dancing, don't you?

677
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,571
-She's so good.
-Yes.

678
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,272
How fun is it?

679
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,475
Of all the things I do,
it's the one I love the most.

680
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,779
How about this. Since you mentioned
wanting to be in an idol group,

681
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,248
do you have an agency you prefer?

682
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,650
I'd be grateful to be in any of them.

683
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,751
You can't be that way.

684
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:27,652
Cold and objective.

685
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,721
I prefer this singer
or I prefer this agency.

686
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,022
You should be able to see that.

687
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,059
If you don't see it,
your dance should just be a hobby.

688
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,694
Wow. Mr. Jang.

689
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,462
The agency you choose

690
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,598
is where they will

691
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,933
make something out of your life.

692
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,903
You won't invest in yourself.

693
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,606
They'll be the ones
to invest money in your life.

694
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,575
They'll stake their lives on it.

695
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,143
Did he come to his senses?

696
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,745
-What?
-What did you say?

697
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,879
He's like this once a year.

698
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,247
-What on earth?
-How could he?

699
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,882
He's like this once a year.

700
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,451
He's coherent for a change today.

701
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,386
COME ON, GUYS

702
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,321
It's the first time in the last 12 hours.

703
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,756
This was the best in your life.

704
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,157
-Really?
-Keep going.

705
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,359
-Do you get it?
-Yes.

706
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,394
Don't feel grateful about it.

707
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,930
You only get this chance
once in your life, Su-min.

708
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,432
Just as Jin-kyung,

709
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,702
Uncle Woo-jae, and Sae-ho have said…

710
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,971
Why am I an uncle?

711
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,107
He lost it again.

712
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,744
Just as what these grown-ups said,

713
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,245
it has to be clear.

714
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,214
Every second matters right now.

715
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,316
After hanging up this call

716
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,418
and before going to bed,

717
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,654
just think about
what kind of music you like

718
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,856
what groups you like, what sort of person

719
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,190
and singer you want to be.

720
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,760
If you thought about that
and still want to do it,

721
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,728
you should do what you can to create

722
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,432
an opportunity where you can
be evaluated this week.

723
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,466
-Okay.
-From anyone?

724
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,601
However you do it.

725
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,171
If you don't, you'll have
this feeling of regret.

726
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,475
What Jin-kyung said is very important,

727
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,377
but it may not resonate with you.

728
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:00,945
No, it does.

729
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,846
It does?

730
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:02,947
Sorry.

731
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,184
Anyway,

732
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,852
find a solution for this feeling.

733
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,621
A solution for this love of dancing.

734
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,989
Picking a career path is the hardest.

735
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,524
-It's hard.
-Try to do that, okay?

736
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,491
-Yeah.
-Okay.

737
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,160
And if you really love to dance,

738
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,795
you can enjoy dancing

739
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,697
-even if you don't join an idol group.
-Right.

740
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:19,931
Look at Jin-kyung.

741
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,399
She's been dancing her whole life.

742
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,968
Jin-kyung enjoys dancing.

743
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,037
What I really liked was that she should

744
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,406
think about what she likes
and what she wants to do today.

745
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,441
-Bingo.
-That's it.

746
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,042
It'd be great if she did that.

747
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,377
Yes, thank you.

748
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,278
You got this, Su-min!

749
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,447
-You got this. We're rooting for you!
-Thank you.

750
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,548
Thank you.

751
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,150
I'll make sure to send you the book.

752
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,786
I experienced something
really interesting today.

753
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,655
I've seen a sane Jang Woo-young.

754
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,624
Woo-young is clearly serious about dance.

755
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,159
You were really cool today.

756
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,327
-Really?
-Yes.

757
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,930
-The first time in three years.
-It was an awesome solution.

758
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,665
You can actually be coherent.

759
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,467
I'm quite surprised as well.

760
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,901
All of you guys think of me

761
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,536
as some kind of lunatic.

762
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,539
I was touched by the fact that

763
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,541
you were touched by how much I made sense.

764
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,310
I thought I was always sane though.

765
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,412
THE COSTUME HE WORE
AS A SANE PERSON

766
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,748
-Let's see the next word.
-There's another person?

767
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:10,749
Next keyword.

768
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,417
-My gosh.
-Oh, boy.

769
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,384
That must be so tough.

770
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,420
"I'm in the service industry,
but customers are tough."

771
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,422
-Oh, no.
-What do they do?

772
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,224
-I can never work in that industry.
-Me neither.

773
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,825
How do you do?

774
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,260
-Hello.
-She's so polite.

775
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,429
Nice to meet you.
Can you introduce yourself?

776
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:29,267
Hello, I'm 31-year-old Lim Yun-kyung
who's a capital I.

777
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,669
-A capital I for Introvert.
-Nice to meet you.

778
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,338
I'm getting the sense of it.

779
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,740
What kind of concern do you have?

780
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,976
I've been working in
the beauty industry for three years.

781
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:42,480
Currently, I assist in shampooing
and other beauty procedures.

782
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,750
Now, the time has come for me to deal

783
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,787
with the clients one-on-one
as a hair designer.

784
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:54,526
But I find it difficult to
lighten the mood by making small talk,

785
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,194
so I'm worried about that.

786
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,029
TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE SMALL TALK

787
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:02,567
Is there anyone you'd like to hear from?

788
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,503
Because my personality type is ISTP,

789
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,905
I'd like for Joo Woo-jae…

790
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,107
Woo-jae is very popular today.

791
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,477
-I'd like to hear his opinion.
-He's on fire.

792
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,945
It's a Joo Woo-jae special today.

793
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,280
Yun-kyung.

794
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,214
Yes?

795
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,515
Can you hear me?

796
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,950
-"Can you hear me?"
-Yes, I can.

797
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,618
Typically, ISTPs would

798
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,020
overcome that.

799
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,055
Oh, is that so?

800
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,658
Don't do it half-heartedly.

801
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,293
Actually,

802
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,194
I think…

803
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:30,795
rather than me…

804
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,865
-Sae-ho would know way more than me.
-Let me.

805
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,033
Oh, really?

806
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,603
You're a clear introvert, aren't you?

807
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,371
-Yes.
-I am

808
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,040
a clear extrovert,

809
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,943
but I used to feel awkward on stage
and was afraid to meet people.

810
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,545
There was something I did
that helped me overcome that.

811
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,546
What was it?

812
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,448
When I first meet someone,

813
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,118
I think of them as someone
who will be my friend and be on my side.

814
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,888
Then, it becomes easier to talk to them.

815
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,624
-I know how it is since I'm an ISTP.
-Okay.

816
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,626
Rather than an abstract answer like that,

817
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,128
give her an example
of breaking the ice in a conversation.

818
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,663
-Show her an example.
-Okay.

819
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,366
Hello, is it your first time at our salon?

820
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,400
Yes, it is.

821
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,437
I'm the new designer
that recently started here.

822
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,671
Since it's your first time,

823
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,040
may I ask how you found out about us?

824
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,542
You know, as a client,

825
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,644
if someone asks me
how I found out about them,

826
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,912
I instantly feel bothered.

827
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,080
Understood.

828
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,315
-That's your preference.
-Okay, Jin-kyung. Yeah.

829
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,484
I saw your salon on an app.

830
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,219
Let me help you get ready.

831
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,821
May I shampoo your hair?

832
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,422
-But…
-Just approach them.

833
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,824
That's too businesslike, though.

834
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,393
But we're at a business.
Shouldn't we be formal?

835
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,528
-Because you provide a service?
-Yun-kyung

836
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,330
wants to say something witty

837
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,598
so that she can be at ease.

838
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,934
Then, shall we practice
with light small talk?

839
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:43,868
Briefly?

840
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:44,769
Sounds good.

841
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,472
Here's an idea. If you want
the toughest person, it's Woo-young.

842
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,474
-Yes, go ahead, Woo-young.
-Yeah.

843
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,176
A client called Jang Woo-young arrived.

844
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,645
-Okay.
-Hello.

845
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,246
-Hello.
-Yes.

846
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,315
I'd like a haircut.

847
00:31:58,716 --> 00:31:59,918
GIGGLE

848
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,788
Is there a style you had in mind today?

849
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,590
Well, I would

850
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,558
like to trim the side of my hair.

851
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,928
-Okay.
-And add some volume on the top.

852
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,263
Trim the side and add volume to the top.

853
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,065
But this is…

854
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,068
This isn't small talk.
Isn't it just a consultation?

855
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,637
Right. It's more of a consultation.

856
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,773
-I'm a clear introvert, right?
-Yes, you are.

857
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,141
So, Yun-kyung…

858
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,910
-Yes?
-…it isn't that you can't speak

859
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,079
or that you're an introvert,

860
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,515
just think of it
as listening to the other person.

861
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,583
-What about that approach?
-I like that.

862
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,719
People prefer to be heard.

863
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,322
That's right.
That is the exact solution she needs.

864
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:41,592
If you try to force yourself
to converse with them…

865
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,795
-It's exhausting.
-…the client will be exhausted too.

866
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,229
That's hard on you as well.

867
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,499
Just listen to what that person has to say

868
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,202
and ask what they may need. That's it.

869
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,103
Start from there.

870
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,072
-Right.
-Don't even think about

871
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,540
why you aren't good at small talk.

872
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,075
-Yeah, don't be so anxious.
-Applause.

873
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,777
-She's absolutely right. You're the best.
-Focus on what they say.

874
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,146
It would be enough
to just answer their questions.

875
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:06,217
Yun-kyung, do you react well
to what your clients say?

876
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:10,588
I think I am doing a good job
at reacting to the clients.

877
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:15,493
But most of the stylists around me
are clear extroverts.

878
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,862
-Don't let that affect you.
-Don't let it affect you.

879
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,032
-Yeah.
-From my personal experience,

880
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:25,503
whether I go shopping for clothes,
get my hair done, or do anything,

881
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,739
I find it most comfortable

882
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,708
-when they just leave me alone.
-Me too.

883
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,643
-When they just leave me alone…
-Yes.

884
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,778
…that's so relaxing.

885
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,613
And they would provide what I need

886
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,382
-when I need it.
-Yes, when I need it.

887
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,151
I think that's the best kind of service.

888
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,286
When someone is truly an extrovert

889
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,556
and approaches others
according to their character,

890
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,025
-it's natural.
-Just being themselves.

891
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,727
-If you try to force yourself to do it…
-Right.

892
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,928
…that makes it uncomfortable.

893
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,797
-Right.
-Just do it your way.

894
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,666
All you need to do is
be at ease and be genuine.

895
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,002
-If I could give you one tip…
-Yes?

896
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,538
…try to find one good thing

897
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,141
that you can see about that person.

898
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,575
"Your shoes are so pretty."

899
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,277
-That's it.
-That's a great tip.

900
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,280
Something like that can leave
a favorable impression.

901
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,248
Right.

902
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,784
-Sook is something else.
-Just a light comment.

903
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,886
Just prepare a light compliment.

904
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,821
If you prepare just that,

905
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,423
you'll feel much more at ease.

906
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,323
I should do that too.

907
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,658
-A light compliment.
-A light one.

908
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,126
-I'll do that too.
-Not heavy.

909
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,195
-We learn from you again, Sook.
-I know.

910
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,696
Hey, nice shirt.

911
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,864
EXAMPLE OF A COMPLIMENT
NICE SHIRT

912
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,566
-Pay her a compliment too.
-Yeah.

913
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,435
Oh, you too.

914
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,270
THAT'S MOCKING HER

915
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,372
What do you think, Yun-kyung?
Was it helpful?

916
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,908
Yes, that was very helpful.

917
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,042
Thank you.

918
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,544
-We'll root for you.
-You got this.

919
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,712
-We're rooting for you.
-Thank you.

920
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,247
You can do it!

921
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,650
-Next.
-Let's see the keyword.

922
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,151
-The applicant.
-"I'm married,

923
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,320
but I find myself noticing another man."

924
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,488
-Who?
-Wait.

925
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,622
Let's briefly stop filming.

926
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,723
WAIT

927
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:56,494
SHE SHOULD TAKE
THIS CONCERN ELSEWHERE

928
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,629
-The story is--
-Wait.

929
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,865
Wait, why are you covering my face?

930
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,899
Hang on.

931
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,835
Why are you covering my face right now?

932
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,270
It was about marriage
so I did it without thinking.

933
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,206
The husband didn't send this, did he?

934
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,807
A woman sent it, right?

935
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:10,942
HOW FAR IS SHE GOING?

936
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,210
You went too far.

937
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,611
A man didn't send this, right?

938
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:14,545
No, it wasn't.

939
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,115
-We should be clear.
-Let's talk to them to find out.

940
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,382
-Let's call them.
-Gosh.

941
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,084
-Hello.
-People are amazing.

942
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,085
CALL IS STILL CONNECTING

943
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,720
Is this going to be okay?

944
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,988
Is this how you'll respond?

945
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,189
TOO HASTY

946
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,591
Hello?

947
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,326
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

948
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,760
Oh, hello!

949
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,028
Nice to meet you.

950
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,799
Pardon me, but shouldn't you use
a voice altering device or something?

951
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,033
No, it's all right.

952
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,368
Oh, really?

953
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,870
Please introduce yourself.

954
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,939
I live in Icheon, Gyeonggi-do.

955
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,308
My name is Lee Ju-young and I'm in my 50s.

956
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:45,943
-Hello.
-Hello.

957
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,812
We were quite surprised

958
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,114
by your keyword.

959
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,015
This is trouble.

960
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,085
You said, "I'm married,
but I find myself noticing another man."

961
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,988
Are you saying this after you got divorced

962
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,990
or are you saying this
while you're married?

963
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,626
Oh, I am not divorced.

964
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:02,960
Okay.

965
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:06,364
I have a husband and children.

966
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,066
-But briefly…
-Briefly?

967
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,368
Well, it isn't brief.

968
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,904
I find myself noticing another man.

969
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,139
-You shouldn't do that.
-That is my concern.

970
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,041
It isn't Joo Woo-jae again, is it?

971
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,910
No, it can't be.

972
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,144
-No way.
-Can we

973
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,713
hear the detailed story, please?

974
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,848
Maybe an idol group?

975
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,284
Oh. Yes, you're right.

976
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,887
It hasn't been that long since I have

977
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,123
started liking an idol group.

978
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,759
-It has been a little over three years.
-I see.

979
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,761
Can you tell us who it is?

980
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,964
Well, you see, I happened to come across…

981
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,666
-Well…
-Woo-young?

982
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,201
I was watching a historical drama.

983
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,669
-Not me.
-A drama?

984
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,971
She said, "Well, you see," not Woo-young?

985
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,373
I THOUGHT SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOU

986
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:51,509
I was watching a historical drama.

987
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,476
A drama?

988
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,347
I happened to see Lee Jun-ho
on The Red Sleeve.

989
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,381
Lee Jun-ho!

990
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,185
LEE JUN-HO IS SUCH A GOOD PERSON

991
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,153
-Jun-ho.
-Oh, Jun-ho.

992
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,588
-Oh, Jun-ho.
-Jun-ho?

993
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,922
-Yes.
-Okay.

994
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,357
I totally understand how she feels.

995
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,694
As I started to like him,

996
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,964
I looked up videos of him on YouTube.

997
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,201
Naturally, 2PM's videos
popped up in my feed.

998
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,537
-Because she was watching Jun-ho's videos.
-Yes.

999
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,871
Yes,

1000
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,640
so I became a 2PM fan

1001
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,943
and I watch their videos almost every day.

1002
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,546
-Gosh.
-2PM's performance is insane.

1003
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,847
Yes, you're right.

1004
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,083
Then, did you happen to move on

1005
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,185
-to Woo-young from Jun-ho?
-Is it Woo-young?

1006
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,419
Yes, you're right!

1007
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,188
YOU ARE CORRECT

1008
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,157
I'M MARRIED BUT I FIND MYSELF
NOTICING JANG WOO-YOUNG

1009
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,459
It was Woo-young in the end?

1010
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,294
It's your fault, you jerk!

1011
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,930
She's married but she finds herself
noticing another man.

1012
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,032
So through Jun-ho,

1013
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,467
-she started fangirling idols.
-Yes.

1014
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,935
Then, she got to know 2PM.

1015
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,503
As she was watching videos of 2PM,

1016
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,305
she started liking Woo-young.

1017
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,107
-I didn't expect this at all.
-What about Woo-young?

1018
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,643
We hope you have many happy days
ahead of you.

1019
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,077
Screwballs is…

1020
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,112
WE AREN'T DONE WITH HER STORY

1021
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,047
-I just found out.
-Oh, my bad.

1022
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,515
They're so popular today.

1023
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,652
What made you fall for Woo-young?

1024
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,955
It isn't easy to move on
to Woo-young from Jun-ho.

1025
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,189
-Exactly.
-What the heck?

1026
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,491
Well, you see,

1027
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:17,628
you'd know if you go to his concert.

1028
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,330
She even went to his concert.

1029
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:23,267
He looks the coolest
when he's doing his main job.

1030
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,902
-Thank you.
-Ju-young.

1031
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,804
-Yes?
-What does your husband say?

1032
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,340
At first,

1033
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,810
my husband and my children told me,

1034
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,246
"You're old,
so why are you making a fuss about idols?"

1035
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,083
But I paid no attention to that

1036
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,253
and continued fangirling.
And I have to do whatever I can

1037
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,890
to get tickets whenever they go on tour.

1038
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,992
It's hard to get tickets.

1039
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,096
Yes. Luckily, I was able to go.

1040
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,267
At first, my husband seemed
to disapprove of it,

1041
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,704
but he seems to like it now.
My children as well.

1042
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,739
I don't nag as much, you see.

1043
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,408
-Exactly.
-So the family became peaceful.

1044
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,309
Yes.

1045
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,645
Thankfully, your husband and children

1046
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,947
-don't seem to mind it.
-Yes.

1047
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,482
Have you ever asked your husband,

1048
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,217
"Since I like a boy band,

1049
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,554
why don't you try liking a girl group?"

1050
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,189
Have you ever asked him that?

1051
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,423
Your husband may feel

1052
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,725
-a bit lonely.
-Suggest one.

1053
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,328
Right. But are you okay with your husband

1054
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:25,996
liking a girl group?

1055
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,431
Yes, I'm okay with it.

1056
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:31,369
Then, if Woo-young and your husband
were both drowning,

1057
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,637
-What?
-who would you save first?

1058
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,873
-Come on.
-That's too difficult.

1059
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,444
Ju-young, it shouldn't be difficult.

1060
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,913
Of course, you should save your husband.

1061
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,783
Sign your husband up
for swimming lessons tomorrow.

1062
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:47,752
WISE ANSWER TO A STUPID QUESTION

1063
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,854
-For his safety.
-Woo-young is good at swimming.

1064
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,156
-Woo-young can swim.
-He's good at swimming.

1065
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,257
You know what?

1066
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,359
If someone around me

1067
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,528
or someone close to me

1068
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,463
says they're Woo-young's fan,

1069
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,965
-Yes.
-I think I'd really like it.

1070
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,400
-You'd like the person?
-Why?

1071
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,934
They wouldn't seem intimidating.

1072
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,169
-Really?
-Yes.

1073
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,471
-I don't mean it in a bad way.
-Okay.

1074
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,941
In my case… I'm Joo Woo-jae, by the way.

1075
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,344
I am a fan of Jang Woo-young.

1076
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,512
-Oh.
-Yes.

1077
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,880
Since I'm a fan,

1078
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,915
when someone says they like Woo-young,

1079
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,351
I feel like… How should I put it?

1080
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,753
"Of course, they should like Woo-young."
That's how I feel.

1081
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,888
That's awesome.

1082
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:26,924
I don't think I would feel jealous at all.

1083
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,561
Woo-young, as a person,
has that kind of charming effect.

1084
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,029
He's right.

1085
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,798
This one time I went to Japan…

1086
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,800
-Yes?
-I went to Japan one time.

1087
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:36,801
At a restaurant,

1088
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,736
a woman came to me

1089
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,070
and paid for my meal

1090
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,273
while she was trembling.

1091
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:45,743
The person on her wallpaper
was Jang Woo-young.

1092
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,078
She knew I was a member of Screwballs

1093
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,980
-and got excited over me.
-She paid for it?

1094
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,682
-She did.
-Did she confuse you with me?

1095
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,517
-Since you're close.
-That's why

1096
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,287
I have been watching Screwballs

1097
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,756
since the Beat Coin days.

1098
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,491
-Thank you.
-Perhaps,

1099
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,694
you'll notice another man
on this show now.

1100
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,629
-No, I don't think so.
-Who knows?

1101
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,833
-I don't think that should happen.
-You may be watching it

1102
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,435
and find yourself noticing Cho Sae-ho. No?

1103
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,805
-Is that a possibility?
-I don't think I would do that.

1104
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,140
You're right.

1105
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,542
-I am married too now.
-Good job.

1106
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,144
Ms. Ju-young also has--

1107
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,645
I'm married too now.

1108
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,747
She could have said yes.

1109
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,449
But she clearly drew the line.

1110
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,084
We should be careful.

1111
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,319
Hello, Ms. Ju-young.

1112
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,588
Yes, hello.

1113
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,056
She became a young girl.

1114
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:36,994
Using this time you have with me,

1115
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,397
is there anything you wanted to say to me?

1116
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,967
You can ask me a favor or anything.

1117
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,401
Is there something?

1118
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,638
-Aren't you releasing an album this year?
-Yes.

1119
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:52,376
It seemed like you were very stressed
about making that album.

1120
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,245
The people around him
are more stressed out.

1121
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,214
Others are more stressed because of me.

1122
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:02,887
It seemed like you weren't getting
enough sleep either.

1123
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,622
I just wanted to tell you that

1124
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,790
-you don't have to work so hard.
-My, thank you.

1125
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,393
Wow. My goodness.

1126
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,961
You must be so happy.

1127
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,029
I really am.

1128
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,465
-Say something to her as well.
-You too.

1129
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,533
-Yes.
-Oh, yes.

1130
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,967
-Ju-young.
-Yes?

1131
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,435
What character is your "Young"?

1132
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,005
-Me?
-Yes.

1133
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,107
-That is so you.
-Seriously?

1134
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,543
I want it to be the same as yours.

1135
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,544
Why ask her that?

1136
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,545
What character is it?

1137
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,346
I feel like
it's the same character as mine.

1138
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,582
My "Young" stands for Glory.

1139
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,850
Mine too.

1140
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:34,752
They connected.

1141
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,921
What character is your "Ju"?

1142
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,188
Geez.

1143
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,723
Come on.

1144
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,225
It means Progeny.

1145
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,426
It's different from mine.

1146
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,095
Stay out of it.

1147
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,697
-Ju-young.
-Yes?

1148
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:50,768
Thank you for waiting such a long time
to be on the phone with us.

1149
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:55,639
On the set of Screwballs,
the show I like so much…

1150
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,208
-Yes.
-…I was able to have a conversation…

1151
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,478
-Yes.
-…with such a genuine fan over the phone.

1152
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,615
-It makes me kind of feel emotional.
-Emotional?

1153
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,818
I will do whatever I can

1154
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,988
-to pour in everything I have…
-Yes.

1155
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,823
…to work hard on Screwballs

1156
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,595
and to do what I can to finish
mixing my album this year.

1157
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,697
That mixing. Geez.

1158
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,165
I'll complete mixing the album

1159
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,000
so that I can go on tours.

1160
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,568
I'll do my best to do that…

1161
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:27,538
-Yes.
-…so if you have the availability…

1162
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,639
I'll definitely come!

1163
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,007
Okay.

1164
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,010
Please come with your husband and children

1165
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,845
if they are free as well.

1166
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:35,746
Okay.

1167
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,915
You know what's cool about Ju-young?

1168
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:41,619
She's either my age or about a year apart.

1169
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,822
At our age, there isn't much
that gets us excited.

1170
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,625
-Right.
-But you seem to…

1171
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,693
-Right.
-…get excited about someone,

1172
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,464
like someone and read about them
when you get up.

1173
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,933
In a way, I'm really jealous about that.

1174
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,905
That's why I am so thankful
to 2PM and everybody.

1175
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,607
Please don't ever change.

1176
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:07,411
The feeling of
excitement and anticipation.

1177
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,146
I hope you can keep it forever.

1178
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,081
When you get older, it isn't easy to find

1179
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,585
-something that can energize you in life.
-You're right.

1180
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,987
Please continue to love Woo-young too.

1181
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,657
-Okay.
-And continue to love our Screwballs too.

1182
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,458
Yes, of course.

1183
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,795
I'd appreciate it if you could
recommend me to your acquaintances too.

1184
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,097
I'm doing my best to do that.

1185
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,933
Hang on.
You're crying right now, aren't you?

1186
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,968
Me?

1187
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,636
-Yes.
-No, I'm trying to hold it in.

1188
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,138
-What?
-She's trying to hold it in.

1189
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,439
-Gosh.
-Yes.

1190
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,974
It felt like she was holding it in.

1191
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:37,908
-I know.
-Gosh.

1192
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,076
-Thank you!
-Sure.

1193
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,177
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

1194
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:44,882
I'm rooting for Screwballs
to be a long-lasting show on Netflix.

1195
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,750
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1196
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,119
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

1197
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,022
-Woo-young was this popular?
-Gosh, you guys.

1198
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,191
When will you finish mixing your album?

1199
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,659
It's thanks to you guys.

1200
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,328
Woo-young, so what is mixing anyway?

1201
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,763
What do you do?

1202
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,231
When will it be done?

1203
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,901
-Just think of it as a fruit blender.
-Oh, that mixing?

1204
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:04,835
Next.

1205
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,170
-Here's the last one.
-Okay!

1206
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:09,306
-What's this?
-"Well… You see… I am…"

1207
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,507
That sounds like me.

1208
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:11,442
-No.
-Well, you see…

1209
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,976
Isn't it like Woo-young?

1210
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,278
-Oh, yeah.
-You try it.

1211
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,413
Well… You see… I am…

1212
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,648
Spit it out already.

1213
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,649
Stop muttering.

1214
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,850
THE WAY HE SPEAKS
FRUSTRATES VETERAN ENTERTAINERS

1215
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,518
WILL THEY SOUND LIKE WOO-YOUNG?

1216
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:22,753
Hello?

1217
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,455
-Yes, hello.
-Hi.

1218
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,958
Please introduce yourself.

1219
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,461
Oh, I am

1220
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,131
a 28-year-old who lives in Busan.

1221
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,100
Please call me by my nickname, Tomato.

1222
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,935
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1223
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,203
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1224
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,071
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

1225
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,406
We saw your keyword.

1226
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:47,044
It said, "Well… You see… I am…"

1227
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,980
Can you please tell us
what this is all about, Tomato?

1228
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,383
I have a job interview
with a public enterprise next week.

1229
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,618
-Interview?
-Public enterprise?

1230
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,220
We had to do interviews today too.

1231
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,321
WE DID THAT ALL DAY!

1232
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,323
If you come here,

1233
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,625
we can prepare you
for almost any kind of interview.

1234
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:07,164
You see, I'm the type of person
that gets very nervous.

1235
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,398
She gets nervous.

1236
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:11,068
I'd like to ask all of you

1237
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,203
on how I can overcome this.

1238
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,038
Is she nervous now?

1239
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,508
Yes, a little bit?

1240
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,344
How badly do you get nervous?

1241
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,412
When I was in high school,

1242
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,215
-I interviewed for a school club.
-Okay.

1243
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,952
They asked me to introduce myself,

1244
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,088
but I misheard that
as introducing my family,

1245
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,258
so I introduced my family members
one by one.

1246
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,426
If you get this nervous,
it would be charming.

1247
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,928
Yes, it's amusing.

1248
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,031
-So I failed the interview.
-Oh, no.

1249
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:45,035
Since then, I get nervous frequently.

1250
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,771
That memory must have stayed with her.

1251
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:52,142
As trauma. Then, when do you
get most nervous in your daily life?

1252
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,210
In her daily life?

1253
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,612
In my early 20s,

1254
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,316
-there was a guy that I had a fling with.
-Okay.

1255
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,585
I got so nervous

1256
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,488
that I canceled our date with only
about 20 to 30 minutes left

1257
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,790
from the time we were supposed to meet up.

1258
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,126
Because you were too nervous to meet him?

1259
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,128
I got so nervous in that moment.

1260
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,329
-Yeah.
-How cute.

1261
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,065
-I stayed home.
-It breaks my heart.

1262
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,401
You made plans to meet him
but you canceled it?

1263
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:18,836
You should've gone!

1264
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,938
Then, when you canceled the date,

1265
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:25,375
I'm sure you didn't say, "Listen,
I'm getting so nervous to meet you."

1266
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:26,276
Of course not.

1267
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,212
-I'd be too embarrassed.
-What did you say?

1268
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:31,949
I just told him that
there was a family emergency.

1269
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,051
FAMILY EMERGENCIES
ARE THE BEST EXCUSES

1270
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,220
I'm sorry, but that guy
definitely knew it was an excuse.

1271
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,023
One time, I built up the courage
to invite him over to my place.

1272
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,358
That guy you were seeing?

1273
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,492
-Yes.
-Oh?

1274
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,161
-But after I--
-You don't get nervous.

1275
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,030
But after I invited him, I got so nervous

1276
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,800
that I realized I couldn't handle it.

1277
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,669
I kept going back and forth
from the kitchen to the living room.

1278
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,472
And he must have picked up on it.

1279
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,041
So it kind of fizzled out in the end.

1280
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,311
So the guy was sitting in the living room

1281
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,480
and you kept going
back and forth from the kitchen?

1282
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,549
That's how it ended?

1283
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,152
I was wondering
if I had to serve him apples

1284
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,921
or turn on the TV for him.

1285
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,155
-Listen.
-Do all of it.

1286
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,524
-Turn on the TV and serve apples.
-When you invited him…

1287
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,493
When you invited that guy,

1288
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,129
you must have had a plan, right?

1289
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,032
-Yes.
-When he comes, you'll serve apples,

1290
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,200
turn on the music, etc.

1291
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,303
Didn't you plan it out like that
before you invited him?

1292
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,773
You know how nervous you get.

1293
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,875
-Didn't you rehearse it?
-Didn't you have a plan?

1294
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,443
Did you try to improvise everything?

1295
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,213
No, I definitely had a plan.

1296
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,447
But when he came…

1297
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,016
-It didn't work?
-She was too nervous.

1298
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,651
She couldn't remember.

1299
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,152
-Tomato.
-Yeah.

1300
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,389
-You're speaking so well right now.
-She is.

1301
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:49,259
-You speak better than us.
-You're so calm and clear.

1302
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,328
Then, why don't we have a mock interview

1303
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,664
-just like this?
-Good idea. What do you think?

1304
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,732
Well…

1305
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,401
And Tomato.

1306
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,269
She got nervous all of a sudden.

1307
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,671
-Yes?
-Tomato.

1308
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,472
-Don't be like that.
-Just so you know,

1309
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,475
we're going to be like real interviewers.

1310
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,011
-Okay.
-Let's try to have a mock interview.

1311
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,880
If you can overcome this,

1312
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,349
the job interview you have
with the public enterprise

1313
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,117
will be like a walk in the park.

1314
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,320
-Shall we begin?
-Yeah.

1315
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,255
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

1316
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,290
You can use your nickname though.

1317
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:21,758
Okay.

1318
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,360
Please introduce yourself.

1319
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,130
Oh, hello. I'm from Busan and…

1320
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,699
I don't think I can do it.

1321
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,103
It's okay.

1322
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,871
Then, let's try this first, Tomato.

1323
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,807
RAN AWAY
BEFORE EVEN SPEAKING HER NAME

1324
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,175
SHE'S MORE NERVOUS THAN EXPECTED

1325
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:39,343
Oh, no. What do we do?

1326
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,244
-She's really nervous.
-What do we do?

1327
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,846
No, she can practice.

1328
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,549
-But…
-Is there a reason

1329
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,918
why you want to join our company?

1330
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:48,952
TO THE NEXT QUESTION

1331
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,054
I am very interested

1332
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,689
in this company

1333
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:55,359
and I'll do my best.

1334
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,794
I don't even know what I'm saying.

1335
00:49:58,862 --> 00:49:59,696
Look.

1336
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:00,797
OH MY GOSH

1337
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,666
-Tomato.
-Yes?

1338
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,468
Basically…

1339
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:08,705
We do have to be on the phone.
Basically, introduce yourself like this.

1340
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,007
For example, I can say, "Hello,

1341
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,175
I'm Cho Sae-ho
and I'm here for the interview."

1342
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,978
"This may seem odd,
but my nickname is Tomato."

1343
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,047
"My face turns red
when I get very nervous."

1344
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,949
"I'm nervous today as well,

1345
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,785
but I'll do my best on the interview."
Then, continue on

1346
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,754
-with the interview.
-Very nice.

1347
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,956
When I do events, I look in the mirror

1348
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,025
and say, "Nice to meet you
and thank you very much."

1349
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:31,328
I repeat it until I can
say it automatically like a machine.

1350
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,697
That way, when I'm speaking,

1351
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,699
I get a little less nervous.

1352
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,801
Because I practiced it countless times,

1353
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,503
it comes out of my mouth naturally.

1354
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,638
-There's that saying, right?
-He's awesome.

1355
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,340
You overcome your nerves with practice.

1356
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,241
Exactly.

1357
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:48,945
If you practice
until it becomes second nature,

1358
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,415
-it comes out however nervous you are.
-Exactly.

1359
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,750
-Don't you know that with your dancing?
-That's right.

1360
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,886
If you freaking… Wait, no.

1361
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,654
If you practice a lot,

1362
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,656
-you get used to it.
-Yes.

1363
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,458
Then, the interviewer may say,

1364
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:04,327
"You don't seem that nervous."

1365
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,330
Then, you can say, "Before I came here,

1366
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,333
I practiced countless times
so that my nervousness wouldn't show."

1367
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,969
-They'll be impressed by the effort…
-By your courage.

1368
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,472
-…you put in for the interview.
-Yeah.

1369
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,774
Those interviewers?

1370
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,343
They're just old guys
if you see them outside.

1371
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,511
Just think of it that way.

1372
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,180
He's right. They're just…

1373
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,348
Here's one more thing to remember.

1374
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,585
If you think that it won't work out,

1375
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,922
-you'll start feeling that way as well.
-Right.

1376
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,057
So you really have to

1377
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,725
get rid of that negative thought.

1378
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:36,693
Got that?

1379
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,428
-Okay.
-"I may be nervous,

1380
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,931
-but it'll work out for me."
-Of course.

1381
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,133
Why not think that way?

1382
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,302
POSITIVE THINKING
CAN BEAT HER NERVOUSNESS!

1383
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,237
-Okay.
-Were we of any help?

1384
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,906
Yes, very much so.

1385
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:50,807
I'm glad.

1386
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,143
Then, why don't you
introduce yourself one last time?

1387
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,411
-Yeah.
-Yeah, give it a shot.

1388
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,846
Don't be nervous.

1389
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,514
No, don't say that.

1390
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,316
Just accept that you're nervous.

1391
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,450
Just go with it.

1392
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,285
-Okay.
-Just go with it.

1393
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,320
-Okay.
-Okay.

1394
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:04,955
Please introduce yourself.

1395
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,923
Hello.

1396
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:09,793
I have applied for this job from Busan.

1397
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,596
My nickname is Tomato

1398
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,931
and my name is so-and-so.

1399
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:18,235
The reason why my nickname is Tomato

1400
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,270
is not only because I like tomatoes,

1401
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,773
but also because my face turns red
when I get nervous.

1402
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,609
Did I do well?

1403
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,978
-Yes! Wow!
-That was really good.

1404
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:28,945
She did it so calmly.

1405
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,081
-Your tone seemed much better.
-Yes.

1406
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,482
-You can do it.
-Also,

1407
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,352
because we found out
that you were nervous,

1408
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,753
we ended up paying more attention

1409
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,221
-to what you were saying.
-Right.

1410
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,090
-We wanted to listen more carefully.
-Yeah.

1411
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,391
Go and kill that interview.

1412
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,793
Thank you.

1413
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,195
Please let us know how it went.

1414
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,096
Please do.

1415
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,765
If you get a nice job, please let us know.

1416
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,267
Yes, I will. Thank you.

1417
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,635
Love you, Screwballs.

1418
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,203
-Yes.
-Yes. Nice talking to you.

1419
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,273
WE ROOT FOR TOMATO, WHO TURNED
HER NERVOUSNESS INTO COMEDY

1420
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,775
-The final tone was totally corrected.
-Yeah.

1421
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,144
You were so good at counseling.

1422
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,112
-Really?
-Yeah.

1423
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,380
We were sincere.

1424
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:04,781
Yes, all five of you were.

1425
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,218
-They were all cases we could relate to…
-Yeah.

1426
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,353
…and we've worried about
things like that too.

1427
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,888
Who hasn't been nervous?

1428
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,823
-I get very nervous.
-Of course.

1429
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,091
You nervously made kimchi too.

1430
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,627
She's a pro at that.

1431
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,828
Has he lost it again?

1432
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,431
When he came to his senses earlier,

1433
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:22,866
we should have cherished it.

1434
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,901
It only lasted a few seconds.

1435
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:25,802
WOO-YOUNG WAS VERY FIRM

1436
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,904
We should have cherished
seeing and hearing him.

1437
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,307
It was so precious. Go back to that.

1438
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,875
Do the concluding comment

1439
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:32,909
but coherently.

1440
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,611
-What?
-What?

1441
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,080
GOOD JOB, MAN

1442
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,182
Compared to other episodes,

1443
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,218
we really talked intensely today.

1444
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,519
-You're right.
-This special…

1445
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,188
-We talked a lot.
-…wasn't physical at all.

1446
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,757
Is this harder than getting splashed?

1447
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,326
This is definitely harder.

1448
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,228
Can't we just get splashed on?

1449
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:52,963
-This is harder?
-Yeah.

1450
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:54,497
I was so happy today.

1451
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,166
I talked my heart out.

1452
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,303
I'll go home and talk with my wife too.
"This is what we did today."

1453
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,638
I think I'm going to puke.

1454
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,706
PUKE FROM ALL THE TALKING

1455
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,874
They kindly listened to what I had to say.

1456
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:07,277
Now, the people who shared their stories

1457
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:11,348
will vote for the member whose advice
resonated with them the most.

1458
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,050
Everyone gave such good advice

1459
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,052
that it must've been
hard for them to choose.

1460
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,255
That's why there were
some that changed their minds.

1461
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,157
They chose one member
but switched to another member.

1462
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,425
THEY ALL GAVE SINCERE ADVICE

1463
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,361
This person got three votes.

1464
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,595
That's a lot.

1465
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,164
This is the God of Talk
chosen by the viewers.

1466
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,000
Congratulations, Sook.

1467
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:32,369
KIM SOOK

1468
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,637
I must've been too sincere.

1469
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,571
DUMBFOUNDED

1470
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,505
But Woo-jae was…

1471
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:39,643
You see, Sook's advice has depth to it.

1472
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,545
-Right.
-It comes from her maturity.

1473
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,881
You can't ignore that depth.

1474
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,450
If anyone wants to know their votes,
may we ask after filming?

1475
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,553
-I'll let you know personally.
-Okay.

1476
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:55,158
We have chosen the God of Talk
in three categories.

1477
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,827
Cho Sae-ho, the God of Talk
chosen by the staff.

1478
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,896
Kim Sook, the God of Talk
chosen by the members.

1479
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,298
And Sook again.

1480
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,500
Kim Sook, the God of Talk
chosen by the members.

1481
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,670
We have prepared
awesome gifts for the winners

1482
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,238
of the three categories.

1483
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,239
-Ready?
-I'm nervous.

1484
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,074
Then, from now on,

1485
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,677
Jin-kyung, me, and Woo-young will

1486
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:14,944
only do physical comedy.

1487
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,313
Stir-fry me.

1488
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,882
TRY TO BEAT THESE COSTUMES

1489
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,886
Can the winners, Sae-ho and Sook,
come forward and line up?

1490
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,421
It has been a long time.

1491
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:26,623
THE TWO GODS EXCHANGE GREETINGS

1492
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,992
-Congratulations.
-Well done.

1493
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:29,959
Come in.

1494
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,294
-What's that?
-Well…

1495
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:34,564
-Our lighting director.
-They represent the staff and viewers.

1496
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,765
You know what?

1497
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,434
You don't use these gloves for this.

1498
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,535
They're both wrong.

1499
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,669
BRIDAL GLOVES, WORK GLOVES

1500
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:42,172
-That's so funny.
-Can you present the award one by one?

1501
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,041
Mr. Cho Sae-ho, the staff chose you
as the God of Talk

1502
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,777
for skillfully and wittily sharing stories

1503
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,914
with top-level talking ability
and bringing laughter.

1504
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,650
THE GOD OF TALK

1505
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,253
THE STAFF-APPROVED GOD OF TALK

00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,656
COMMEMORATIVE PHOTO IS A MUST

00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,058
IT'S THE BIGGEST AWARD
SINCE I DEBUTED

1508
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,593
WIFE, THANK YOU FOR MARRYING ME

1509
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,528
I'll treasure it.

1510
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,063
-Okay.
-It's quite hefty too.

1511
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,565
-Next.
-You're right.

1512
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:09,933
Ms. Kim Sook,

1513
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,935
the entertainers chose you
as the God of Talk

1514
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,204
for demonstrating quick wit
and sharp instincts

1515
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,306
despite the ruthless pressure
of a tough interview.

1516
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,109
THE GOD OF TALK

1517
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,711

COMMEMORATIVE PHOTO IS A MUST

1519
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,614
I'VE RECEIVED SUCH A HUGE AWARD

1520
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:25,882
PEOPLE I'M THANKFUL FOR
COME TO MIND

1521
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,151
Ms. Kim Sook was chosen
by the viewers as the God of Talk

1522
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,487
for deeply empathizing
with the viewers' stories

1523
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,822
and offering sincere advice and comfort.

1524
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,091
THE GOD OF TALK
CHOSEN BY THE VIEWERS - KIM SOOK

1525
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,126
Congratulations.

1526
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,927
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN

1527
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,062
It's like a real trophy.

1528
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,730
I SAID I'M UNLUCKY WITH AWARDS

1529
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:42,065
BUT IT WAS ALL
FOR THIS HUGE AWARD

1530
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,800
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations.

1531
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,802
Thank you both for your hard work.

1532
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:46,903
Thank you.

1533
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,873
By the way, if you peel off the sticker,

1534
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,908
you'll see that
they're repurposed trophies

1535
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,910
from our escape room days.

1536
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,044
-Don't do it.
-I won't.

1537
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,212
-Me neither.
-Okay.

1538
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,447
We have to return these.

1539
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,715
-Return it?
-They'll reuse it.

1540
00:56:58,782 --> 00:56:59,883
-Next time.
-No, it's okay.

1541
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,284
They have to reuse it next time.

1542
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,020
We have so many at our office.

1543
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,689
We filmed for a long time
but we really enjoyed it.

1544
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,458
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

1545
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,030
Excuse me. I'm sorry,

1546
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:14,931
Yes?

1547
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,766
Aren't there any prizes?

1548
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,867
Well done!

1549
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,002
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

1550
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,604
GOING HOME IS THE AWARD

1551
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,473
Didn't they say they'd give us a prize?

1552
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,375
SHOULDN'T YOU TREAT US
FOR WINNING AN AWARD?

1553
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,276
Really?

1554
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,545
AWKWARDLY LAUGHING

1555
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,880
Next episode on Screwballs…

1556
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:35,718
THE JOKER IS EXILED TO KOREA

1557
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,388
The other bad guys
have joined him as well.

1558
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,656
Can't I like you?

1559
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,292
I'm Dan Chen,
the shorter version of Jang Chen.

1560
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,661
The best location for exile, Gangjin.

1561
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,831
The greatest Silhak scholar
of the Joseon Dynasty, Jeong Yak-yong,

1562
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,633
endured 18 years of exile.

1563
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,802
Surviving as a criminal
charged with high treason.

1564
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,571
I am Criminal Kim Sook.

1565
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,506
Actually, I am crazy about men.

1566
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,342
We were supposed to meet again.

1567
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,310
I'm sorry.

1568
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,644
Come on!

1569
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,079
"I'd like to apologize."

1570
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,347
Not going to say that!

1571
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,515
So what?

1572
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:09,419
Tea is said to soothe
a tired body and mind.

1573
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,887
My dog wouldn't drink like that.

1574
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,055
Without acting rashly.

1575
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,022
He acts carelessly.

1576
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,058
No careful consideration.

1577
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,627
-You're last.
-What?

1578
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,562
You must behave with dignity.

1579
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,831
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

1580
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,567
THE BAD GUYS
GET ALONG SWIMMINGLY

1581
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:26,669
K-EXILES CAN'T STAND
BAD GUYS BEING HAPPY

1582
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,805
BAD GUYS WILL BECOME GOOD

1583
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,241
IN THE HARSH LIFE OF K-EXILE

1584
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:32,408
I'm not feeling well.

1585
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:33,543
Please stop.

1586
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,278
If you carry out life of exile well,

1587
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,014
the person that came in first
as a model exile

1588
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,983
will take the zip line to the mainland

1589
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,150
and their exile ends.

1590
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,987
Gangjin is so nice.

1591
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,622
-It's so nice.
-It's so nice.

1592
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,156
-Gangjin is nice.
-It was so nice.

1593
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,057
WHICH VILLAIN WILL BE REFORMED?

1594
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,459
