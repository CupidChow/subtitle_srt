1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,739
A RUTHLESS COMPETITION
TO RISE TO THE TOP

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,107
CHAEBOLS KNOW HOW TO PARTY

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,308
What on earth?

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,809
ROUND 1'S WINNER,
CHEWED-UP SUNG-HOON

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,544
ROUND 2,
CLASSY HORSEBACK QUIZ SHOW

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,579
TURNS INTO RUCKUS

7
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:13,847
You dare grab my hair?

8
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,348
Onion Ring.

9
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,282
Wrong.

10
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,884
WHAT WOULD CHAIRMAN DO THINK…

11
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,052
You timed out!

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,387
…ABOUT THIS
PATHETIC COMPETITION?

13
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,454
Correct.

14
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,790
EVEN HORSES WOULD LAUGH
AT THIS FARCE

15
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,291
THE NEW EPISODE BEGINS NOW

16
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,426
CURRENT STANDINGS
SAE-HO, 1.8 BILLION

17
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,761
WOO-YOUNG, 600 MILLION
WOO-JAE, 501 MILLION

18
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,962
SOOK, 500 MILLION
JIN-KYUNG, 300 MILLION

19
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,366
THIRD EPISODE
OF CHAEBOL HEIR AUDITION

20
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,537
WHAT MISSION MUST
THE HEIR TRAINEES TACKLE NEXT?

21
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,339
Now that the Dora-Group
has joined the ranks

22
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,408
of the top ten Korean companies,

23
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,276
it needs to expand globally.

24
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,745
-To do that, we must embrace change.
-Which is?

25
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,447
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

26
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,215
Are you familiar with the concept of ESG?

27
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,617
-Of course.
-I see.

28
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,819
Can you tell me
what the acronym stands for?

29
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,121
Okay.

30
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,458
-S for speaking.
-Please continue.

31
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,326
And then…

32
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,028
And then… ES…

33
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,496
-What's next, an A?
-No, a G.

34
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,531
Oh, a G.

35
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,367
AS EXPECTED, GIRLIE…

36
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,737
"Discuss ideas on a global scale."

37
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,739
That's the motto of the Dora-Group.

38
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,275
Allow me to remind you
of the most common understanding of ESG.

39
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,010
With sustainable growth in mind,

40
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,745
the principle fosters responsibility

41
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,447
toward the environment and society

42
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,115
and drives corporate transparency.

43
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,616
Does it have nothing to do with MSG?

44
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,551
No, not at all.

45
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,386
Lately within the Dora-Group,

46
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,889
we've begun to see lively discussions
about reusing and recycling.

47
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,592
As the head of a fashion brand,

48
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,727
I too am seeing the appeal of recycling.

49
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,864
To advance into the global market,
we need to develop a new material.

50
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,666
-Of course.
-Nanomaterials, for instance.

51
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,001
Are you perhaps familiar
with the nano unit?

52
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,337
Shush.

53
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,806
With the camera rolling,
that wouldn't hurt, actually.

54
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,374
-Zip it. We're shooting here.
-It's ongoing.

55
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,844
Business decisions should be
sustainable and eco-friendly

56
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,979
with virtuous leadership on the rise.

57
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,215
Your task is to devise
an ESG-based product,

58
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,852
"Cool-and-Chic Smart Casual."

59
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,156
The concept has long been promoted
as a dress code in the public sector.

60
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,759
With the summer approaching,
let's promote a lightweight ensemble

61
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,195
to conserve the energy
going into air-conditioning.

62
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,231
-That makes sense.
-It's an eco-friendly campaign.

63
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,832
It's like this. "Mom, turn the AC on."

64
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,968
-"Take off your clothes."
-Exactly.

65
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,703
We'd have to be half-undressed, then.

66
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,907
Our aim is to launch
Cool-and-Chic Smart Casual

67
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,877
all office workers can wear,
including those of the Dora-Group.

68
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,912
You'll hold a presentation
when your styling is done.

69
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,813
Okay.

70
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,350
The ranks will be decided in real-time
by the everyman producers.

71
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,284
Do we use these?

72
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,088
The winner's prize is one billion won.

73
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,056
2ND PLACE: 500 MILLION
3RD PLACE: 200 MILLION

74
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,758
4TH PLACE: 100 MILLION
5TH PLACE: NONE

75
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,627
Let's see.

76
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,961
STARTING THEIR DESIGN

77
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,998
MODEL AND FASHION GURU FOR MEN

78
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,471
Precise measurement is Fashion 101,
my dear fellow designers.

79
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,406
Are you novices in fashion design?

80
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,608
You should come up with a sketch first.

81
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,443
We haven't got all day, have we?

82
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,580
There's no speaking sense
to people who lack the fundamentals.

83
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,017
Seeking fancy designs alone…

84
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,252
-Oh, no.
-…goes against today's mission.

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,820
FASHION BRAND CEO
FANATIC OF LUXURY BRANDS

86
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:12,258
A look created without a vision
won't be competitive in the market.

87
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,930
FALLING OVER

88
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,732
-What's he up to?
-You!

89
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,202
HE HAS ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES…

90
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,736
I see you're all being earnest.

91
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,438
We're taking this very seriously.

92
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,274
SAVE THE PLANET

93
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,211
BY COMING UP WITH SMART LOOKS

94
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,081
TO SECURE THE SHOW'S SURVIVAL

95
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,651
DESIGNING AND CRAFTING
SESSION OVER

96
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,891
You do look like you're siblings.

97
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,528
A STERN-AND-STRICT-LOOKING DUO

98
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,231
Won't Chairman Do
find them too embarrassing?

99
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,833
We're going to be his twin heirs.

100
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,535
Oh, so you've partnered up.

101
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,371
BY THE WAY, WHERE IS JIN-KYUNG?

102
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,473
CRACKS UP

103
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,309
-Hey, your effort shows.
-My goodness.

104
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,645
-It's already worn me down.
-She's become a robot.

105
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,514
It seems you're all ready.

106
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,849
-We're all set.
-Okay.

107
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,919
-Let's begin the presentation.
-Shall we, then?

108
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,487
-Won't you kick us off, Jin-kyung?
-Sure.

109
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,656
Go ahead since your suit
seems to be giving you trouble.

110
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,226
I must tell you how it feels to wear this.

111
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,629
It's as if I were in Siberia.
That's how chilly it is.

112
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,197
It's so chilly.

113
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,398
BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER

114
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,002
First and foremost,
I've utilized a novel material,

115
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,837
namely, bamboo.

116
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,773
As I've said, it's so chilly
that I'm shivering.

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,609
When this steel wool touches the skin,

118
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,344
it really helps in dropping
your body temperature.

119
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,213
Aren't they scratchy, though?

120
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,914
Excuse me? They are rather itchy.

121
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,851
I must admit as much,
but even such a sensation is welcome.

122
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,820
Let's say you feel listless or drowsy
during your work hours.

123
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,857
-The irritation will perk you right up.
-I see.

124
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,193
In a way, it is a feature
that boosts your productivity.

125
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,328
-I have a question.
-Ask away.

126
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,463
Won't the summer heat
warm the steel wool up?

127
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,165
-That's true.
-Metal absorbs heat.

128
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,566
-Considering…
-It's a good point.

129
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,135
The steel wool can absorb heat?

130
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,504
In summer,
they will get hot enough to fry eggs.

131
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,207
-That would be an added bonus.
-How many eggs could we cook on her?

132
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:12,111
Your four limbs would be kept cool,
and you can cook eggs on your torso.

133
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,113
Enjoy a fried egg for lunch
whenever, wherever.

134
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,683
-I bet you can cook rice in bamboo jars.
-Yes, of course.

135
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,786
-Team dinners often feature singing.
-Sure.

136
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,387
Can you give us some beats as well?

137
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,222
How nice. I actually dig the idea.

138
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,024
-Isn't this cool?
-Yeah, it's great.

139
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,927
ONE PERSON TO RULE
ALL TEAM DINNERS

140
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,897
-You brought out the look's unique point.
-I love the idea.

141
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,865
-That was nice.
-Yeah, I like it.

142
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,100
Thank you.

143
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,868
The final pitch was a nice touch.

144
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,440
As for this hat,
I used a torn-up fly screen

145
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,109
and crafted it by hand
every step of the way.

146
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,977
The adornments are also eco-friendly.

147
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:45,878
They're artificial greenery.

148
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,280
Our love is evergreen

149
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,483
You can wear this hat
in a state of full undress.

150
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,386
-Feel free to wear this hat only.
-What?

151
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,621
-Without any clothing?
-Except for the hat, yes.

152
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,924
Shouldn't you worry
about your private parts in the sun?

153
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,527
You're perfectly right.
That is why I prepared this feature.

154
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,563
-When it gets hot…
-Oh, my.

155
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,832
-She's pulling something out.
-I get it now.

156
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,167
So that covers you up.

157
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,502
AN ALL-NEW DRESS

158
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,338
These vines can be found
practically anywhere.

159
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,074
When tied around your waist,
it works as a belt.

160
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,542
It somehow feels racier.

161
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,877
-It's spicy.
-Wear it like so.

162
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,412
A REMEDY FOR MODESTY

163
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,748
-So that's attachable.
-Yes, of course.

164
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,783
ONE QUICK TOUCH,
AND YOU'RE DECENT

165
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,753
Suppose the season changes
and the fall comes around.

166
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,788
-Will the leaves fall?
-They will wither.

167
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,125
-Those act as accents to my look.
-I see.

168
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,560
BEWARE OF THE POLICE
WHEN LEAVES START TO FALL

169
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:38,364
As a person
with a keen interest in fashion…

170
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,734
Your watch doesn't seem appropriate
for an ESG business practice presentation.

171
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,969
SO SHINY, SO FLASHY

172
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,570
That's too much distraction.

173
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:48,241
First off, let me present
the short-sleeved top I upcycled.

174
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,942
I'm wearing it underneath the cardigan.

175
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,311
-Too much yapping.
-He must've drawn pictures himself.

176
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,680
As you can see… Please look.

177
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,282
FAILS TO HOLD IT IN

178
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,719
-It's a rag, plain and simple.
-Oh, no. Look closely.

179
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,287
But the collar hangs too loose.

180
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,256
That's for breathability.

181
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,991
How far does it go?

182
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,727
It can go all the way down.
Don't worry about it.

183
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,130
It keeps me cool enough,
allowing me to tuck in my shirt.

184
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,098
Here's the key feature.

185
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,700
When you get stomach pains
and must take a dump,

186
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,069
you lower down your pants and everything…

187
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,604
-It can be a lot.
-It's a hassle.

188
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,273
-But it's necessary.
-Here's my pitch.

189
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,675
Please don't misunderstand.
I'm merely suggesting an idea.

190
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,910
When I lower my pants…

191
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,212
I'll be ready to relieve myself.

192
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,113
This part here…

193
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,114
AN ABYSMAL CHASM

194
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,182
Well…

195
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,687
-I mean…
-What are you playing at?

196
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,825
That's why I specifically asked you
not to misunderstand me.

197
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,893
-How could we not, though?
-He's right, you.

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,562
Oh, you're wearing a top upside down.

199
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,197
Yes, that's exactly right.

200
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,034
Your arms are supposed to go
through those lower parts, right?

201
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,635
What about it?

202
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,472
I'm not exactly telling others
to flash their private parts around.

203
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,940
How else do we reuse the tank tops?

204
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,375
-Just throw them away!
-I'm only pitching an idea here.

205
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,944
This top can help on other occasions too.

206
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,413
I recently visited a hospital
for a colonoscopy.

207
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,315
You understand how that works, right?

208
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,350
-I can't believe my ears.
-This makes it all hassle-free.

209
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,585
-Jeez.
-Just look.

210
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,020
Isn't this… This doesn't seem appropriate.

211
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,389
I actually prepared one other look.

212
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,657
QUICK TRANSITION
DUE TO CRITICISM

213
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,726
If anyone asks me
to join them for a night out,

214
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,662
I can get changed
and be ready in a few seconds.

215
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,298
IS HIS SECOND LOOK WELL-PREPARED
AND NOT DISGUSTING?

216
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,834
RUSTLE

217
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,704
Can you give me some beats, Jin-kyung?

218
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,308
You can be ready…

219
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,309
in mere seconds.

220
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,611
You can look magnificent, too.

221
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,545
What do you think?

222
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,848
-What's that about?
-I don't actually get it.

223
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,216
What the heck is this?

224
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,785
Chairman Do would be furious.

225
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,154
This isn't the only look I can cover.

226
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,056
-Any cushion at home will do.
-Oh, yeah?

227
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,559
Please pass me one.
I'll get changed in a second.

228
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,728
He's gone out of shape.

229
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,763
He's regained all his lost weight.

230
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,798
CHANGING

231
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,699
-Come in.
-Hey, yo.

232
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,702
-Isn't this fine?
-Seriously, though.

233
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,604
-What on earth?
-Doesn't it look cool?

234
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,639
You're ticking me off.

235
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,474
This is my special getup for a party.

236
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,309
-Excuse me? What sort of party…
-After you clock out…

237
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,844
What kind of party would it be?

238
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,078
It'd be a pool party.

239
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,313
Pool party?

240
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,315
COWERING AT
THE BARRAGE OF CRITICISM

241
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,983
Why are you wearing
a cushion of all things?

242
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,219
It's because cushions are also expendable.

243
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,687
-So you recycled them.
-It's a terrible waste.

244
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,222
You can be bold and use whatever.

245
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,524
-If that's your thing, I could use it.
-Really?

246
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,927
-Are you sure you can make this work?
-Of course.

247
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,895
HE'S GOING TOO FAR
WITH THAT EXTRA-LARGE CUSHION

248
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,864
Nothing is impossible, you know.

249
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,966
HE'S CHOOSING TO PUSH FORWARD…

250
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,436
-Dang, he's being stubborn.
-That won't fly, I'm sure.

251
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,705
-How could it?
-You promised to make it work.

252
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,141
Will this work?

253
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,542
HE MUST TURN THINGS AROUND
SOMEHOW

254
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,244
Give me some more beats, please.

255
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,845
CUE ENTRANCE MUSIC

256
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,014
See? I'm all set.

257
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,183
I'm all set.

258
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,751
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOUR ATTITUDE

259
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,287
IS HE A WAGYU SUSHI OR WHAT?

260
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,322
I'm rocking it, aren't I?

261
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,290
-You are. I'll give you that.
-See?

262
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,792
-There's nothing wrong with this.
-Kudos.

263
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,362
Am I causing discomfort? Anyone?

264
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,597
You know what?

265
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,931
-This is better.
-Agreed.

266
00:09:58,998 --> 00:09:59,832
It's much better.

267
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,534
I can make anything work.

268
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,402
-What about that one?
-Which one?

269
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,837
-The swim ring.
-The swim ring?

270
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,072
-I'll take it.
-For real?

271
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,239
I'll make that work.

272
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,642
I CAN WEAR A SWIM RING
NO PROBLEM

273
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,511
FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT

274
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,614
A GOAT IN TERMS OF EXPANDABILITY

275
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,815
How about this?

276
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,017
Can you try this heater with the power on?

277
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,019
-Prepare to be amazed.
-That won't work, Sae-ho.

278
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,053
You bet it will work.

279
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,154
Okay, I'm ready.

280
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,590
-Are you sure you pulled it off again?
-Sure.

281
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,825
Did he nail it again?

282
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,494
TYING HIS FATE TO THIS ABSURDITY

283
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,129
No trouble at all.

284
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,365
LEARN FROM SAE-HO'S TENACITY
AND DON'T GIVE UP

285
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,800
Okay, I'll give you that.

286
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,669
-That truly works with anything.
-Of course.

287
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,437
I'm amazed, really.

288
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,807
-So you're presenting your ideas together?
-Yes.

289
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,243
-Okay, then.
-You are indeed dressed similarly.

290
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,312
It's pure coincidence, isn't it?

291
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,446
-Yes.
-Right.

292
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,615
BUT THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE

293
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,816
DAY OF THE FIRST SHOOT

294
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,385
My goodness.

295
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,053
I can't believe we got back together.

296
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,254
AFTER THE MOVING REUNION

297
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,823
It was nice to enjoy our chemistry
after the long break.

298
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,794
STILL HIGHLY MOTIVATED
AT THE TEAM DINNER

299
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,397
Let's do our best.

300
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,532
We promise to do our best!

301
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,900
THE LONG-AWAITED REBOOT
FIRED THEM UP

302
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,236
THAT IS WHY THEY WENT
THE EXTRA MILE…

303
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,805
HERE ARE PHOTOS
OF HOW THEY USUALLY DRESS

304
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,607
Mountain.

305
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,541
Sea.

306
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,910
-We're Mountain and Sea.
-We're Mountain and Sea.

307
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,079
"Mountain and Sea," huh?

308
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,048
Looks like they came prepared.

309
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:27,286
We consume and discard
far too many plastic bottles.

310
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,857
Imagine a world
where we fashion an outfit out of them.

311
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,060
The vision inspired me
to prepare this look.

312
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,596
This is the Cool-and-Chic Smart Casual
made with plastic bottles.

313
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,898
Let's say you feel hot mid-stroll.

314
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,433
-Yeah?
-When that happens,

315
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,301
fill a bottle of your choice
with some water.

316
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,236
With cold water, I presume.

317
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,405
My heart happens to beat…

318
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,274
YOUR EFFORT IS COMMENDABLE…

319
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,710
Shall we say my heart beats
at a higher temperature?

320
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,978
Since that's the case,
I'll fill up this bottle near it.

321
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,046
Oh, with cool water.

322
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,616
That would certainly lower
your body temperature there.

323
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,052
-It gets startlingly cool.
-I see.

324
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,587
Why don't you check it out, Sea?

325
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,988
Oh, dang it!

326
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,290
You looked like you got burned.

327
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,492
-It was scorching.
-What on earth?

328
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,960
OFF TO A ROCKY START

329
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,562
-It's supposed to be cold.
-Oh, right.

330
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,097
Yeah, it cools you down.

331
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,231
What's more,

332
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,468
-this look offers another function.
-Sounds great.

333
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,571
You can never foresee the dangers
you may face on your way to work.

334
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,073
That is why this vest also works
as a shock absorber.

335
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,875
-Like a bulletproof vest?
-Exactly.

336
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,345
Do you perhaps remember
Sechs Kies' old choreography

337
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,813
with the technique called "back down"?

338
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,015
I sure do. But it'd be too dangerous.

339
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,118
-I prepared my own rendition.
-Right here and now?

340
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,986
Do you really mean it?

341
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,354
-Don't try it.
-Woo-jae.

342
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,823
-Is this your last shoot or what?
-Be careful.

343
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,892
-Be careful.
-Hold on.

344
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,729
Why don't you squat down
and fall to the back light and easy?

345
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,598
You should move that way.

346
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,533
That won't be enough
to make the show entertaining.

347
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,836
-But it can be dangerous.
-How about you put all the caps back on?

348
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,938
Don't be concerned.

349
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,341
-I'll pull it off.
-You could injure yourself.

350
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,744
-Oh, dear. You could get hurt.
-Try it in a sitting position!

351
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,746
What's up with you, guys?

352
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,282
You could injure your neck.
We don't want you to get hurt.

353
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,217
-Do it while sitting.
-Yeah, squat down first.

354
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,319
TRYING OUT
THE SAFE APPROACH FIRST

355
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,355
-That's it. Try a back roll instead.
-There you go.

356
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,856
-I could've screwed up badly.
-Told you.

357
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,124
So that doesn't work.

358
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,059
You narrowly escaped injury.

359
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,530
IN THE END,
HE IS SQUATTING DOWN…

360
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,298
Why would you insist on trying this?

361
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,733
DETERMINED

362
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,535
TUMBLES OVER

363
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,569
Oh, come on!

364
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,237
Still, that protected his head.

365
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,374
WOW! IT REALLY PROTECTED HIM!

366
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,575
Still, that protected his head.

367
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,044
-So it did.
-It kept his head safe.

368
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,513
UNFORTUNATELY,
ALL IT PROTECTED WAS HIS HEAD…

369
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,081
Turn off the cameras and leave!

370
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,651
What on earth is this? It's so silly.

371
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,719
That plastic bottle looks off.

372
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,021
WOO-JAE MUST TRULY LOVE
SCREWBALLS

373
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,789
Isn't he supposed to be a model?

374
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,425
Let's go home!

375
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,260
The ending was rather weak.

376
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,162
What exactly did he show us?

377
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,864
Hello? Mr. Sea!

378
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,667
Why don't you show us what you prepared?

379
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,935
I am…

380
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,369
DID YOU CALL FOR ME?

381
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,171
WHAT WOULD HE DO NOW?

382
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,074
…not like you, to tell the truth.

383
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,978
I used to live in the deep sea.

384
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm one of the merpeople.

385
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,316
He's come up with a bizarre story.

386
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,517
What happened, then?

387
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,852
Let's see how he recovers.

388
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,919
THE PASSIONATE MERMAN

389
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,654
ENDED UP SELECTING
AN OVER-THE-TOP CONCEPT

390
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,656
Please continue. Who are you?

391
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,757
As I've said,

392
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,493
I'm a merman.

393
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,629
Were you caught in a fishnet?

394
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,631
What's your main source of diet?

395
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,532
Well…

396
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,834
THE QUESTIONS PUT
THE MERMAN ON THE SPOT

397
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,003
It's a secret.

398
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,739
So, who's the fish in the family,
your mother or your father?

399
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,774
I'll fill you in later.

400
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,209
HIS BACKSTORY HAS HOLES

401
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,211
Why are you wearing a net?

402
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,247
Humans…

403
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,548
and their disastrous greed…

404
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,017
polluted the sea,
leaving me in this state.

405
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,052
So I see, dear.

406
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,387
What's your name?

407
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,222
Sea of Sustainability.

408
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,957
HE'S GIVEN HIS CHARACTER
SOME DEPTH

409
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,359
Okay, I'm back.

410
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,560
BYE-BYE, MERMAN
HELLO, DO-OVER

411
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,796
The storytelling earlier was
my artistic take on reality.

412
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,900
That was a prelude I prepared
as a means to deliver the message.

413
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:05,304
Now, this is the real deal.
Let's talk about practical ideas.

414
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,072
I like the vibe of your look.

415
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,410
We wear thermal underwear
to power through the winter, don't we?

416
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,014
Once you've worn it enough times,
it often gets stretched out.

417
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,448
While that can be upsetting,

418
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,084
don't let it get you down.
Here's an idea to cheer you up.

419
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,488
Don't throw out the worn-out items.
Hold on to them until summer.

420
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,592
Then, cut both pant legs twice,
once on the outside, once on the inside.

421
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,994
Create openings with scissors.

422
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,230
-Just like that?
-That way, air can go in and out.

423
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,867
Cut your top along the inner lines too.

424
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,203
Then, you're all set with breezy clothes
great for the hot weather.

425
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,738
-I like the idea.
-Thank you.

426
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,573
As for these pants,

427
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,643
long johns can be tight
and rather uncomfortable to wear.

428
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,912
Modified ones like these
don't give you such discomforts.

429
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,948
You could say… it's a scientific design.

430
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,884
We've introduced ventilation openings.

431
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,918
Nice and breezy.

432
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,520
When the heat gets unbearable,

433
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,422
a moment's rest can easily remedy it.

434
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,726
Sit down and relax for a minute,
and your body will cool down.

435
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,628
-Oh, I get it.
-All right.

436
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,897
Let's suppose you've cooled down enough

437
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,398
and it's gotten too chilly.

438
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,701
Then, get right up and resume your stroll.

439
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,135
What an innovative idea!

440
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,338
If the heat gets to you again, squat down.

441
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,539
Only a moment will do.

442
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,207
-It looks cool and nice.
-It's amazing.

443
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,143
-Keep yourself cool and fit.
-I like the idea.

444
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,213
Your Japanese fans
would be streaming this on Netflix.

445
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,648
-This here is…
-Shorts, right?

446
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:23,816
Yeah, it's safety shorts.

447
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,918
Underneath is my underwear,

448
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,486
and beneath that layer…

449
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,487
are my private parts.

450
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,522
IF THIS IS HOW
YOU'RE PLAYING IT…

451
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,126
I'M CRANKING IT UP A NOTCH TOO

452
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,894
SORRY TO BURDEN YOU
WITH THE DRESS CODE

453
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,496
AND THE COOL-AND-CHIC
SMART CASUAL

454
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,998
I ACTUALLY HAVE MULTIPLE IDEAS

455
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,799
You look so dashing. Oh, my.

456
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,837
HIS ENGINEERING ROOTS SHOW

457
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,272
That's impressive, Woo-jae.

458
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,440
I love it!

459
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,043
That's what I'm talking about. Kudos.

460
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,878
DIDN'T YOU URGE THE OTHERS
TO USE THEIR WORDS?

461
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,980
-Refrain from slapsticks.
-That's a winner.

462
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,117
-That's on another level.
-My goodness.

463
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,985
-This is--
-What lit a fire under you?

464
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,987
He's sacrificing himself for the team.

465
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,122
-That's a winner.
-Hands down.

466
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,123
-Incredible.
-Congrats.

467
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,425
VETERAN MODEL IS
WASTING HIS TALENT

468
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,728
It'd be amazing to carry around
a device like this in the summer.

469
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,064
It could be useful
after a swim at the beach.

470
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,866
Does it interest you,
Sea of Sustainability?

471
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,201
I've avoided going near the sea so far.

472
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,870
But you belong there.

473
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,804
You're a merman.

474
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,140
-You're from the deep sea.
-The ocean is your home.

475
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,207
My kind

476
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,376
can perish if we go without water.

477
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,844
-That's understandable.
-So…

478
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,814
That's why I need to keep

479
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,749
a steady supply at hand.

480
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,551
I feel better now.

481
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,019
Now I finally feel energized.

482
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,456
I need… a supply of water.
I can't go without it.

483
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,225
HE'S MAKING HIS STORY WORK
WITH THAT DEVICE…

484
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,961
I've been dying to stress this.
I need water to survive.

485
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,398
The water is so nice and warm!

486
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,400
IT'S TIME NOW

487
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,869

VOTE CLOSED

499
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,829
I hope you haven't forgotten, guys.
The overall loser of the day…

500
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,498
-They get a penalty next week.
-…gets the costume on our next shoot.

501
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,434
Please remember that I got drenched,
sirs and madams.

502
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,669
That was impressive as hell.

503
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,370
-I took a shower.
-Are all the votes in?

504
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,373
They are indeed all in.
Allow me to announce third place first.

505
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,809
The honorable position goes to…

506
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,844
Seriously, though…

507
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,879
Congratulations, Jin-kyung.

508
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,983
I suppose her idea wasn't all too bad.

509
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,284
Really?

510
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,754
I thought my cushion idea was decent.
But with these two getting soaked…

511
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,090
-Hold on. If she's third place…
-If you think about it…

512
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,326
-And next up…
-This feels like a red flag.

513
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,962
-…is fourth place.
-Maybe I played it too safe.

514
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,897
-The fourth place goes to…
-That can't be me.

515
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,533
Congratulations, Sook.

516
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,503
I'm in fourth place? I'm so grateful!

517
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,271
I can't believe it.

518
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,540
Did I perhaps offend people
with my sofa cushion idea?

519
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,442
-One of these guys placed last?
-Here's the thing.

520
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,277
Woo-young was well-received

521
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,479
-by the everyman producers.
-They went wild for him.

522
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,048
I get the feeling that I placed last.

523
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:10,949
Attention, please.

524
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,885
-Darn it.
-I'll now announce second place.

525
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,819
-Second place, guys.
-Second place?

526
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,154
-Let's hear it.
-Second place?

527
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,823
My story carried an important message.

528
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,824
Congratulations…

529
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,025
Sae-ho.

530
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,027
-…Woo-jae.
-What?

531
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,062
-Have I heard right?
-Is this for real?

532
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,099
My dear everyman producers,
thank you very much.

533
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,934
I've always loved you all.

534
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,470
I'd like to thank our camera crew…

535
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,872
-Hey, Woo-jae.
-…the staff members, Director Park…

536
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,441
-Woo-jae--
-…and the writers. I'm so grateful.

537
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,611
-Being on Netflix changed him so much.
-We could see your effort earlier.

538
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,480
Why is he bowing, all out of the blue?

539
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,515
-What's he doing?
-I have to admit you stood out.

540
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,784
-Just a second.
-You really did.

541
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,119
Hold on a minute. Does this mean

542
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,821
-I could lose to you again?
-I think I'm losing this time.

543
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,358
-This is just… I'm to lose again?
-You were brilliant earlier.

544
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,794
I keep getting pitted against Sae-ho.

545
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,429
One of you won, and the other lost.

546
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,033
I'm certain I placed last here.
Let me break it down for you.

547
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,235
But you went all in, Sae-ho.

548
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,503
That sofa cushion was hilarious.

549
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,538
But Woo-young cracked people up too.

550
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,773
WHAT BEGAN AS A FASHION CONTEST

551
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,141
TURNS OUT TO BE
A COMEDY COMPETITION

552
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,410
-As for the winner…
-But my message…

553
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,213
-…this person received 16 votes.
-Did my message…

554
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,881
-What about the loser?
-The loser

555
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,115
secured one vote.

556
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,817
ONLY 1 VOTE?

557
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,751
Hold on.

558
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,721
Someone got a single vote
after all the stinking trouble?

559
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,558
-I predict Sae-ho's win.
-Oh, no.

560
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,361
Let me tell you
why I believe Woo-young to be the winner.

561
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,897
Sae-ho's idea was very entertaining.

562
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,833
Sae-ho literally had us in stitches.

563
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,936
He should've taken that as his cue
and finished his act there,

564
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:38,837
but he didn't.

565
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,106
-Don't forget the heater.
-It was like a medley.

566
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,809
He kept at it endlessly.

567
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,044
-I did do my best.
-I can't be sure who won.

568
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,713
-But--
-But this guy got soaked.

569
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,184
For what it's worth, let's accept
the results without feeling offended.

570
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,752
Congratulations, Woo-young!

571
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,588
FIRST PLACE, JANG WOO-YOUNG

572
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,291
THAT CUTS DEEP…

573
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,792
I mean…

574
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,262
A MAJOR WIN IN THE COMEDY BATTLE
AFTER A LOSS IN THE DANCE-OFF

575
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,464
Sae-ho got the most people
laughing, didn't he?

576
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,065
The results baffle me too.

577
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,433
Mountain.

578
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,334
Sea.

579
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,570
-We're Mountain and Sea.
-We're Mountain and Sea.

580
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,607
THESE GUYS ASIDE…

581
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,310
It hurts that I lost to the bamboo human.

582
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,147
The bamboo human ranked quite high.

583
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,916
Creating that look was a major pain.
I got countless scratches.

584
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,218
Let me tell you the tallies.

585
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,519
Sae-ho received one vote.

586
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,021
Sook, two votes.

587
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,589
Jin-kyung, three votes.

588
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:35,027
IN THE SAME BALLPARK

589
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,696
It makes sense now.

590
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,465
-It's clicking, all right.
-It's so hilarious.

591
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,667
One more thing.

592
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,702
Even with the loss,
Sae-ho is still in the lead.

593
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,237
-Okay, that's good.
-Oh, right.

594
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,174
If you ask me, my 1.8 billion
might not be enough to win today.

595
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,743
But it should at least save me
from facing the penalty.

596
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,278
CURRENT STANDINGS
SAE-HO, 1.8 BILLION

597
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,247
WOO-YOUNG, 1.6 BILLION
WOO-JAE, 1 BILLION 1 MILLION

598
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,715
SOOK, 600 MILLION
JIN-KYUNG, 500 MILLION

599
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,650
Now, let's move on to the next segment.

600
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,619
-I'm sure you're all hungry.
-Sure!

601
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,121
You'll be given some free time
starting now.

602
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,858
You have one hour to explore
and take advantage of the facilities.

603
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,961
You can either spend your earnings
or increase your assets.

604
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,463
Seriously?

605
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,733
A true chaebol should know
how to put their wealth to good use.

606
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,902
We have a restaurant on-site.

607
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,738
Please enjoy the exquisite delicacies
we have prepared for you.

608
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,373
A RICH SUPPLY
OF SUPPOSED DELICACIES

609
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,508
My only interest is in earning more.

610
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:27,379
A chaebol must have the chutzpah
to make investments for the future.

611
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,248
We have also set up
the Asset Management Chamber.

612
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,720
Please feel free
to flaunt your Midas touch.

613
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,657
We're bound to see
at least one of us going completely broke.

614
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,892
This may be where I lose everything.

615
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,262
Next, the Korean Chaebol
Reputation Institute is also on-site.

616
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,466
An improvement or demerit
to your own or crewmate's reputation

617
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,468
will result in bonuses
or penalties in your assets.

618
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,204
We might end up in the red.

619
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,506
There's one other way.

620
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,475
Some of you may value hard work

621
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,944
and hope to earn money honestly
regardless of the amount.

622
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,045
That's my thing.

623
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,913
You can then try newspaper delivery.

624
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,848
Delivery, huh?

625
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,217
-How much does it pay?
-Fifty million.

626
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,151
They're going big.

627
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,552
I should try that first.

628
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,920
1 DELIVERY EQUALS 50 MILLION

629
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,289
WHAT MAY SEEM LIKE A BREAK

630
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,858
IS IN FACT

631
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,694
A CHANCE OF A LIFETIME
TO TURN THINGS AROUND

632
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,797
SOME ENJOY LUXURIES

633
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,099
SOME TAKE RISKS

634
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,468
SOME TAKE ON HONEST WORK

635
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,937
THEY BICKER,
REGRET THEIR CHOICES

636
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,773
AND SUFFER IN AGONY

637
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,275
AN INTENSE COMPETITION UNFOLDS

638
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,279
WHO WILL HAVE THE LAST LAUGH
IN THIS DOG-EAT-DOG CONTEST?

639
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,449
I have one last announcement.
As long as you're in agreement,

640
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,419
you can yield, donate, or trade
your wealth with others.

641
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,854
Let's have a bite first.

642
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,891
-Yeah, we should do that.
-Let's eat before we lose everything.

643
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,794
-Your break starts now. Please enjoy.
-Okay!

644
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,795
FREE TIME STARTS NOW

645
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,630
This must be the restaurant.

646
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,998
Hello.

647
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,699
Oh, good afternoon.

648
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,635
Right. I won't be having anything.

649
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,036
-So the meal…
-Is this the restaurant?

650
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,571
-I'm skipping lunch.
-…isn't free?

651
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,739
That's right.

652
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,241
Goodness, look at those huge numbers.

653
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,810
Huh? A billion won?

654
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,645
Everything's at half-price.

655
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,079
ALL ITEMS GET 50% OFF

656
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,316
Guys, they've got
Ballantine's 30-year-old here.

657
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,553
-But it costs 15 billion won.
-We won't be drinking it, then.

658
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,455
-Man, this is legit.
-It's worth 15 billion?

659
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,389
ENJOY THE FREE AROMA

660
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,424
How much is pork belly?

661
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,792
Pork belly costs a billion.

662
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,693
A billion?

663
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,229
-I don't have that kind of money.
-Me neither.

664
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,897
I can't afford to get pork belly.

665
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,199
EXTREMELY SHORT ON FUNDS

666
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,334
Can't you get us a little treat?

667
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,837
-How would I afford it?
-Just a drink, Sae-ho.

668
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,872
No, no. I don't have that much money.

669
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,374
Buy us a 500-million dish.
That matches all I have.

670
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,876
-How expensive.
-Same here.

671
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,345
-I'm so hungry.
-Let me take a look around first.

672
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,948
SAE-HO SENSES DANGER
AND TAKES OFF IN A HASTE

673
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,149
Aren't you eating anything?

674
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,153
I'm not exactly at a level
where I'm financially comfortable.

675
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,355
All the bougies are awful.

676
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,425
Margherita costs 500 million won? Damn it.

677
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,496
So this is where the delivery…

678
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,830
What have we got here?

679
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,799
"Human Slot Machine"?

680
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,002
ASSET MANAGEMENT CHAMBER
HUMAN SLOT MACHINE

681
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,571
"Human Slot Machine"?

682
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,875
"Place your bet inside the money box
and hit the 'Go' button

683
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,376
to get the slot machine rolling."

684
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,544
"Press the 'Stop' button…

685
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,346
-Stop.
-…at your discretion."

686
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,515
"You win if the machine presents
three matching fruits."

687
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,950
"When you do,
your bet is returned tenfold"?

688
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,320
SUSPICION IS PLAIN IN HIS GAZE

689
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,389
How many fruits do you each have?

690
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,490
Three.

691
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,525
It's impossible, then.

692
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:30,161
You have three fruits each,
so I'd have to multiply 1/3 three times.

693
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,163
Then, I get 1/27.

694
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,999
-That's impossible.
-It's not impossible.

695
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,500
But it is.

696
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,136
AND YET,
WOO-JAE OVERLOOKED ONE FACT

697
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,340
BECAUSE THERE ARE
3 WINNING CASES,

698
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,242
THE ODDS OF WINNING ARE 1/9

699
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,046
I'm not betting my assets
on a meager 1/27 probability.

700
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,648
-What's more…
-Try your luck just once.

701
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,317
I'm afraid you don't know
my castmates all that well.

702
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,653
We don't have a bold gambler among us.

703
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,954
The three of you

704
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,822
can rest up and go home.

705
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,558
-I suggest that you…
-Stop.

706
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,394
I see our horses.

707
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,529
Is this the place, then? Okay.

708
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,830
"Human Slot Machine"?

709
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,466
WOO-YOUNG ALSO TAKES AN INTEREST
IN THE HUMAN SLOT MACHINE

710
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,769
Give it a go, Woo-young.

711
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:11,836
Ten times the amount, huh?

712
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,038
The odds aren't so bad.

713
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,172
That's impossible.

714
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,475
-A 50-million bet can yield 500 million.
-You'd earn as much.

715
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,010
As I said, the odds aren't so bad.

716
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,345
AFTER ENTICING WOO-YOUNG,

717
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,813
WOO-JAE CONTEMPLATES

718
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,516
Okay. I'm going to earn 200 million first.

719
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,286
I'll use that for games,
leaving my original asset intact.

720
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,721
RULE #1 OF INVESTMENT
KEEP YOUR PRINCIPAL

721
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,089
SEEKS WORK TO AFFORD PORK BELLY

722
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,857
"Start from the distribution center."

723
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,860
"Deliver the newspaper
to the conference room on horseback."

724
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,095
TRAVEL FROM
THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER

725
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,296
TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM
ON HORSEBACK

726
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,498
YOU MUST THROW THE PAPER INTO
THE CART TO GET YOUR PAYCHECK

727
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,734
I'm giving this a go.

728
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,869
-I'd like to deliver an issue too.
-Go ahead.

729
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,305
All my bills are over 100 million.

730
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,807
PART-TIMERS DEPART FOR DELIVERY

731
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,942
Gee, this is too much for me.

732
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,410
Damn it!

733
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,280
SNICKERS

734
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,449
PICKING UP SPEED

735
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,185
-Coming through.
-How are you so good at this?

736
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,252
SHE'S OUTRUN AGAIN

737
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,654
We've got a long way to go.

738
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,055
AN ENDLESS CORRIDOR

739
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,257
I can't take this. Oh, dear.

740
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,926
HOW FAR DO I HAVE TO GO?

741
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,029
Oh, man. There's no way
I can repeat this again and again.

742
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,698
I'm too exhausted to continue.

743
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,133
FINALLY REACHES HIS DESTINATION

744
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,601
I'm a wreck, damn it!

745
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,237
TARGET POINT

746
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,640
FOLDING IT
SO IT WOULD LAND IN THE CART

747
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:23,875
Goal!

748
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,510
IT WENT IN

749
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,613
You have to return your horse first.
Once you do that…

750
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,016
THEY WILL ONLY BE PAID WHEN
THEY HAVE RETURNED THEIR RIDES

751
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,484
IN OTHER WORDS…

752
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,419
I can't manage this!

753
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,354
HE HAS TO TRAVEL BACK
DOWN THIS CORRIDOR

754
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,824
This is freaking exhausting!

755
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,927
SEBASTIAN IS STILL ON HER WAY

756
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,330
YOU RARELY CATCH THIS EXPRESSION
ON VARIETY SHOWS

757
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,234
Jin-kyung. We have to make
a return journey to get paid.

758
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,503
There's an extra challenge
of throwing the paper into the cart.

759
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,404
Did you succeed?

760
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,505
Yeah, I did.

761
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,240
My gosh, this is getting tiresome.

762
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,909
Look, the important thing
is that we have to go back on horseback.

763
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,679
CRY-LAUGHING

764
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,481
-Jin-kyung, I'm telling you…
-I'm drained already.

765
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,183
…that we must make the return journey.

766
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,586
My thighs are burning.

767
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,888
HARD LABOR IS MAKING THEM WEEP

768
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,123
IF WE HAD WANTED
TO GIVE YOU AN EASY TASK,

769
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,491
WE WOULD'VE MADE YOU READ PAPERS

770
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,995
This is totally worth 200 million,
not a measly 50 million!

771
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,663
LOSING HER MIND

772
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,198
I'm so tired.

773
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,232
MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES

774
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,668
WHY WORK SO HARD
TO EARN CHUMP CHANGE

775
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,071
WHEN YOU COULD TRY YOUR LUCK
AND EARN A FORTUNE?

776
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,939
Test your luck.

777
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,675
So this is why you came to the set today.

778
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,745
WRITERS OF THE SHOW
ARE SIDE-HUSTLING

779
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,281
So, I win 500 million with 50 million
if I get three matching fruits?

780
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,049
NODDING IN ASSENT

781
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,385
A BOLD INVESTMENT
OF 50 MILLION WON

782
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,120
Go!

783
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:44,689
Go!

784
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,791
THEIR ARMS GO SPINNING
RIGHT ON CUE

785
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,595
Gosh, how adorable.

786
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,263
ROUND AND ROUND THEY GO

787
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,065
Stop!

788
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,902
TOO BAD

789
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:01,873
You're so mean.

790
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,877
Are you sure you have a lemon? Show me.

791
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,379
WE DON'T PLAY CHEAP TRICKS HERE

792
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,115
50 MILLION WENT LOST

793
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,816
Man, just one minute ago…

794
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,986
AFTER ALL THE GREAT TROUBLES
I ENDURED TO EARN THAT MONEY…

795
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:16,955
I want one more round.

796
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,857
I want one more round.

797
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,259
BETS ANOTHER 50 MILLION

798
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,161
-Go.
-Go!

799
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:27,465
Stop!

800
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,736
PRETENDING TO BE UPSET SFX

801
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,206
BARELY KEEPING A STRAIGHT FACE

802
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,877
My 100 million went down the drain.
It's such a shame.

803
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,779
This game here…

804
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,914
drives you out of your mind.

805
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,750
ENTRANCED,
HE PLACES HIS THIRD BET

806
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,485
I hope I don't lose all my money here.

807
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,386
-Let's do this.
-Go!

808
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,622
Oh, please. Give me one win here.

809
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,524
I'm begging you.

810
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,292
Stop! Oh, please…

811
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,029
3 CONSECUTIVE LOSSES

812
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,399
THE PART-TIME DELIVERY BOY
RETURNS FROM A TRIP TO HELL

813
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,602
One last time.

814
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,806
HERE'S A MAN WHO CHOOSES
TO WALK INTO THE HELLFIRE

815
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,740
Go.

816
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,175
SPINNING FOR THE 4TH TIME

817
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,377
Come on. Please take pity on me.

818
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,012
HIS LOSS COULD REACH 200 MILLION

819
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,547
Stop! Oh, please…

820
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,315
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

821
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,519
Oh, dear. You poor thing.

822
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,754
That ate up 200 million.

823
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,725
A SPLIT-SECOND'S DECISION
COST HIM 200 MILLION

824
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,061
THEN COMES A VOICE OF SALVATION

825
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,863
Dude, go deliver the newspaper.

826
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,264
-It's not too bad.
-Did you succeed?

827
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,533
WOO-JAE EARNS 50 MILLION
FROM DELIVERY

828
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,903
-You can earn 50 million, right?
-Yeah.

829
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,005
ON HIS WAY TO WIN 50 MILLION
AFTER LOSING 200 MILLION

830
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,373
Man, my 200 million…

831
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,677
What's taking Jin-kyung so long anyway?

832
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,579
IT'S NOT LIKE
I DIDN'T WANT TO RETURN

833
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,613
I MERELY COULDN'T

834
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,248
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S HAD
A SCREW LOOSE

835
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,150
Did you succeed, Jin-kyung?

836
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,384
Yeah.

837
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,088
JIN-KYUNG ALSO HAD A SUCCESS

838
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,157
-You really did it?
-Gosh, I'm worn out.

839
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,758
That means you earned 50 million.

840
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,462
I can only collect once I return,
but I'm too exhausted to get there.

841
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,566
THAT REMINDS HIM
OF HIS THIGH PAINS

842
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,001
IS SHE CRYING
OR IS SHE LAUGHING?

843
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,871
-I'm beat!
-Oh, man. My thighs.

844
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:16,207
I might just keel over. Did they have to
make such a challenging task?

845
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,611
How on earth do I get back
to the starting point?

846
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,579
Man, this is crazy.

847
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,181
Dang. My precious 200 million.

848
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,450
HE MUST COMPLETE THE TASK
4 TIMES

849
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,818
I'm worn out.

850
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,419
TO MAKE UP FOR HIS LOSSES

851
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,689
THE BUSY WORKER BEE
REACHED HIS DESTINATION

852
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:32,857
Here's your delivery.

853
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,494
ANOTHER BUST

854
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,632
TO THINK IT WAS ALL IN VAIN…

855
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,033
My thighs are about to burst.

856
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,802
ONLY PAIN ACCOMPANIES HIM
ON HIS WAY BACK

857
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,538
WOO-JAE HAS MANAGED TO SECURE
50 MILLION

858
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,873
The pancake looks so good.

859
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,210
A SUSPICIOUS CHEF
HAS BEEN TRYING SELF-PROMOTING

860
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,878
Swing by my pancake joint.

861
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,880
Welcome.

862
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,315
"Culinary Guessing Wars."

863
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,684
INCREDIBLE TECHNIQUE

864
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,053
MASTER OF SKILLET
WITH 30-YEAR EXPERIENCE

865
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,789
THIS IS ACTUALLY
OUR LIGHTING DIRECTOR

866
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,593
"A black-and-white pancake
will be flipped again and again."

867
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,861
GUESS THE COLOR
AND DOUBLE YOUR POT

868
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,363
Basically, it's a 50-50 game.

869
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,466
If you win, you can double your bet.

870
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,002
Here's the thing.

871
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,038
I think I learned my lesson.

872
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,607
I barely made it out alive
from that newspaper delivery,

873
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,509
and I don't think I can bet on that.
What do I do?

874
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,211
Oh, man. It took so much hard work.

875
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,681
HE TRADED HIS THIGHS
FOR 50 MILLION WON

876
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,284
Mark my words.
I can't go on another delivery.

877
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,987
There's no repeating that.
My thighs are done for the day.

878
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,488
AS HIS CONTEMPLATION
GETS PROLONGED…

879
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,391
I'll make the game nice and easy
for my first patron.

880
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,827
-Okay, I'll make my bet.
-All right.

881
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,495
Don't tell others about our arrangement.

882
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,830
-Nice and neat, right?
-Sure.

883
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:46,898
Here's my 50 million.

884
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,566
BETS HIS ENTIRE REWARD

885
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,834
Fifty million, right?

886
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,336
COOKING SHOW BEGINS

887
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,837
HURRAH

888
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,840
WATCH OUT FOR THE PANCAKE

889
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,643
-He's terrible at this.
-Give me a minute.

890
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,045
Are you sure you've got this?

891
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,580
IN THAT CASE…

892
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,717
Oh, come on.

893
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,187
Pancake, pancake.

894
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,955
FULLY COOKED UNDERNEATH THE DESK

895
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,458
It's a 50-50 guessing game.

896
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,793
THIS 50% CHOICE

897
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,030
DECIDES WHAT IS TO HAPPEN
TO HIS HARD-EARNED PAYMENT

898
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,231
Black.

899
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,300
-I'm betting on it being black.
-Okay.

900
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,769
-I'll give you a chance to reconsider.
-I won't use it.

901
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,805
Remember that I promised
to make it easy for you.

902
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,140
I'm still not changing my answer.

903
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,975
-Knowing you, I--
-Black, it is.

904
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:31,943
-Woo-jae.
-Yes?

905
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
Open the lid.

906
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,313
JUST A SECOND…

907
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,281
Should I have changed my answer?

908
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,852
Is this a mind game or what?

909
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,120
WHEEZE

910
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,956
SHE'S AT A CROSSROADS
BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH

911
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,424
ARE YOU EXHAUSTED?

912
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,593
YES

913
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,263
Wait, Director.

914
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,298
You don't know
what I had to endure to earn that!

915
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,368
YOU WENT THROUGH
THE SAME TROUBLES AS HER

916
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,370
SHORT OF BREATH

917
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,406
Finally!

918
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,306
EARNS 50 MILLION

919
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,212
Do you trust your pancake or me?

920
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,716
I TRUST THE COUCH

921
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,084
I'll give you ten seconds.

922
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,986
-I'll go with white.
-White pancake, correct?

923
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,289
Here we go. Three, two, one.

924
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,458
WHITE PANCAKE, SUCCESS

925
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,262
Thank you so much.

926
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,396
Congratulations.

927
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,366
-I'll take 10 bills of 10 million.
-Here you go.

928
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,134
HIS TACT EARNED HIM 100 MILLION

929
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,404
What is this place? Let me see.

930
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,740
"Chaebol Reputation Institute."

931
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,308
You will find a menu with questions.

932
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,476
QUESTIONS THAT SLANDER CHAEBOLS

933
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,044
Select one of the questions first.

934
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,280
Then, call one of your acquaintances

935
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,783
and ask them to rank your castmates
from first place to last place.

936
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,654
The person who is ranked first
will be docked 500 million won.

937
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,422
The person who is ranked fifth

938
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,558
will gain 500 million won.

939
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,959
Let's call Shin Gi-ru.

940
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,727
-I like the idea.
-I'm calling her now.

941
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:00,598
How's this? "Who do you think
you can beat in a fight?"

942
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,333
-Ask Gi-ru that.
-She'll put you on top.

943
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,801
-Hey, Gi-ru.
-I'm here.

944
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,771
-I have one quick question to ask.
-Fire away.

945
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,407
Let's say you have to fight my castmates.

946
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,044
Can you rank them by the order
of your likelihood of winning?

947
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,413
-Think of my old team on Beat Coin.
-Oh, I see.

948
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,748
I'll be honest with you. As for Woo-jae…

949
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,618
I think I'll be able to
knock him over easily.

950
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,753
DISGRACEFUL EXIT

951
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,990
-As for second place…
-Who is it?

952
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,425
Well, I'll go with Jin-kyung.

953
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,326
Jin-kyung?

954
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,994
SHE WOULD ALSO BE KO'D
IN 3 SECONDS

955
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,396
-I'm going to put you in third place.
-Oh, okay.

956
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,298
I know you can be a bulldog.

957
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,501
-The remaining spots are the issue.
-Yeah?

958
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,003
Still, I'll put Sae-ho in fourth place.

959
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,904
OH, NO

960
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,305
500 MILLION VANISHES
BEFORE HIS EYES

961
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,841
As for Woo-young, he's a dancer.
He's a martial artist of sorts.

962
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,009
-He can be fast.
-Exactly.

963
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,945
He might have some aces up his sleeve.
That's why he gets fifth place.

964
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,480
Thank you very much.

965
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,648
No worries. Good luck, Sook.

966
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,483
-Thanks, Gi-ru.
-It was my pleasure.

967
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,419
I was so close to winning. Dang it.

968
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,221
-I can't believe it!
-Hey.

969
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,390
Think about the money Woo-jae lost.

970
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,992
MISFORTUNE OF OTHERS
GIVES THEM MORE JOY

971
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,093
THAN THEIR OWN GOOD FORTUNE

972
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,962
-I suppose we should keep it a secret.
-Damn straight.

973
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,598
GRINNING, THEY ENTER
THE ASSET MANAGEMENT CHAMBER

974
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,934
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

975
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,968
What have we got here?

976
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,803
THIS IS NEW FOR SAE-HO AND SOOK

977
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,071
Here's your 50 million.

978
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,374
CLUELESS ABOUT
HIS 500-MILLION-WON LOSS

979
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,310
I suggest you work your ass off.

980
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,444
NOT LISTENING

981
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,047
DOUBLED HIS EARNINGS
FROM THE DELIVERY GIG

982
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:24,682
-What's this station?
-Hey, Director.

983
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,217
-Hello!
-Director.

984
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,653
-Is this a 50%-chance guessing game?
-Yes.

985
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,620
This seems quite fair.

986
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,722
-Let's do a delivery first, Sook.
-Yeah?

987
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,991
Let's play the game
with the pay from the gig.

988
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,427
Can I just take one?

989
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,962
JUST WHEN THEY'RE
ABOUT TO DEPART…

990
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,096
You're Jong-ho, right?

991
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,598
Thanks for your vote.

992
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,732
KIM JONG-HO, PRODUCER

993
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,167
I can't believe no one else did.

994
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,235
That's actually rough.

995
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,504
OFF TO DELIVER THE NEWSPAPER
AFTER A SHORT GREETING

996
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,705
Where's the delivery point?

997
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,273
-Way back across the corridor.
-Where?

998
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,211
-How's the pancake game?
-Congrats, dude.

999
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,846
-You earned 500 million.
-Seriously?

1000
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,982
Yeah, I swear I'm telling the truth.

1001
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,617
There's no reason why you wouldn't.

1002
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,118
Even so, I mean it.

1003
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,253
-For real?
-Sure.

1004
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,590
THEY PART WAYS AFTER
EXCHANGING VALUABLE INFORMATION

1005
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,858
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WON 500 MILLION WON…

1006
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,195
WHAT SHOULD I DO
WITH THE WINDFALL?

1007
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,097
I see you're back again.

1008
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:17,969
I'm not a fan of gambling,
but this game gets to you.

1009
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,172
DR. OH IS ON AN ERRAND

1010
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,506
Gosh, why is this so rough?

1011
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,509
Newspaper delivery.

1012
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,212
Can you give me directions?
Oh, that way?

1013
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,649
IT TURNS OUT SHE SET OFF
WITHOUT CHECKING THE DESTINATION

1014
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,218
BARELY REACHES THE DESTINATION

1015
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,490
SHE CAN'T AFFORD PORK BELLY
AT THE MOMENT

1016
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,093
SHE MUST SUCCEED TO HAVE SOME

1017
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,332
Don't forget to return your horse.

1018
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,134
NEXT UP IS SAE-HO

1019
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,403
SUCCESS

1020
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,471
I earned 50 million!

1021
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,606
You can collect it
when you return your ride.

1022
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,875
Dang it. This is so frustrating.

1023
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,710
I failed the damn challenge.

1024
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,513
Oh, man.

1025
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,548
-I don't think I can keep doing this.
-I'm exhausted.

1026
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,350
But I might suck it up if I'm all out.

1027
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,055
-I don't think I can do this again.
-Wasn't this fun earlier?

1028
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,323
Why does it hurt so much now?

1029
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,493
EVEN A FUN GAME GIVES YOU PAIN
THE MOMENT MONEY GETS INVOLVED

1030
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,661
Here goes.

1031
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,529
HE'S BETTING
HIS 50-MILLION DELIVERY FEE

1032
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,364
I'm begging here. Please help me out…

1033
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,934
IF HE WINS,
HE EARNS 500 MILLION WON

1034
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,170
If I hit the jackpot this time,

1035
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,272
I won't return to you, not ever.

1036
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,641
I can promise you that.
Help me win just this once.

1037
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,376
Go!

1038
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,447
CONCENTRATING
THE UNIVERSE'S ENERGY…

1039
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,749
Stop!

1040
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,750
GULP

1041
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,285
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

1042
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,587
ANOTHER LOSS!

1043
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,489
TOUGH LUCK

1044
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,226
TOTAL LOSS OF 250 MILLION

1045
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,497
THE WORLD HAS TURNED AGAINST ME

1046
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,966
AN EMOTIONAL TURMOIL HITS HIM

1047
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,469
TO BECOME THE HEIR,

1048
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,970
ONE MUST GO BIG OR GO HOME

1049
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:00,905
Go!

1050
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,878
HE HAS STAYED
AHEAD OF OTHERS SO FAR

1051
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,313
Congratulations, Woo-young!

1052
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,250
HE REFUSES TO GO DOWN LIKE THIS

1053
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:14,685
Stop.

1054
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,389
LET ME TRY ONE MORE TIME

1055
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,057
HE-HE-HE

1056
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,059
MADNESS IN HIS EYES

1057
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,528
ANOTHER LOSS

1058
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:25,730
Hey, let me take a turn.

1059
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:27,898
Stop.

1060
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,234
YOU LOST AGAIN

1061
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,669
IT'S SAE-HO'S TURN THIS TIME

1062
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,670
Go!

1063
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:34,972
Stop.

1064
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,244
ANGELS OF GENEROSITY

1065
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,345
Go!

1066
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,580
THEIR WORK-REST RATIO IS RUINED

1067
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,714
Stop.

1068
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,584
IT'S ANOTHER LOSS, NO DOUBT

1069
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,285
SAE-HO GIVES UP

1070
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,320
Do your jobs properly.

1071
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,588
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON US

1072
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,622
Go!

1073
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,525
Allow me one victory.

1074
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,794
I WON'T RETURN ONCE I'VE
RECOVERED MY LOST MONEY

1075
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,895
-Stop.
-Oh, pretty please…

1076
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:03,868
TOTAL LOSS OF 300 MILLION

1077
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,836
This is killing me. Oh, man…

1078
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,104
I should never dabble in gambling.

1079
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,172
CHAEBOL REPUTATION INSTITUTE

1080
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,874
Here's my word of advice.

1081
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,909
-Go work your ass off.
-Why?

1082
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,513
Sook and I had a field day here earlier.

1083
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,548
As if. I was around and didn't see you.

1084
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,283
See for yourself later
if you don't believe me.

1085
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,584
-You're not lying?
-No.

1086
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,753
That means anything
could've happened to my money.

1087
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,189
A COMPANY'S VALUE
HINGES ON ITS CEO'S IMAGE

1088
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,458
THIS ROOM IS ACTUALLY
THE SCARIEST OF ALL

1089
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,526
I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH

1090
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,195
If I ask my mom to rank the team
based on their compatibility with Chanel,

1091
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,464
she might give me a leg up, right?

1092
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,066
CALLING HIS MOTHER
WITH HIGH HOPES

1093
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,335
Hello?

1094
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,737
-Mother.
-Hi.

1095
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,673
I'm on shoot at the moment.
Can you spare me a few minutes?

1096
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,641
Oh, sure.

1097
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,242
Woo-jae and Jin-kyung are with me.

1098
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,678
-Hello, ma'am. This is Woo-jae.
-Hello, ma'am.

1099
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,146
-Mom.
-What's up?

1100
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,347
Here's a simple question.

1101
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:54,351
Select one of my castmates
who is most ill-suited to promote Chanel.

1102
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:57,188
I'm not really big on such things.

1103
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,088
Ask your gut.

1104
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:01,859
Rank my castmates starting from the one
who'd be the worst at promoting Chanel.

1105
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,528
PLEASE LET HER NAME WOO-JAE…

1106
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,630
-You, Sae-ho.
-What was that?

1107
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,065
I'm placing you on top.

1108
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,567
-500 MILLION

1109
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,001
MOST UNSUITED
TO BE CHANEL'S AMBASSADOR

1110
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:11,936
1ST: SAE-HO

1111
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,472
CRACKING UP

1112
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,474
Did you say first place?

1113
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,808
-I said you're the worst fit.
-Wait--

1114
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,176
She thinks you're the least suitable.

1115
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,679
Am I really the most unsuited member
of the bunch?

1116
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,280
-Yes, you are.
-Oh, I see.

1117
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,382
And? Who's next?

1118
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,054
Who do you think would be
the best to promote Chanel, ma'am?

1119
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,956
-Someone who'd be the best?
-Yes, ma'am.

1120
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,123
In that case…

1121
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,558
I happen to be a model, ma'am.

1122
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,060
Ma'am, hello.

1123
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,428
DEEP IN THOUGHT

1124
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,129
-Please speak freely, ma'am.
-One moment.

1125
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,432
Please do, ma'am.
You can take your time.

1126
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,034
I'm in trouble.
You want me to name someone?

1127
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,070
WHO WILL WIN 500 MILLION?

1128
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,672
One of your members… Sook would do nicely.

1129
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,808
-Who was that?
-Sook, Kim Sook.

1130
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:51,909
ME, MA'AM?

1131
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,845
So, you're placing her in fifth place?

1132
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,547
I think she'd look wonderful in Chanel.

1133
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,148
-I get what you mean.
-Okay.

1134
00:41:58,215 --> 00:41:59,483
Thank you.

1135
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,885
Thank you, ma'am.

1136
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,553
-No problem. Have a good one.
-I love you.

1137
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,488
-I love you too.
-Thanks again.

1138
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,323
Oh, man.

1139
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,459
My mom cost me 500 million.

1140
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,762
JIN-KYUNG CALLS SOMEONE
WITHOUT HESITATION

1141
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,331
-Hello?
-Hey, La-el.

1142
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,368
-Hi there.
-Can you rank my castmates on Screwballs

1143
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,337
from the person most likely to pee
while in the shower?

1144
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,672
On what show now?

1145
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,974
Out of my colleagues on Screwballs.

1146
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,877
Who do you think is
most likely to pee in the shower?

1147
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,014
Who would pee the most
while they're washing themselves?

1148
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,448
I don't know who your castmates are.

1149
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,618
CRACKS UP

1150
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,988
-La-el--
-Hi, La-el. This is Woo-jae.

1151
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,223
Oh, wow.

1152
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,992
-We have Sook…
-I'm here too, La-el.

1153
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,129
…your mom, Sae-ho,

1154
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,465
me, and Woo-young.

1155
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,234
-It's the five of us.
-Woo-young.

1156
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,635
HE-HE-HE

1157
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,337
-The most likely to…
-Then…

1158
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,540
who among us seems least likely to pee?

1159
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,142
You, Woo-jae.

1160
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,310
SWEET

1161
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,611
Thanks.

1162
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,513
-La-el.
-Yeah?

1163
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,682
You think Woo-young would pee the most?

1164
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,984
-Yeah.
-I'm sending you a bag, La-el.

1165
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,187
Tell me. Why do you think
Woo-jae would pee the least?

1166
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,657
He's too thin to hold much liquid in.

1167
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,160
CRESTFALLEN

1168
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,928

1169
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,631
-Got it. Thanks.
-No problem.

SECURES TEAR-SOAKED 500 MILLION

1171
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,070
NEXT UP IS WOO-JAE

1172
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,272
-Hello?
-Hi, ORBIT.

1173
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,375
-I'm going to ask you a question.
-Okay, ask away.

1174
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,812
Don't put much thought into it.
You only need to rank these people.

1175
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,548
-Please rank my colleagues…
-Okay.

1176
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:41,652
…in terms of their unsuitability
to the post of the president.

1177
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,653
The president?

1178
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,689
Start from the person
who seems most unsuited to be one.

1179
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,759
Fifth place being the most suitable,
and first place being the least suitable.

1180
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,061
-So, in the order of unsuitability?
-Exactly.

1181
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,597
-Let me lead with Jin-kyung.
-Damn it.

1182
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,499
ELATED

1183
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,671
-Why are they always dunking on me?
-Who'd be most suited to the role?

1184
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,473
-I'll give you the whole list.
-Okay.

1185
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,941
I'm done for.

1186
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:06,977
-Jin-kyung, Sae-ho…
-Dang.

1187
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,178
…Sook,

1188
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,080
Who's next?

1189
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,583
-Woo-young, and you, Woo-jae.
-All right!

1190
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,519
-What the? I'm disappointed in you, ORBIT.
-Thanks, ORBIT.

1191
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:16,987
Why do they always pick on me?

1192
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,189
May I ask the reasons
behind your assessment?

1193
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,426
The position of the president…

1194
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,061
requires various qualities.

1195
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,729
-Like an all-rounder.
-Exactly.

1196
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,333
That's why I lead with someone
who has had business successes.

1197
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,668
Namely, Jin-kyung.

1198
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,103
-That means I'm the most suitable, no?
-Excuse me?

1199
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,005
Am I not most suited to the job?

1200
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,206
You're my top candidate.

1201
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,076
-I asked you to rank on unsuitability.
-The unfitness.

1202
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,045
I did rank on unsuitability.

1203
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,279
I started from last place.

1204
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:46,984
-In that case, it's all switched up!
-That puts Woo-jae in first place.

1205
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,986
-Our places were swapped!
-No, that's not true.

1206
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,722
-He said I was his top candidate!
-It doesn't work like that.

1207
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,190
-Come on.
-Give me the phone.

1208
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:56,360
HAND OVER THAT PHONE
AND THE 500 MILLION, YOU RASCAL

1209
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,929
-We need a ruling from a judge.
-Excuse me, ORBIT.

1210
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,664
-Get Director Park here.
-Hey, ORBIT.

1211
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,666
-This is Sae-ho.
-Hi, Sae-ho.

1212
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:06,704
Based on your assessment
of how unfit we are to be the president,

1213
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:11,075
you put Woo-jae in first place
and Jin-kyung in fifth place, correct?

1214
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,843
-Yes, that's exactly it.
-There we have it.

1215
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,244
-Not at all.
-It's all sorted now.

1216
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,781
-I explained the question in detail.
-It's all cleared up. We're good.

1217
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,650
JIN-KYUNG WINS 500 MILLION

1218
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,518
WOO-JAE LOSES 500 MILLION

1219
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:22,886
I'm so hungry.

1220
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,488
SOOK IS BATTLING WITH HUNGER

1221
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,523
But I can't afford anything.

1222
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,526
He must be still playing
with the slot machine.

1223
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:30,761
CORRECT

1224
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,563
WHAT HAPPENED
TO NOT DABBLING IN GAMBLING?

1225
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,531
SOMEONE IS KEEPING THEM
VERY BUSY

1226
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,901
IN TIRED VOICES

1227
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,503
What's up with your voices?

1228
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,938
HA-HA

1229
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,306
HE-HE-HE

1230
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,574
IT'S ON YOU, DUDE

1231
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,142
STILL, LET'S TRY AGAIN

1232
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,243
Go!

1233
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:50,614
YET ANOTHER LOSS

1234
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,349
Oh, no. Dang it.

1235
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,951
GIVE IT A REST ALREADY

1236
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,353
A DEEP SIGH

1237
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,422
A RINGING WAIL

1238
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,492
THE AFTERMATH OF BOLD INVESTMENT

1239
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,761
BURST INTO LAUGHTER

1240
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,230
HERE'S YOUR COLLEAGUE
IN A RARE, WRETCHED STATE…

1241
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,998
The threshold is too high for me.

1242
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,870
Let's say I play 10 rounds
betting 100 million in each round.

1243
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:16,073
I stand to gain if only I could win once.

1244
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,842
I bet Woo-young banked on that too,
but he ended up losing everything.

1245
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,482
Can you give me a demonstration
without a bet?

1246
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,717
Go!

1247
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,552
HERE'S A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE
FOR YOU

1248
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,154
Stop.

1249
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,625
-Oh, yeah!
-Hold on.

1250
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,593
THERE IT IS, THE JACKPOT

1251
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,162
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

1252
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:42,232
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
LET'S CELEBRATE

1253
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,568
You've got to be joking.

1254
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,240
A CAST MEMBER IS HUSTLING
FOR SOME REASON

1255
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,410
Forty-three, forty-four…

1256
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,980
I'll now announce the winner.
Congratulations, you're the chaebol heir!
