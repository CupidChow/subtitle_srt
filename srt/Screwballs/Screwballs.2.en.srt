1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,835
KILLER

2
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,803
Now, here we are at the Killer Boot Camp.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,673
We even put up a sign behind you.

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,377
BOOT CAMP FOR KILLER RECRUITS 2025

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,245
How pathetic.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,680
THE LACK OF FUNDS SHOWS

7
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:14,948
It does look silly.

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,850
-Boot Camp for Killer Recruits 2025.
-It's been a while.

9
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,519
Shouldn't we get a code name?

10
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,388
It doesn't have to be fancy.

11
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,757
I'll go with Sniper Cho,
mixing my name with the word sniper.

12
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,859
-That's just an example.
-That sounds great.

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,594
I'll go ahead with Young-hee.

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,895
That's chilling.

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,597
That actually sounds scary.

16
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,399
Make one up for me.

17
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,035
-How does Sook-wreck sound?
-I'll go with that.

18
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,070
-You're okay with it?
-Yeah.

19
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,773
HER CODE NAME FITS HER PERFECTLY
AS IF IT WERE HER GIVEN NAME

20
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:40,740
NAMING GENIUS

21
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:41,741
We have to hand it to Sae-ho.

22
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,643
-We'll call him the Fly Killer.
-All right.

23
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,779
I'll go with Fly Killer.

24
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,081
Call me Knife-foot.

25
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,753
Let's add a backstory
where I stab people with my foot.

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,754
I like it.

27
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,125
New recruits, do you remember
the third item on your code of conduct?

28
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,295
Code number three. Killers never waver.

29
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,664
-I told you they'd give us water guns.
-You did.

30
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,401
You'll find items
that are familiar to killers.

31
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,404
You'll take turns to become a target.

32
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,607
The designated target
will hold a whistle between their lips

33
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,678
while holding up the water gun
and maintaining composure.

34
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,380
The others have three minutes

35
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:24,284
to shake the target up
with whatever means necessary.

36
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,755
Should the target fail to stay composed
and end up blowing the whistle,

37
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,625
the others can attack them
with the water guns.

38
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,828
We have prepared a magnificent prize

39
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,297
-for whoever claims first place.
-It's going to be mine.

40
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,632
What is it? Can you not tell us now?

41
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,000
I can share this much.

42
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,169
It signifies our move to Netflix.

43
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,572
-That's amazing.
-Netflix offers top-quality souvenirs.

44
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,141
Let's now decide on the order.

45
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,943
-Kick us off, Fly Killer.
-I'll go first.

46
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,244
-All right, then.
-Go ahead.

47
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,145
FIRST TARGET IS YOUNG-HEE

48
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,680
Is the water cold?

49
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,948
No, it's warm.

50
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,716
So there's warm water inside?

51
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,852
WHERE IS HE GOING?

52
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,356
I'm cooling it down.
It's below zero degrees Celsius outside.

53
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,692
Come on. Why would you do that?

54
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:06,993
Unbelievable.

55
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,695
I wondered what he was up to.

56
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,063
Me too.

57
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,099
It takes too long
to cool down a full tank.

58
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,637
Let me check how big of a laugh
will get the whistle to go off.

59
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,973
How's this?

60
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,040
Is this unacceptable?

61
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,475
Yes, that counts as it being blown.

62
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,812
Even a tiny scoff is enough
to make it go off, then.

63
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,980
Yes, that's right.

64
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,354
I'll try to hold back from laughing.

65
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,491
WE CAN'T HOLD BACK FROM LAUGHING…

66
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,726
-Is this off-limits?
-Yes.

67
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,729
THE TRAINING TO BECOME
SILENT SNIPERS BEGINS NOW

68
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,764
All right. Ready.

69
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,499
Go.

70
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,434
Do you all remember

71
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,737
the Pyeongchang Olympics?

72
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,672
She thought it was being held
in Pyeongchang-dong.

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,040
FLINCH

74
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,176
She said, "I hear my part of town
is hosting the Olympics."

75
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,778
-Surely not.
-I'm not lying.

76
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,747
Seriously, she's not so clueless.

77
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,449
She called me to say, "The Olympics
is being held in my neighborhood."

78
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,619
HER COMPOSURE AND THE MUZZLE ARE SHAKING

79
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,722
-I went, "Excuse me?"
-Come on.

80
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,457
I'm telling the truth.

81
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,227
KILLERS NEVER WAVER

82
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,995
FLARING NOSTRILS

83
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,565
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S KEPT HER COOL

84
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,668
Have you heard
anything new about Jin-kyung?

85
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,737
I heard that she's running
to be the president.

86
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,040
WHAT, ME?

87
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,541
…to be the president.

88
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,646
I heard…

89
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,282
A DARK HORSE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

90
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,550
-…about that too.
-She's holding on.

91
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,221
-The presidential election?
-That was my finishing blow.

92
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,989
I can't believe she held out.

93
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,124
That deserved a laugh, didn't it?

94
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,894
When I volunteered to be her spokesperson,

95
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,896
she went, "What's that about?"

96
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,932
She asked, "What does that mean?"

97
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,968
She didn't know that term.

98
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,003
SHE HASN'T MADE A SOUND, BUT SHE'S LOST IT

99
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,373
Oh, so she didn't know
what a spokesperson did.

100
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,041
Here's the thing, Jin-kyung.

101
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,410
I'll make an offer.

102
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,548
If you blow the whistle loud and clear,

103
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,782
I'll call Woo-seok.

104
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,053
THE BAIT WORKED LIKE A CHARM

105
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,488
Way to go, Woo-jae!

106
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,389
KNOWS HER TOO WELL

107
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,225
-Well done.
-That was funny.

108
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,393
PERSUASION ALWAYS TRUMPS FORCE

109
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,396
If you back out,
I'm calling you a sleazebag.

110
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,464
Aren't we allowed to lie?

111
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,498
Hey!

112
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,966
Of course, we can lie.

113
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,401
-Shame on you, Jin-kyung.
-Can't we lie?

114
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,903
Are they seriously allowed to lie?

115
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,505
That's just wrong.

116
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,007
All right, then.

117
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,410
I'll really make the call
if you blow the whistle again.

118
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,880
WAVERING

119
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,315
-I swear I'll do it.
-Really?

120
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,517
-Blow on it nice and loud.
-Seriously?

121
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,519
WHATEVER, HERE GOES

122
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,622
HE DOES IT AGAIN

123
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,792
I'M WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU, WOO-SEOK

124
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,628
-I have a friend named Kim Woo-seok.
-Oh, him.

125
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,563
JIN-KYUNG IS DUPED AGAIN

126
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,233
I know who you're talking about.
He's a sweet guy.

127
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,136
-And he always picks up.
-Don't you thoink Jun-ho answer?

128
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,037
-Try Jun-ho.
-Call him.

129
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,105
I think my turn is up.

130
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,074
-What do you mean?
-I've done my due.

131
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,610
Woo-jae is going to call Byeon Woo-seok,

132
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,478
and I got my penalty. Isn't it over?

133
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,647
-Let others take their turn.
-You still have time left.

134
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,482
So you haven't changed.
I'll repeat the rule for you.

135
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,484
I don't appreciate your tone.

136
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,320
-It's a compliment. Always the same.
-Pause the game.

137
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,322
-I hope we're on a timeout.
-Of course.

138
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,356
What time is it?

139
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,624
You want to know the time?

140
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,958
It's 11:01 a.m.

141
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,627
Why did you want to know, anyway?

142
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,096
-We could call Woo-seok now.
-That's right.

143
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,066
You know what, Jin-kyung?

144
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,501
Please edit it
if you think this is inappropriate.

145
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,371
I'm sharing a true story here.

146
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,440
Actually, it happened to me today.

147
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,142
This is me betting everything I've got.

148
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,444
I think I should.

149
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,245
WHAT COULD THIS BE ABOUT?

150
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,848
Tell me the truth.
You saw everything earlier, didn't you?

151
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,721
JIN-KYUNG CAME INTO THE BATHROOM
WHILE HE WAS RELIEVING HIMSELF

152
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,189
She saw everything!

153
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,690
She must have!

154
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,692
THE WITNESS ISN'T DENYING IT

155
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,096
She grinned so brightly, too.

156
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,864
The time is up for Jin-kyung.

157
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,998
That was hilarious.

158
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,471
Let's begin the next round
after we call Woo-seok.

159
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,439
-To Kim Woo-seok, right?
-Yes.

160
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,974
Stop that.

161
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,576
You don't want me to call him? Got it.

162
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,146
Shall we have Fly Killer sit, please?

163
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,882
SECOND TARGET, FLY KILLER

164
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,385
During our break,

165
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,453
I trained myself to always keep my cool.

166
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,989
I did some soul-searching, you see.

167
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,858
-'Kay.
-Let's roll.

168
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,061
Ready, go.

169
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,897
Can you guess what he said
after coming back from the bathroom?

170
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:38,998
Can you, Jin-kyung?

171
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,300
"My stomach kept hurting so bad,

172
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,202
so I took a dump.

173
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,772
But I forgot to wipe myself after that."

174
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,009
THE WITNESS MADE HIM FORGET ABOUT HYGIENE

175
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,779
I HAVE A FACE TO SAVE AS A K-POP IDOL

176
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,248
He must've been badly shaken.

177
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,949
I'd understand even if he hadn't wiped.

178
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,317
I didn't mean to pry, though.

179
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,886
Why did you open the locked door?

180
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,621
Well, the thing is…

181
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,257
Why did you do it, really?

182
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,993
-Did you know it was occupied?
-I merely thought

183
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,729
the door was stiff
and required force to open.

184
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,431
Did you really see everything?

185
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,866
Let me put it this way.

186
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,135
I know him in and out…

187
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,807
THERE ARE NO SECRETS BETWEEN THEM

188
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,915
After Jin-kyung came back
from the bathroom,

189
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,917
-she told me something.
-What?

190
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,952
"Woo-young is adorable."

191
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,054
HOW ADORABLE

192
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:35,988
Take it as a compliment.

193
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,724
I'M NOT ADORABLE!!!

194
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,828
I really felt terrible.

195
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,129
When I swung the door open,

196
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,131
I obviously didn't mean to take a peek.

197
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,267
But he saw me too, you see.

198
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,602
He didn't even yell.

199
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,971
He just stayed still, devastated.

200
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,808
HE STILL SEEMS TO BE IN THAT STATE

201
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,778
He just sat there, absolutely stupefied.

202
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,680
THE SADDEST WHISTLING EVER

203
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,948
That's a wrap.

204
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,449
3 MINUTES FELT LIKE 3 HOURS

205
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,318
I saw nothing.

206
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,321
THE NEXT TARGET IS SNIPER CHO

207
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,990
I've matured a lot as a married man.

208
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,992
I can embrace whatever comments
are thrown my way.

209
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,295
HOW PATIENT IS THE NEWLYWED GOING TO BE?

210
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,464
Ready, set, go.

211
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,832
I hear he paid his fiancée a billion.

212
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,735
HIS PATIENCE LASTED ONLY 3 SECONDS

213
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,872
1 BILLION WON PAID UPON MARRIAGE

214
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,242
By the way, how long has he been married?
About a year?

215
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,610
Did he really get married?

216
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,646
I hear his wife demanded
separate bedrooms.

217
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,648
FOR A SHARED BEDROOM,
500 MILLION WON IS REQUIRED

218
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,617
-I thought they were separate houses.
-Just separate rooms.

219
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,452
At least they live together.

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,953
Kisses are off-limits.

221
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,588
NO-KISSING ZONE

222
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,090
They haven't had their first kiss yet.

223
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,426
The terms of their marriage contract
outnumber the codes for killers.

224
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,561
Hands down.

225
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,496
-Really?
-There are about 100 of them.

226
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,031
1. 1 BILLION WON PAYMENT
2. SEPARATE ROOMS

227
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,566
3. NO-KISSING ZONE
100. TAXES NOT INCLUDED

228
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,769
Jin-kyung asked me
to hand in her money gift

229
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,973
because she couldn't attend
Sae-ho's wedding in person.

230
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,709
She only wired me about 15,000 won or so

231
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,679
using KakaoPay.

232
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,215
Around then,

233
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,285
Sae-ho called me and said
that I shouldn't have given him so much.

234
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,185
So…

235
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,289
I don't get why he thinks so little of me.

236
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,692
-How much did you give him?
-It was within the ordinary range.

237
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,928
-Just ordinary.
-Tell us the amount.

238
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,597
Why would I put it out in the open?

239
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,033
Tell us. Reveal it.

240
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,701
-Full disclosure.
-Let's do that.

241
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,469
-All right.
-I want full disclosure.

242
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,205
-No secrets.
-Let's be honest.

243
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,174
-What's wrong?
-How much did you give him?

244
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,376
-To be honest, I haven't…
-You haven't given him any?

245
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,011
I haven't had the chance to yet.

246
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,046
Seriously?

247
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,814
Can I call a timeout?

248
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,316
Thanks for sharing.

249
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,353
You're bound to check the guestbook
after the wedding is over.

250
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,790
I found the names
of Sook, Woo-jae, and Jin-kyung

251
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,958
and felt grateful to them.

252
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,860
Woo-young's name wasn't on it.

253
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,364
-Did you just enjoy a free meal?
-I had my reasons.

254
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,934
It's no big deal. Sae-ho left directly
for his honeymoon anyway.

255
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,136
His wife didn't go with him, though.

256
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,574
What exactly can you do as a couple?

257
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,909
WE BEG HIS FAMILY'S UNDERSTANDING

258
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,511
How long does he have to
maintain this facade?

259
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,080
I mean, seriously.

260
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,181
And that's it.

261
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,482
That was hilarious.

262
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,917
If we hadn't brought this up,

263
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,587
you'd have kept going
without giving him anything.

264
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,457
No, I'll talk to him later.

265
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,326
Let me apologize before going in.

266
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,895
I'm going all in. I won't even snort.

267
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,464
Goodness, they're so committed.

268
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,431
RELOADING THE WATER GUNS

269
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,067
Don't we have cold water?

270
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,870
-Why are you using drinking water?
-That's the coldest we've got.

271
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,172
-It was refrigerated.
-She determined to get cold water.

272
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,946
Wait, Jin-kyung.
That cap is for the water bottle.

273
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,015
HEH…

274
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,385
You really are a screwball.

275
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,321
She's freaking hilarious.

276
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,057
How is it possible to be like that?
I'm so jealous.

277
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,026
-You won't blow the whistle, right?
-Of course not.

278
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,160
-Never?
-Sure.

279
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,129
You have no plans to do it, right?
Here goes.

280
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,296
Ready, go.

281
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,366
You're not going to call
Byeon Woo-seok, are you?

282
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,936
If you're not going to anyway,
blow the whistle now.

283
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,605
I'll let you off the hook then.

284
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,140
If you don't, you have to call him.

285
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,710
Yeah, stay still
if you're going to call him.

286
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,311
But if you won't, blow on it.

287
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,080
-Three, two, one!
-The world is watching.

288
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,082
DID YOU THINK THAT'D WORK ON ME?

289
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,051
You're calling him
if you don't blow the whistle.

290
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,886
-You're doing it?
-You'll call him?

291
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,054
-Goodness.
-Really?

292
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,758
Why are you so easily swayed?

293
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,360
You're so weak-willed.

294
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,328
Let's leave him be.

295
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,197
-He said he'd call Woo-seok.
-Okay.

296
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,432
THE FICKLE KILLER

297
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,599
He just said so.

298
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:45,071
Let's give him a free pass
and get Woo-seok out of the deal.

299
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,841
I mean the actor, Byeon Woo-seok.

300
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,176
DESPERATE

301
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,744
The movie star…

302
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,013
This is a secret between us,

303
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,082
I know congratulations are in order

304
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,251
-for Woo-jae next year.
-Really?

305
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,688
I hear his fiancée is 22 years his senior.

306
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,457
IS HE A COUGAR HUNTER?

307
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:07,259
The lady was born in 1966.
I hear you're acquainted with her, Sook.

308
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,295
The lady with a sports car.

309
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,996
Isn't her hair cropped short
like an athlete?

310
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,801
I hear he noticed children
being rowdy at a playground,

311
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,936
told them to hush,

312
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,137
and got beaten up by them.

313
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,806
The time is up.

314
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,613
-I didn't find them funny. That's all.
-All right, then.

315
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,049
I'll keep grinding away at it.

316
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,551
I'm opening the bathroom door
on you, Woo-jae.

317
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,988
You're going to scream if you do, man.

318
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,392
Because of the odor?

319
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,231
THE BIOCHEMICAL KILLER

320
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,933
Just get on the phone already.

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,336
Wait, let's do that in the next episode.

322
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,471
-In the next episode?
-Yes, please.

323
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,073
-We're keeping it for later?
-Yes.

324
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,575
-Probably in two hours.
-Oh, right.

325
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,746
COMING UP NEXT
A PHONE CALL WITH BYEON WOO-SEOK

326
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,283
I'm pretty much the same as Woo-jae.

327
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,652
PUMPING WATER

328
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,654
Ready, go.

329
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,591
She's now fully 50 years old.

330
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:13,726
She's in for trouble.

331
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,762
DATE OF BIRTH: JULY 6TH, 1975
JUST A COLD FACT

332
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:18,597
HALF-CENTENNIAL KILLER

333
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,267
-She's hit that major milestone.
-Sure.

334
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,470
She's no longer an ordinary angler.
She's catching the days with her tools.

335
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,172
SAGE ANGLER SOOK

336
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,339
She's catching time.

337
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,842
You jerks!

338
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,977
Isn't it out of line to bring up my age?

339
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,913
-Sook.
-Did you watch her video?

340
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,982
She showed me a clip of her
catching an olive flounder

341
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,351
and ripping its head off
right on the spot.

342
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,253
With her teeth, right?

343
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,488
COULD BE A REAL STORY…

344
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,889
-Her bare teeth.
-Yeah.

345
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,524
That blew my mind away.

346
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,326
She has such a refined palate, too.

347
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,664
I saw her preparing the bait
to catch more fish

348
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,132
and eating it herself.

349
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,969
FOOD TASTER FOR FISH

350
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,672
Habits get you all the time.
She has that magic touch.

351
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,374
Still, you went too far with the worms.

352
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,212
SPECIAL DELICACY AT FISHERIES

353
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,015
You know how she owns five boats, right?

354
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,150
Oh, that makes sense.

355
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,052
All five captains are her husbands.

356
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,954
UNEXPECTEDLY-SKILLED MAN-EATER

357
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,388
Each boat has a different captain.

358
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,758
-That's it for Sook.
-Okay.

359
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,161
-Look at her.
-You rascals.

360
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,796
She took some hits.

361
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,064
You're all awful.

362
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,234
-You were easy prey.
-That worm bit was good, though.

363
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,369
"You went too far with the worms."

364
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,707
I HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING

365
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,309
HUNK IDOL WHO'S GOTTEN TOO FAMILIAR

366
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,012
I heard that she's running
to be the president.

367
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,982
MEMORY-IMPAIRED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

368
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,184
I hear his wife demanded
separate bedrooms.

369
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,886
THE NEWLYWED'S SHOCKING SECRETS

370
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,287
They haven't had their first kiss yet.

371
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,155
She's now fully 50 years old.

372
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,725
AND HALF-CENTENNIAL SOOK-WRECK

373
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,629
I'll announce the results
of the composure training.

374
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,231
First, Jin-kyung.
Gosh, you did pretty well.

375
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,133
-Four times.
-Only four times?

376
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,068
You blew the whistle four times.

377
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,703
Sook, eight times.

378
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,640
-That's quite a lot.
-I did laugh many times.

379
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,475
Sae-ho, 23 times.

380
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,910
What, 24 times?

381
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,378
-No, 23 times.
-Right.

382
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,013
Woo-young, 25 times.

383
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,147
Oh, no!

384
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,517
You should've gone into the pool.

385
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,686
You must've gotten hit non-stop.

386
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,756
You must know this already,
but Woo-jae took first place.

387
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:27,026
-Congrats.
-There's a prize for the winner, right?

388
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,895
-We did prepare one.
-He promised something grand.

389
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,430
We took care to choose a good one.

390
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,500
The training you went through
required you to stay silent.

391
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,567
A noise-canceling gadget?

392
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,370
The task taught you to be secretive.

393
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,041
So, we prepared a fitting item
for your clandestine activities.

394
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,142
What is it?

395
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,912
A set of slippers
to mitigate inter-floor noise.

396
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,213
That's a huge gift.

397
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,716
-I've always longed for them.
-Go get it.

398
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,818
-I'm so jealous!
-Me too.

399
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,486
GREAT FOR STEALTH INVASIONS

400
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,955
PERFECT NOISE-CANCELING

401
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,756
Let them see you.

402
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,559
-His heels are sticking out.
-They don't fit.

403
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,894
HEEL-CANCELING

404
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,332
I'm reminded of the sandals
the Maasai people wear.

405
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,034
As discussed earlier, I'm a generous guy.

406
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,769
You're handing them over again?

407
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,972
PRACTICALLY AN ANGEL

408
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,808
-No, don't.
-You already wore them.

409
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,810
We should bring out our water guns again.

410
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,212
That's a violation of our code
to remain cold-blooded.

411
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,513
KNIFE-FOOT'S GOOD HEART

412
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,384
AT LEAST IT BROUGHT PEACE TO HOMES

413
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:29,188
COLD SPELL OF WINTER IS NOTHING

414
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:32,257
COMPARED TO THE ICY HEARTS
OF THESE KILLERS

415
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,061
FROSTY AND LONESOME KILLERS

416
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,230
GATHER FOR A SECRETIVE LUNCH

417
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,399
Look how thick the cut is.

418
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,269
That's one hell of pork shoulder.
Its color is amazing.

419
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,039
-You're here to dine, yes?
-Hello, ma'am.

420
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,308
RESTAURANT OWNER'S TIMELY ARRIVAL

421
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,411
Today's special is grilled pork belly.

422
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,980
FIRST, SHE FIRES UP THE PORTABLE GRILL

423
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,349
Won't we need a camera over here too?

424
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,286
You won't be able to catch us
when you're filming Sook.

425
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,923
I'm worried that all you see
will be the back of our heads.

426
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,260
What was that?

427
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,396
-He said that's just fine.
-Who said so?

428
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,296
KILLER INSTINCT

429
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,331
Our head cameraman.

430
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm so disappointed in you.

431
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,302
I thought we had a bond
because we look alike.

432
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,738
THE CAMERA SHAKES

433
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,174
THEY COULD BE SIBLINGS

434
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,809
THE GRILLING FINALLY BEGINS

435
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,044
Can we just eat it?

436
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,245
Yes, please dig in.

437
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,180
-We're getting a peaceful meal?
-What about you?

438
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,748
We're having burgers.

439
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,683
Can I have one, too?

440
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,720
I can't enjoy grilled pork
when you're having some burgers.

441
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,989
But you're going to eat it, aren't you?

442
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,791
That'd make you look weirder.

443
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,559
Can I get some salt with sesame oil?

444
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,463
I don't like my pork belly
with soybean paste sauce.

445
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,598
While we were on hiatus…

446
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,534
Don't be surprised.

447
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,636
-My appetite has increased.
-Really?

448
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,204
-See for yourself.
-Okay.

449
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,440
That's going to be a shocker.

450
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,874
Wait and see.

451
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,143
-This is all cooked, Sae-ho.
-Try it.

452
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,479
-By the way, Sae-ho.
-Goodness.

453
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,014
I took it to be polite…

454
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:02,915
PORK BELLY TARTARE

455
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,650
Doesn't it look like raw fish?

456
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:05,717
HOW FRESH

457
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,719
ENOUGH WITH THE PRANKS

458
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,289
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS

459
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,325
FABULOUSLY SNAPPING HER WRIST

460
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,561
SPRINKLING FRAGRANT HERB-SALT

461
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,897
EFFICIENT HANDIWORK MATCHING HER DARK PAST

462
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,133
SHE DOESN'T STOP

463
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,235
BITE-SIZED MEAT IS LINED UP NEATLY

464
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,337
ONLY MASTERS CAN FLIP THREE PIECES AT ONCE

465
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,307
SHEER PERFECTION PREPARED BY SOOK-WRECK

466
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,409
I think you can start eating, guys.

467
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,478
YUM

468
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,546
Goodness, this is so good.

469
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,749
-It's terrible only we're enjoying this.
-Right.

470
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,451
I hate being a celebrity
at times like this.

471
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,521
We won't fault you
if you didn't eat, then.

472
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:44,890
GLANCING AROUND

473
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,725
KILLERS NEVER WAVER

474
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,894
-But it's too mouthwatering.
-It's so good.

475
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,596
It tastes even better
because we're together.

476
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,664
A BITE FOR SOOK-WRECK FOR HER TROUBLES

477
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,334
MEANWHILE, WOO-JAE
IS DEVOURING MEAT IN SILENCE

478
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,002
Woo-jae is eating so well.

479
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,838
-Yeah, it must be true then.
-Look at his rice.

480
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,207
He's eating spoonfuls of rice, too.

481
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,375
It's incredible.

482
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,677
WITH DETERMINATION

483
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,947
HE TAKES IN SPOONFUL AFTER SPOONFUL

484
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,684
AS WELL AS THE PORK BELLY

485
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,755
THIS IS CERTAINLY NEW

486
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,826
-You're almost done.
-I have some news to share.

487
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,027
Go ahead.

488
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,796
You know
how I usually pick at my food, right?

489
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,265
But I only did that

490
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,467
-because of the shoot.
-Does it upset your stomach?

491
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,836
It makes me so stressed
that my stomach gets upset.

492
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,771
-I often feel sick.
-I get what you mean.

493
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,175
When I'm on a shoot with close friends,

494
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,744
I feel fine even if I eat while filming.

495
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,781
I used to get headaches at night,
but those are gone, too.

496
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,951
We can tell you're at ease
from the way you eat.

497
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,786
You're the sensitive type, then.

498
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,021
He's hyper-sensitive.

499
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,355
"You're the sensitive type, then"?

500
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,291
You talk like that's news to you
after all these years.

501
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,960
THEY EVEN TOOK PERSONALITY TESTS TOGETHER

502
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,196
-I should tell you…
-We must have a new task.

503
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,463
Wolf it down.

504
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,065
No, don't get anxious.

505
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,734
This is because he's recently joined
Two Days and One Night.

506
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,169
They keep him on his toes.

507
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,170
That's understandable.

508
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,940
We've discussed
your specialties as killers earlier.

509
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,575
-Do you remember?
-Yeah.

510
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,744
We briefly mentioned
being a lady killer or a man-eater.

511
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,846
A FEW HOURS AGO

512
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,515
You're a man-eater in a literal sense.

513
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,319
Can you share your tips on getting someone
interested in you over a meal?

514
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,423
Let's say you're interested in me,
Woo-young.

515
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,992
I'M NOT BUYING THAT SCENARIO

516
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,795
It's just a hypothetical scenario, okay?

517
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,130
-Let's just roll with it, ***hole.
-Go ahead.

518
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,765
-He's interested.
-That's our story.

519
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:37,936
But I left the table to take a phone call
and haven't made my way back.

520
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,671
Won't that bother you?

521
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,041
If you left the table in haste
for some urgent business…

522
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,911
This is what I'd think.

523
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,878
"Phew."

524
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,914
"At least she can take a hint."

525
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,818
"Thank goodness she isn't obtuse."

526
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,219
There's no talking to you.

527
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,656
SAE-HO DEMONSTRATES HIS SKILLS
THAT CAPTURED HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE'S HEART

528
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,758
HIS ARM IS TOO SHORT

529
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,126
What are you doing?

530
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,194
Be nonchalant.

531
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,196
SO GENTLE AND CARING

532
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,666
If someone I didn't like did that,
I'd be so ticked off.

533
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,700
HORRIFIED

534
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,503
IF THE TISSUE TRICK ISN'T WORKING…

535
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,471
HOW ABOUT THIS?

536
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,405
How's this?

537
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,473
WORKING UP A TORNADO

538
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,075
TA-DA

539
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,644
Does something like this work for you?

540
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,012
You're begging for attention.

541
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,448
-Look.
-You'd be at it with no one giving a hoot.

542
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,449
Look, Jin-kyung.

543
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,152
HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU

544
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,722
How's my idea?
Rather than using some boring tricks,

545
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,924
I'd make direct eye contact…

546
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,428
STANDING UP WHILE MAINTAINING EYE CONTACT

547
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,263
Here.

548
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,633
Isn't this better?

549
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,534
HUNK OF RAW MEAT

550
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,636
Just give her an entire piece.

551
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,804
It's a token of affection.

552
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,440
THIS IS FROM THAT GENTLEMAN OVER THERE

553
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,576
See? I've gotten her enthralled!

554
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,145
I bet she'll keep thinking about me!

555
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,279
A REAL FRESH CHARM

556
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,748
I spared you one huge chunk of meat.

557
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,849
Isn't that generous?

558
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,052
THAT WORKED SOMEHOW

559
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,621
-That's hilarious.
-Won't this be memorable too?

560
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,555
Shall I cut it?

561
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,590
So, let's talk about our interests.

562
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,626
Have you watched Squid Game on Netflix?

563
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,361
You must've, right, Jin-kyung?

564
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,764
FORCING A CONVERSATION
IN THE SAME WAY HE DOWNS FOOD

565
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,399
DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO BULLDOZE HIS WAY

566
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,736
Seriously!

567
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,504
SHOOTING DAGGERS AT HIM

568
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,073
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE MARRIED NOW

569
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,942
-I have another question for you.
-Fire away.

570
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,779
They say all killers
are born from misfortune.

571
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,715
-They have tragic backstories.
-That's true.

572
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,418
So, why don't we battle it out
with tragic events in your lives?

573
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,253
-What does that mean?
-Let's see who had it worst.

574
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,022
SHARE SAD TALES
TO PROVE YOUR WORTH AS A KILLER

575
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,825
Let me start off with a short story.

576
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,326
I once bought a pair of jeans

577
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,595
and had a whole one-third cut off.

578
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:46,965
I'm not lying.

579
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,867
-But--
-Do you know what saddened me more?

580
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,203
I'll even mention the brand.

581
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,871
I can name it.

582
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,941
I fell in love with jeans from Balmain.

583
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,076
-That's a luxury brand.
-So, I went shopping for them.

584
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,278
Those were actually biker jeans,

585
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,047
-so they had knee pads
-I remember.

586
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,016
-incorporated into the design.
-That's right.

587
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,985
I tried them
and came out of the fitting room.

588
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,855
I then asked the clerk, "How do I look?"
Only to see the knee pads

589
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,423
down on my shins.

590
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,592
What a bummer.

591
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,493
SHIN PADS

592
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,395
No one could beat that tragic tale.

593
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,664
-You poor thing.
-I almost spewed my water out.

594
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,466
I used to bang my head a lot.

595
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,734
CONCERNED

596
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,870
When you're taller than 185 cm,

597
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,806
you can bang your head easily
when you get off the bus.

598
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,409
He's not sharing a sad tale.
He's bragging.

599
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,344
Have I ever told you this story?

600
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,746
My friends and I rented out a cottage

601
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,048
-years ago.
-That sounds lovely.

602
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,584
-Romance is bound to blossom, right?
-Sure.

603
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,686
I had something going with this guy.

604
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,524
And this guy who took interest in me

605
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,560
came to the girls' bedroom to ask me out.

606
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,929
He actually hid in the closet.

607
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:55,233
When I was about to go into the room
after washing my hair,

608
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,068
these two girls snickered and said,

609
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:01,173
"Go ahead with your skincare routine."
They then went to the living room.

610
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,576
I didn't get why they were grinning,
but I went into the bedroom.

611
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,447
My stomach had been grumbling
because of the raw fish we had earlier.

612
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,415
I'm getting bad vibes already.

613
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,883
Oh, no. Sook.

614
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,619
-So, I--
-Please stop. You're breaking my heart.

615
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,054
Imagine how I'd feel.

616
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,723
I think that was my last shot at romance.

617
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,828
Anyway, being all alone
made me feel so relaxed.

618
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,730
I must've let out 32 farts or so.

619
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,134
Please add sound effects.

620
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,105
-Like that.
-I was so refreshed.

621
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,273
I didn't feel bloated.

622
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,242
-I hope the floor didn't cave.
-The girls asked,

623
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,145
-I'm losing my mind here.
-"Why are you back so soon?

624
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,213
Where were you?"

625
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,113
And the guy…

626
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,283
Did he pass away?

627
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,188
-He came down the stairs,
-Did he pass out?

628
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,825
trudging down the stairs
looking all sallow.

629
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,695
I had no idea what went on then.

630
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,729
SHRIEKING

631
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:01,299
My friends filled me in after the trip.
"He wanted to surprise you

632
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,369
and asked us to give you two the room."

633
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,537
But you surprised him.

634
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,774
This story brought back a memory for me.

635
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,543
This happened in America.

636
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,513
I had kimchi stew
at some Korean restaurant.

637
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,216
Naturally, you'd get some food
stuck between your teeth.

638
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,852
I noticed this car parked in the lot.

639
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,455
Its windows were heavily tinted, you see.

640
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,558
So, I used the car's windows as a mirror

641
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,493
and started removing the bits.

642
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,396
-Oh, man.
-How embarrassing.

643
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,165
-Did the driver come outside?
-Who was it?

644
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,567
No, they just drove away.

645
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,905
HILARIOUS

646
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,040
I could console myself with this thought.

647
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,341
"I'm in the US."

648
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:47,445
"The driver was likely White
or African American."

649
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,080
That's what I clung to.

650
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:52,651
But I couldn't shake off the fact
that I was near the Korean restaurant.

651
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,653
SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT

652
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,254
You were signaling them to go.

653
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,923
URGING THE DRIVER'S INSTINCTS TO LEAVE

654
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,591
It's your turn now.

655
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,792
Misfortunes in my life?

656
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,663
FLY KILLER REVIEWS HIS LIFE

657
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,731
I've always been happy.

658
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,269
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
FIRST TASTE OF MISFORTUNE

659
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,038
IT'S ALREADY TIME FOR DESSERT

660
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,940
If you like your noodles chewy, dig in.

661
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,876
THE DESSERT IS CHEWY INSTANT NOODLES

662
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,678
SLURPING

663
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,746
WOLFING THE NOODLES DOWN

664
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:23,848
EATING NON-STOP

665
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,250
It's been a while. It tastes so good.

666
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,552
ONE MEMBER GOES ON A RAMPAGE AGAIN

667
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,488
GRABBING A LARGE AMOUNT
AND SLURPING THE NOODLES

668
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,759
A BIG APPETITE AND
A BIG LIST OF MODEL FRIENDS

669
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,362
A FEW HOURS LATER

670
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,631
Hello?

671
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:40,865
Hey, Woo-seok.

672
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,536
We had something going, remember?

673
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,604
Sorry? Did we perhaps argue?

674
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,905
-No, not "argue."
No, more like a situationship.

675
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,206
You argued with him?

676
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:53,578
SCREWBALLS OST - REBOOT

00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,638
Subtitle translation by: Jeongwoo Kim

SCREWBALLS
