1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,236
Previously on Screwballs.

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,438
Surviving as a criminal
charged with high treason.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,740
ABBY FROM SAJA BOYS

4
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:07,774
JAVIER BARDEM

5
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,875
CHOI MIN-SIK'S JANG KYONG-CHUL

6
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,777
DAN CHEN WHO'S SHORTER THAN JANG CHEN

7
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,046
As the worst villains of the world,

8
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,316
you've ended up
at the worst place of exile, Gangjin.

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,518
-That's why we're--
-We've been exiled?

10
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,619
Write an apology for someone else.

11
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,821
"Hello, I'm Hong Jin-kyung."

12
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,823
"Currently, I'm on
an overseas business trip."

13
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,960
"But actually, I am crazy about men."

14
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,096
"Finish filming and get paid."

15
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,365
TOO ASHAMED TO EVEN LIFT HIS HEAD

16
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,933
Congratulations, Woo-jae.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,835
BOWING DEEPLY
1ST PLACE JOO WOO-JAE

18
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,605
I want to eat some abalone.
May I have some?

19
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,606
No.

20
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,276
AT RISK OF COMMITTING A VIOLENT CRIME

21
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,078
Where's my oxygen tank?

22
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,648
CAN THE VILLAINS MAKE IT
THROUGH THE EXILE IN ONE PIECE?

23
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,183
Everyone.

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,985
-What's this?
-What's this?

25
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,753
Gosh, this is pretty rough.

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,588
-What is it?
-Do you see what's written?

27
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,957
What? "Pay for the next team dinner?"

28
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,626
"Banana Kick?"

29
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,094
Let me explain.

30
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,962
When you think of Gangjin,

31
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,931
-you think of Jeong Yak-yong.
-Yes.

32
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,535
While he was in exile in Gangjin,

33
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,970
he wrote books like
Admonitions on Governing the People

34
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,105
and Treatise on the Legal System,

35
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,674
gaining profound wisdom through hardship.

36
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,845
You will begin the exile mission shortly
in order to gain enlightenment as well.

37
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,213
The games' results will

38
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,849
determine when each one of you
will end your exile.

39
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,150
I see.

40
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,419
The rules are simple.
It's an individual competition

41
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,722
and points will be awarded
based on the results of each mission.

42
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,791
After all the missions are complete,

43
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,193
we'll tally up the total scores

44
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,061
and determine the final rankings.

45
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,998
The exile ends immediately
for the person in first place.

46
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,400
That's sensational.

47
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,002
The second and third place have to enjoy

48
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,971
the activities at this place of exile.

49
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,072
Then, their exile ends.

50
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,674
-That's not bad.
-Oh, I see.

51
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,609
The fourth and fifth place have to

52
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,878
experience the wilderness
of this place of exile.

53
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,279
-Wilderness?
-Then, it ends.

54
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,280
I hate that so much.

55
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,249
I really don't want
to enjoy the wilderness.

56
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,418
Here's the first mission.

57
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,253
It's called The Art of Restraint:

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,454
Pull to the End!

59
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,056
In this exile mission,

60
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,692
you must avoid rash moves,
think carefully,

61
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,427
and act with dignity.

62
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,762
You have seven seconds

63
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,731
to gently tug the tip of the roll

64
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,501
to pull the glass of water
over to your side.

65
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,902
I took a glance at it, Sook.

66
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,971
The glass isn't just full,

67
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,206
but the surface tension is
at its absolute max.

68
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,975
-The surface is--
-If you pull slightly,

69
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,344
the water will spill over
and tear the roll,

70
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,513
so you have to focus
and pull very carefully.

71
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,114
Does it get better the further you go?

72
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,250
It's better to go the farthest

73
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,119
because rankings from first to fifth
are decided by whoever moves

74
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,888
their glass the farthest.

75
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,390
First place gets five points,
second place gets four and so on.

76
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,225
What about these?
Matdongsan and coffee truck?

77
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,196
Those are some rewards and penalties
that we included along the way.

78
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,732
THERE'S A VARIETY OF REWARDS
AND PENALTIES TOO

79
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,835
But the rewards are weak
while the penalties are strong.

80
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,437
What kind of reward is this?

81
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,774
Ice cream, Banana Kick, Matdongsan,
and there's a Starbucks gift card too.

82
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,278
But there's things like paying
for the team dinner and a coffee truck.

83
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,514
There's Jin-kyung's, Sook's,
and my name here too.

84
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,484
-Those are just examples.
-I see.

85
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,887
For example, if it's Woo-young's turn,
the other four can put their names

86
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,788
where they want.

87
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,390
-Okay.
-I see.

88
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,392
When it's his turn,
the rest of us can do that?

89
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,894
For example, if Sae-ho stopped
at Woo-young's coffee truck,

90
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,163
he'll have to send him a coffee truck.

91
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,632
-You never know.
-I have to send him a coffee truck?

92
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,868
-That's right.
-You can apply it that way.

93
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,404
So Woo-young isn't the one
who gets Sae-ho the coffee truck.

94
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,473
-If I land on Jin-kyung's coffee truck…
-You have to send her a coffee truck.

95
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,542
-When she's filming elsewhere?
-Yes.

96
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,277
-It's a reward then.
-But

97
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,613
Woo-young isn't on any other show,
so where do I send it?

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,215
-Darn.
-He'll be on Music Bank soon.

99
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,849
Or when you appear on a radio show.

100
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,185
-You're so annoying.
-Or at his home.

101
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,119
-His home?
-Geez.

102
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,387
Let's send it to his home.

103
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,924
I'll make an announcement
about the coffee truck to my neighbors.

104
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,160
-If you look to your left, Sook,
-Let me do it.

105
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,895
-you'll see a kettle.
-Okay.

106
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,530
All right. Let me see.

107
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,398
LET'S FILL IT UP, SHALL WE?

108
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,134
THE GLASS IS BEING FILLED TO THE BRIM

109
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,135
-Okay.
-More, more.

110
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,438
-Okay, from here…
-Do it with this one now.

111
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,372
FILL IT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,140
That's enough.

113
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,376
Don't pour too much.

114
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,044
Show some compassion.

115
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,713
-Okay.
-Yeah.

116
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,249
I'm the first one to go.

117
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,217
It can even dome over, you know.

118
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,453
-You could have poured more with this.
-Way more.

119
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,587
-That's enough.
-Okay.

120
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,855
-No.
-No.

121
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,523
-No way.
-But I'm the first to go.

122
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,825
-Just wait.
-Hush.

123
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:19,792
Geez.

124
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,462
-Stop.
-That's it.

125
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,763
I bet you can add more.

126
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,064
-You can.
-Really?

127
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,633
What are you talking about?

128
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,167
Who do you think you are?

129
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,069
SOMEONE WHO HAS ALREADY TRIED IT

130
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,170
Okay, Woo-young.

131
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,106
You don't have to roll it.
You can just pull it.

132
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,040
All right.

133
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,709
HIS USUAL RASHNESS INDEX 100

134
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,111
Is this girly hip-hop?

135
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,812
HIS USUAL RASHNESS INDEX 100

136
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,514
I need water.

137
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,482
HIS RECKLESSNESS INDEX 100

138
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,718
CAN HE LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND,
STAY CALM, AND COMPLETE HIS MISSION?

139
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,420
-Ready, go.
-Go.

140
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,824
I, JANG WOO-YOUNG, WILL…

141
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,261
SHOW YOU A WHOLE NEW SIDE OF ME!

142
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,431
It's not moving. What are you doing?

143
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,834
I think we went too easy on him.

144
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,869
SLOWLY CREEPING ALONG

145
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,504
-Isn't it seven seconds?
-That's it.

146
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,773
VERY TINY MOVEMENT

147
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,975
SAD

148
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,543
-Flick on the forehead.
-Yeah.

149
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,744
AS IF DOING BADLY WASN'T ENOUGH

150
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,649
WOO-YOUNG HAS NEVER BEEN
THIS CAREFUL IN HIS WHOLE LIFE

151
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,885
By the way, this can get wet, right?

152
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,952
Of course, it can.

153
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,355
-It's up to where it gets torn, right?
-Right.

154
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,023
Then, we need to pull no matter what.

155
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,858
-Yeah.
-Really? Now I understand.

156
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,460
Who should flick you?

157
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,128
-Get flicked by one of us.
-No, thanks.

158
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,730
"No, thanks" isn't an option.

159
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,232
We need to flick your forehead.

160
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,368
-Who do you choose?
-Jin-kyung.

161
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,537
-No way.
-Let's have Sook flick your forehead.

162
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,706
I thought you said I had a choice.

163
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,707
Get flicked by Javier.

164
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,874
STOP COMPLAINING AND GET FLICKED

165
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,509
What an honor to be
flicked by Javier Bardem.

166
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,045
Ouch, Sook.

167
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,280
SCARED

168
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,948
Oops. Sorry.

169
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,084
That was stronger than I expected.

170
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,453
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

171
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,090
That flick was stronger than I thought.

172
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,191
Are you okay?

173
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,659
Do I look okay to you?

174
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,060
-It hurts.
-Lalala soda pop

175
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,528
You're fine.

176
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,796
At least, it wasn't Sae-ho.

177
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,764
Who's up next?

178
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,599
-Me.
-Is it Sae-ho?

179
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,102
Stop!

180
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,070
IT'S SAE-HO'S TURN?
LET'S FILL IT UP

181
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,338
Stop!

182
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,207
FOCUSED

183
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,642
-Stop.
-It's your fault if it spills over.

184
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,844
-That's enough.
-No, more.

185
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,747
-You poured more earlier.
-No, yours was way lower.

186
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,615
Yours was practically a freebie.

187
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,850
Darn it.

188
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,017
All right. Give it a go.

189
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,652
AND SO, SAE-HO'S GLASS IS
FILLED TO THE BRIM

190
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,553
Ready.

191
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:29,989
Ready.

192
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,925
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT POISED REALLY LOOKS LIKE

193
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,666
What was that?

194
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,470
DONE AFTER 1 SECOND

195
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,205
What was that?

196
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,640
How can it be this hard?

197
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,574
Geez!

198
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,309
-You ended up where I was.
-Right here.

199
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,511
-He's the same as me.
-What?

200
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,645
He's just before Woo-young.

201
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,746
Something's weird though.

202
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,215
-What's weird?
-What's weird?

203
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,383
He did worse than Woo-young?

204
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,651
Yes, he did worse than me.

205
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,655
No.

206
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,657
-How are they so bad at this?
-Again.

207
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,925
-How are they so bad?
-Again.

208
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,627
You poured too much water in it.

209
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,928
Jin-kyung will flick you.

210
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,596
ENDS WITH FLICKING OF HIS FOREHEAD

211
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,864
-Unravel it.
-Who's up?

212
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,199
Who is it?

213
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,100
It's Jin-kyung.

214
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,535
JIN-KYUNG'S TURN

215
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,936
Let's not fill it too much.

216
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,672
You filled ours up.
We should fill up hers too.

217
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,641
It isn't fun if you fill it too much.

218
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,642
No, it's fun.

219
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,876
You'll see.

220
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,912
Stop already.

221
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,814
-Done.
-Gosh.

222
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,781
Hers is bulging the most.

223
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,018
Jin-kyung, we can fill a cup
with what's at the top.

224
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,319
-Ready.
-We poured that well.

225
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,255
-Are you ready, Jin-kyung?
-Just yank it, Jin-kyung.

226
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,657
Just yank it and roll it up.

227
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,558
Ready.

228
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,726
Just yank it, Jin-kyung.

229
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,862
Just yank it and roll it up.

230
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,434
JI… JIN-KYUNG!

231
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,470
SOOK, WOO-JAE TOLD ME TO JUST YANK IT

232
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,206
DARN IT
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

233
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,778
That's a skill!

234
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,946
It's a skill.

235
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,080
You're in last place!

236
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,382
Didn't she look like
a member of a circus just now?

237
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,918
SHE EVEN LOOKS LIKE SHE'S HERE TO PERFORM

238
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,587
-It's here, right?
-What was that?

239
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,655
-Cirque du Soleil.
-What was that?

240
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,090
What's this?

241
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,892
Why did you try to do a magic trick?

242
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,330
TA-DA

243
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,867
Darn it. This method didn't work.

244
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,767
GIGGLING

245
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,668
I'm here.

246
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,237
You've got skills.

247
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:25,771
Go easy on me.

248
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,712
WOW!

249
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,681
RUNNING AWAY

250
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,517
CLEARLY A PSYCHOPATH

251
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,653
I'M GOING TO KILL THAT PSYCHO

252
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,422
Jin-kyung, can you move aside?
It's my turn.

253
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,359
What is wrong with these guys?

254
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,927
-My turn.
-But you're still smiling.

255
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,463
BUT YOU'RE STILL SMILING

256
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,932
Jin-kyung is enjoying it so much.

257
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,433
Get over here, you psycho.

258
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,669
-Are you angry or something?
-I'm getting cold sweats.

259
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,504
I got cold sweats after flicking you.

260
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,541
Are you angry or something?
You just look really happy.

261
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,910
You looked sleepy,
so I thought I'd wake you up.

262
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,977
THE MEAN BROTHER GETS READY

263
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,479
Look, everybody.

264
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,414
You are completely ignoring

265
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,318
all physics while you play this game.
All you do is…

266
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,787
Is he showing off again?
Didn't he write an apology?

267
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,590
All you think about is pulling it.

268
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,191
This is a fight against acceleration.

269
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,661
Depending on
whether there's acceleration or not,

270
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,562
He's showing off.

271
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,664
the height of the water
in the front and back--

272
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,432
Shut up and just do it.

273
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,967
If you keep at a certain speed

274
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,102
while maintaining zero acceleration,

275
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,438
that water won't budge.

276
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,539
Of course from zero--

277
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,942
"You can just call me a brat."

278
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,009
YOU NEED MORE SELF-REFLECTION

279
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,177
Let's see how well you do.

280
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,612
Good. Now, maintain the tension.

281
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,613
-Hurry up.
-Maintain it.

282
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,348
-Just shut up and do it.
-Are you ready?

283
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,349
I'll blow the whistle.

284
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,518
-Why is he so talkative?
-Ready, set…

285
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,553
Look at his face.

286
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,690
Hey, he did worse than me.

287
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,458
SNAP

288
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,994
SHAME LEVEL AT 100

289
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,396
This is a fight against acceleration.

290
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,297
I'll flick him.

291
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,033
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULDN'T SHOW OFF TOO MUCH

292
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,769
Hang on. Are you sure you tried this out?

293
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,539
-Of course.
-The staff succeeded in seven seconds?

294
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,907
We even poured more than that.

295
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,308
TIME FOR JUDGMENT

296
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,409
Hang on, Woo-jae.

297
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,345
-That's so funny.
-I flicked Jin-kyung too hard,

298
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,046
-so I have to be fair.
-Yeah, do it.

299
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,848
-I don't have anything against you.
-Do it.

300
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,749
Got it?

301
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,085
FLICK

302
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
THE DOWNFALL OF THE SHOW-OFF

303
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,825
He flicks really hard.

304
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,728
-That was insane.
-I think Woo-jae got flicked the hardest.

305
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,029
That was really hard.

306
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,263
I'm so sorry, Woo-jae.

307
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,232
Hey, Woo-young's in the lead.

308
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,333
THUS FAR, NO ONE COULD ESCAPE THE FLICK

309
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,801
And I'm in second place.

310
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:36,769
This is the worst.

311
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,270
-Ready.
-No need to lift it.

312
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,705
You can't hold it up like that.

313
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,707
-Get ready.
-You have to lower it.

314
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,908
It'll spill that way.

315
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:43,976
Yeah, lower it.

316
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,345
It's over.

317
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,413
AN ENDING WITHOUT ANY TWIST

318
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,081
-What the heck?
-Same as me.

319
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,550
I think something's wrong
with the toilet paper roll.

320
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,152
I'm sorry, Sook.

321
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,920
NOT EVEN JAVIER BARDEM
COULD AVOID THE FLICK

322
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,656
Nice shot.

323
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,057
That scumbag.

324
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:00,893
All right, Sook.

325
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,528
Woo-young's first place, I'm second,

326
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,397
Sook's third place, Woo-jae's fourth,

327
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,831
and Jin-kyung's in fifth place.

328
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,667
Can someone from the staff show us?

329
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,301
We'll fill the glass with water.

330
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,970
Our writer Sun-hee was the best at it.

331
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,239
-Okay, Sun-hee.
-Can you come over here, Sun-hee?

332
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,676
They tried this and succeeded?

333
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,010
I don't think it's possible.

334
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,113
But a regular person might
get a bit camera shy.

335
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,581
Just making an excuse beforehand

336
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,483
-for our writer.
-What about us?

337
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,118
Do you have your own technique?

338
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,354
Do you enjoy doing this?

339
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,722
LAUGHING

340
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,623
Ready,

341
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,659
-get set.
-She can't do it.

342
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,795
Twenty to thirty cameras

343
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,663
are on you, Sun-hee.

344
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,865
-Eight lights are on you.
-Go.

345
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:42,968
How is she doing that?

346
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,203
THE GLASS COMES ALONG NEATLY ON THE ROLL

347
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,505
SHE'S GOOD
HOW IS SHE DOING IT?

348
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,609
Hey, she got Banana Kick!

349
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,011
-Can't you give us one?
-Well.

350
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,080
-Give her a round of applause.
-But how?

351
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,915
WRITER SUN-HEE WON THE BANANA SNACK

352
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,183
Here's your Banana Kick.

353
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,818
-It's possible.
-She's good.

354
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,885
-Hey.
-What was that?

355
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,854
-I wanted Banana--
-We were just bad at it.

356
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,891
Statistically speaking, how is it
even possible for all five of us to fail?

357
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:06,926
THE REALITY OF SCREWBALLS

358
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,928
Give us our points. Then--

359
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,863
We'll give you your points
from one to five.

360
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,964
-Okay.
-Also,

361
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,700
-considering your lack of talent,
-Geez.

362
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,102
-I'll give you 15 seconds.
-Okay.

363
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,436
Let's try again with 15 seconds.

364
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,571
We can just add the points.

365
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,739
-Okay.
-Okay.

366
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,540
-In the same order?
-Okay.

367
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,342
-You're up, Woo-young.
-Lalala soda pop

368
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,377
-Hey!
-Hey! One, two.

369
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,113
One, two, three, four.

370
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,447
-Let me know, Director.
-Ready.

371
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,849
Ready, set,

372
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,884
go.

373
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,587
OH!

374
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,922
TOTALLY FOCUSED

375
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,327
FIRST TIME PASSING
"FLICKING FOREHEAD" ZONE

376
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,495
Yeah, this is…

377
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,131
I saw how Sun-hee did it
and got the hang--

378
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,299
-What is it?
-"50,000-won bonus"?

379
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,301
-He got "50,000-won bonus."
-Wow.

380
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,636
-What?
-I get that?

381
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,570
Yeah.

382
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,607
Lalala soda pop

383
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,442
FEELING GREAT

384
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,443
Your names.

385
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,045
THAT WAS AWESOME

386
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,347
-Okay, about that much?
-Okay.

387
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,749
You know, I think I can do it now.

388
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,885
-You got the hang of it.
-Yeah.

389
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,786
Really?

390
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,521
I got it now.

391
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,588
50,000-won bonus.

392
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,990
Are you done? That's enough.

393
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,057
Stop. That's enough.

394
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,093
It's getting torn in the front.

395
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,494
There's water in the front.

396
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,762
Where? This much is fine.

397
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,198
-No, it isn't. You can't get water on it.
-It's okay.

398
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,699
No, move it back.

399
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,202
You got water on the cup.
I mean, the toilet paper.

400
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,336
-Where?
-It's fine.

401
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,604
We can erase it with CG.

402
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,007
What the heck? You got water on it.

403
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,942
Let's start over. I don't want to do it.

404
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,610
-No, stop.
-We can erase it.

405
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,112
Get that wet paper out.

406
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,080
Put it on a new piece of toilet paper.

407
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,049
-We can use a digital filter to erase it.
-Why?

408
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,451
Don't you worry about it.
We can erase all of it.

409
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,352
That's not the point!

410
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,254
-Erasing it isn't what matters.
-Look,

411
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,989
-Woo-jae is drying it.
-I'm drying it.

412
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,124
I'm fanning it.

413
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,559
Go ahead and try again.

414
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,294
Ready.

415
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,762
If all else fails, we can edit it out.

416
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,096
Set.

417
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:52,731
Go.

418
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,867
I'LL OVERCOME THE BASELESS CRITICISM
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN!

419
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,768
Good job.

420
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,972
SOLEMN

421
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,209
I think he's going to pass me.

422
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,377
Stop. Stop.

423
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,612
Stop.

424
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,448
"Pay for the next team dinner."

425
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,586
PAY FOR THE NEXT TEAM DINNER

426
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,788
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

427
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,657
THE WORLD IS AGAINST ME

428
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,593
"Pay for the next team dinner."
Where is it?

429
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,829
-Where is it? Where's the sticker?
-I was disappointed because he beat me.

430
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,032
-It isn't better to beat someone.
-Cho Sae-ho.

431
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,801
SIGHING

432
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,035
Let's have it very soon.

433
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,138
Let's do the team dinner soon, Jin-kyung.

434
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,373
Enough with the team dinners.

435
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,676
I like team dinners.

436
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,311
I like talking about myself
at team dinners.

437
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,447
JIN-KYUNG IS THE THIRD ONE UP

438
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,616
-Me pitching in 500,000 won on dinner.
-Pick the coffee truck for me.

439
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,452
Just stop at the coffee truck for me.

440
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,888
HE WHINES WHILE THEY FILL

441
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,322
-Wouldn't it be nice?
-No fun.

442
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,523
-Stop.
-That's enough.

443
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,058
-Wouldn't it be nice?
-No fun.

444
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,027
Your filling mine the most.

445
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,395
-No, it's the same.
-It is.

446
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,697
I'm serious. It's the same.

447
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,500
Jin-kyung, if you egg us on,
I can add three times more.

448
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,536
-Are you ready?
-We poured very little right now.

449
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,573
-Don't do a magic trick like before.
-Ready,

450
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,042
set, go.

451
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,844
Set, go.

452
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,312
Coffee truck for Woo-young.

453
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,546
-Coffee truck for Woo-young.
-What?

454
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,815
Why did you keep saying that?

455
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,884
"Donate 100,000 won
to small business owners."

456
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,586
Donate to small business owners.

457
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,588
You kept confusing me from the side.

458
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,989
I didn't confuse you.

459
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,925
Your face is more confusing.

460
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,093
WHY THAT JERK

461
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,062
"Donate 100,000 won
to small business owners."

462
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,964
It was too fast.
You should've pulled slowly.

463
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:32,865
-Too fast.
-Yeah.

464
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,333
You were hasty.

465
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,267
Next up is Woo-jae.

466
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,169
-Is it me?
-Yes.

467
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:43,175
HE KEPT BABBLING ON
ABOUT THE GAME MECHANICS EARLIER

468
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,646
WILL IT BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

469
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,814
Ready,

470
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,883
-set.
-Wait.

471
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,386
WILL HE SUCCEED IN REGAINING HIS PRIDE

472
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,287
Making it longer?

473
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,622
Ready, set,

474
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,523
go.

475
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,925
He's doing well.

476
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,393
Go to Jang Woo-young.

477
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,462
FOCUSED

478
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,098
-Pay for team dinner.
-Banana Kick.

479
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,202
-He's going to succeed.
-He's doing it.

480
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,604
Okay. He did it!

481
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,239
HE DID IT

482
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,708
I should've added more water.

483
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,811
Where's my solo shot?

484
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,249
GROSS

485
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,651
FEELING LIKE LOSERS NEXT TO HIM

486
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,952
-Good job.
-Bring that over.

487
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,253
Gosh, I feel so relieved.

488
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,256
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

489
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,925
Woo-jae cheated.

490
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,026
How so?

491
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,062
He should've rolled the toilet paper rod,
but he just pulled it like this.

492
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,665
-That's up to each person.
-We all did that.

493
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,401
OH, REALLY?

494
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,737
Didn't you say we had to roll the rod?

495
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:45,838
It isn't a rod.

496
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,206
It's a roll.

497
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,308
A rod is a stick.

498
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,310
LAUGHING

499
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,711
-What? A rod?
-You cheated.

500
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,912
Did you use a rod?

501
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,114
That's cheating.

502
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,515
LET'S JUST CONTINUE

503
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:58,784
Are you ready?

504
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,386
Land on "Coffee truck for Woo-young."

505
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,021
Our last attempt for today.

506
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,389
Be quick. We're out of time.

507
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,390
-Ready.
-Let's go.

508
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,325
-Slowly.
-That jerk.

509
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,394
HE'S MESSING AROUND AGAIN

510
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,095
Hey, watch out.

511
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:10,996
Set.

512
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,431
Go.

513
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,533
It's over.

514
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,836
SHOWING TREMENDOUS FOCUS

515
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,438
What the heck?

516
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,006
We didn't pour enough water.

517
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,341
How far is she going?

518
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,744
WILL SOOK SUCCEED AS WELL?

519
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,680
-Your 15 seconds are up.
-That's it.

520
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,815
You were here.

521
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,717
-"Coffee truck for Jin-kyung."
-You're here.

522
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,685
-No, I didn't land on that.
-Yes, you did.

523
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,720
No, that's wrong.

524
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,121
Check the camera. She was here.

525
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,656
-No.
-"Coffee truck for Jin-kyung."

526
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,324
WITNESSES APPEAR FROM EVERYWHERE

527
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,225
-Where is it?
-Here.

528
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,827
-The cup was there.
-I did it.

529
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,762
-You were here.
-"Coffee truck for Jin-kyung."

530
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:44,863
What?

531
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,366
She should've stopped
when her 15 seconds were up,

532
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,267
-but she didn't.
-Yes.

533
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,735
-What?
-He's right.

534
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,137
-Your 15 seconds are up.
-That's it.

535
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,406
WOO-JAE WAS RIGHT

536
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,642
Who's paying for the coffee truck?

537
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,277
-You are.
-You are.

538
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,244
Me?

539
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,548
Good for Jin-kyung.

540
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,615
Yeah.

541
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,318
I should have stopped
at the 100,000-won bonus.

542
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,487
What a shame.

543
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:09,855
ROUND 2 RESULTS

544
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,690
1ST WOO-JAE, 2ND SOOK, 3RD SAE-HO,
4TH WOO-YOUNG, 5TH JIN-KYUNG

545
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,360
And so, Woo-jae has seven points

546
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,962
and Sook has seven points.

547
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,863
You were so good.

548
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,698
-Sae-ho has seven points.
-Seven.

549
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,933
Okay! Seven points.

550
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,367
Woo-young has seven points.

551
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,469
-What the heck?
-What?

552
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,137
Jin-kyung has two points.

553
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,638
-What?
-How did this happen?

554
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,775
He got five points and two points,
so he has seven points.

555
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,577
Sook got three points and four points.

556
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,112
-And I got two and seven?
-Yeah.

557
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,316
-Jin-kyung, you look happy.
-Did she get one and one?

558
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,717
She looks happy today.

559
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,286
Let's do a final
10-point comeback round later.

560
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,055
Even though she's sad,
she's still smiling.

561
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,490
Gosh. Okay!

562
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,991
What's the second game?

563
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,693
Let me introduce the second game.

564
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,328
During exile, tea was

565
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,563
said to soothe the weary body and mind

566
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,665
and was also a precious companion.

567
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:58,070
That's why Jeong Yak-yong himself
was deeply fond of tea ceremonies too.

568
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,039
This time, all you have to do is drink tea

569
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:02,708
in this game.

570
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:07,179
It's called Carefully Drinking It Up
with a Serious Face.

571
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,483
I BET IT ISN'T JUST DRINKING TEA

572
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,019
Do you remember the Water Bomb game?

573
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,588
We drew for byes
and did a tournament style.

574
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,091
You can see
the tournament bracket next to you.

575
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,027
Starting now, you'll compete one-on-one.

576
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,664
Each of you will stay seated
as you each have a cup of tea in hand.

577
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,902
And under your opponent's teacup,
you'll see the initials of an idiom.

578
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:35,541
Whoever guesses the idiom
from the initials first wins.

579
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,178
For example, if the idiom
under the teacup is

580
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,146
"T.B.O.S."

581
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,414
What is it, Sae-ho?

582
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,149
-T.B.
-O.S.

583
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,851
To buy our stories?

584
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,019
All right, Jin-kyung.

585
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,720
T.B.O.S.

586
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,856
"To be or not to be?"

587
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,025
Woo-young, T.B.O.S.

588
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,393
-Two birds, one stone.
-Correct.

589
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,296
Stop showing off. I knew it too.

590
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,231
To buy our stories?

591
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,632
Yeah. It's "Two birds, one stone."

592
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,668
Catching two birds with one stone.

593
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,404
If you call out the answer first, you win.

594
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,538
However,

595
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,173
we prepared a few drinks.

596
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,475
Mango juice, green plum juice,
Let's Be Coffee

597
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,111
Powerade, Cantata Coffee, etc.

598
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,982
When you finish the drink in your teacup,

599
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,018
you get a chance to guess
your opponent's idiom.

600
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,087
For example, let's say you saw T.B.O.S.

601
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,089
And you know it means
"Two birds, one stone."

602
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,159
But if you haven't finished your drink,
you can't guess the answer.

603
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,061
The reason why we set it up this way is

604
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,096
because you can't see it
if you hold it like that.

605
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,764
We have to make you drink.

606
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,033
The bottom is shown when you drink, right?

607
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,936
-Use your instincts to time it right.
-Give him a hand.

608
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,072
This will be an intense
battle of the minds.

609
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,174
I don't get it.
Can you explain it one more time?

610
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,242
I'll tell you.

611
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,977
If you don't drink it,

612
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,111
you can't guess the answer.

613
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,012
You must drink it up.

614
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,413
Even if you see what it is,

615
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,350
you have to finish your drink.
The reason for that…

616
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,618
Geez, man.

617
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,152
How do you not get that?

618
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,187
Get it?

619
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,090
-You have to drink it up--
-Only then can you guess the answer.

620
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,559
SECRETLY LISTENING CAREFULLY

621
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,794
While you're helping Woo-young out,

622
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,596
another person seems
to look very confused.

623
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,766
There's no other way.
We just have to play the game.

624
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,701
You know, I actually had no expectations.

625
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,536
We were going to move past her.

626
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,805
By the way, is this possible as well?

627
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:14,973
The game starts

628
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,974
and I just guess it.

629
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,276
You just make a guess?

630
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,845
Then, we'll refill your drink.

631
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,480
If I get it wrong?

632
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,715
Is it okay
if we do a really difficult one?

633
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,584
You must know a lot of idioms.

634
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,219
I like difficult ones.

635
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,222
Do you know "Catch a tiger
with a bare kick"?

636
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,623
BARE WHAT?

637
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,425
-What?
-Oh, "Catch a tiger with a bare fist."

638
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,393
With a bare fist.

639
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,295
-Let's continue the game.
-Wait.

640
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,030
LET US KNOW NEXT TIME

641
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,999
Let's draw the bye with this.

642
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,968
We'll add the last two digits
when you stop

643
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,269
and the highest number gets it.

644
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,838
After I start, I'll stop when you say so.

645
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,807
If you add one plus nine,
the last digit is zero.

646
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,576
-Whoever gets the highest last digit…
-Okay.

647
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,844
-Okay.
-Who'll go first?

648
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,780
We'll start from Jin-kyung.

649
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:56,948
Just hit Start and then Stop.

650
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,083
Stop.

651
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,051
-Two.
-Two.

652
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,185
What is two?

653
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,953
One plus one is two.

654
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,388
-The last digit.
-The last digit.

655
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,456
What are we doing?

656
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,758
-We're deciding the order.
-Deciding the order.

657
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,995
LIFE MUST BE A BIT INCONVENIENT FOR HER

658
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,330
Drawing the bye.

659
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,031
Just stay here like this

660
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,200
-and find out when it airs next month.
-Okay.

661
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,668
-Show us yours, Woo-jae.
-Okay.

662
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,836
Here I go.

663
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,805
-Nine is the highest, right?
-Yeah, nine.

664
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,041
YES, I GOT 9

665
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,544
You have to press after at least a second.

666
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,012
NEXT UP

667
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,380
-Eight.
-Eight.

668
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,381
One.

669
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,982
Gosh, I got three.

670
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,084
Woo-jae won the bye.

671
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,486
He's already good,
but he even won the bye?

672
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,521
JOO WOO-JAE

673
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,256
Then, for the preliminary round…

674
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,292
Do you want to play with me, Jin-kyung?

675
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,294
-Sure.
-Okay, it's me and Jin-kyung.

676
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,396
Then, it'll be Sook and Woo-young.

677
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,597
Lalala soda pop

678
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,765
COMPLETED FILLING OUT THE BRACKET

679
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,833
Tell us

680
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,568
-if it's too weird.
-Okay.

681
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,802
Is this too hard?

682
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,072
-That'll be okay.
-It's okay, right?

683
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,340
-Oh, wow.
-That's okay.

684
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,775
JIN-KYUNG CONFIRMS HER ANSWER TOO

685
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,478
WRITING IT DOWN

686
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,880
Fill about three quarters of the cup.

687
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,382
DAN CHEN DRINKS THE POWERADE

688
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,850
JOKER LIKES LET'S BE COFFEE

689
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,884
Ready,

690
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,986
set, go.

691
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:08,954
Shall we clink our cups?

692
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,355
DRAG

693
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,559
SIP

694
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,234
I think I saw it. I saw it.

695
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,635
I have to think about it.

696
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,871
-You can only guess if you finish it.
-Finish your drink.

697
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,305
You should look too, Jin-kyung.

698
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,273
Look, Jin-kyung.

699
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,508
SHE'S JUST A CAFE PATRON

700
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,943
She's just sipping her coffee right now.

701
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,845
Why aren't you looking?

702
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,680
-She's just enjoying the coffee.
-I saw it.

703
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,049
WHAT COULD IT BE?

704
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,718
Hers is difficult.

705
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,086
It isn't difficult.

706
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,121
It isn't?

707
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,256
HE DID SEE THE CLUE

708
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,258
Don't leave the cup on the table.

709
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,726
-Hold it in your hand.
-Yeah.

710
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,194
Okay.

711
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,095
Okay.

712
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,664
FOLDING FORWARD

713
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,771
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE EITHER

714
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,008
AS VILLAINS DO,
THEIR TEA CEREMONY IS VERY SLEAZY

715
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,643
Just drink it up.

716
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,546
I'm trying not to show her mine.
I saw hers already.

717
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,682
If I know what hers is,
I would drink mine up.

718
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,417
You know what, Jin-kyung?

719
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,953
He already saw yours
so you can just drink it up.

720
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,054
-He saw hers?
-I didn't.

721
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,623
No, Sae-ho already saw what yours is,

722
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,025
so you can just drink yours up.

723
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,661
-I already saw yours. It's R.K.A.D.
-Exactly.

724
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,096
You can just drink yours up

725
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,499
and use your hand
to be more aggressive.

726
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,035
-What is it?
-R.K.A.D.

727
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,270
-You don't know this one?
-For real?

728
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,272
-He really doesn't know this?
-Sae-ho.

729
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,042
You should know this!

730
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,711
SHE OPENLY DRINKS UP THE COFFEE

731
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,079
Let's see it again.

732
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,049
Jin-kyung, did you
at least see one initial?

733
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,750
-No.
-You haven't seen anything?

734
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,619
If you give me a hint,
I'll drink mine up.

735
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,689
-Kindheartedness.
-What? Kindheartedness?

736
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,390
-Really?
-She just handed it to you.

737
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,160
DRINKS IT UP AS PROMISED

738
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,628
O.B.E.Y.

739
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,596
O.B.E.Y.

740
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,999
-O.B.E.Y.
-What?

741
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,501
O.B.E.Y.

742
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,002
What is R.K.A.D.?

743
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,937
-Is it O.B.E.Y.?
-Related to kindheartedness?

744
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,772
WHAT IS HERS?
R.K.A.D.

745
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,608
REAL KIDS ARE DUMB?

746
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,676
-What?
-You see? It may take some time.

747
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,178
Is it Reading Korean
and English about Death?

748
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,247
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

749
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,481
Fill his cup up.

750
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,382
Yes, that's right.

751
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,117
-O.B.E.Y.
-Since you got it wrong.

752
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,151
Woo-young, fill his cup.

753
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,486
If you guess…

754
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,488
If you guess, you have to drink again.

755
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,757
ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE

756
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,493
OH!

757
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,495
SOMETHING POPPED INTO JIN-KYUNG'S MIND?

758
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,197
Order between the elder and the younger!

759
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,498
That's correct.

760
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,367
-Okay.
-What's hers?

761
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:38,169
-Reciprocate kindness after death.
-Reciprocate kindness after death?

762
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,405
I got stuck on another word,
so I didn't even think of it.

763
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,473
-Yeah.
-Me too.

764
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,642
-It was hard for him.
-How could I not know that?

765
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,710
Jin-kyung, you win. Congratulations.

766
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,280
-You didn't even have a clue.
-It was that idiom.

767
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,481
Is this right?

768
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,615
NEXT MATCH
KIM SOOK VERSUS JANG WOO-YOUNG

769
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,683
I'll go with this.

770
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,985
Nothing too hard please.

771
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,354
THEY SOLEMNLY START
BY CONFIRMING THEIR IDIOMS

772
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,389
-Okay?
-Okay.

773
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,857
-What is it?
-What is it?

774
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,195
THE SECOND DRINK FOR THE TEA CEREMONY
IS THE GREEN PLUM DRINK

775
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,130
Shall we clink too?

776
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,064
SHALL WE CLINK TOO?

777
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,832
-Let's get to it.
-Okay.

778
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,435
Why don't you both
start by drinking it up?

779
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,071
Can't you just leave it to us?

780
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,439
CATCHING A GLIMPSE

781
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,440
BUT HE MISSED IT!

782
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,978
You wrote too small.

783
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,879
-So petty.
-I did?

784
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:21,846
Really, Sook?

785
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,814
ACTING LIKE HE'LL DRINK

786
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,517
THIS ROUND WON'T GO SO EASILY EITHER

787
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,089
-Here I go. Take a look.
-Okay.

788
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,224
Let's just drink up. Ready, go.

789
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,293
THEY BOTH TAKE A SIP

790
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,297
Woo-young saw it.

791
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,765
DID ABBY SEE THE INITIALS?

792
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,867
I only saw T.T.

793
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,803
Tell us. What did you see?

794
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,105
I saw W.H.W.S.

795
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,740
Just drink it up, Sook.

796
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,208
There's no point.

797
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,078
DARN IT
HE FIGURED IT OUT

798
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,347
Why did you…
T.T. is correct, isn't it?

799
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,417
DID SOOK GET THE TWO INITIALS RIGHT?

800
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,586
What starts with those?

801
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,655
Top talent?

802
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,789
Too tall?

803
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,658
I didn't see the first two.

804
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,692
Drink.

805
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,761
Hey.

806
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,329
STOP BEING PETTY AND DRINK

807
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,831
WHATEVER

808
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:13,732
Hey.

809
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,733
VILLAIN MODE ACTIVATED

810
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,201
I can't see his well.

811
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,769
TRY TO SEE IT IF YOU CAN

812
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,437
-Here he goes.
-You see?

813
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,472
THE GROOVE TECHNIQUE

814
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,573
I can't see his.

815
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,908
THE MAESTRO OF TEA CEREMONY
PLAYS WITH THE TEACUP

816
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,777
Come on, man! Wait.

817
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,213
He's like Drunken Master.

818
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,347
G?

819
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,316
G.T.T.T.

820
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,985
DOGGONE IT
THAT'S CORRECT

821
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,155
THEY BOTH KNOW EACH OTHER'S INITIALS

822
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,157
What could G.T.T.T. be?

823
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:40,659
G.T.T.T.

824
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,427
GOT TO TAKE TWO?
GOOD TO TRY TOO?

825
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,130
WAY HOME WAY SOUTH?
WATCH HIGH WALK SLOW?

826
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,736
It'd be funny if it took a whole hour.

827
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,172
AFTER SOME TIME…

828
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,842
THEY'RE STILL DEEP IN DEEP THOUGHT

829
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,548
My beard should have grown by now.

830
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,685
Can you use CG to add it in?

831
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,720
Make me drool.

832
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:14,592
What about this?

833
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,227
At the same time,

834
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:17,862
you say the first word.

835
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,465
I think the game will be over
as soon as they do that.

836
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,733
I really don't know.

837
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,001
Do it honorably.

838
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,803
-His is G.T.T.T. right?
-Yeah.

839
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,937
One, two, three.

840
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:26,838
-Great.
-Work.

841
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,311
HMM?

842
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,450
THEY'LL THINK UNTIL THE NEW YEAR

843
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,018
This is too funny,

844
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,152
Here we go again.

845
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,588
One, two, three.

846
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,789
-Great.
-Work.

847
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,591
-Pronounce it well.
-Come on.

848
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,525
What did you say?

849
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,260
-I did it.
-Say it properly.

850
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,528
One, two, three.

851
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,429
-Great.
-Work.

852
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,465
-Come on.
-I said it right. She heard it.

853
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,666
-So you heard it.
-Great.

854
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,800
Yeah, she heard it.

855
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,169
I have no clue.

856
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,704
-If you know--
-Hang on.

857
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,372
Raise your right hand.

858
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,607
Work hard with sincerity.

859
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:04,676
That's correct.

860
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,211
-What's his?
-Great talent takes time.

861
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,178
Darn it!

862
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,547
Lalala soda pop

863
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:10,715
Lalala lalala

864
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,016
WOO-YOUNG WINS

865
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,351
SO CLOSE

866
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,186
That was such an easy one too.

867
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,955
-Yours was hard.
-Yeah.

868
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:17,889
HONG, JANG

869
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:18,990
-Woo-young.
-Okay.

870
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,258
JIN-KYUNG, WOO-YOUNG
MAKE IT TO THE SEMI-FINAL

871
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,194
You know, two unexpected players advanced

872
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,829
from the preliminary round.

873
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,397
Yeah, they did.

874
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,399
CAN'T REFUTE WHAT IS KIND OF RIGHT

875
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,135
We weren't expecting this kind of bracket.

876
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,570
Oh, they have to win to
play against Woo-jae.

877
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:33,738
That's right.

878
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,607
This one's Jin-kyung's.

879
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,142
CONFIRMING THE IDIOM BEFOREHAND

880
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,177
Okay. Got it.

881
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,479
He got it immediately since he's educated.

882
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,549
I know this one.

883
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,719
All right. Please show
proper decorum to one another.

884
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,854
You can't throw coffee
at the other person.

885
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:54,192
Just drink the coffee before you
as if you were enjoying a tea ceremony.

886
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,694
The bystanders can just take a nap.

887
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,829
All right. First of all--

888
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,330
I'll see how this game goes.

889
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,431
Attention.

890
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,933
Bow.

891
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,901
THE SEMI-FINAL

892
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,069
Let's remove the saucers. All right.

893
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,573
Each time you place the cup on the table,
you lose a point.

894
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,675
If your cup touches the table,

895
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,479
you have to reveal the first initial.
Understood?

896
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,514
All right. Relax and get started.

897
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,782
ENJOY THE TEA CEREMONY

898
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,785
-Nice to meet you.
-Remove it from the table.

899
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,821
-What's your name?
-Don't place it here.

900
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,055
What's your name?

901
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,089
-Me?
-Yes.

902
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,593
EVEN INTRODUCING THEMSELVES IS TOUGH
ON THIS DATE

903
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,562
Can you please tell me your name?

904
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,896
I'm cramping up.

905
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,364
Oh, Cramping Up is your name?

906
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,999
HER NAME MADE HIM DRINK UP

907
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,534
Your holding your cup backwards.

908
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:37,435
No, that's right.

909
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,670
-Let's see.
-I can't see.

910
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,338
-No, he's holding it right.
-Yeah.

911
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,873
WHY IS SHE PICKING ON ME?
I'M HOLDING IT RIGHT

912
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,276
THE DATE IS ABOUT TO BE RUINED
AFTER A SHORT WHILE

913
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,945
I'm done.

914
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,346
INSTEAD OF HIDING IT THIS TIME,
HE GOES HEAD ON

915
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,581
HIS INITIALS: T.H.G.F.

916
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,083
I finished mine.

917
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,351
Hurry up and look.

918
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,519
WHATEVER
I'LL DRINK MINE UP TOO

919
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,453
HER INITIALS: S.H.S.T.

920
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,257
BOTH OF THEM BOLDLY DRINK UP

921
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,458
Geez.

922
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,459
Woo-young!

923
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,528
DID HE GET IT AS SOON AS HE SAW IT?

924
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,495
No, that's not it.

925
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,532
Darn it. That's not right.

926
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,367
Is this right? "Stick to one's guns"?

927
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,237
-It's wrong, isn't it?
-Have more coffee.

928
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,539
-His coffee is refilled.
-When did you do it?

929
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,274
SCRIBBLING

930
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,508
What did you see?

931
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,277
T.H.H.F.

932
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,714
She misread it.

933
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,149
She didn't pronounce
those letters correctly, did she?

934
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,551
It should be Tee and Aitch.

935
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,888
Can you not?

936
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,090
-Hey, you're--
-Did you finish your drink?

937
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,258
She pronounced it Tae and Itch.

938
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,392
Yes, she finished hers.

939
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,160
If you did, can't you show it to me again?

940
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,697
-No, I can't.
-Really?

941
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,598
The time is…

942
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,800
-Let's take a nap.
-Look from up close.

943
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,069
-Are you sleepy?
-Shouldn't they say, "One hour later"?

944
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,004
Sleep again?

945
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,074
-All right.
-Are they done?

946
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,943
-Some time has passed,
-Did they get it?

947
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,311
so on the count of three,

948
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,947
you must both say your first word. Okay?

949
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,448
One, two, three.

950
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,449
-To.
-Student.

951
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,519
To?

952
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,587
To…

953
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,488
Woo-young.

954
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,391
The student has surpassed the teacher.

955
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,292
That's correct.

956
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,428
-Woo-young's good.
-Lalala soda pop

957
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,263
To have…

958
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,265
-To have…
-It was teacher.

959
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,833
To have…

960
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,734
SHE'S STILL TRYING TO GUESS IT

961
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,137
To have…

962
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:20,638
To have good foresight.

963
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,806
Oh, to have good foresight.

964
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:26,477
SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING UNTIL THE END
SO THERE'S NOTHING TO REGRET

965
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,979
He's good at things like this.

966
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,447
He's surprisingly good.

967
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,548
Woo-young is good.

968
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,318
I think I finally found
a game that I'm good at.

969
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,819
I get to play against Woo-jae!

970
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,654
I can't believe I'm playing against him.

971
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,657
This is an honor in my family.

972
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,292
I get to play against Woo-jae

973
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,328
on Screwballs.

974
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,395
It's okay if I lose.

975
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,999
-I don't have to win.
-No, you should win everything.

976
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:48,967
This is such an honor.

977
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,835
Woo-jae gets four points even if he loses.

978
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:51,736
Just because.

979
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,438
That's how luck works.

980
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,405
ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH ABOUT LIFE?

981
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,075
-You secured second place at least, right?
-Right.

982
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,478
All right. Please greet each other.

983
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,813
Just casually drink your coffee.

984
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,381
-That was a very good bow.
-Darn.

985
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,782
That's a foul.

986
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:05,883
-Don't say that.
-Yeah.

987
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,518
-It's offensive.
-That's bad manners.

988
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,821
THE REF IS EXTRA STRICT
TO THE WINNER OF THE BYE

989
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:11,856
ONE AUDIENCE MEMBER LOOKS SATISFIED

990
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,191
Give him a penalty.

991
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,225
A penalty.

992
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,693
What kind of penalty is it?

993
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,062
If you say something like that again,

994
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,264
-you must reveal the first initial. Okay?
-Okay.

995
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,632
THE FINAL MATCH BEGINS

996
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:22,734
Hold your cups.

997
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,202
Clink.

998
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,537
-Do a love shot.
-Oh.

999
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,106
-I wanted to do that too.
-Love shot.

1000
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,707
OH I WANTED TO DO THAT TOO

1001
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,277
THE TWO MALE VILLAINS SIT
ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER

1002
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,714
Don't stick your tongue out.

1003
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,387
SNUGGLING

1004
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,155
His arm is very warm.

1005
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,057
-As our skins touch--
-He's very soft.

1006
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,694
THEIR LOVE SHOT IS
THE MOST DISGUSTING ONE OUT THERE

1007
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,229
Okay, unlink your arms.

1008
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,233
-Woo-young finished his drink.
-He saw it.

1009
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,334
-He saw it.
-No, I didn't.

1010
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,568
-I think he saw.
-Did you?

1011
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,804
-Oh. No.
-You didn't see it?

1012
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,807
STUCK TO THE TABLE

1013
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,277
SINCE HE MADE IT TO THE FINAL,
HE WANTS TO WIN FOR ONCE

1014
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,347
BUT HE IS UP AGAINST JOO WOO-JAE

1015
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,759
WHO KNEW THERE'D COME A DAY
WHEN WOO-YOUNG TAUNTS WOO-JAE

1016
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,860
He isn't moving.

1017
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,062
THE PROBLEM IS THAT
HE DIDN'T SEE IT EITHER

1018
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,996
Didn't you see it?

1019
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,197
-No.
-I can't see it.

1020
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,533
Man, these guys are being petty.

1021
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,434
I got it.

1022
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,768
Learning from the past.

1023
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,669
Darn.

1024
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,870
THAT IS CORRECT

1025
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:33,971
-Didn't you see?
-Woo-jae.

1026
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,174
-Hang on.
-He didn't finish it.

1027
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,074
He didn't finish it.

1028
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,510
THE RULE IS
TO FINISH THE DRINK THEN ANSWER

1029
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,312
You didn't see it.
What are you going to do?

1030
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,281
I can fill it and drink it up again.

1031
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,417
-He needs a penalty.
-You must tell him your first word.

1032
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,552
-One word.
-Fill it up.

1033
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,553
Just the first word.

1034
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,089
Only the first word. One, two, three.

1035
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,023
-Learning.
-Run.

1036
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,225
Woo-young!

1037
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,262
Run in the family.

1038
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,099
Run in the family.

1039
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,302
-Learning from the past.
-Darn.

1040
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,870
-Learning from the past.
-Sae-ho!

1041
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,938
-What?
-That's correct!

1042
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,072
Why did you do that one?

1043
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,640
When did you see his?

1044
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,742
I guessed it from just L and F.

1045
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,212
Geez. I knew he was going to guess it.

1046
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,179
Why'd you do that one?

1047
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,848
You should've picked a tough one.

1048
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,283
His was "Run around in confusion." Tough.

1049
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,986
I told you to do the other one
since it's difficult.

1050
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,022
WHAT'S THE POINT OF REGRETTING IT NOW?
HE ALREADY WON

1051
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,324
Why is life like this?

1052
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,427
Why does it only shine on me?

1053
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,664
-How would he know?
-How did he get it from L and F?

1054
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,600
-He's a genius.
-He's not human.

1055
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,201
I want to live in the shadows too.

1056
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,570
If there is light and shadow,

1057
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,938
why am I always in the light?

1058
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,707
CLOSING IN ON HIM
SO HE CAN GET SOME ONLINE CRITICISM

1059
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,175
Why does the light always shine on me?

1060
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,311
-Get lost.
-Yeah. He's so annoying.

1061
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,682
-Anyway, Woo-jae is the final winner.
-He got five points.

1062
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,683
He got five points.

1063
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,651
Woo-young gets four.

1064
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,654
For third, fourth, and fifth place,
we'll have a three-way battle.

1065
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,956
-A three-way battle? Sitting like this?
-Yes.

1066
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,525
-You'll sit in a triangle.
-Okay.

1067
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:04,462
Let's make it easy
and have the staff give us the idioms.

1068
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,197
We'll randomly pick one of them.

1069
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,698
Okay.

1070
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,334
WHAT KIND OF IDIOMS
WILL THERE BE IN THE THREE-WAY BATTLE

1071
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,004
-All right. Please clink your cups.
-Let's do this.

1072
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,672
Okay. Clink your cups.

1073
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,874
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1074
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,476
Let us begin shortly.

1075
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,577
Wait.

1076
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,245
Wait. I didn't say you can start yet.

1077
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,313
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

1078
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,282
The cup cannot go below the table.

1079
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,150
It can't touch this either.

1080
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,819
The cups can't touch the table either.

1081
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,454
After a certain amount of time,

1082
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,024
you have to say your first word
at the same time

1083
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,625
as before.

1084
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,227
But we don't know ours either.

1085
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,629
-They don't know their own idioms?
-We don't.

1086
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,797
-You have no clue?
-No clue.

1087
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,066
-You didn't even see what yours was?
-No.

1088
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,335
THEY JUST GRABBED WHAT WAS IN FRONT

1089
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,971
-It might be for the best.
-That's not a bad idea.

1090
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,839
Let's begin. One, two, three.

1091
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,075
Here we go. We got this!

1092
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,143
This one is…

1093
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,711
AS SOON AS THEY CLINK,
THEY START PROBING

1094
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,013
This one is really going to last an hour.

1095
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,416
THE REF IS PROBING AS WELL

1096
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,219
THE STAFF JOINS IN ON THE PROBING TOO

1097
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,288
What kind of game
makes the ref and the producer do this?

1098
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,489
NO ONE KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THE GAME

1099
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,624
We're all doing this.

1100
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,828
DRINKING THEIR TEA
WHILE PROTECTING THEIR CUP

1101
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:15,866
BUT THEY HAVE TO DOUBLE THE EFFORT

1102
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,902
IT'S GOING TO END UP LIKE THIS

1103
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,103
What is it?

1104
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,872
One hour later.

1105
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,442
What is it?

1106
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:26,777
NOT EVEN 1 OUNCE OF EXCITEMENT IN THE GAME

1107
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,479
Drink your tea already.

1108
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,647
Drink it up.

1109
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,651
JIN-KYUNG'S IDIOM PEEKS OUT A LITTLE

1110
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,453
I saw hers, but I don't know what it is.

1111
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,189
What is it? If you tell me,
we can attack her together.

1112
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,557
T.T.A.T.

1113
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,325
-It's T.T.A.T.?
-Yeah.

1114
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,393
I don't know what it is.

1115
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,295
We don't know the answers either though.

1116
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,696
Jin-kyung doesn't know it either.

1117
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,665
SINCE SHE DOESN'T KNOW HER OWN,
SHE DOESN'T FEEL THREATENED

1118
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,035
-T.T.A.T.?
-Yeah.

1119
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,603
T.T.A.T.

1120
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,505
-Is it easy?
-Is it easy?

1121
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,173
Even elementary school kids know it.

1122
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,376
T…

1123
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,846
No need to guess your own.

1124
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,215
T.T.A.O.?

1125
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,916
What is it? It's too hard.

1126
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,351
It's too hard.

1127
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,953
-T.T.A.T.?
-What could it be?

1128
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,954
What is it?

1129
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,122
What is that?

1130
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,923
WHAT IS IT

1131
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,760
THEY DON'T KNOW MINE YET
SO I HAVE TO KEEP IT HIDDEN

1132
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,296
We use this often in our daily lives.

1133
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,597
-Really?
-Yes.

1134
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,765
-We say it often?
-Yes.

1135
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,699
BOTTOMS UP

1136
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,567
E.C.S.L.

1137
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,136
MINE IS E.C.S.L.

1138
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,170
I finished mine.

1139
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,306
WHY IS HE DRINKING HIS UP TOO?

1140
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,807
N.S.O.P.

1141
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,876
Show me yours.
Let's take a look at it together.

1142
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,911
-I finished mine.
-One, two, three.

1143
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,913
SURE, I'LL SHOW YOU

1144
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,015
Their chat alone
feels like a low-tier one.

1145
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,918
The way he said, "Let me see yours."

1146
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,520
THE GAME OF THE LOW-TIER VILLAINS
IS ALL-OVER-THE-PLACE

1147
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,255
Is hers easy as well?

1148
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,189
All three are easy.

1149
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,658
-E.C.S.L.?
-N.S.O.P.

1150
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,393
N.S.O.P.

1151
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,594
Oh, what the heck?

1152
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,163
-They're so easy.
-They really are.

1153
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,264
Whose is? Sook's?

1154
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,165
I don't know either.

1155
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,800
N.S.O.P.?

1156
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,403
WANTING TO CRY

1157
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,706
This is going to need "One day later."

1158
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,275
THEY PREPARE FOR 1 DAY LATER

1159
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,844
AND SO, THE PRECIOUS DAY
AT GANGJIN IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE

1160
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,347
OKAY, MORNING HAS ARRIVED

1161
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,414
What's hers?

1162
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,249
T.T.A.T.?

1163
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,284
Top tier…

1164
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,419
HE IS STILL TRYING TO GUESS IT TOO

1165
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,388
How about a hint?

1166
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,889
-Yes, the first word please.
-Okay.

1167
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,524
-Yes.
-At the count of three…

1168
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,393
-You don't know your own.
-We don't know.

1169
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,195
-What on earth?
-Just tell us.

1170
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,030
-Just give us the three words.
-Okay.

1171
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,699
-I'll start from Sook then.
-Okay.

1172
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,401
Every. No. Through.

1173
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,802
-Sae-ho!
-The answer?

1174
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,305
-Every cloud has a silver lining.
-I know! Through thick and thin.

1175
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,040
Both of you are correct.

1176
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,075
You're last place!

1177
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,944
JIN-KYUNG IS CONFIRMED AS LAST PLACE

1178
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,312
What's yours, Sae-ho?

1179
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,247
-Mine? I don't know.
-What's his?

1180
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,349
-No sense of propriety.
-Oh, no sense of propriety.

1181
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,250
What's mine?

1182
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,185
-Through thick and thin.
-We already got it.

1183
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,454
-Wow.
-Since it was T.T.A.T.--

1184
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,856
What a peaceful game.

1185
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,758
-I saw hers but didn't get it.
-Me neither.

1186
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,327
And so, all the games are complete.

1187
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,129
Woo-jae won the games
at the place of exile

1188
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,263
-with 12 points.
-So easy.

1189
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,198
Easy.

1190
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,601
Second place is Woo-young with 11 points.

1191
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:04,769
2ND PLACE WOO-YOUNG
11 POINTS

1192
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,103
Sae-ho is third with 10 points.

1193
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,471
3RD PLACE SAE-HO
10 POINTS

1194
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,906
Fourth place

1195
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,775
-is Sook with nine points.
-Okay.

1196
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,911
Fifth place is Jin-kyung
with three points.

1197
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,813
5TH PLACE JIN-KYUNG
3 POINTS

1198
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,049
THE EXILED LIFE OF THE VILLAINS
IS COMING TO AN END

1199
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,918
For carrying out
his life of exile diligently,

1200
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,654
and coming in first,
you can say he was a model inmate.

1201
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,757
Woo-jae may end his exile immediately.

1202
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,461
In Gau-do, there's the ZipTrek
that connects to the mainland.

1203
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,762
-What's a ZipTrek?
-It's a zipline.

1204
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:32,830
Oh, a zipline?

1205
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,031
He rides it well.

1206
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,833
-He likes it.
-You can take that

1207
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,436
to the mainland and get some rest.

1208
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,437
Okay!

1209
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,905
I want to zipline too.

1210
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,239
What will second and third get?

1211
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,374
I don't want to zipline.

1212
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,075
Have you heard of SUP?

1213
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,777
-SUP?
-Yes.

1214
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,514
It's the initials for
stand up paddleboard.

1215
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,383
That is really fun!

1216
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,418
-You have to row.
-You do it while standing.

1217
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,353
You can stand, sit,

1218
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,955
or some even lie down these days.

1219
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,690
-Oh, that SUP?
-Yeah, stand up paddleboard.

1220
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,025
I was wondering what it was.

1221
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,493
You like that, don't you?

1222
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,328
I bet we'll all fall in the water.

1223
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,498
Sook who's in fourth place
and Jin-kyung who's in fifth place must--

1224
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,799
To the wilderness?

1225
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,502
There's a family that
raises 40 chickens around here.

1226
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:15,573
THERE'S A FAMILY THAT RAISES
40 CHICKENS AROUND HERE

1227
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,976
I was really going to help them out,
but I can't do this one.

1228
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,377
-Hang on.
-Let's play in the water.

1229
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,547
-Why are they raising 40 chickens?
-The water sounds fun.

1230
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,416
-It seems fun.
-So what about the 40 chickens?

1231
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,818
You'll go over to that house

1232
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,288
and take a selfie
while holding the chicken.

1233
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,257
SELFIE WITH THE CHICKEN

1234
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,658
When you complete that mission…

1235
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,427
Not next to it, but while carrying it?

1236
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,528
Yes, they must catch it.

1237
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,196
-Like this?
-No, with both hands.

1238
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,498
Chickens are super fast.

1239
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:41,732
This is unbelievable.

1240
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,068
All the chickens
are going to run away from her.

1241
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,705
EVEN CHICKENS HAVE EYES

1242
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,441
The two of us walking around together
isn't the best look today.

1243
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,577
You know what? You can grab
Jin-kyung's hair and take a selfie.

1244
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,112
She is like a chicken.

1245
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,547
You can catch it, right?

1246
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,982
NO WAY

1247
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,417
-On a paddleboard--
-We'll fall in the water.

1248
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,353
It may be easier than the wilderness,

1249
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,355
but it may take some time to get there.

1250
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,891
But in the wilderness mission,
they can just catch a chicken.

1251
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,058
If they can catch it fast,

1252
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,394
-it may end quickly.
-You may leave when I leave.

1253
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,296
-Then, I want to catch one fast.
-Yeah.

1254
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,031
-Let's do the chicken thing.
-Let's do it.

1255
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,099
Can both of you do it?

1256
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,333
I was going to do it for you.

1257
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,269
-No, I'm going to do it fast.
-Okay.

1258
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,737
Are you ready, Jin-kyung?

1259
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,372
-Let's get going.
-Let's hurry too.

1260
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,307
Man, ziplining is going to be fun.

1261
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,975
Chickens are scarier than you think.

1262
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,679
-Isn't it nice and cool, Sook?
-Yeah.

1263
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,115
How is it this cool?

1264
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,416
What a nice sea breeze.

1265
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,151
IN THE PEACEFUL ISLAND OF GAU-DO,

1266
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,354
THERE IS A FAMILY OF 40 CHICKENS

1267
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,227
BUT THERE ARE SOME
WHO ARE TRYING TO DISRUPT THIS PEACE

1268
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,361
Where are you going?

1269
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,363
To catch some chicken.

1270
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,899
At the count of three,
say "To catch chicken."

1271
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,134
Where are you going?

1272
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,570
-To catch chicken.
-To catch chicken.

1273
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,443
-Let's do it quickly.
-Okay.

1274
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,245
It's nothing.

1275
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,514
Yeah, let's be the first to get out.

1276
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,683
We are villains after all.

1277
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,651
THE SCARY VILLAINS HAVE COME
TO RECEIVE THEIR PUNISHMENT

1278
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,154
-My goodness. Look at the pretty flowers.
-Oh, my.

1279
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,656
-They really are pretty.
-They're so pretty.

1280
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,725
WHO KNEW THE ROAD TO CATCHING CHICKENS
COULD BE THIS BEAUTIFUL?

1281
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,027
The view is amazing.

1282
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,130
Your hair kind of
blends in with the trees.

1283
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,666
CAMOUFLAGE COLORS

1284
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,101
Gosh, your hair…

1285
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,370
Your hair kind of looks like the trees.

1286
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,240
Is that them? One is outside.

1287
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,743
-What the heck?
-We'll get it in no time.

1288
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,511
COME AND GET ME

1289
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,315
EXTRAORDINARY SET OF CLAWS

1290
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,518
FEARLESS GAZE

1291
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,321
We'll be quick.
Is it okay if it isn't funny?

1292
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,423
We'll get it fast.

1293
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,758
If we catch it, we get to leave?

1294
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,226
THEY ARE SURPRISINGLY CONFIDENT

1295
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,794
Let's get one right away.

1296
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,763
It'll be a piece of cake.

1297
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,265
What? Where did they go?
They went up the mountain.

1298
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,500
BUT WHERE ARE THE CHICKENS?

1299
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,668
They're all up there.

1300
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,604
THE CHICKENS ARE RATHER SURPRISED

1301
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,072
We'll get it fast.

1302
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,374
WAIT RIGHT THERE

1303
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,977
BUT THE CHICKENS LOOK PRETTY SCARY TOO

1304
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,513
THE TENSION IS PALPABLE

1305
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,618
You get one first, Sook.

1306
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,654
SCARED

1307
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,622
-I'll take your photo.
-Okay.

1308
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,424
LAUGHING

1309
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,825
Doggone it. What's that?

1310
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,762
JUST A CHICKEN PASSING BY

1311
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,163
I'm coming in.

1312
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,064
THE BIG SIS GIVES IT A SHOT

1313
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,500
HESITANT

1314
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,771
SHE SUCCEEDED IN ENTERING THE CHICKEN COOP

1315
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,407
No, come here.

1316
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:38,142
Hey.

1317
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,176
Jin-kyung.

1318
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,978
-Should I go first?
-They're so scary.

1319
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,413
-So scary.
-Should I go first?

1320
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,348
Get the one that's up there.

1321
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:49,319
THE LITTLE SIS ENTERS AGAIN

1322
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,155
You catch one first.

1323
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,492
THE FLEETING SISTERLY LOVE
OF THE SCAREDY-CATS

1324
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:57,528
Go ahead, Sook.

1325
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,163
-Okay.
-Come over here.

1326
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,900
Hey, grab it from the entrance here.

1327
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,134
-Okay.
-Catch it from here.

1328
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,170
I'll steer them to you. Come here.

1329
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,372
I'm really going to catch one this time.

1330
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,674
-Catch it at the entrance.
-Okay.

1331
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,912
First of all, I'd like to
apologize to our viewers.

1332
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,514
MEANWHILE, THIS GUY IS STRUTTING AROUND
AFTER BEING IN 1ST PLACE

1333
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:18,849
You see,

1334
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,018
I'd like to come in at a rank

1335
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:24,054
other than first place too.

1336
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,590
I don't feel that bad for our members,
but I do feel very bad

1337
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,058
for our viewers.

1338
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,359
Once again, I am sorry.

1339
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,462
A PUBLIC APOLOGY TO THE WHOLE NATION

1340
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,897
I heard it's pretty long.

1341
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,165
THE WAY TO GAU-DO'S ZIPLINE

1342
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,633
THE ZIPLINE IS 973 METERS LONG

1343
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,735
It's almost a kilometer?

1344
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,003
I have always

1345
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,139
hated gravity.

1346
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,975
WHAT CONCEPT IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

1347
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,376
I have always hated the fact that

1348
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,179
my two feet had to be
planted on something.

1349
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,381
The time when only Gangjin's ocean

1350
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,150
will be beneath my feet.

1351
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,185
I'm going to fly.

1352
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,321
HE FULFILLS HIS DREAM OF FLYING IN GANGJIN

1353
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,489
For 970 meters.

1354
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,893
Not even a sparrow can easily do that.

1355
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,094
NOT EVEN A SPARROW CAN EASILY DO THAT

1356
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,663
This must be it.

1357
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,898
ARRIVED AT HIS DESTINATION

1358
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,166
Monorail?

1359
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,034
TAKING A MONORAIL UP THERE?

1360
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,169
Hello.

1361
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,871
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO HIGH

1362
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,174
Sir, how high is the zipline?

1363
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,609
This mountain is 100 meters.

1364
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,547
So it's about 120 meters
from the sixth floor.

1365
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,083
What? It goes up to 100 meters?

1366
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,085
This mountain is 100 meters

1367
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,621
and you can go down from up there.

1368
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,724
APPROXIMATELY THE SAME HEIGHT
AS A 40-STORY APARTMENT

1369
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,728
That's not the height I was expecting.

1370
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,629
One hundred…

1371
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,931
He said it's 100 meters.

1372
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,534
The height is 100 meters.

1373
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,370
It isn't the height I was expecting.

1374
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:47,838
A BIT SCARED

1375
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,307
Do ziplines go up that high?

1376
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:54,278
When you go down, they don't push you.
You just fall.

1377
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,680
That isn't ziplining then.

1378
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,549
THAT ISN'T ZIPLINING THEN

1379
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:04,454
ANYWAY IT IS THE DESTINY OF
THE 1ST PLACE TO GO UP

1380
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,491
It isn't the height of the one
we took in Busan.

1381
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:11,061
You know that
a person would die if they fall

1382
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,429
from this height, right?

1383
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,998
Let's enjoy paddle boarding.

1384
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,801
You know, I got second place

1385
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,037
-fair and square
-Yeah.

1386
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,407
-by winning the games, right?
-You did.

1387
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,076
So the second and third place
should be different.

1388
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,911
Sure. You can take the nicer one.

1389
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,613
Okay?

1390
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,049
So why is it like this?

1391
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,584
HE KEEPS STAMMERING ON

1392
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,152
-Hello.
-Hello.

1393
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,421
How adorable.

1394
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,989
THEY ARRIVED AT THE SUP BOARDING DOCK!

1395
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,661
A SPECIAL MOMENT
WHERE LOCAL MEETS ISLAND ACTIVITIES

1396
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,596
GAU-DO'S NEW REFRESHING ACTIVITY

1397
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:49,032
The two of you who came in
second and third place will get to enjoy

1398
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,634
Gau-do's new refreshing SUP experience.

1399
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,803
While you enjoy the beauties of Gau-do

1400
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,905
on the stand up paddleboard,

1401
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,741
you'll also have to do
the Apologize With Your Body mission.

1402
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,076
Can't we just enjoy it?

1403
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:05,249
CAN'T LET THE EXILED VILLAINS
JUST LEISURELY ENJOY THEMSELVES

1404
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,152
While on the paddleboard in the sea,
you must use your body to make

1405
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,456
the Korean letters jieut and siot
as an apology.

1406
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,057
That was well thought out.

1407
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,628
As the second place,
why don't you pick the letter you want.

1408
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:18,862
I'll do jieut.

1409
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:19,830
Then, I'll do siot.

1410
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,432
FOR YOUR REFERENCE

1411
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,302
DURING THE SIMULATION

1412
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,938
THE STAFF FELL IN THE WATER
PLENTY OF TIMES

1413
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,539
Oh, no.

1414
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,441
I've never done paddle boarding.

1415
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,576
CAN THEY DO IT WITHOUT FALLING IN?

1416
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,444
-I'm excited. I wanted to try it.
-Is it done?

1417
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,146
CARRIED OUT SAFELY
UNDER AN EXPERT'S GUIDANCE

1418
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,182
SAE-HO IS FIRST TO GO

1419
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,319
HE CAREFULLY GETS ON THE BOARD

1420
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,757
WOBBLING

1421
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,426
I'll give you the paddle now.

1422
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,794
HE SUCCESSFULLY GOT ON BOARD

1423
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,530
The paddle is th-th-this?

1424
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,765
Yes.

1425
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,302
The wind is pretty strong today.

1426
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,203
The current is pretty strong right now.

1427
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,438
-Right?
-So be careful.

1428
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,173
CAN HE STAND IN THIS STRONG CURRENT?

1429
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,675
You have to turn it like this.

1430
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,944
Why? To face the camera.

1431
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,512
TO FACE THE CAMERA

1432
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:09,680
Also, from here…

1433
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,048
STANDING UP

1434
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,249
Also, from here…

1435
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,419
You can just stand like this.

1436
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,386
You're good.

1437
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,622
Good job.

1438
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,756
Just ride it like this.

1439
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:20,857
HEY, HE'S GOOD AT IT

1440
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,492
You're good, Sae-ho.

1441
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,696
SMILING PROUDLY

1442
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,031
Should I turn my body towards the camera?

1443
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:29,366
No, just keep going.

1444
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,867
Just keep going.

1445
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,035
WHO CARES WHAT THEY SAY

1446
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,372
SAE-HO GOT ON THE BOARD EASILY

1447
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:37,407
Wow. I really wanted to try this.

1448
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,408
WOO-YOUNG ALSO BOARDS

1449
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:39,876
Kneel.

1450
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,546
I think you'll be good at it.

1451
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,915
-Can I go like this?
-Yeah.

1452
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,884
HE BOARDS EASILY

1453
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,785
And then…

1454
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,821
SHOULD I STAND UP AS WELL?

1455
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,255
Hold this and stand up?

1456
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,693
Wow! It feels totally different.

1457
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,562
WOO-YOUNG ALSO EASILY STANDS

1458
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,131
THEY'RE BOTH DOING WELL

1459
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:04,001
They're startled because
we're doing better than they expected.

1460
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,736
-Why are you doing so well?
-You're good.

1461
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,538
-Shall we do the pose?
-The pose?

1462
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,240
Wow.

1463
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,245
What?

1464
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,482
HE SUCCEEDS IMMEDIATELY

1465
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:19,483
-Did I do it?
-But

1466
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,318
you have to do it at the same time.

1467
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,253
HE IS JUST HAVING FUN

1468
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,523
-Isn't it fun?
-Yeah, this is fun.

1469
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,392
-Okay. This is good.
-Okay.

1470
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,394
-Here we go.
-Okay.

1471
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,629
ONCE AGAIN, SAE-HO DOES IT EASILY

1472
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,500
WOO-YOUNG HAS TO SUCCEED NOW

1473
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,802
CAN HE DO IT?

1474
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,807
JIEUT SIOT

1475
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,077
LAUNCHING A POWERFUL APOLOGY

1476
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,713
-You succeeded.
-Okay!

1477
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,680
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

1478
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,716
Your exile ended

1479
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,385
but you can stay on the paddleboard longer
if you want to.

1480
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,287
I want to keep doing it
until they're done.

1481
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,822
SO THEY DECIDE TO
ENJOY THE OCEAN FOR A LITTLE LONGER

1482
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,692
He is enjoying the sport
and he is a stowaway.

1483
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,361
ONE IS ENJOYING THE SPORT
THE OTHER IS A STOWAWAY

1484
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,796
He's stowing away.

1485
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,297
CALL THE MARITIME POLICE
TO REPORT STOWAWAYS

1486
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:08,799
Where are you going?

1487
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,834
Hey, I'm going home.

1488
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,137
WHILE A FAMOUS CELEBRITY
ATTEMPTS TO STOW AWAY

1489
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,672
GAU VILLAGE

1490
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,808
Ji-Jin-kyung, get it!

1491
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,012
JI-JIN-KYUNG, GET IT!

1492
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,880
Jin-kyung, get it!

1493
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,248
Jin-kyung!

1494
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:26,783
Get it. Jin-kyung.

1495
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,185
Right now!

1496
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,953
-Hey!
-Right now!

1497
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,088
Jin-kyung.

1498
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,923
-Go, go.
-This is insane.

1499
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,391
-Jin-kyung.
-I'm catching it.

1500
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,592
-Jin-kyung.
-I'm getting it.

1501
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,494
I'm really going to catch it this time.

1502
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,831
THEN, I'LL TRUST YOU
AND LET THE CHICKEN OUT

1503
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,899
RUN AWAY

1504
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,802
-Here they go, Jin-kyung.
-Here they come!

1505
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:46,903
Here they go, Jin-kyung.

1506
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,139
BUT THE CHICKEN WON'T GO OUT SO EASILY

1507
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:51,208
-This is driving me nuts.
-This is insane.

1508
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,143
Geez. I'm so scared.

1509
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,211
Jin-kyung.

1510
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:55,912
Jin-kyung, let's go.

1511
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,647
AM I JIN-KYUNG?

1512
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:58,982
This isn't working.

1513
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:01,451
Jin-kyung, Jin-kyung, Jin-kyung!

1514
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,087
-Jin-kyung.
-Get it.

1515
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,423
Gosh, Jin-kyung.

1516
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,426
SHE SUCCEEDS IN CATCHING JIN-KYUNG

1517
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,428
She got it. Sook got it.

1518
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,363
-Jin-kyung.
-Take a picture.

1519
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,331
She caught it.

1520
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,398
-Jin-kyung.
-Eun-young.

1521
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,033
-Hurry up and take a photo.
-Come out.

1522
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,269
-My goodness. Good job.
-How did you catch it?

1523
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,271
-Jin-kyung, where's the camera?
-You're awesome.

1524
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,374
#GOOD TIMES #WITH NICE CHICKENS

1525
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,408
You hold it this time.

1526
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,676
Hold it from the bottom.

1527
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:27,844
TRY HOLDING IT, JIN-KYUNG

1528
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,446
One, two, three.

1529
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,881
#WE ARE CLOSE

1530
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:33,383
#AWESOME GANGJIN

1531
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,153
I know, I know. Okay.

1532
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,523
ACTING ALL BUDDY-BUDDY
AS IF THEY LIKED IT ALL ALONG

1533
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,124
I'm putting it down now.

1534
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:48,098
HOPING THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE THREE
LAST FOREVER

1535
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,535
Someone has to ride along
if you weigh less than 50 kilograms?

1536
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,703
I barely go over.

1537
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,972
Well, you can do it.

1538
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,041
You can do it on your own.

1539
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:01,278
I think it's too long.

1540
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,379
It fits fine.

1541
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,382
FAILED IN DODGING IT

1542
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:09,119
If I fell,
this helmet won't really help me, will it?

1543
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,253
You'll land in water.

1544
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,288
Oh, the water.

1545
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,559
BREATHING HEAVILY

1546
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,660
It's pretty high.

1547
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,331
HE FINALLY ARRIVES
AT THE STARTING POINT OF THE ZIPLINE

1548
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,232
Oh, my.

1549
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,068
Please wait here.

1550
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,538
AS HE HEARD, IT IS EXTREMELY HIGH

1551
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:33,210
A LITTLE NERVOUS

1552
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:34,277
Let me explain.

1553
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:36,012
When I give the signal,

1554
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,981
-this door will open.
-Okay.

1555
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,217
When I ask you to sit, please sit.

1556
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,585
Then, you'll take off.

1557
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,719
Understood.

1558
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,724
I've relied on my fist for 40 years.

1559
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,293
I'm not afraid.

1560
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,228
SURE YOU AREN'T

1561
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:54,064
The door is about to open.
Please stand where you are.

1562
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,667
THE DOOR OPENS

1563
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,004
When I ask you to sit,
please stretch your legs out.

1564
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:02,973
-Okay.
-Please sit down.

1565
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,374
Stretch your legs forward.

1566
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,010
Stretch your legs forward.

1567
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,481
Wow!

1568
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,517
THE FEAR WAS ONLY MOMENTARY

1569
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:19,089
THE THRILLING RUSH FOLLOWS IMMEDIATELY

1570
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:26,563
A REFRESHING DESCENT!

1571
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,200
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN

1572
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,203
WHEN HE CUTS THROUGH THE AIR

1573
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,507
THE GANGJIN SEA
BRUSHES UP AGAINST THE TIP OF HIS NOSE

1574
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,744
Wow, I want to do this again.

1575
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,647
ENJOYING THE EXHILARATING WIND
TO THE FULL

1576
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,982
How can you hold it like that?

1577
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,051
I don't think I can hold it.

1578
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,185
It's all right.

1579
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,721
MAKING A COOL EXIT

1580
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,991
-It looks kind of creepy.
-Smile, Jin-kyung.

1581
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,594
Smile with the chicken.

1582
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,864
That was fun.

1583
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,399
That was really fun.

1584
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,366
Wait.

1585
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,502
THEY'RE STILL SCARED OF CHICKENS

1586
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,571
This is what Gangjin is all about!

1587
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,572
BUT EXILED LIFE IN GANGJIN WAS FUN

1588
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,143
THE CLUMSY EXILE DIARY OF THE VILLAINS

1589
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:17,547
THE END

1590
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:20,216
On the next episode of Screwballs.

1591
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,352
Farmhands are different from before.

1592
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,520
Hamilton and Copperfield.

1593
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,488
-I bought one from Cartier.
-What?

1594
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,257
The farmhand that worked hard,
take a leave.

1595
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,425
Farmhand holiday.

1596
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,760
I'm a dude. You get me, right?

1597
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,896
FROM DELICIOUS SOUTHERN FOOD

1598
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,597
TO ICE-COLD BEER

1599
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,299
ENJOY AS MUCH AS YOU WANT

1600
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,902
Of all the shows you do,
Screwballs is your favorite.

1601
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,871
Okay. You all raised your hand,
didn't you?

1602
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,106
I'm getting drunk.

1603
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,075
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE A HAPPY HOLIDAY

1604
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:46,009
He's really drunk.

1605
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,811
A DRUNKARD BARGES IN?

1606
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,546
-Just drink.
-Get lost, all of you!

1607
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,047
VOICES ARE RAISED

1608
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,883
THEY DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT OTHERS SAY

1609
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,219
THEIR RELATIONSHIP STARTS TO
UNRAVEL A LITTLE BIT

1610
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,655
ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING UP
WHILE ON VACATION?

1611
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:02,292
No one can beat me
when it comes to bad breath. For real.

1612
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,662
Perhaps you don't know this,
but shouldn't we just rest on a holiday?

1613
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,263
Just let us sweep the courtyard.

1614
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,433
I THOUGHT WE WERE ON VACATION

1615
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,103
WATER SHOW?

1616
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,270
What are you going to do?

1617
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,839
I can see his behind.

1618
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,307
What do we gain from this?

1619
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,209
Has he lost his mind?

1620
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,177
WHAT DID THE FARMHANDS
GAIN AND LOSE ON THEIR VACATION?

1621
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,116
