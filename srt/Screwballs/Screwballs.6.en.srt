1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:06,072
I'm looking for someone who can
lead the Dora-Group to a bright future.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,108

Let's move on.

11
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,792
Why bother with quizzes?
Let's dance the day away.

12
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,162
It's Horseback Quiz Show.

13
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,832
Mount your horses
and race from the starting line.

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,402
You'll have to get in a single file
in front of me.

15
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,603
I'll announce the prize money.

16
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,905

HERE THEY GO

25
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,856
GIDDY UP

26

GALLOPING ON THE SHORT LEGS

27
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,194
FIERCE COMPETITION TO GET AHEAD

HE-HE

29
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,932
WHITE MOCHI PASSES
THE THRESHOLD FIRST

30
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,136
-Head to the director.
-This is pretty difficult.

31
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,805
WITH THESE CHILDREN'S TOYS,
IT HELPS IF YOU'RE SHORT

32
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,473
Okay!

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,541
SHORT KING IS THE WINNER

34
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,409
Slide in after Sae-ho, Woo-jae.

35
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,746
RANKS: SAE-HO, WOO-JAE,
SOOK, WOO-YOUNG, JIN-KYUNG

36
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,849
-I'm worn out.
-I think I've gotten the hang of it.

37
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,685
WAY BACK BEHIND CHOO SUNG-HOON,
SOMEONE IS HYPERVENTILATING

38
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,822
A JOCKEY
WITH A SCRUNCHED UP FACE

39
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,957
SHE FINALLY MADE IT

40
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,094
-If you pause for three seconds--
-What? How long do I get?

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,896
Three seconds.
You're out if you get tongue-tied.

42
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,031
Here we go.

43
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,668
-What is he doing?
-Where are you going?

44
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,803
-I'm practicing.
-Oh, okay.

45
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,271
Okay, then.

46
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,640
Name five celebrities
with the last name Hong.

47
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,476
Hong Jin-hee, Hong Jin-kyung…

48
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,810
One, two…

49
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:51,911
-Hong Seok-cheon…
-One…

50
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,947
-Hong Seo-beom…
-One, two…

51
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,049
-You failed!
-Hong Ran-hui! Isn't there Ran-hui?

52
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,484
-Of course not.
-Ran-hui.

53
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,052
Ready, go.

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,055
Hong Jin-kyung, Hong Seo-beom,
Hong Rok-gi, Hong Seok-cheon,

55
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,123
and Hong Seo-beom.

56
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,292
-Wrong. You mentioned him already.
-I did? Dang it.

57
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,128
Hong Jin-kyung,
Hong Seo-beom, Hong Rok-gi,

58
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,230
Hong Seok-cheon, and Hong Ka-young.

59
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,866
"Hong Ka-young"? You failed!

60
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,034
Isn't there a celebrity named Ka-young?

61
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,436
Look it up, guys.

62
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,538
-I don't think so.
-But that name is so familiar to me.

63
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,673
-I'm sure of it.
-Okay, I get it.

64
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,908
There's an actress with that name!

65
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,810
Hong Jin-kyung,
Hong Seok-cheon, Hong Rok-gi,

66
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,212
Hong Seo-beom, and Hong Hak-pyo.

67
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,413
-What if…
-Correct.

68
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,483
I'm telling you. There is a Hong Ka-young.

69
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,751
Who is it then?

70
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,520
NERVOUSLY WANDERING GAZE

71
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,421
LET'S FIND OUT

72
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,024
THERE IS INDEED A CELEBRITY
NAMED HONG KA-YOUNG!

73
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,092
HONG KA-YOUNG, MODEL

74
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,460
I'm her fan, you know.

75
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,095
How old is she, roughly?

76
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,164
I believe she's about 30.

77
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,465
BORN IN 2003, SHE'S ONLY 22

78
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,300
THE SUPPOSED FAN
DOESN'T KNOW HER SO WELL

79
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,968
I got it right, okay?

80
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,305
Sook and Jin-kyung
will both receive the prize.

81
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,541
Come on, now. That's unacceptable.

82
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,909
Choose only one, okay?

83
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,377
Shut it. You too.

84
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,512
-I didn't say anything.
-You're making things messy.

85
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,682
-You earned 100 million, Jin-kyung.
-Got it.

86
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,817
Ready.

87
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,253
THE SECOND RACE BEGINS

88
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,056
LITTLE PONIES' GAZES
ARE FIXED AHEAD

89
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,124
Oh, shoot.

90
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,426
SO COMMANDING

91
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,929
WITH IMPECCABLE POSTURE

92
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,199
A DARING ESCAPADE
OF THE CHAEBOL HEIR WANNABE

93
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,501
-That was banging.
-Oh, man.

94
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,870
Turns out practice is a game changer.

95
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,939
He's gotten much faster
after that practice run.

96
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,907
Can I go take another round?

97
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,742
-This is so much fun.
-All right.

98
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,377
-Here's your question.
-Okay.

99
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,314
Name five film titles
that have "man" or "men" in them.

100
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,217
-Inside Men…
-One.

101
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,551
-Outside Men…
-Two?

102
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,886
Wrong.

103
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,288
-Off I roll.
-Ready, go.

104
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,791
Inside Men, Iron Man… Damn it.

105
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,192
You failed.

106
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,363
Inside Men, Iron Man,
Anchorman I, Anchorman II…

107
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,531
You timed out.

108
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,732
-I need five names?
-Yes.

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,900
I thought we had to name four.

110
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,669
Also, the first Anchorman movie
doesn't have a number at the end.

111
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,770
Gee, you're so thorough.

112
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,339
Please come closer.

113
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,840
-Ready, go.
-Inside Men,

114
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,442
All the King's Men,

115
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,509
Wonder Woman…

116
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,111
-One, two…
-Hollow Man…

117
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,013
One, two…

118
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,648
-You timed out.
-He wants five titles.

119
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,350
-Please go ahead.
-Inside Men, Iron Man,

120
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,119
All the King's Men, Wonder Woman,

121
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,988
and Men in Black I.

122
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,489
-Wrong.
-Come on.

123
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,825
The first Men in Black movie
wasn't numbered.

124
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,127
You should've gone with Men in Black II!

125
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,998
Inside Men, Iron Man,
the Birdman, a Company Man…

126
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,065
-Oh, man…
-You failed!

127
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,433
TIMED OUT

128
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,003
Am I an idiot or what?
I had them all figured out!

129
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,438
Iron Man, Inside Men,

130
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,440
-a Company Man…
-Dang. I just remembered.

131
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,575
Beat Coin… Oh, no.

132
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,143
-Wrong.
-Darn it.

133
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,379
I hope we do get a movie deal.

134
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,247
TAKING HIS OWN SWEET TIME

135
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,017
DOING ALL HE CAN
TO BUY EXTRA SECONDS

136
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,085
-Wait, I'm still getting there.
-Ready…

137
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,388
-Hold on. What do you think you're doing?
-One, two…

138
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,223
Come on, Director! I told you to hold.

139
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,891
A PALE GHOST APPEARS
AFTER THE WEIRDO

140
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,127
Inside Men, Iron Man,
Wonder Woman, All the King's Men,

141
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,928
and a Company Man Standing Next.

142
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,230
Wrong!

143
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,498
What?

144
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,166
You mashed up two titles together.

145
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,003
-What else is there?
-Ready, go.

146
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,906
Inside Men, The Man Standing Next,
a Company Man, Iron Man,

147
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,408
-and Wonder Woman.
-Correct!

148
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,209
SUCCESS

149
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,046
DISAPPOINTED

150
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,348
CURRENTLY OWNS 600 MILLION WON

151
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,551
CURRENTLY OWNS 1 MILLION WON

152
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,187
EVEN THE QUIZ SHOW ISN'T
GOING IN WOO-JAE'S FAVOR TODAY

153
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,022
Quizzes are your thing, Woo-jae.

154
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,459
Truth be told,
I had an accident about four days ago.

155
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,461
I was visiting this shop
in Cheongdam-dong,

156
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,398
and I ended up banging my head
really hard on the staircase.

157
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,701
That must've damaged my brain.

158
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,406
The bruise and the bump
were noticeable just days ago.

159
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,041
At any rate, this isn't good.

160
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,810
THE SUPPOSED INJURY
SEEMS TO BE TAKING ITS TOLL

161
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,546
All right. Please get ready
for the third round.

162
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,950
HAHAHA

163
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,853
Goodness. Woo-young looks so hilarious.

164
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,321
LET'S GO FASTER!

165
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,190
A NEED FOR SPEED

166
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,760
PASSIONATE EQUESTRIANS

167
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,762
JUNG CHEONG COMES IN FIRST AGAIN

168
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,665
You guys should try this later.
It's so much fun.

169
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,934
It'll help you forget
all your worries away.

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,602
You'll be stress-free in no time.

171
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,840
You know what? As for the order…
This arrival order has been fixed.

172
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,008
You, me, and the others. It's the same.

173
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,110
It's identical.

174
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,380
I'm exhausted.

175
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,916
Give me five brands
that have four-syllable names in Korean.

176
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,451
-AMOUPRE…
-Unbelievable.

177
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,420
-Chanel…
-Wrong.

178
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,521
Chanel?

179
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,089
-Oh, four syllables?
-Yeah.

180
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,091
-Four syllables, right?
-Yeah. Go.

181
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,426
MUMBLING

182
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,128
One, two…

183
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,830
You timed out!
That must've been a very nasty injury.

184
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,065
AMOUPRE,

185
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,501
"Balencia"…

186
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,102
-Wrong!
-Ferragamo… Darn it.

187
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,004
Balenciaga, not "Balencia".

188
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,773
A SUSPICIOUS SMILE

189
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,274
A SLOW APPROACH

190
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,776
BUYING TIME AS MUCH AS HE CAN

191
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,511
-I'm still back here.
-One.

192
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,513
AMOUPRE, UNIQLO,

193
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,214
Le Coq?

194
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,416
-Wrong.
-Really?

195
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,984
That's not how it works.

196
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,585
-Okay, I've got them all.
-Ready, go.

197
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,321
AMOUPRE, Marc Jacobs…

198
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,423
WORK, MY DAMAGED HIPPOCAMPUS

199
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,491
-You timed out!
-Damn it.

200
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,727
BLOOD PRESSURE RISING

201
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,795
One, two…

202
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,230
CheilJedang, Dong Suh Foods,

203
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,400
AMOUPRE, Inside Men…

204
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,968
WRONG

205
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,237
AMOUPRE, UNIQLO,

206
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,573
Levis', Ferragamo,

207
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,476
-and "Jarc Macobs". I mean Marc Jacobs.
-No, that shouldn't count.

208
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,944
Why not? I corrected myself quickly.

209
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,712
-Correct.
-Okay!

210
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,681
Netflix.

211
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,749
WE LOVE YOU, NETFLIX

212
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,818
Sorry, but that question
has been answered.

213
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,019
Hermès.

214
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,554
WIPE YOUR SNOT FIRST…

215
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,824
Dang, this is way trickier than I thought.

216
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,227
Your mind goes blank, doesn't it?

217
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,830
Even though you came up
with all five items while waiting…

218
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,364
-You failed!
-…you can't recall any.

219
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,766
-Nothing comes up.
-I know.

220
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,534
-Your mind goes blank.
-By the way,

221
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,504
thank you for mentioning AMOUPRE.

222
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,806
That's the only brand I can recall
that meets the requirement.

223
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,409
-It does, if you think about it.
-It's for our survival.

224
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,610
Ready.

225
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,481
As for this question,

226
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,250
-arriving early would give you an edge.
-Oh, really?

227
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,953
GO

228
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,423
HUFFING AND PUFFING
VS. GIGGLING NON-STOP

229
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,825
ENJOYING THE RUSH OF ADRENALINE

230
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,328
OVERTAKES JUNG CHEONG EASILY

231
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,129
THE SOLE FRONT-RUNNER

232
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,867
My gosh, Dr. Oh. You're on fire today.

233
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,303
Dang, I forgot to wear my sunglasses.
I knew something was off.

234
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,872
THOSE MUST BE MAGIC SUNGLASSES

235
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,607
ON THE OTHER HAND…

236
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,610
THE STRAGGLING SEBASTIAN
IS STILL ON HIS LONELY JOURNEY

237
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,844
Has someone not arrived?

238
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,614
Goodness, not yet?

239
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,382
FINALLY, SEBASTIAN JOINS THEM

240
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,450
All right, then.

241
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,686
Name five girl groups
whose name has four syllables in Korean.

242
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,522
There's no way we can get them soon.

243
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,990
Girl's Day,

244
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,758
Wonder Girls,

245
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,326
-Girls' Generation…
-One…

246
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,661
-How many do I need?
-Two…

247
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,162
You're out!

248
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,497
Do I need four names?

249
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,832
-Five names.
-That many?

250
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,534
-All questions ask for five items.
-My gosh.

251
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,736
Wonder Girls, Girls' Generation, TWICE,

252
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,572
-AMOUPRE…
-Wrong!

253
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,941
-It's bugging the hell out of me.
-Thanks, man.

254
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,743
Stop stalling to think. Go.

255
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,978
Wonder Girls, Girls' Generation,

256
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,114
Girl's Day, TWICE…

257
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,583
-You failed!
-IVE?

258
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,251
NEXT UP IS THE GIRL GROUP EXPERT

259
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,352
I bet he'll name them all.

260
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,888
Wonder Girls, TWICE, Girls' Generation,

261
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,524
OH MY GIRL, and Girl's Day.

262
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,892
-Correct.
-Okay!

263
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,327
This is so frustrating.

264
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,229
Let's get going. Move it, guys.

265
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,499
Let's give her some time. It's been ages
since she last faced a camera.

266
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,668
Chop, chop. We haven't got all day.

267
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,437
Woo-jae sure knows his girl groups.

268
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,505
SNICKERS

269
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,141
Oh, man. Jin-kyung is hilarious.

270
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,976
You need to get to the front first.

271
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,145
1ST: SAE-HO, 1 BILLION
5TH: JIN-KYUNG, 200 MILLION

272
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,748
Guys, give Jin-kyung some room
so she can get ahead.

273
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,585
-We'll try to give her some space.
-Good. Switch things up a bit.

274
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,286
-All right.
-Yeah, help her out this time.

275
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,821
THEY ALL VOW
TO GIVE WAY TO SEBASTIAN

276
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,990
-Let's help her get to the front.
-Okay.

277
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,926
-You can start from that point.
-Good idea. Move up a bit.

278
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,728
We'll allow your castmates' kind gesture.

279
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,697
-That's your new starting line.
-Ready.

280
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,798
KIND-HEARTED TRAINEES

281
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,073
A LAUGHABLE SIGHT UNFOLDS
JUST SECONDS INTO THE RACE

282
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,710
SWEET AND SHORT-LIVED VOWS
FROM CHAEBOL-WANNABES

283
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,445
EVERYONE OUTRUNS JIN-KYUNG
AS IF REHEARSED

284
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,947
Goodness, Sook.
How have you become such a good jockey?

285
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,350
Man, Sook. You're blowing my mind!

286
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,652
UNEXPECTED SUCCESS
OF THE SHORT PEOPLE

287
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,822
WHILE THESE TWO BICKER…

288
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,358
Steering… That's rather tricky.

289
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,661
It's Jin-kyung. She's freaking hilarious.

290
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,196
Oh, my. Jin-kyung.

291
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,465
THE DAY IS UNUSUALLY ROUGH
FOR THIS CHAEBOL TRAINEE

292
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,967
Name five hot singers.

293
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,602
Jang Woo-young, J. Y. Park,

294
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,271
-Cho Sae-ho, Hong Jin-kyung…
-Sae-ho, seriously?

295
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:40,906
-Wrong.
-Hasn't Jin-kyung released a song?

296
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,142
-Just guys?
-That doesn't matter.

297
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,344
Jang Woo-young, Ok Taec-yeon,

298
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,747
Na Hoon-a, Kang Jin,

299
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,315
-and Nam Jin.
-Correct!

300
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,417
-Correct!
-Hooray!

301
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,453
I mean, I sort of get it.
But her list was a bit…

302
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,056
-Are you disrespecting the veterans?
-Of course not.

303
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,458
-Na Hoon-a and Nam Jin are…
-The category was hot singers.

304
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,860
-They're hot.
-I guess she's right.

305
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,462
HEH

306
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,865
SOOK'S SECRET CRUSHES REVEALED

307
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,169
You made it almost impossible
for us to dispute her answers.

308
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,437
Sure, those guys are hot.

309
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,039
EVEN THEIR PHOTOS
EXUDE SEDUCTIVE AURA

310
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,309
ALL THE WHILE, SEBASTIAN HAS
GOTTEN TANTALIZINGLY TIRED

311
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,878
Take the center spot.

312
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,279
Come sit here, Jin-kyung.

313
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,548
MR. CHOO KINDLY ADJUSTS
JIN-KYUNG'S STARTING LINE

314
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,617
-Cut me some slack this once.
-Okay. Let's do this!

315
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,318
Ready.

316
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,121
GO

317
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,057
GRITS HER TEETH

318
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,191
Hey, you!

319
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,026
ALL SMILES

320
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,661
GIGGLING

321
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,831
STUCK

322
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,666
WE'LL GET GOING, GUYS

323
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,301
Come on, Sook!

324
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,737
-What's wrong with you?
-Get going!

325
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,273
DESPITE THE HEAD START…

326
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,744
-I'm exhausted.
-It's seriously killing me.

327
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,679
Please give us an easy question.

328
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,717
Here goes. Name five celebrities
whose name ends with "sook" or "suk."

329
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,385
-"Sook"?
-"Suk"?

330
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,654
Paeng Hyeon-suk, Kim Sook,

331
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,756
-Lee Yeong-suk…
-Wrong!

332
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,925
COMING UP
WITH A FAKE NAME DIDN'T WORK

333
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,060
Oh, I got it.

334
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,229
-Paeng Hyeon-suk, Kim Sook, Ahn Moon-sook…
-You failed!

335
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,064
One, two…

336
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,165
You failed!

337
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,068
Paeng Hyeon-suk, Kim Sook,

338
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,003
Hyun-sook…

339
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,172
THINK OF SOMETHING, SEBASTIAN

340
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,607
You failed!

341
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,775
Who did you name?

342
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,677
-Paeng Hyeon-suk, Kim Sook, and Hyun-sook.
-Ready, go.

343
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,045
Kim Sook, Paeng Hyeon-suk,

344
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,147
-Hon-suk… No.
-Wrong.

345
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,482
WHO IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE?

346
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,118
-Hon… Wait, there's Son Sook, right?
-Kim Sook…

347
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,285
SEBASTIAN AND MR. CHOO TEAM UP

348
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,521
Kim Sook, Lee Sook, Hyun-sook,

349
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,089
Paeng Hyeon-suk, and Kim Hyun-sook.

350
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,591
Who is Lee Sook?

351
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,693
-Ms. Lee Sook is a veteran.
-Who was that at the end?

352
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,628
-Kim Hyun-sook, the Lady of Fertility.
-Exactly.

353
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,996
Oh, Hyuk-sook.

354
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,464
Don't forget the great Ms. Lee Sook.

355
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,600
-Sook, you won this round.
-Yes!

356
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,135
Man, she's good.

357
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,070
She's a strong contender, all right.

358
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,006
We'll let Jin-kyung start
from that point this time.

359
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,307
SPECIAL MEASURES
FOR THE UNDERDOG

360
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,076
Over here. That's it.

361
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,112
We'd easily take Jin-kyung over
even if she walked and we rode the horses.

362
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,547
MIRTHLESS LAUGHTER

363
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,615
Ready.

364
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,452
I'M TAKING FIRST PLACE
THIS TIME!

365
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:13,092
SEBASTIAN GIVES HER ALL, AND
HER COMPETITORS GIVE HER A CHASE

366
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,827
I CAN DO THIS!

367
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,563
WE'RE ON OUR WAY, SEBASTIAN

368
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,066
WHO WILL PLACE FIRST THIS TIME?

369
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,501
I got here first!

370
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,836
I got here first!

371
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,138
Jin-kyung came in first,
followed by Woo-jae.

372
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,841
I just don't get it.
How is Sook so good at this?

373
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,342
All right. Jin-kyung.

374
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,112
Name five shows on Netflix.

375
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,917
WILL JIN-KYUNG BE ABLE TO GET
THE RIGHT ANSWER AS WELL?

376
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,286
-Ready, go.
-Squid Game,

377
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,588
-Single's Heaven.
-Single's Heaven…

378
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,656
-Go.
-Single's Inferno.

379
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,324
-Single's Heaven?
-No, Single's Inferno.

380
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,960
-She called it Single's Heaven.
-She did call it that way.

381
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,863
Single's Inferno, Netflix…

382
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,464
Wrong!

383
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,500
ALL HER EFFORTS WERE IN VAIN

384
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,001
Ready, go.

385
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,837
Squid Game…

386
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,139
You're out!

387
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,774
Squid Game, Single's Inferno,

388
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,309
the Trauma Code: Heroes on Call,

389
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,077
-Beat Coin… Oh, dang it.
-You failed!

390
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,345
Why did I mention that one?

391
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,847
SO FLUSTERED THAT
SHE BLURTED OUT HER PAST LIFE

392
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,782
Squid Game,

393
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,884
Screwballs: In Search of Loose Screws,

394
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,952
Culinary Class Wars,

395
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,019
the Trauma Code: Heroes on Call,

396
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,589
and The Queen of Villains.
That's a Japanese show

397
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,959
set in the world
of Japanese professional wrestlers.

398
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,827
I watched it just yesterday.

399
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,863
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LIE…

400
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,631
CHECKING OUT THE FACTS

401
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,499
-Is there a show with that name?
-Is there?

402
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,668
-Sae-ho, you were correct.
-Yes!

403
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,904
-That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime…
-Okay.

404
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,840
AN OSTENTATIOUS PAT
ON HIS OWN BACK

405
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,208
Can't we lose the horses?

406
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,676
Hey, don't "stirrup" trouble.

407
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,678
PLEASE DON'T DESERT ME

408
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,282
-That's because she has weak thighs.
-Let's set you up here, Jin-kyung.

409
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,718
Do you want to try my pink horse?

410
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,186
I'll trade you for almost nothing.

411
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,288
Take it a bit further
to the front, Jin-kyung.

412
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,825
-You don't need to force yourself up--
-Gosh, yours moves so smoothly!

413
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,727
That's because I had it trained well.

414
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,230
-It's noticeably different!
-I'm an excellent trainer.

415
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,266
It's learned to work with me, you know.

416
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,003
THIS PONY BECAME A FINE MOUNT
OVER THE LAST 30 MINUTES

417
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,505
Wire me 300,000 won later.
I won't ask for more.

418
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,374
Ready.

419
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,441
SNEAKY STEPS

420
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,843
-What on earth?
-What is she doing?

421
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,279
GO

422
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,649
How dare you, you little punk?
Did you just push me?

423
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,218
Something's wrong with my horse.
Why won't it go forward?

424
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,220
SOOK RIDES AHEAD,
LEAVING THE TRICKSTER BEHIND

425
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,889
-Still, you're making fine progress.
-Yeah, I am.

426
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:24,957
HUSTLING

427
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,759
Why won't it move?
Is someone holding me back?

428
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,193
A HEAVY TRAFFIC AREA

429
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,163
BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER

430
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,833
-This runs really smoothly.
-It's decent, isn't it?

431
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,902
-It's amazing.
-I did a fine job breaking it in.

432
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,871
That's what it means
to be one with your horse.

433
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,472
MASTER TRAINER, JANG WOO-YOUNG

434
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,640
-It's much better.
-Really?

435
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,975
A NEW TALENT UNLOCKED:
HORSE TRAINING

436
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:47,112
Name five words that read the same
forwards and backwards.

437
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,515
Lee Hyo-lee,

438
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,716
rotator…

439
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,018
-You failed!
-I understand, dear.

440
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,086
I'LL LEAVE WITHOUT A FUSS

441
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,655
-One, two…
-Wait. I'm getting there.

442
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,856
Here goes.

443
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,092
Lee Hyo-lee, rotator, stats…

444
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,393
What?

445
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
You failed!

446
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,632
Kayak, race car, level,
rotator, and stats.

447
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,933
-Correct!
-All right!

448
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,338
SHE DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE
TO TRY THE QUIZ

449
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,206
Unbelievable.

450
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,507
AN EXPERT AT MOCKERY

451
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,409
HOW DID HE KNOW ALL THE WORDS?

452
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,211
How did he even come up with "race car"?

453
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,548
-Stats, race car, kayak…
-Shouldn't that count as…

454
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,616
Extraordinary Attorney Woo
has all the answers.

455
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,152
-Woo young-woo
-Did you just call me?

456
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,320
Not you. Attorney Woo.

457
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,923
"'Woo Young-woo' reads the same
whether from front or back."

458
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,858
"So do kayak, race car,
stats, rotator, and level."

459
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,226
Jeez, he's so loud!

460
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,729
Ready.

461
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,897
EVERYONE TWITCHES FORWARD

462
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,033
I haven't blown the whistle yet.

463
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,204
INTENSE COMPETITION
BETWEEN WOO-JAE AND SOOK

464
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,339
Lean forward just a bit. There you go.

465
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,042
IN THE BACK, JIN-KYUNG IS STILL
TAKING LESSONS

466
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,878
THUD

467
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,180
-Well done.
-That must've hurt.

468
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,182
Come on, I got here first.

469
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,786
-No, you didn't get in the line.
-You'll go second, Woo-jae.

470
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,489
Name five sexy female singers.

471
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,924
Name five sexy female singers.

472
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,427
Kim Sook, Song Eun-i, Hong Jin-kyung,

473
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,329
Lee Young-ja, and Lee Hyo-lee.

474
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,730
Do they all count as singers?

475
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,866
-Lee Young-ja?
-She released an album, too.

476
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,200
But…

477
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,502
TECHNICALLY, THERE IS A SONG

478
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,137
WHERE SHE'S CREDITED
AS THE SINGER…

479
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,872
She hasn't built a career as a singer.

480
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,607
-Yeah, she has.
-You could say that, sure.

481
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,876
Did you release an album under your name?

482
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,210
-No way.
-Sure, as Nanda Kim.

483
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,545
Nanda Kim is the singer, not you.

484
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,380
And you're not hot at all.

485
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,915
Sae-ho has a point. You failed.

486
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,850
-Get back.
-You're not sexy.

487
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,920
Damn you, you annoying rascals.

488
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,790
An Young-mi, Song Eun-i, Kim Sook…

489
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,025
DIDN'T YOU JUST ARGUE
THAT SOOK DIDN'T COUNT?

490
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,760
Lee Hyo-lee,

491
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,996
Chae-yeon, Song Eun-i…

492
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,931
-You're way too slow with answers.
-You're out!

493
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,834
-Eun-i somehow keeps getting a shout-out.
-I know.

494
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,471
SHE'S A FAMOUS HOT SINGER
FOR REAL

495
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,006
-Ready, go.
-Suzy, Uhm Jung-hwa,

496
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,508
Kim Hyun-jung, Lee Hyo-lee, and Chae-yeon.

497
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,643
-Correct.
-Hooray!

498
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,547
Weren't we supposed to name
five lady comedians?

499
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,015
-Sexy female singers.
-Oh, right.

500
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,152
I got confused because all we heard
were names of female comedians.

501
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,353
I got it. Okay.

502
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,557
Finally, you did it.
You'll get your 100 million reward.

503
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,093
-Try not to move up and down.
-You can start first.

504
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,661
THE NEXT ROUND BEGINS NOW!

505
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,831
Just push down with your bottom.
Do it, Jin-kyung.

506
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,566
COURSE INTERFERENCE

507
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,068
Are you for real? I'm a lousy rider as is.

508
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,837
WHILE THE OTHERS BICKER
IN THE BACK,

509
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,039
ONE MODEL STUDENT KEEPS HER LEAD

510
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,174
-Push down with your butt.
-My goodness.

511
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,709
You're an amazing jockey.

512
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,244
Hold on, my horse's neck…

513
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,146
LIMP

514
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,050
CRACKS

515
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,485
Hold on, my horse's neck…

516
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,555
THE HORRIFIC EVENT
TAKES EVERYONE BY SURPRISE

517
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,725
He broke his horse's neck!

518
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,760
Too bad,
but he should've taken better care of it.

519
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,829
You must've treated it badly!

520
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,898
I'll go with a pink one.

521
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,366
LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT

522
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,734
Head to the director.

523
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,669
THE HORSE HAS BEEN
HIS LOYAL PARTNER

524
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,304
-Okay!
-Woo-jae got it right.

525
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,939
Can we buy them from you?

526
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,008
AND DREAMED OF A FUTURE
WITH WOO-JAE…

527
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,877
He broke his horse's neck.

528
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,678
The horse passed.

529
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,046
Can you not direct it now?

530
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,214
YOU NEVER VALUED ME, WOO-JAE

531
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,983
HE'S DETERMINED TO SAVE HIS RIDE

532
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,051
HERE'S SOME
CHIROPRACTIC THERAPY!

533
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,688
See if it can move. Go on.

534
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,391
The poor thing is whinnying.
I didn't even press the button.

535
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,560
LET ME DIE IN PEACE, WOO-JAE

536
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,329
It's moving fine, at least.

537
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,265
PLEASE SAVE ME

538
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,634
-Would you like to keep using it?
-Yeah, I'm good.

539
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,768
THE QUIZ SHOW RESUMES

540
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,670
Name five snacks
that have four-syllable names.

541
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,539
Let's pick up the speed. One, two…

542
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,706
You're out!

543
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,708
SHE'S LEAVES WITHOUT A WORD
ONCE AGAIN

544
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:37,776
Four-syllable names?

545
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,511
IT'S TIME TO WORK MY HIPPOCAMPUS

546
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,547
-One…
-Shrimp Crackers, Sweet Potatoes…

547
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,448
-Wrong!
-He wants four-syllable names.

548
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,683
-Just four?
-Yes.

549
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,852
-Four-syllable names?
-Ready, go.

550
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,921
-Onion Ring.
-Wrong.

551
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,323
HE DID HIS BEST…

552
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,526
-Ready, go.
-Indian Bob, Sweet Potatoes…

553
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,429
-You're out!
-Five four-syllable names?

554
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,597
That's correct.

555
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,300
-Ready, go.
-Potato Chips, Sweet Potatoes,

556
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,536
-Potato Crisps… Dang it.
-Wrong!

557
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,238
Potato Chip.

558
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,973
Indian Bob, Sweet Potatoes,

559
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,942
-Potato Crisps…
-That's right.

560
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,711
Potato Crisps, Indian Bob…

561
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,848
Potato Crisps, Indian Bread,
Sweet Potatoes…

562
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,384
-Indian Bob, Potato Crisps…
-You failed!

563
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,153
Chocolate Pie… Potato Crisps…

564
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,689
-Chocolate Pie… Indian Bob…
-Indian Bob, Sweet Potatoes,

565
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,756
Potato Crisps…

566
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,825
-Chocolate Pie, Indian Bob.
-You're out!

567
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,961
SHE FAILED

568
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,896
-Ready, go.
-Chocolate Pie, Indian Bob,

569
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,498
Sweet Potatoes, Potato Crisps,

570
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,000
-and AMOUPRE.
-Wrong.

571
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,337
Damn it, AMOUPRE!

572
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,939
-I'll never wear your brand!
-Sweet Potatoes, Potato Chips,

573
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,242
Potato Crisps, Indian Bob, and Nune Ddine.

574
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,710
-Correct!
-All righty!

575
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,578
-Nune Ddine is an ice cream brand.
-No, it's a snack.

576
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,647
It's a snack.
That's actually one of my favorites.

577
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,651
-You catch my eyes, Nune Ddine
-I can't stand him.

578
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,219
You stand out too, Jin-kyung

579
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,554
You catch my eyes, Nune Ddine

580
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,024
-You stand out too, Jin-kyung
-Stay out of my sight, Sae-ho.

581
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,960
-Potato Chip
-I still can't name five snacks.

582
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,528
SINCE SAE-HO WON THAT QUIZ,

583
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,065
HE GRACIOUSLY OFFERS
WOO-JAE HIS HORSE

584
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,067
NEXT QUESTION

585
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,271
This is going to be difficult.
It's a tricky one.

586
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,939
A tricky one? Okay.

587
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,875
GO

588
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,878
Seriously, what's going on with her?

589
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,614
I'M AS SWIFT AS THE WIND

590
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,150
DR. OH EUN-HYEONG RACES AHEAD

591
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,053
OUT OF MY WAY, YOU

592
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,022
ALMOST TIPS OVER

593
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,890
AN AMAZING NEW TECHNIQUE!

594
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,128
STARTLED MR. PAPER DOLL
FAILED TO PUT UP A FIGHT

595
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,897
You guys in the back.
Listen very carefully.

596
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,332
Why aren't they joining us?

597
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,833
We had things to discuss.

598
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,805
Name four songs that mention
one of the four seasons each.

599
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,374
HAHA

600
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,709
You're out.

601
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,078
There's no point in getting here early.

602
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,815
I SWEAR
I WILL SECURE A POINT THIS TIME…

603
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,417
-Go.
-"Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter"

604
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,420
by Bigbang. "Summer Story" by DJ DOC.

605
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,255
"Fall Again" by Daybreak,

606
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,557
-and then "Winter Story."
-Correct.

607
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,594
Thought so. This is why we stayed behind.

608
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,998
I feel terrible, Director,
but we should retire this guy.

609
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,667
-Is it unmanageable?
-Yeah, you can't really…

610
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,536
-This poor guy…
-Is it gone?

611
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,404
When I got on it,
it reached out to my heart.

612
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,573
"It's time you let me go."

613
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,776
-Come pick up your new horse.
-Okay!

614
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,614
IT'S A UNICORN!

615
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,149
What is it?

616
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,351
That's so pretty.

617
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,753
I can't believe
you gave him a Lamborghini.

618
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,355
I like it.

619
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,757
Do you want to take this?
It's an amazing ride.

620
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,793
Why not?
Let's see if it's as good as you say.

621
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,063
Your guy can't hold a candle to this guy.

622
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,632
That thing runs really smoothly.

623
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,734
Let's roll.

624
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,002
Ready.

625
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:52,938
GO!

626
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,208
GRABS HER ARM

627
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,009
A DEATH GRIP

628
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,177
WOBBLES

629
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,280
A COUNTERATTACK

630
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,849
You dare grab my hair?

631
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,717
IS THIS IS A HORSE RACE
OR A BRAWL?

632
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,285
Seriously, I'm no match for Sook.

633
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,154
Don't you dare grab my hair, you brat.

634
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,655
TURNS INTO
AN OBEDIENT YOUNGER BROTHER

635
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,591
I'll be stricter with time
since this one is easy.

636
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,359
I'll get it in one go, then.

637
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,828
There's no syllable limit this time.

638
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,463
Name five Korean car models.

639
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,400
-One…
-Pride, Grandeur, Sonata…

640
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,068
-What's the name…
-You timed out!

641
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:25,637
Ready, go!

642
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,774
Avante, Sonata, Grandeur, GV70, and GV80.

643
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,841
We can't have that.

644
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,511
GV70 and GV80 are the same model.
They're one and the same.

645
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,913
-Genesis is a Korean car model.
-So, Woo-jae…

646
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,981
Correct!

647
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,417
-No, he should've said Genesis.
-That would only be right.

648
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,519
-Variants shouldn't count.
-GV70 and GV80 do count.

649
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,388
Enough of that, you cheeky punk.
What would your lost horse say?

650
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,724
THAT IS A GOOD ONE

651
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,325
Your pony would be ashamed of you.

652
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,560
I don't get it.

653
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,896
-Explain why my answer is wrong.
-Why, seriously…

654
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,131
GV70 and GV80 are totally different cars.

655
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,067
-Genesis is…
-That's a brand.

656
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,769
It's a brand under Hyundai Motor Company.

657
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,905
-It's a brand name like Hyundai or Kia.
-He's right.

658
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,273
Your pony is rolling in its grave.

659
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,042
-Look here.
-Cat got your tongue? Speak.

660
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,211
Bringing in model numbers was uncool.

661
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,612
I'm ready. I can be quick.

662
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,948
-What do you mean, Jin-kyung? Go back.
-But why?

663
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,716
He just said Woo-jae won the point.

664
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,018
He got the answer.

665
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,753
CELEBRATORY DANCE TIME

666
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,555
I've never heard of a car named GV70.

667
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,622
NOT EXACTLY A MOTORHEAD

668
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,824
She's never heard of it.

669
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,425
-GV70
-GV70

670
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,893
SEBASTIAN…

671
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,062
ACCEPT THAT IT'S OVER
AND HEAD BACK

672
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,565
You know what?
GV70 has a full-year waiting list.

673
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,533
-That's true.
-That model's that popular.

674
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,601
A DEEP SIGH

675
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,070
Does this mean the quiz time is over?

676
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,805
Let's go dancing, then.

677
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,106
We absolutely should.

678
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,275
I have to turn things around with dancing.

679
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,810
I haven't earned that much.

680
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,512
WOO-JAE WON 500 MILLION

681
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,314
JIN-KYUNG WON 200 MILLION
SOOK WON 300 MILLION

682
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,582
What do you say

683
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,985
to one last question
worth 500 million won?

684
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,954
-Seriously?
-The final 500-million-won question.

685
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,189
-Let's roll. I'll take that bet.
-Seriously? Let's go.

686
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,124
Make it difficult, okay?

687
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,561
-I want a super challenging one.
-Okay, I hear you.

688
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,597
It's worth the runner-up prize
from Dance Time.

689
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,465
This can be life-changing.

690
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:03,935
Ready.

691
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,737
CURRENT STANDINGS
1.3B, 600M, 300M, 501M, 500M

692
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,039
WILL THEIR LIVES BE CHANGED

693
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,242
OR STAY THE SAME?

694
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,410
Get ready.

695
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,779
WHO WILL WIN
THE 500-MILLION-WON JACKPOT?

696
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,116
FINAL ROUND BEGINS!

697
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,486
Relax, Jin-kyung.

698
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,589
Relax, Jin-kyung.

699
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,725
Rise up and fall down. Repeat the cycle.

700
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,560
-After you.
-It's worth a lot, so…

701
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,228
-Go ahead.
-You can go first.

702
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,863
-After you.
-No, I insist.

703
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,098
Just go.

704
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,666
I wonder how difficult it will be.

705
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,736
-Get going. Why are you standing about?
-Go.

706
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:38,803
LIKE TRUE CHAEBOL HEIRS

707
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,739
THEY SHOW CLASS
BY YIELDING THE ADVANTAGE

708
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,408
-Don't push me, okay?
-Let's get it over with!

709
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,011
-Getting in line early is meaningless…
-Try your luck, Woo-jae.

710
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,946
It can be a waste of effort.

711
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,282
Oh, dear. Just a second.

712
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,183
There's no point in getting here first.

713
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,419
-So, this one's worth 500 million?
-Yes.

714
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,754
Dang, that's a big one.

715
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,791
-Give me five proverbs.
-Oh, my goodness.

716
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,893
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

717
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,729
You timed out!

718
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,364
ARE WE ON A LOOP?
THIS SCENE SEEMS FAMILIAR

719
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,033
-Proverbs…
-Don't give others time to think.

720
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,501
-Ready, go.
-Proverbs…

721
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,269
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

722
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,905
Moving on.
Don't bark at the wrong chimney?

723
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,106
-Wait.
-Wrong!

724
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,174
BRAIN ON FULL THROTTLE

725
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,242
Ready, go.

726
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,777
A fool is wise in his own eyes.

727
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,345
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

728
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,681
Drive gently over the stones.

729
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,150
-Wrong!
-You and I… Okay.

730
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,785
GIGGLES UNCONTROLLABLY

731
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,720
-I'm sure there's a saying like that.
-Ready, go.

732
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,854
HE-HE-HE

733
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,992
Excuse me? Acting isn't allowed.

734
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,627
Come on. Don't fake it to stall.

735
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,195
You timed out!

736
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,398
-Come on! I only laughed, okay?
-I don't think so.

737
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,935
-The others are waiting.
-You're so annoying. Jeez.

738
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,036
-Ready, go.
-I only laughed.

739
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,439
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow.
Pie in the sky.

740
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,007
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

741
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,876
-Drive gently over the stones.
-One, two…

742
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,745
-AMOUPRE, damn it.
-Wrong!

743
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,782
-I'm giving up.
-I actually brought some wares for you.

744
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,285
I think I deserve to be
your brand's ambassador.

745
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,654
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

746
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,956
Still water… drowns a man.

747
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,725
-Wrong!
-What did I get mixed up?

748
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,894
STILL WATER "RUNS DEEP," DEAR
BUT I GET YOUR CONFUSION

749
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,429
Still waters run deep.

750
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,098
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

751
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:17,068
Bad news… turns away wrath…

752
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,304
…turns away wrath.

753
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,572
Wrong!

754
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,540
-It gets so confusing!
-Bad news, huh?

755
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,409
-What should I have said?
-Bad news travels fast.

756
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,911
Oh, that's right!

757
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,313
-Ready, go.
-Bad news travels fast.

758
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,581
Treat others
the way you want to be treated.

759
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,982
Drive gently over the stones.

760
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,684
Two heads are better than one.

761
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,619
Lock the stable door
after the horse has bolted.

762
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,154
-Correct!
-Yeah!

763
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,890
Stop it.

764
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,027
Think about it. Can't bad news…

765
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,797
also turn away wrath?

766
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,232
That's some food for thought.

767
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:52,270
Congratulations, Sae-ho.
You won 500 million won.

768
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,305
Dang, he's miles ahead of us.

769
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,207
THE GAME ENDS
WITH SAE-HO SECURING 500M

770
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,544
Your potential as the future chaebol
really shone this round.

771
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,746
We appreciated
your dignified horseback riding

772
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,949
and the demonstration
of your wealth of knowledge.

773

-Thank you.
-Are things all set up?

774
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,254
-The riding was enjoyable.
-Sae-ho is winning by a landslide.

775
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,356
Don't you look down on this old man.

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,059
I'll now award you your prize money.

777

Props to you, Sook. You won 300 million.

00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,472
-Woo-jae. You won 500 million.
-Gosh, he's earned a fortune!

782
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,508
-Well done, Sae-ho. You won 800 million.
-All righty! Thank you.

783
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,910
-Great work, guys.
-He's loaded.

785
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,914

ATMOSPHERE GROWS HOSTILE

792
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,828
You're being too harsh.

793
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,231
You'd better do right by me.
Give me 50 million.

794
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,300
-Why would I do that? I'm all out.
-Just give it to me.

795

Throw me a bone here.
You have millions of won.
