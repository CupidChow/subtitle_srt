1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,736
It is winning the hearts
of future viewers.

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,204
We'll be meeting children, then.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,105
-Hi.
-Hello.

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,374
THE CAST WAS SPLIT INTO TWO TEAMS

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,410
UNDERSTANDING THE CHILDREN'S MINDS
PROVES TO BE A CHALLENGE

6
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,345
(IT'S MY FIRST TRY AT CHILD CARE)

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,481
BUT EACH MANAGED TO WORK THEIR WAY

8
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,449
INTO THE CHILDREN'S HEARTS!

9
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,484
Faster!

10
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,887
THEIR FOCUS SHIFTED
FROM CARING FOR CHILDREN

11
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,957
TO HAVING FUN WITH THEM

12
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,659
LET'S SEE HOW SAE-HO AND WOO-JAE FARED…

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,095
PORORONG HAD A LOCK ON THE KIDS

14
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,163
WOO-JAE ONLY PLAYED 2 GAMES

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,032
WHILE SAE-HO OFFERED A WHOPPING 6 GAMES

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,501
-Mom and dad…
-All right. Let's go!

17
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,503
-I like my mom more.
-You like your mom more?

18
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,038
What about your dad?

19
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,807
THEY SEEM TO BE HAVING FUN OVER THERE

20
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,476
TEARS

21
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,545
I-NA DID RETURN SHORTLY AFTER…

22
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,048
-You can…
-What's going on, A-yun?

23
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,616
…ONLY TO LEAVE AGAIN

24
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,017
Okay, come down, guys.

25
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,585
CHILDREN SEEM TO BE DRAWN

26
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,487
FURTHER INTO SAE-HO'S WORLD

27
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,456
Great job.

28
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,324
UNLESS WOO-JAE TURNS THE TIDE

29
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,427
MR. COMEDIAN WILL WIN!

30
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,496
Who wants to join me for the numbers game?

31
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,665
NO RESPONSE

32
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:10,437
IN THAT CASE,
I'LL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO LOOK AT ME

33
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,606
LET'S GO

34
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,910
WAIT, IS THIS THE RIGHT APPROACH?

35
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,678
THAT'S WHEN JEONG-HU RUNS TOWARD WOO-JAE

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,113
IT'S JEONG-HU!

37
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,181
Jeong-hu.

38
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:22,849
Wanna ride the pony, I-na?

39
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,517
NOPE

40
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,087
FAILED TO CATCH THEIR ATTENTION

41
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,088
All right.

42
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,155
SECOND ATTEMPT

43
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,790
Please gather around, everyone.

44
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,593
Can you come down and join me, I-na?

45
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,994
Hold on.

46
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,730
Seo-jin and A-yun. Please come join me.

47
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:38,965
Why?

48
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,300
"Why?"

49
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,370
Why don't you come here
and play a game with me?

50
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,606
How do I get there?

51
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,341
Let me help. Come this way.

52
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,244
I'll go down the slide.

53
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,679
Come this way, A-yun.

54
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,581
I'll go down the slide too.

55
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,982
Oh, you'll come down the slide?

56
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,751
ALL RIGHT, THEN

57
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,454
I'm going down the slide.

58
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,089
SO MUCH FUN

59
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,225
Wow. Can you go over there, Seo-jin?

60
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,226
TELLS SEO-JIN WHERE TO GO…

61
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,161
-But this
-Come here.

62
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,362
…AND SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTS A-YUN

63
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,433
Are we playing with the ball now?

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,169
WHAT THEN CAPTURES A-YUN'S GAZE?

65
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,705
-Did you ask about a ball?
-Yeah.

66
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,607
Why don't we gather around?

67
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,776
I want to play with the ball.

68
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,811
You do?

69
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,446
I want to play with the ball!

70
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,680
Here you go.

71
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:28,948
WEREN'T WE GOING TO PLAY?

72
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,451
Okay, A-yun.
If you score, you have to dance.

73
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,852
Score a goal.

74
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,920
Kick it.

75
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,822
Whose name tag is this?

76
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,790
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-Goal! You have to dance now.

77
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,958
-Let's dance.
-Sae-ho.

78
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,293
IN A WORLD OF THEIR OWN

79
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,528
Great moves.

80
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,164
ARE COMEDIANS UNBEATABLE?

81
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,233
THIRD ATTEMPT

82
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,601
HE'S GOT PIKACHU AND SPIDER-MAN

83
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,836
YOU'RE TRYING, AT LEAST

84
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,471
AMAZED

85
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,575
ARE YOU WATCHING, A-YUN?

86
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,510
FROSTY RECEPTION

87
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,180
(I'LL BE ON MY WAY)

88
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,781
(TIME FOR A REALITY CHECK)

89
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,652
Are you having a nice day, Woo-jae?

90
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,353
I've come to realize

91
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,721
that it's much harder

92
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,925
to win a child's heart
than to win a woman's heart.

93
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,960
With the ladies,

94
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,762
my charms always disarm them.

95
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,598
At least,
that's how things have been so far.

96
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,300
But with kids…

97
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,269
I'm completely clueless.

98
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:24,837
Gosh, it's so hot.

99
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,005
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING

100
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,340
Can you blow on it?

101
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,708
PUFF

102
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,742
Just a bit more.

103
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,544
FOR THIS TWO-YEAR-OLD LADY

104
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,879
HE'S THE ULTIMATE CHARMER

105
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,113
It tastes amazing.

106
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,682
What a fine cook you are.

107
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,749
It's incredible.

108
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,451
YOU CAN SEE HER EYES SHOOTING HEARTS

109
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,887
LET'S CHECK ON SOOK,
JIN-KYUNG, AND WOO-YOUNG

110
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,021
All right.

111
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,657
This is a pizzeria.

112
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,826
-Come in for pizza.
-Does that mean

113
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,795
-I can get a slice of pizza?
-Sure.

114
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,930
-All right.
-I have one slice.

115
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:51,931
Okay.

116
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,000
LAST WEEK

117
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,735
Where's I-seo?

118
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,770
-Won, what about me?
-Where is I-seo?

119
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,871
I-seo…

120
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,440
I love you.

121
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,110
WON BADLY LONGED TO SEE I-SEO AGAIN

122
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,547
AND I-SEO CAME TO HIM AND HELD HIS HAND

123
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,216
(HANDS HELD TIGHTLY)

124
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,485
Hello.

125
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,187
I-SEO AND WON'S PIZZERIA

126
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,522
LOVELY SERVICE AND GREAT PIZZA

127
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,524
Can I try the pizza?

128
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,759
NODS

129
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,860
Nom, nom…

130
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,196
THIS SWEET PART-TIMER CHECKS
IF THE CUSTOMER ENJOYS IT

131
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,300
Now, what do you say
to Pizza Dance with me?

132
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,668
OKAY

133
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,171
Won, what do you say
to Pizza Dance with I-seo and me?

134
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,173
-No thanks.
-You don't want to?

135
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,541
Me neither.

136
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,110
Why, I-seo?

137
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,745
All right. Can I get one more pizza?

138
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,447
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED
NOT FOR SALE

139
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,583
CLINGING TO THEM ONCE MORE

140
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,517
Won.

141
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,551
Guys.

142
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,954
NOTE: WON DOESN'T LIKE
BEING BOTHERED WHEN HE'S PLAYING

143
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,322
If Pizza Dance isn't up your alley,

144
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,957
what do you say

145
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,925
to "Simple Dance"?

146
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,095
I need to film my dance challenge
with them.

147
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,799
BUT THE KIDS ARE SO YOUNG…

148
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,467
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS

149
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,368
All together now.

150
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,736
One, two…

151
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,073
WHAT IS THIS SONG?

152
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,911
WHAT SCREWBALL TRIES THIS
WITH TWO-YEAR-OLDS?

153
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,214
CAUTIOUSLY APPROACHING HIS TARGETS
FOR THE DANCE CHALLENGE

154
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,116
That's me singing it.

155
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,554
GOING FOR A RECORD
WITH THE YOUNGEST KIDS EVER

156
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,256
This is my song. Wanna dance with me?

157
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,724
WARY

158
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,292
Woo-young

159
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,593
has released a new song.

160
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,331
By the looks of things,
he's trying to engage new listeners.

161
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,732
Come join me, guys.

162
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,301
But the kids are backing away,
clearly freaked out.

163
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,039
He's literally chasing the children
that are hiding behind walls.

164
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,241
Put your hands up high.

165
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,344
NOT FEELING IT

166
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,347
Are we actually being of any help?

167
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,881
-I can't help but wonder.
-Wanna try it?

168
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,220
UNDAUNTED, HE CONTINUES
WITH HIS LIVE PERFORMANCE

169
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,490
A FUTURE VIEWER DANCES FROM AFAR

170
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,125
SINGING PASSIONATELY

171
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,593
Join me, guys.

172
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,895
HO-WON JOINS HIM

173
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,198
We're going to do
the "Simple Dance" Challenge.

174
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,399
I-SEO IS DANCING TOO!

175
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,201
Hey, I-seo's dancing. Great.

176
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,202
Get ready.

177
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,239
Put your hands up. Ho!

178
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,142
The children practically see me
as one of their own.

179
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,945
In other words, we've become a team.

180
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,015
Your ice cream is ready.

181
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,817
Here you go. Please enjoy.

182
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,653
-My gosh, Won.
-It's for your troubles.

183
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,289
Are you giving me ice cream
for my dance performance?

184
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,824
Thank you.

185
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,025
I'll enjoy it.

186
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,494
-Let me get a shot.
-Thanks.

187
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,195
#FIRST FEEL-GOOD SHOT OF THE DAY

188
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,131
We got a fun shot in that moment.

189
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,766
I-SEO AND HO-WON COLLECT FRUIT

190
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,900
Kids.

191
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,435
The "Simple Dance" Challenge seems to…

192
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,406
Wait, the children are showing me
their affection now.

193
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,742
If you ask me,
I'll probably ace the game today…

194
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,977
My gosh!

195
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,478
I-seo, thank you so much.

196
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,513
THE LOVE KEEPS COMING

197
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,081
Here's some ice.

198
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,449
Ice?

199
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,217
HEH

200
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,954
It looks like the song and dance
unlocked their hearts for me.

201
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,123
TOUCHED

202
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,291
Sure.

203
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,093
PRESENTS KEEP ON COMING

204
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,294
Thank you, guys.

205
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,529
Here's your juice.

206
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,330
Juice? Did you prepare it for me?

207
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,965
-Thank you.
-No problem.

208
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,801
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

209
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,637
This is my pay for the day.

210
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,173
Hey, you earned a lot.

211
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,207
My performance fee.

212
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,408
A BUCKET FULL OF GOODS

213
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,245
Won and I-seo.
Why don't we play in the ball pit?

214
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,780
I want to play!

215
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,382
-Let's go!
-Let me join you!

216
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,585

GRAMPS IS NOW WON'S FRIEND

223
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,333
I see you have a plane, I-seo.

224
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,168
Look, I-seo.

225
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,070
I can fly like a plane.

226
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,441
SEEING WOO-YOUNG JUMP

227
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,376

229
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,745
-I…
-Come on.

230
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,981
-I flew like a plane too!
-Good girl.

231
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,716
I did it too.

232
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,285
A HAPPY TIME WITH THE PLANE GAME

233
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,454
Join us, Ho-won. Watch me fly.

234
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,227
BOP

235
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,231
CURRENTLY FIVE CHILDREN
IN THE BALL PIT

236
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,134
Look, here comes
the tallest plane in the world.

237
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,370
Do you want to fly?

238
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,838
Why don't I get you up in the air?

239
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,173
How about it?

240
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,941
I'll make you fly. Come here, Won.

241
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,644
Won, she'll help you fly. Go to her.

242
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,979
IGNORES JIN-KYUNG

243
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,648
Guys, this is how you do it.

244
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,116
A DEMONSTRATION

245
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,852
FALLS RIGHT AWAY

246
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,220
Okay. This is it…

247
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,022
STARING

248
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,858
-That was…
-Do you want to fly, I-seo?

249
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,926
SHAKES HER HEAD

250
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,794
NOT TO THIS FUTURE VIEWER'S LIKING

251
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,596
Woo-young, lie in the ball pit.

252
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,265
-I'd rather not--
-Go on.

253
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,566
Come on. Get me in the air.

254
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,568
-Look, everyone.
-I haven't tried this in a while.

255
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,571
This may be much more challenging.

256
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,006
Wanna fly in the air, Won?

257
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,440
-No.
-No?

258
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,977
Lift me up.

259
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,445
Do it.

260
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,047
Come on. You have to
stretch out your arms.

261
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,383
SHAKING LIKE A LEAF

262
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,886
Dang it!

263
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,688
I can't hold you up, okay?

264
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,723
A SHORTER PASSENGER

265
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,758
-Sook.
-Go on.

266
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:19,792
-Try lifting Sook.
-Wait.

267
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:20,760
Come on!

268
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,596
-Excuse me, ma'am!
-Lift me up.

269
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,264
-Go on.
-Try it.

270
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,899
Why don't I lift you up?

271
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,570
HERE'S A SILENT OBSERVER

272
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,637
Three, two, one.

273
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,372
CAN THIS PLANE TAKE OFF
BEFORE THE DAY IS UP?

274
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,775
-Why are your legs so weak?
-What's the matter with you?

275
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,578
-What's up with your legs?
-That was downright pathetic.

276
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,880
DISAPPOINTED

277
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,583
See? We frightened all the kids away.

278
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,154
THE DISAPPOINTMENT
DROVE THE CHILDREN AWAY ONE BY ONE

279
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,655
Lift me up!

280
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,123
THE KIDS WILL RETURN
IF YOU LIFT ME UP

281
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,792
I can't believe you.

282
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:53,926
What's wrong with you?

283
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,062
-Forget it, you.
-I don't get you at all.

284
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,296
Seriously…

285
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,397
Sae-ho!

286
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,732
Woo-jae!

287
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,903
THE SOLE REMAINING YOUNGSTER
GETS ALL THE SCOLDING

288
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,137
Sae-ho!

289
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,439
Woo-jae!

290
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,574
LET'S CHECK ON THEM

291
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,742
Mom!

292
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,143
What are you doing?

293
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,913
-What are you doing, Hae-sa?
-What?

294
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,581
My gosh. Hae-sa's putting on makeup.

295
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,584
Are you putting on makeup, Hae-sa?

296
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,119
ACTUALLY…

297
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,922
HAE-SA SHOWED INTEREST IN THE VANITY
10 MINUTES AGO

298
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,690
LET'S START DOLLING MYSELF UP

299
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,827
IT'S TIME FOR A GLOW-UP

300
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,430
REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHERS WERE DOING

301
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:37,069
HAE-SA STAYED BY THE VANITY
THE WHOLE TIME

302
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,538
Can you sit here, Hae-sa?

303
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,708
All right. Let's work on the base first.

304
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,245
I'm going to put on the foundation now.

305
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,914
I'LL SHOW YOU
AN EXPERIENCED MODEL'S SKILLS

306
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,383
The foundation's been applied.

307
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,851
Where do we apply this?

308
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,287
Your lips.

309
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,189
SWISH SWISH

310
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,792
She's so adorable. After the lipstick…

311
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,927
Now for your eyes.

312
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,195
Let's apply some eye shadow.

313
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,463
Which color would you like?

314
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,698
HMM…

315
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,033
This one?

316
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,236
Close your eyes for me.

317
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,305
This side too.

318
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,408
BOTH WOO-JAE AND HAE-SA ARE VERY SERIOUS

319
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,678
It's time for a manicure.

320
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,046
Let's take care of your nails.

321
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,083
LIGHT AND DELICATE TOUCHES

322
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,952
ONE STRAND GOT LOOSE

323
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,790
CONTRARY TO RUMORS,
UNCLE WOO-JAE SEEMS KIND AND METICULOUS

324
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,525
Shall we draw pictures, A-yun?

325
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,494
Can you draw a picture of me?
Come this way.

326
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,862
Drawing?

327
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:37,797
Yes, please.

328
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,231
I want blue.

329
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,733
Draw me here, please.

330
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,068
Would you like to draw too?

331
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,636
WELL…

332
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,770
Would you rather try more makeup?

333
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,505
More makeup it is, then.

334
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,407
Turns out Hae-sa loves makeup.

335
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,375
Show me your hands.

336
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,910
BACK TO THEIR LITTLE SALON GAME

337
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,611
Rub your palms like this and do this.

338
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,213
FOLLOWING MR. PIKACHU'S DIRECTION

339
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,315
HOW ADORABLE…

340
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,483
Just like this.

341
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,551
WITNESS THIS CUTENESS AGAIN

342
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,452
Light dabs.

343
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,288
Use gentle touches.
Hydration is very important.

344
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,255
Gently.

345
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,224
Share the moisture with your skin.

346
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,561
You have five minutes left
to impress the children.

347
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,131
Did you have fun hanging out with me?

348
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,971
That's my picture of you.

349
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,640
-That's me?
-Yeah.

350
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:22,641
Who is this?

351
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,276
It's you.

352
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,645
Gosh, that's me?

353
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,114
That's your face.

354
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,482
I have a question.

355
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,385
A-yun, who's your favorite
out of Mr. Joo over there and me?

356
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,855
-What?
-I like…

357
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,856
Who's your favorite?

358
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,224
-You.
-Really?

359
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,126
Thank you.

360
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,594
STOP ASKING, OKAY?

361
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,795
You're all set.

362
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,730
Let's clap to celebrate.

363
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,333
(OVERWHELMED BY HAE-SA'S ADORABLENESS)

364
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,368
HAE-SA RETURNS AFTER HER GLOW-UP

365
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,936
Hae-sa.

366
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,105
Look at Hae-sa with her makeup on.

367
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,673
My gosh, you're so pretty.

368
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,809
Look how pretty she's gotten.

369
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,943
Want a plane ride, Hae-sa?

370
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,880
THIS IS WHY DADS DOTE ON THEIR GIRLS

371
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,149
UP WE GO

372
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,186
JUST WATCHING THIS PLANE FLY
IS THERAPEUTIC

373
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,154
Hae-sa.

374
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,224
COMPARED TO WHAT THE OTHER TEAM IS DOING…

375
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,127
WHAT A LOVELY SIGHT

376
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,463
I'll lift you up too, Hae-sa.

377
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,898
You're going to fly higher this time.

378
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,132
Brace yourself.

379
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,536
My gosh, you're flying so high.

380
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,171
Stretch out your arms, Hae-sa.

381
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,205
LIKE THIS?

382
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,640
FIDGET

383
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,675
THESE UNCLES JUST LOVE HER

384
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,846
Hae-sa seemed like the reserved type,
but she's opened up to us. Look.

385
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,548
-Hae-sa.
-Can you give me a hug, Hae-sa?

386
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,515
THEY'VE GROWN CLOSER

387
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,117
Gosh, Hae-sa.

388
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,351
Give me a hug too, Hae-sa.

389
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,420
Come on. Give me a hug.

390
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,956
-Give me a hug, I-na.
-Gosh, you precious little thing.

391
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,791
WOO-JAE HAS BECOME HAE-SA'S FAN

392
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,027
Give me a hug, I-na.

393
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,028
NO WAY

394
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,996
SOME STILL REMAIN RATHER PRICKLY

395
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,665
A-yun, can you give me a hug?

396
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,400
RUSHING INTO HIS ARMS

397
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,573
What's this? Whose is this?

398
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,608
Did you name tag fall off, Seo-jin?

399
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,742
EXPERTLY HANDLING A REQUEST

400
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,544
-Your time is up.
-Really?

401
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,446
Yes. We'll wrap things up after the vote.

402
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,082
IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE THE BEST TEACHER!

403
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,285
-Want to sit next to Uncle Woo-young, Won?
-Who?

404
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,954
Do you want to go sit next to him?

405
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,789
-No.
-No?

406
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,924
I-SEO: SIT NEXT TO ME

407
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,292
MS. STRAIGHT-SHOOTER

408
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,729
THE CUTE PAIR IS JOINED AT THE HIP

409
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,665
THE CHILDREN ARE TO GIVE A VITAMIN CANDY

410
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,768
TO THE TEACHER THEY WANT TO MEET AGAIN

411
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,239
All right. We'll close our eyes now.

412
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,306
I'm closing my eyes now.

413
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,241
WINK

414
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,141
-Okay--
-Hold on.

415
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,543
-Wait, that's out of line.
-I'm ready.

416
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,878
COOKIES FOR BRIBING

417
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,546
Come on, that's not cool.

418
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,947
Why did you open your eyes?

419
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,682
-Seriously, Jin-kyung.
-Why did you peek?

420
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:44,850
Because I heard something rustling.

421
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,952
BRIBING, PEEKING

422
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:47,853
Let's close our eyes.

423
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,855
-Don't do it, Jin-kyung.
-Don't play tricks.

424
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,757
-That got all the kids hooked.
-We're closing our eyes now.

425
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,426
AFTER THE SNACK BAG IS HIDDEN,
YUL WALKS UP TO THEM TO CAST HIS VOTE

426
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,328
Guys.

427

(BEGGING FOR LOVE)

428
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,400
YUL CHOOSES GRAMPS?!

429
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,504

430
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,673
YUL CHOOSES JIN-KYUNG

431
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,774

433
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,210
Guys.

434
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,413
-Yul, come back.
-Come to me, kids.

435
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,648
JIN-KYUNG GETS THE FIRST VOTE

436
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,950
Which teacher is your favorite, Won?

437
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,752
We had fun, didn't we?

438
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,420
I was so happy, you know.

439
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,055
-Off you go, Won.
-We had fun, right?

440
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,323
WHO IS WON'S FAVORITE?

441
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,326
-I was so happy.
-I did end up losing my voice…

442
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,028
-I would like to see you again.
-Thank you.

443
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,763

Seong-jun, or was it Sang-jun?

446
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,569
HO-WON CHOOSES SOOK

447
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,938
Remember our time together.

448
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,306
ONLY PERSON TO RECEIVE 0 VOTES

449
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,541
I'm not a beast.

450
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,376
I'm a human prince.

451
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,979
JIN-KYUNG GOT 3 VOTES!

452
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,347
-Thank you.
-Hang on.

453
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,682
Why do I keep hearing her say thanks?

454
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,016
I'm a person.

455
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,017
Woo-young…

456
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,686
Guys.

457
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,321

We're friends.

459
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,659
-What are we doing?
-Seong-jun.

460
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,995
When are they giving us the candy?

461
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,164
THE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THEM

462
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,166
I'm right behind you.

463
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,133
NEXT UP IS SEONG-JUN

464
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,101
Seong-jun.

465
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,035
3 VOTES, 2 VOTES, 0 VOTES

466
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,904
-Seong-jun.
-I'll treat you to a meal.

467
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,639
CRACKING UP

468
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,673
Seong-jun.

469
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,275
NOT INTERESTED

470
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,043
-How about some pork ribs?
-Seong-jun.

471
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,445
Seong-jun.

472
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,013
PORK RIBS?

473
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,715
Fine. Beef ribs.

474
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,551
Do you like snacks, Seong-jun?

475
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,553
Where is he?

476
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,687
Chuck flap tail.

477
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,157
Chuck flap tail.

478
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,325
-Pair it with water celery.
-So?

479
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,060
-That's hilarious.
-Guys.

480
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,562
-Seong-jun.
-With bracken too…

481
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,230
Has Seong-jun not made his choice yet?

482
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,433
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE VOTE IS GOING

483
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,802
-Guys, listen.
-Where are you, Seong-jun?

484
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,471
-Can you give me a hand, Seong-jun?
-Guys.

485
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,239
-I won't ask for more.
-I swear I'll treat you.

486
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,042
SLOW
BUT APPROACHING LITTLE BY LITTLE

487
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,377
-Seong-jun.
-I love you, Seong-jun.

488
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,578
What's this, Seong-jun?

489
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,981
Even when I'm with my dentist,

490
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,783
I don't hold my mouth open this long.

491
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,020
ONCE AGAIN, THE VOTING BOXES ARE OPEN

492
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,521
-I need my medicine.
-Seong-jun.

493
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,856
Medicine, please.

494
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,557
TIME FOR A MAJOR REALITY CHECK

495
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,526
-Seong-jun, my jaw hurts.
-Medicine, please.

496
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,328
YUL STEPS IN FOR HIS FRIEND

497
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,030
-There we go.
-Yul's helping?

498
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,331
Good idea. Please help, Yul.

499
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,199
Wait, Yul. Come on.

500
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,868
THE CANDY WENT INTO SOOK'S MOUTH

501
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,903
-Thanks, Seong-jun.
-Thank you.

502
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,271
A 3-TO-3 TIE BETWEEN SOOK AND JIN-KYUNG

503
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,440
Go give it to them, I-seo.

504
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,841
FINAL VOTER, I-SEO

505
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,343
-How hilarious.
-Off you go.

506
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,377
I-seo…

507
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm sure she'll choose me.

508
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:28,947
WITHOUT HESITATION

509
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,315
-I-seo.
-She'll choose me.

510
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,285
I-SEO CHOOSES WOO-YOUNG

511
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,320
-Who did I-seo choose?
-Woo-young.

512
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,221
Woo-young?

513
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,389
DIED OF HAPPINESS

514
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,290
-That's it.
-It's over.

515
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,893
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND
HE WON 1 VOTE, NOT 1ST PLACE

516
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,396
Good job giving the Narae Class a fun day.

517
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,665
The children have chosen

518
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,400
the teacher they'd like to meet again.

519
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,170
Are we not giving them a chance
to change their answer?

520
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,471
-Due to a control issue,
-Right.

521
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,473
they don't get a chance to reconsider.

522
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,241
Okay. Please turn around on three.

523
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,677
One, two, three.

524
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,878
WHO WON MORE VOTES?

525
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:00,979
Gosh, what's this?

526
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,415
One, two, three.

527
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,517
Gosh, what's this?

528
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,886
TEAM SAE-HO: JEONG-HU, SEO-JIN
TEAM WOO-JAE: HAE-SA, I-NA

529
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,521
WAIT

530
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:10,989
Who did you choose, A-yun?

531
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,792
A-YUN SITTING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

532
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,227
Who did you choose, A-yun?

533
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,062
(LEADING HER TO HIS SIDE)
(OVERJOYED TO SEE TWO KIDS)

534
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,397
Who did you choose, A-yun? Me?

535
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,898
-Gosh, I-na.
-Did you choose me?

536
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,000
AT THAT MOMENT, A-YUN GOES TO SAE-HO

537
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,070
Hey, I won!

538
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,439
It's a three-to-two victory!

539
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,708
-Wait.
-A-yun came to me.

540
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,376
She said she chose Woo-jae.

541
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,478
But her final choice was me.

542
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,815
JUST 5 MINUTES AGO

543
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,916
I like him more.

544
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,351
You do? Sit here.

545
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,919
Shh. Let's keep it a secret.

546
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,854
Let's ask A-yun.

547
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,523
-A-yun!
-Who would you like to meet again?

548
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,024
-Give me a hug.
-Tell us.

549
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,893
Hug the teacher you'd like to meet again.

550
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,228
WHO DOES A-YUN REALLY FAVOR?

551
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,196
Hug the teacher you'd like to meet again.

552
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,166
SHE CHOSE SAE-HO

553
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,168
SAE-HO TAKES THE 3-TO-2 VICTORY

554
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,337
WHAT A BUMMER

555
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:03,275
Goodness, Hae-sa. We had fun first.
You only hung out with Woo-jae at the end.

556
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,910
-I-na.
-Thank you.

557
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,879
-You chose me, didn't you?
-The final twist.

558
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,447
A-yun changed her mind at the end.

559
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,849
-I mentioned a gift earlier.
-Right.

560
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,351
-I'm sure you remember.
-Of course.

561
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,219
We did prepare a special gift.

562
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,621
-Okay.
-Good for us.

563
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,458
I believe you couldn't have received
such an honor before.

564
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,995
We have the amazing director
from the Love Forest Day Care Center.

565
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,997
-Oh, I see.
-This is Director An.

566
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,266
-You have my deep respect.
-Thank you.

567
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,902
-Please award him the prize.
-All right.

568
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,538
We jumped through hoops to secure it.

569
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,441
Jin-kyung and Sook. The teacher
from Love Forest Day Care Center

570
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,710
will give you an award certificate.

571
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,712
-You should stand up.
-Yes, it's an award.

572
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,947
-An award?
-Congrats.

573
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,215
What about the gift?

574
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,350
-An award certificate?
-That's it?

575
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,053
The award certificate
from Director An is your gift.

576
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,987
-Really?
-Yes.

577
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,055
It's an honor.

578
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,323
"Award Certificate."

579
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,027
"You have formed a genuine connection
with the children of Narae Class

580
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,095
-as a one-day teacher."
-Lighten up, dude.

581
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,897
-"You won their love…
-I'm happy.

582
00:19:58,964 --> 00:19:59,798
-Look at him.
-…and became

583
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,734
their favorite teacher.
As such, I give you this certificate."

584
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,769
Thank you!

585
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,706
My gosh. Director An, is there no gift?

586
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,974
Applause, please.

587
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,043
-No, there isn't.
-Let's clap for Mr. Cho.

588
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,578
JUST TAKE THE WARM APPLAUSE

589
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,980
-Perhaps some prize money?
-Prize money?

590
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,848
CLINGY

591
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,083
Sae-ho.

592
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,052
This is downright unseemly.

593
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,620
Wait, it's not like that.

594
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,488
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

595
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,856
-Thank you.
-My gosh.

596
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,192
-I didn't expect this.
-Congrats, Sook. Thank you.

597
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,193
Thank you.

598
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,295
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you, everyone.

599
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,631
Such an honor doesn't come by easily.

600
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,532
Of course not.

601
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,603
Yes, exactly. For me,
getting I-seo's approval

602
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,839
-was rewarding enough.
-I feel you.

603
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,474
That made my heart full.

604
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,642
I-SEO'S VITAMIN CANDY AWARD

605
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,344
Are you leaving now?

606
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,079
-What?
-Are you going away?

607
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,780
-It is over.
-What?

608
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:49,815
Are you leaving?

609
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,717
-Yes.
-Yeah, let's catch up later.

610
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,851
-Okay.
-All right.

611
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,853
-Let's meet again. Bye.
-Goodbye.

612
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,290
THE GOODBYES TUG AT OUR HEARTSTRINGS

613
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,225
Bye, Yul.

614
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,793
Let's meet again.

615
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,629
-Please give me a hug.
-Thank you.

616
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:04,963
-My gosh.
-Bye.

617
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,198
Take care.

618
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:07,799
Thanks for today.

619
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,368
-Let's meet again.
-Give me a hug, Seo-jin.

620
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,169
Why do you have to leave now?

621
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,604
Let's take a photo.

622
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,505
Just one photo.

623
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,840
Come here.

624
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:15,741
All right.

625
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,809
One, two, three. Smile.

626
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,013
WE'LL REMEMBER JULY 14, 2025
FOR LONG IN OUR HEARTS

627
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:22,981
-Bye.
-Bye.

628
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:23,915
I-seo.

629
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,550
#WITH ANGELIC FUTURE VIEWERS

630
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,019
How adorable.

631
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,420
I got attached already.

632
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,222
All it took was a single hour.

633
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,290
Goodbye.

634
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,891
Bye, I-na.

635
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,326
See you, Seo-jin.

636
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,927
Thank you.

637
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,263
I love you.

638
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,766
That wasn't easy at all.

639
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,702
Man, I'm covered in sweat.

640
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:44,703
IT'S FINALLY OVER…

641
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,738
-Great work.
-Thank you so much.

642
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,240
-My gosh…
-I know they can be a handful.

643
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,841
Ma'am, you're the best.

644
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,510
AFTER THE STORM…

645
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:55,080
THEY GATHER TO WAIT
FOR THE NEXT PART OF THE SHOOT…

646
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,215
Gosh, being around kids
drained all my energy.

647
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,017
Taking care of them is no joke.

648
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,385
I'm so tired.

649
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,787
Look at Woo-jae.

650
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,789
(WOO-JAE'S LOOKING DRAINED)

651
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,123
Just look at him.

652
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,225
-What happened to him?
-It was rough.

653
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,527
He looks like someone took his soul.

654
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,929
WITH EVERYONE FEELING LIKE
THEIR SOUL HAS BEEN DRAINED…

655
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,164
We need the aprons back on?

656
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,200
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO
WEAR THEIR APRONS AGAIN?

657
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,236
TO BE A LONG-RUNNING VARIETY SHOW…

658
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:23,408
EVERYONE MUST PUT IN MORE WORK

659
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,546
WE'LL SOON BE MEETING A VIEWER
OF A BIT MORE DISTANT FUTURE

660
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:32,484
SO PLEASE PUT YOUR APRONS BACK ON
AND RETURN TO THE KIDS CAFÉ

661
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,422
What's going on?

662
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,591
Goodness.

663
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,126
FIRST TO ENTER IS WOO-YOUNG

664
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,060
My gosh.

665
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:42,994
Hello.

666
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,663
WHY DO WE HAVE A TODDLER HERE?

667
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,797
Hi.

668
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,432
GREETINGS FIRST

669
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,867
Hi.

670
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,036
Hello.

671
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,437
HE'S MUCH YOUNGER THAN THE KIDS EARLIER!

672
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,507
HELLO

673
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,142
Hello.

674
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,210
Hi.

675
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,344
WHY IS A BABY LEFT HERE ALONE?

676
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,347
BRIGHTLY SHINING EYES

677
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,882
He has such big eyes.

678
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,984
Such large eyes…

679
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,787
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

680
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,189
I'm the Prince.

681
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,758
PROCESSING THE FIRST ENCOUNTER…

682
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,093
Who are you, buddy?

683
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,764
IS THE BABY GEARING UP FOR A WAIL?

684
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,298
All right, then.

685
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,134
Let's have some fun.

686
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,735
We're going to have some fun.

687
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,404
Okay.

688
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,440
All right. Let's try this snack.

689
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:33,612
TO OPEN UP THIS FUTURE VIEWER'S HEART,
WOO-YOUNG CHOOSES BRIBERY

690
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,714
It's so good, isn't it?

691
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,282
GIVE ME MORE

692
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,617
Delicious, right?

693
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,885
What do you see in there?

694
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,088
-You like this, don't you?
-Please join me.

695
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,290
-Shall I take it out? Here.
-Won, you're hurting my feelings.

696
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,591
It's so good, right?

697
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,226
THIS MAY GO EASIER THAN EARLIER…

698
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,061
So good.

699
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,196
THAT SAID…

700
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:52,931
You love it.

701
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,132
…WOULDN'T HE HAVE TO DO MORE?

702
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,033
It's that good.

703
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,868
You want some more?

704
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,370
You'd love some more.

705
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,340
It's so good.

706
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,843
BURSTS INTO TEARS

707
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:09,881
SHAKEN

708
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,184
Here. Why don't you drink some water?

709
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,285
Here's your water.

710
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,753
Drink this.

711
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,787
THE EYE CONTACT MADE HIM WAIL

712
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:16,822
Go ahead.

713
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,824
I DON'T GET IT… WHY HE'S CRYING?

714
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,094
IS HE SHOWING INTEREST?

715
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,030
NO, HE'S NOT

716
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,466
Oh, goodness. Take one more of these.

717
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,000
Here you go. It's so good.

718
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,469
WHAT COULD BE UPSETTING HIM?

719
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,471
Are you looking for your mom?

720
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,339
Should I take my wig off?

721
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,574
(IS MY WIG TICKING HIM OFF?)

722
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,409
WITHOUT HESITATION

723
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,777
You found that scary, right?

724
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,813
You know what? Let's throw that away.

725
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:43,181
It's gone.

726
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,952
I have more snacks for you.

727
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,320
Have a snack.

728
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,656
Here's your snack.

729
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,392
NOW THAT THE WIG IS GONE,
LET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER

730
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,294
It's so good, right?

731
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,063
So good.

732
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,131
How delicious.

733
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,434
HIS SECOND FLOOD OF TEARS

734
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,069
SO LOST, UNSURE WHAT TO DO

735
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,272
A BRUSH WITH A BRAND-NEW STAGE
OF CHILD CARE

736
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,007
Drink water.

737
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:09,941
NOVICE REACTING CALMLY

738
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,409
Who upset you so badly?

739
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,278
Who bothered you?

740
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,713
You're drinking like a champ.

741
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,914
Great job.

742
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:16,815
Do you want a puff?

743
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,484
One more? Well done.

744
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,785
It's yummy, right?

745
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,654
Want another sip of water?

746
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,690
HE'S HAD ANOTHER BITE OF THE SNACK…
HAS HE CALMED DOWN NOW?

747
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,259
How yummy.

748
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,827
It's so good, right?

749
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,695
IS HE A GOOD PERSON?

750
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,667
How interesting.

751
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,105
PRINCE DOES ALL HE CAN
TO WIN OVER THE FUTURE VIEWER

752
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,306
Do you want to ride this?

753
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,641
Why don't you try it?

754
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,808
Why don't you try it?

755
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,844
You love the idea, don't you?

756
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:46,912
You love it.

757
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,449
I'D LOVE THAT

758
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,820
I FINALLY GOT YOU SMILING!

759
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,322
There's another kids' room.

760
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,490
What's Woo-young doing here?

761
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,727
HERE COME A BAND
OF MORE SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING PEOPLE

762
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,728
Wanna try it?

763
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,463
What do you say?

764
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,266
WILL THIS FUTURE VIEWER BE ABLE TO
REMAIN CALM AT THEIR STRANGE MUGS?

765
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,635
-He's so cute.
-I'll help you hop on.

766
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:11,536
Who is he, Woo-young?

767
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,004
My goodness.

768
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,308
THE GROUP WALKS IN

769
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,742
I just found him here.

770
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:18,910
Hi.

771
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:19,978
Look, it's Pororo.

772
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,180
You're a perfect little angel.

773
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,248
He's so beautiful.

774
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,349
(PROCESSING THINGS)

775
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,318
I should wipe his tears.

776
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,721
Hello.

777
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,089
I should wipe his tears.

778
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:32,824
Hello.

779
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,026
TEARS ARE POOLING AGAIN!

780
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,828
FEELING ANXIOUS

781
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,930
STUDYING HIS MOOD

782
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,967
One look at Sook, and he's crying.

783
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:44,836
I took off my wig too.

784
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,305
THE DAM OF TEARS BREAKS AGAIN

785
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,809
LET'S GO BACK
TO JUST 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOOT…

786
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,614
LEE E-DAM
12-MONTH-OLD

787
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,617
Who's on camera right now?

788
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,086
Is that you, E-dam?

789
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,520
HE HAD FUN WITH THE UNFAMILIAR CAMERA

790
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,860
HE WOULD SMILE
AT EYE CONTACT WITH CREW MEMBERS

791
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,262
I took off my wig too.

792
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,497
Wipe away his snot.

793
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,200
Seeing Sook made him cry right away.

794
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,168
No way. It's because of Woo-young.

795
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,971
Woo-young made three kids cry
in the first half of the shoot.

796
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,406
HOW DO WE TACKLE THIS?

797
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,812
HOW DO YOU CONSOLE THE FUTURE VIEWER
WHO CAN'T SPEAK JUST YET?

798
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,682
HERE'S TODAY'S MISSION!
GET TO KNOW THE FUTURE VIEWER

799
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,684
GEARING UP THE SHENANIGANS

800
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,686
DISTRACTING DITTIES

801
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,454
E-dam.

802
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,989
PLEASE LOOK AT ME

803
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,493
A RATHER SLOPPY TALENT SHOW
FOR THE FUTURE VIEWER

804
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,395
HE COULDN'T CARE LESS

805
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,696
COMEDIAN PORORO DISPATCHED

806
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,964
Do you like kittens?

807
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,067
You like me, don't you?

808
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,602
You're fond of me.

809
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,039
SECRET WEAPON: BLEATING SOUND

810
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,341
STARTLED

811
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,677
I'm going to approach him slowly.

812
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,946
A DISSATISFIED GROAN

813
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,216
THE BLEATING SOUND
ONLY BACKFIRED ON SAE-HO

814
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,819
NEXT UP IS THE EXPERIENCED MOTHER

815
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,656
MADAM CANDELABRA SINGS "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"
THOUGH IT'S NO ONE'S BIRTHDAY

816
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,591
SOOK BUILDS UP HARMONY WHILE SHE'S AT IT

817
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,495
-Our dearest E-dam
-Our dearest E-dam

818
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:20,365
-Happy birthday to you
-Your tune sounds so mournful.

819
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,033
Did I make you sad?

820
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,069
Wait, here's your cheese.

821
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,603
Would you like your rice puff?

822
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,971
We can hang out while having some cheese.

823
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,709
-Oops.
-He can walk a bit.

824
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:31,976
Why don't we go over there?

825
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,144
-Okay.
-Shall we?

826
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,013
I doubt he'd ever come.

827
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,980
UNCLE WOO-JAE'S UNIQUE IDEA

828
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,416
He could come to us after he gets bored.

829
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,286
WOO-JAE'S PITCH: E-DAM MAY COME TO US
AFTER HE'S DONE PLAYING BY HIMSELF

830
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,488
E-dam. We have some cheese here.

831
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,157
WILL HIS PUSH-AND-PULL IDEA YIELD RESULTS?

832
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,592
He might be hungry.

833
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,328
-He must be hungry.
-Here he comes.

834
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,631
HE'S APPROACHING THEM!

835
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,735
COOING

836
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,269
E-dam.

837
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,271
A MOMENT'S REST TO OBSERVE THE FUNNY MAN

838
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,208
OFF HE GOES AGAIN

839
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,943
(A SLICED CHEESE HELD AT THE READY)

840
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,849
HALTS

841
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,951
MAKING A BIG C

842
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,020
A LONG GROAN

843
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,589
He was on his way to us…

844
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,459
E-dam.

845
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,696
THE FUTURE VIEWER
KEEPS ON GOING TO THE ROOM'S CORNER

846
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,064
Great job.

847
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,132
THE TRUTH IS…

848
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,168
HIS MOTHER IS HERE…

849
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,537
AS MUCH AS WE WANTED TO
GIVE HER A SHORT BREAK…

850
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,438
E-dam.

851
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,075
…WE COULDN'T BECAUSE OF THESE SCREWBALLS

852
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,144
Peekaboo.

853
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,212
BREAKING THE SHOW'S CONCEPT

854
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,047
I could try this car.

855
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,216
(MOM)

856
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,651
E-dam.

857
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,619
Whose bag is this?

858
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,455
-Could it be E-dam's bag?
-Maybe his parents left it here.

859
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,157
-There's a note.
-Is this a toddler's bag?

860
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,191
Look, diapers are here.

861
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,259
And a note too.

862
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,528
I can see his snacks too.

863
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,129
-I see some diapers and other stuff.
-Wait.

864
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,030
A handkerchief.

865
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:03,001
"Hello, the child is Lee E-dam.
He's a 12-month-old boy."

866
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,502
"This is his mom writing the note."

867
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,771
"He's not the shy type,

868
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:09,507
but he may need some time
to get used to a room full of strangers."

869
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,508
AN INSTRUCTION FOR THE CAST

870
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,745
"My energetic boy enjoys activities
involving physical contact

871
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,315
such as ball games, piggyback ride, tag,
and lifting him like a plane."

872
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,752
"If he acts fickle, approaching you
to hold him and then pushing you away,

873
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,854
feel free to let him wander freely."

874
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:25,723
"He's mouthing these days,
so he takes everything into his mouth."

875
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,393
"When he does that,
please have him suck on his pacifier."

876
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,529
"If he's whimpering a lot for no reason,
he must be feeling hungry."

877
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,499
"E-dam is supposed to have
some soft tofu around 12:30 p.m.

878
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,868
and drink some formula
between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m."

879
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,970
"The excess gas
must be expelled after his meals."

880
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,738
"Please rub on his back so he'd burp."

881
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,507
-I did the same for my niece.
-Soft tofu.

882
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,875
"Please take good care of him."

883
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,744
-What time is it?
-Could she have had a business trip?

884
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,213
I wonder why this responsibility

885
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,382
-came to be ours.
-This could be the biggest challenge.

886
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,518
Let's get that soft tofu ready.

887
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,554
We have to microwave
the soft tofu for 30 seconds.

888
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,989
LET'S FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!

889
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,591
Take the lid off…

890
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,492

00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,671
He's beaming.

896
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,440
E-dam.

897
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,508
There you go.

898
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,576
-Good job.
-Look.

899
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,478
-Here's your yummy treat.
-Let's eat.

900
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,547
SOFT TOFU IS NOW READY

901
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,282
It's time for your lunch

902
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,783
Look.

903
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,254
NOM

904
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,388
Good job.

905
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,824
You're eating like a champ.

906
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,692
The instruction said
we have to mix it up for him.

907
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,727
You want more?

908
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,495
-Have some cheese.
-Turns out he's hungry.

909
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,397
Oh, I got you.

910
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,199
MAYBE HE CRIED BECAUSE OF HUNGER?

911
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,368
-He wants some more quickly.
-I got you.

912
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,502
That looks so good.

913
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,770
I'll give you more tofu.

914
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,841
He's so adorable.

915
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,142
-Okay. Open wide.
-How cute.

916
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,044
HE TAKES MS. CANDELABRA'S FOOD
WITHOUT A COMPLAINT

917
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,279
My gosh.

918
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:58,616
PORORO'S AIRPLANE SHOW

919
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,918
A BIG BITE

920
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,121
ONE MORE

921
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:08,526
HE TAKES BITES OF THE CHEESE TOO

922
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,029
All right. Flight Yum-yum, now taking off.

923
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,096
It's your food.

924
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,999
Hey, here it comes.

925
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,636
-Soft tofu.
-It's tofu.

926
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,639
It's silky soft.

927
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,707
Here he comes.

928
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,841
He's crawling to you.

929
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:24,742
Open wide.

930
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,811
E-DAM IS GETTING TO KNOW EVERYONE
BY TAKING A BITE FROM EACH

931
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,379
-Great job.
-It's so good, right?

932
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,647
Applause.

933
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,050
The important fact
is that he likes Pororo.

934
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,919
That's because your costume
doesn't have any scary elements.

935
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:35,987
That's true.

936
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,323
-But our costumes…
-The scariest-looking person

937
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,757
is actually Sook.

938
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:40,892
SOOK LOOKS THE SCARIEST!

939
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,928
One look at Sook, and he's crying.

940
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,964
HE DID BURST INTO TEARS
FROM THE FIRST ENCOUNTER

941
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,265
His eyes fill whenever he sees Sook.

942
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,000
DESPITE THE TRICKS…

943
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,202
GRAMPS ONLY MADE HIM CRY

944
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,371
-Where are you going? Come this way.
-He wants his mom.

945
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,307
Shoot, I scare him.

946
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,342
I'M GIVING HIM UNEASE…

947
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,277
GRAMPS HAS STAYED AWAY

948
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,581
NOT TO MAKE THE FUTURE VIEWER WEEP…

949
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,285
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

950
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,787
Why don't I change my look?

951
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,055
SHE'S CHANGING HER LOOK?

952
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,290
I could wear this.

953
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,257
I'M DONE WITH HIDING

954
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,625
I'll wear this.

955
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,927
Won't that scare him?

956
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,996
SOOK'S MAKEOVER BEGINS

957
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,964
TRIUMPHANT PORORO
IS HOGGING E-DAM'S ATTENTION

958
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,699
You love that, don't you?

959
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,734
I'll help you put it on.

960
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,802
Gosh, you're so cute.

961
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,504
How lovely.

962
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:27,572
They fit him perfectly.

963
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,508
He must love the sunglasses.

964
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,843
He likes sunglasses?

965
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,178
This should be enough to make him giggle.

966
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,079
HEH

967
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,581
Won't he wail big time?

968
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,317
Hello.

969
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,652
Hello.

970
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,587
Hello.

971
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,488
How terrifying.

972
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,757
What on earth, Sook?

973
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,759
What are you even wearing?

974
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,128
Gosh, that's scary.

975
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,062
WHAT'S THIS?

976
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,431
If someone followed me at night
looking like that,

977
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,632
I'd lose my mind.

978
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,700
I'd leave that town.

979
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,136
The important thing
is that E-dam isn't crying.

980
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,270
E-DAM'S RESPONSE MATTERS MOST!

981
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,505
Why don't I feed him?

982
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,140
PLUCKS UP THE COURAGE TO FEED E-DAM

983
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,142
-Open wide.
-Say, "ah."

984
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,044
-Open wide.
-Say, "ah."

985
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,346
-Open wide.
-Say, "ah."

986
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,083
AT ANY RATE, HE TAKES FOOD
FROM SOOK WITHOUT A FUSS

987
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,619
Why don't I feed him
to see if he doesn't mind my brows?

988
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:15,653
He's still staring.

989
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,021
-E-dam.
-Sook got him hooked.

990
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,356
-I sure did.
-Yeah.

991
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,425
-You don't mind my brows?
-You want these?

992
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,826
Do my brows not scare you?

993
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,828
His gaze is right on the sunglasses.

994
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,962
Look right here.

995
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:25,963
So he digs sunglasses.

996
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,399
Do you like sunglasses?

997
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,301
He likes seeing his reflection in them.

998
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,637
E-DAM MUST LOVE SUNGLASSES

999
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,305
Can you get me a pair too?

1000
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,340
Turns out sunglasses held the key.

1001
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,843
BLISSFULLY HAPPY

1002
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,211
-No thanks.
-Right, you have a pair.

1003
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,979
Here are your sunglasses.

1004
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:42,947
E-dam.

1005
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,549
Can you look at me?

1006
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,184
-What have I got here?
-Sunglasses.

1007
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,485
RATHER A STRANGE SIGHT

1008
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,220
Look.

1009
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,621
Just like makeup…

1010
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,390
How lovely you are.

1011
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,525
FOR AN INNOCENT CHILD,
THIS MIGHT BE FASCINATING

1012
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,895
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS?

1013
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,263
No, that's scaring him.

1014
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,364
It's not working.

1015
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,432
We're scaring him.

1016
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,038
We're becoming good friends.

1017
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,406
NOT DIGGING THIS

1018
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,175
-Maybe he didn't like sunglasses.
-We're becoming close. Gosh, how cute.

1019
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,213
But he has definitely warmed up to me
compared to earlier.

1020
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,981
-Don't you agree?
-Covering the eyes helped.

1021
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,483
A-HAHA

1022
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,051
Covering the eyes helped.

1023
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,688
-Sook, you could probably join…
-Hey, look.

1024
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,791
-Sook, you could probably join…
-Hey, look.

1025
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,160
-…the actors in Haunted Mansion as is.
-Look, guys.

1026
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,828
-Look at him.
-He loves Sook.

1027
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,230
SHE'S HIS NEW FAVORITE

1028
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,631
Pour 210 ml.

1029
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,467
Good. Keep it going.

1030
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,738
E-DAM APPROACHES SOOK AGAIN

1031
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,974
(DOES HE WANT A HUG?)

1032
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,644
A PAIR OF BESTIES

1033
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:51,282
HE MUST LIKE THE SUNGLASSES!

1034
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,787
THEY'RE IN A WORLD OF THEIR OWN…

1035
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,923
-Let's get you comfortable.
-Here we go.

1036
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,926
Shouldn't we go find
somewhere more comfortable?

1037
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:02,860
Will that do?

1038
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,996
Sook looks like she's in element.

1039
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,131
I've never seen you look so gentle.

1040
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,733
DEFINITELY A NEW SIGHT

1041
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,869
Seriously, the Great Kim Sook
is holding a toddler to feed him.

1042
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,171
It's a unique sight.

1043
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,239
Turns out E-dam likes me best.

1044
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,675
You all said I scared him, didn't you?

1045
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,678
But beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

1046
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,746
Incredible.

1047
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:22,780
She's his great-grandmother.

1048
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,349
Birth Goddess.

1049
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,817
-Great-grandmother.
-Birth Goddess.

1050
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,487
-She's definitely the great-grandmother.
-I'll have you know

1051
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,522
I once starred in a children's TV show.

1052
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,958
He's drinking the milk so well.

1053
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,059
How lovely.

1054
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,894
-He must've been hungry.
-Yeah.

1055
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,962
-He's hungry.
-Yeah.

1056
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,030
We're hungry too.

1057
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,033
He has such long lashes.

1058
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,935
-I know.
-Look at his feet.

1059
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,102
My gosh. How dainty.

1060
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,606
-Totally. We used to be that tiny once.
-Yeah.

1061
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,875
La-el's feet used to be like his too.

1062
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:51,909
Goodness.

1063
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,778
You've been hungry, huh?

1064
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,046
He must've been starving.

1065
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,480
How could you eat alone, E-dam?

1066
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,316
SHOULD AN ADULT SAY THIS TO A TODDLER?

1067
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,951
-He's so lovely.
-You can take your time.

1068
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,820
We can always get you a new bottle.
Drink it slowly.

1069
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,322
You have far to go.

1070
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,489
This tastes like puffed rice.

1071
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,525
Why are you having it?

1072
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,427
I wanted to understand why he liked it.

1073
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,962
-This is…
-It's a clue for us.

1074
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:11,862
One bag contains

1075
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,931
far too many puffs for E-dam to finish.

1076
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,333
I'm sure his mother would want us

1077
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,236
-to help not to waste good food.
-Responsible adults should understand

1078
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:22,039
-why children like their snacks.
-Yeah, it's to build a connection.

1079
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,774
His face is falling.

1080
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,743
So this is what it tastes like.

1081
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,912
-No wonder they love it.
-I know, right?

1082
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,347
A GROAN

1083
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,715
-Hey.
-Were you hungry?

1084
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,516
How are his eyes…

1085
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,085
What do you want?

1086
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,519
-What's wrong?
-Help him burp.

1087
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,888
-You don't want us eating your snacks?
-We'll give you more.

1088
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:41,158
(CHECKING HIS BOTTLE)

1089
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,494
He wanted to check his bottle.

1090
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,729
(YUM)

1091
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,831
He has such lovely eyes.

1092
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,599
Good job.

1093
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,967
-He's stopped again.
-His cheeks…

1094
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,435
What do you want?

1095
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,137
-What should we do?
-Here's your rice puff.

1096
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,238
Did you want this?

1097
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,373
PERHAPS SOME WATER?

1098
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,574
-Here.
-It's yours.

1099
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,842
Here's your bottle, E-dam.

1100
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:58,909
Your bottle.

1101
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,378
SOMETHING GOT ON HIS NERVES!

1102
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,113
He was drinking just fine.

1103
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,015
Hold on. What if…

1104
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,517
Did he…

1105
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,319
soil his diaper?

1106
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,454
That might be it.

1107
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,091
Yeah, that may be what's making him feel
awkward and uncomfortable.

1108
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,626
Let me check.

1109
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,095
-Do you want to drink some more?
-He should digest…

1110
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,263
Oh, he's still drinking.

1111
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,132
-He needs to burp.
-We should lay him down.

1112
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,400
-Lay him down?
-Yeah.

1113
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,335
Why don't I help?

1114
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,770
WOO-JAE TRIES TO HOLD AND CONSOLE HIM

1115
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,338
That's a wrong move.

1116
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,206
-Okay. Here you go.
-He doesn't like it.

1117
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,509
His diaper needs to be changed.

1118
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:32,943
It's gotten wet and heavy.

1119
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,745
Let me change your diaper.

1120
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,581
JIN-KYUNG TURNS ON HER MOTHERING MODE

1121
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,350
He can wear his pants later.

1122
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,451
Okay. Later.

1123
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,119
Hey, he's crawling away.

1124
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,888
He's going to that gentleman.

1125
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,390
REFRESHED NOW?

1126
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,526
-I hear toddlers love this.
-I haven't done this in a while.

1127
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,598
The new diaper definitely made him
feel more comfortable.

1128
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,201
-You're right.
-So the diaper was the problem.

1129
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,370
-Yeah, that was getting to him.
-Not his meal.

1130
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,438
We did a great job.

1131
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,939
-The diaper was the issue.
-E-dam.

1132
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:02,840
Right?

1133
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,076
My gosh.

1134
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:05,976
OFF WE GO ON AN ADVENTURE

1135
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,446
-He's crawling up the stairs.
-It was the diaper all along.

1136
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,680
-Yeah.
-I mean it.

1137
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,149
HELLO

1138
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,186
You're feeling good, huh?

1139
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,087
HE DOES LOOK HAPPIER

1140
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:17,788
Look at me, E-dam.

1141
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,727
WHAT'S HE DOING? A TODDLER IS WATCHING!

1142
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,562
STARES FOR A MOMENT

1143
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:25,896
(TAKES HIS EXIT)

1144
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,331
E-dam.

1145
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,599
It's incredible here, Jin-kyung.

1146
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,834
HERE COMES THE NEXT CUSTOMER

1147
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,035
My gosh.

1148
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:31,969
Is it fun up there?

1149
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,339
WOO-YOUNG IS AT THAT AGE
TO GO CRAZY FOR SLIDES

1150
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,874
Hey, this is so much fun.

1151
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,242
What's that for?

1152
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,746
I mean, having a crowd surround him
won't be so good for E-dam.

1153
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,914
Kids don't like feeling crowded.

1154
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,350
Hey, this looks quite fun.

1155
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:47,985
Go on.

1156
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,521
ENJOYING THEMSELVES
AWAY FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

1157
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:52,022
(I WANT TO TRY TOO)

1158
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,290
What is all this?

1159
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,692
It's amazing, Jin-kyung.

1160
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,365
TURNS OUT PLAYING IS REALLY THE BEST

1161
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,134
I liked going on that disk.

1162
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,335
-My gosh.
-The disk?

1163
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,539
WHERE IS E-DAM, BY THE WAY?

1164
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,642
IT'S MORE FUN TO BE UNDER THESE CHAIRS
THAN ALL THE RIDES!

1165
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,813
HE'S FEELING HIS BEST NOW

1166
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,684
BEAMING

1167
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,321
I'M HAVING FUN

1168
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,626
Your mom wrote this letter for you, E-dam.

1169
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,761
You recognize her handwriting?

1170
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,029
STARING

1171
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,531
You recognize it, do you?

1172
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,002
-Honk, honk.
-Isn't that amazing?

1173
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,337
-Honk, honk.
-Giddy-up!

1174
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,305
-Giddy-up!
-Honk, honk.

1175
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,706
He's looking this way. Giddy-up!

1176
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,276
BEGGING FOR HIS ATTENTION

1177
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,677
-Giddy-up!
-He's going to you.

1178
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,078
Giddy-up!

1179
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,313
Giddy-up!

1180
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,148
HAS PORORONG ENCHANTED HIM…

1181
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,283
This is fun, right?

1182
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,118
…INTO GETTING ON THE ROCKING HORSE?

1183
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,854
(A SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART)

1184
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,491
E-dam. Giddy-up, horse!

1185
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,059
AFTER GIVING PORORONG THE COLD SHOULDER

1186
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:03,928
Here's some cheese.

1187
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,429
SOMEONE HAS APPEARED BEFORE HIM

1188
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,732
IT'S THE ENCHANTING GRANNY

1189
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,536
A BIG BITE

1190
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,871
Good job.

1191
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,739
You're eating like a champ.

1192
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,743
Getting the diaper changed
has improved his mood by far.

1193
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,479
-It's evident.
-Yeah.

1194
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,481
That's why I suggested we do it.

1195
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,184
I didn't change it because of you.
It was based on my hunch.

1196
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,220
-But I passed the diaper to you…
-Hey.

1197
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,222
-…because you weren't moving a finger.
-His diaper

1198
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,023
was all I've been thinking about.

1199
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,058
What are you saying?

1200
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,660
-You only thought of snacks.
-My thoughts were solely on his diapers.

1201
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,796
All you've been thinking about
was the rice puffs.

1202
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,631
Do you think so little of me?

1203
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,832
You had five puffs, right?

1204
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,369
WHILE THE GROWN-UPS BICKER…

1205
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,072
It's your mom. Say, "Hello, Mom."

1206
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,073
"This is E-dam."

1207
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,708
A GROAN

1208
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,176
Woo-jae, feed this to E-dam.

1209
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,077
(SECOND BATCH OF SOFT TOFU)

1210
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,578
-More tofu.
-Here it is.

1211
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,580
A MENTION OF SOFT TOFU
MAKES HIM DROP THE TOY

1212
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,216
-It's time for soft tofu.
-Should we be feeding him so much?

1213
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,619
Sure, we only fed him one portion
instead of one and a half portions

1214
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,686
like we were told to.

1215
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,756
EAT A LOT AND GROW TALL AND STRONG!

1216
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,325
-Eating like a champ.
-It's time for contouring. Here we go.

1217
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,128
We need some shadows here
to make your cheeks less prominent.

1218
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,465
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CHILD CARE AND SELF CARE

1219
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,800
This is so good, isn't it?

1220
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,135
If his mother found out,

1221
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,471
we wouldn't get to see him again.

1222
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,706
So this is what it tastes like.

1223
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,009
THE CHILDISH DUO BEING SELFISH AGAIN

1224
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:25,943
E-dam.

1225
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,578
-Gramps.
-Now that I've tried it…

1226
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,812
Yeah?

1227
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,281
I can taste something…

1228
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,749
Hold on. What's this ingredient?

1229
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:32,716
It's definitely here.

1230
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:33,617
I'll read them for you.

1231
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,919
Apple, beetroot, and carrot.

1232
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,387
THAT EXCUSE ISN'T FLYING

1233
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,821
I'm so hungry.

1234
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,224
We should leave some for E-dam to eat.

1235
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,225
There's enough…

1236
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,459
-What do we do then?
-…for E-dam.

1237
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,362
There's enough left.
You can stop eating, then.

1238
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,164
-What?
-Stop eating.

1239
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,232
Here's your snack.

1240
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,533
LET'S GIVE PUFFS TO E-DAM TOO

1241
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,801
(HERE'S YOUR SNACK)

1242
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:51,936
Snack?

1243
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,072
WHAT FELL TO THE GROUND
GOES INTO THE ADULT'S MOUTH

1244
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:55,973
Here's your snack.

1245
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,308
IT'S FOR YOU, E-DAM

1246
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:58,776
-Here's your snack.
-My gosh.

1247
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,978
-I'm sorry.
-Wait. I think you dropped it on purpose.

1248
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,780
-Here's your snack.
-My gosh.

1249
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:03,948
-I'm sorry.
-Wait.

1250
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,482
I think you dropped it on purpose.

1251
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,550
No way.

1252
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,118
Here's your snack, E-dam.

1253
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,154
-E-dam. Oops.
-Goodness.

1254
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,890
-You really shouldn't, Jin-kyung.
-Please check the mirror.

1255
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,428
-Stop it, okay?
-This isn't your snack. It's a mirror.

1256
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,397
THE CHILDISH ADULTS
FINALLY GIVES E-DAM A PUFF

1257
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,467
Let me spray this on your face.

1258
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,903
-You can't.
-Just a bit.

1259
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,038
THIS MAKEUP ARTIST IS STILL WORKING

1260
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:29,907
I'll apply the mascara now.

1261
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,408
Here's your snack.

1262
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,544
-Good.
-This is the final step.

1263
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,446
What a sweet boy.

1264
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:36,580
MAKEUP STUDIO WITH GREAT SERVICE

1265
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,882
Jin-kyung ate a few rice puffs,

1266
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,151
and she wants to have some more.

1267
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,953
So she's feeding him a few
to do that guilt-free.

1268
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,055
Let me brush your hair.

1269
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:45,956
All right.

1270
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,424
Gosh, you look so charming.

1271
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,326
-So pretty.
-You look so lovely.

1272
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,562
Watching all this
reminds me of the old show

1273
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,330
-the guys from god did.
-Right.

1274
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,232
-With Jae-min.
-It brings back memories.

1275
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,768
I'll give you a quick foot massage.

1276
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,436
Let me brush your hair with this.

1277
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,871
The haircut is exquisite.

1278
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,273
THIS PRETEND MAKEUP STUDIO
IS RATHER THERAPEUTIC

1279
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,476
I'll move on to this foot.

1280
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,444
Let me rub it like this.

1281
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,748
You'll be billed 330,000 won
for today's services.

1282
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,418
Should we leave our contact info
so his mother can call us about the bill?

1283
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,520
Gosh, her handwriting is so neat.

1284
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,123
He's drinking it by himself.

1285
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,591
DRINKING THE MILK AGAIN AFTER THE FUN

1286
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,559
Do you need a hand?

1287
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,460
Shall I help?

1288
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,397
Lay him down
so the bottle is at the right angle.

1289
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:27,564
Let me help.

1290
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,700
A COMFORTABLE EATING SHOW

1291
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,568
Gosh, you're doing great.

1292
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,170
Look at him drinking the milk.

1293
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,872
He loves it.

1294
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,142
-I think he'd rather not be cradled.
-Yeah.

1295
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,444
A THERAPEUTIC TIME
INSTEAD OF THE CHILD CARE TIME

1296
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,782
SATISFIED!

1297
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,117
Sook, after the shoot--

1298
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,053
-E-dam.
-My gosh.

1299
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,220
How creepy.

1300
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,388
So creepy.

1301
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,456
Grandma.

1302
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,825
-Call her Grandpa.
-Right. Grandpa.

1303
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,728
I'M PUTTING YOU AT MY GUNPOINT

1304
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,297
HOW DO I LOOK, E-DAM?

1305
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,432
I want to chuck a grenade.

1306
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:04,702
Peekaboo.

1307
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:05,769
Peekaboo.

1308
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,005
-E-dam.
-We're having fun.

1309
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,073
Off he goes.

1310
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,607
Turns out he really likes her.

1311
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,209
I LIKE YOU, AUNT SOOK

1312
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,945
I guess kids dig her costumes.

1313
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,180
-E-dam.
-How interesting.

1314
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,981
ADULTS CAN'T COMPREHEND
THE INNOCENT CHILD'S GAZE

1315
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,516
Where did E-dam go?

1316
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,086
-Peekaboo.
-I wonder where E-dam is.

1317
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,922
PEEKABOO FROM THE INSIDE

1318
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,290
You're having fun, aren't you?

1319
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,492
See? I'm clearly E-dam's favorite.

1320
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,728
-E-dam, there's a window here.
-Knock, knock. Is E-dam here?

1321
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,997
PEEKABOO FROM THE OUTSIDE

1322
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,233
-E-dam.
-Here he is.

1323
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,435
-Where did E-dam go?
-Here he is.

1324
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,604
Peekaboo.

1325
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:41,939
E-dam.

1326
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,143
Peekaboo.

1327
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,312
THE PEEKABOO GAME ISN'T LIKELY TO END

1328
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,547
THANKS TO THE DELIGHTFUL SMILES FROM E-DAM

1329
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,049
Hello, Uncle Woo-jae.

1330
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,250
Peekaboo.

1331
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,687
Peekaboo.

1332
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,122
Peekaboo.

1333
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,190
-Look.
-Is E-dam here, by any chance?

1334
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,292
Peekaboo.

1335
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,128
Here you are, E-dam.

1336
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,731
Something caught his eye.

1337
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,333
Is it the soft tofu?

1338
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,300
Do you want the soft tofu?

1339
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,503
Okay. Here goes.

1340
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,571
STRAIGHT TO HIS MOUTH

1341
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,939
-Nom, nom.
-He's eating so well.

1342
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,275
I'd love to see him ride this,
but he's not interested.

1343
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,910
CURIOUS TO SEE HOW CUTE HE'D LOOK

1344
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,380
-E-dam.
-E-dam.

1345
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,548
Man, you startled me!

1346
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,049
Hey, E-dam.

1347
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,151
Guys, look.

1348
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,218
Right here.

1349
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,953
Peekaboo, E-dam.

1350
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:31,922
E-dam.

1351
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,857
Look, Uncle Woo-jae is here.

1352
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:34,792
BUT HE STILL FAVORS SOOK

1353
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,426
Look at him smiling.

1354
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,996
E-dam. Peekaboo!

1355
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,130
Goodness, E-dam.

1356
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:41,799
E-DAM LOOKS JOYFUL

1357
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,268
WILL HE FINALLY RIDE THE ROCKING HORSE?

1358
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,169
He seems happy.

1359
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,005
I wonder what he'll look like
after a year.

1360
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,475
I wonder what he'll look like
after a year.

1361
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,110
He's in a better mood.

1362
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,044
You're there.

1363
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,181
HE'S ON THE ROCKING HORSE,
MAKING EVERYONE'S DREAM COME TRUE!

1364
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:02,352
FINALLY!

1365
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,321
You're doing great.

1366
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,423
HE DOESN'T GET IT,
BUT HE'S HAPPY TO SEE OTHERS HAPPY

1367
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,192
-"I'm the expert here."
-Our dreams came true.

1368
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:09,126
Giddy-up.

1369
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,694
Our devotion reached his heart.

1370
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,095
-Giddy-up.
-We got him where we wanted.

1371
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,297
Let's do this!

1372
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,165
TO THINK THE ROCKING HORSE
COULD MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY…

1373
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,934
It's time for galloping!

1374
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,302
Let's ride!

1375
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,770
Giddy-up!

1376
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,574
Gosh, he's investigating
Woo-young's scary wig.

1377
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,710
-What's that?
-Can you tell us?

1378
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,745
His mood improved.

1379
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,314
It's all good now.

1380
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,016
Don't you crave some water?

1381
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,856
WE HAD OUR PARTY TIME
NEXT, IT'S WATER TIME

1382
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,527
IT'S FANTASTIC

1383
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:44,428
All right.

1384
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,263
E-dam.

1385
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,198
CAN YOU GO ON THE ROCKING HORSE
ONE MORE TIME?

1386
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,437
UNCLE WOO-JAE DISPATCHED

1387
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,308
AFTER THE EXHILARATING PLANE GAME

1388
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,577
-There he is.
-Let's try this.

1389
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,913
-Where are his pants?
-Giddy-up!

1390
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,716
AN ENCORE "GIDDY-UP" PERFORMANCE

1391
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,718
-Giddy-up!
-It's party time!

1392
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,353
-Giddy-up!
-Let's go!

1393
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,821
-Go!
-Giddy-up!

1394
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,089
RIDE ON, E-DAM!

1395
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:15,125
FEELING ON THE TOP OF THE WORLD

1396
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,460
It's E-dam's time.

1397
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,561
-Go, E-dam!
-Giddy-up.

1398
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,763
SUDDEN HESITATION

1399
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,332
He's rocking it so well.

1400
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,734
FEELING CONFIDENT AGAIN

1401
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,837
-Giddy-up.
-Giddy-up.

1402
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,505
-He's standing on the seat.
-My gosh.

1403
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,840
He stood up.

1404
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,277
YOU'RE AMAZING

1405
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,145
Great job, E-dam!

1406
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,513
-Giddy-up.
-Giddy-up.

1407
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,948
-Giddy-up.
-Well done.

1408
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,951
-He looks at us one by one…
-Right.

1409
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,986
-…to see if we're cheering.
-Yeah, he checks our reaction.

1410
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,423
-E-dam's mother has returned.
-I see.

1411
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,557
Great work, everyone.

1412
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:48,959
BABYSITTING SHIFT ENDS

1413
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,994
-I can't thank you enough.
-It was therapeutic.

1414
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,396
It was rough at first,

1415
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,399
but as time went on,
E-dam boosted our spirits.

1416
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,667
A REWARDING TIME WITH A ROCKY START

1417
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,669
Do you think you managed to win

1418
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,805
the heart of the next future viewer,
the 12-month-old E-dam?

1419
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,340
I'd say so.

1420
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,042
-We've become a family.
-I'm not exaggerating

1421
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,910
when I say he's hooked on to us.

1422
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,179
I'm concerned he might cry
when we say our goodbyes.

1423
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,916
But by the time the children
grow old enough to watch our shows,

1424
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,785
a few of our cast members
may have passed away.

1425
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,521
You're unbelievable.
Do you have to go that far?

1426
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,190
-It's just that--
-You never know who dies first.

1427
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:21,325
-Whoever it is--
-That's true.

1428
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,759
I can promise you one thing.

1429
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,462
I'll stick around longer than you,
at least by a day.

1430
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,364
-I'll nail your coffin shut.
-Suit yourselves.

1431
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:32,202
Okay. We led you to believe
that E-dam's mother was running an errand.

1432
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:36,306
But in fact, she has been observing you
taking care of E-dam.

1433
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,374
WE HAD NO IDEA

1434
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,076
She's been right here with us.

1435
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,744
In the previous part of the shoot,

1436
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,880
the four-year-olds cast their votes
to choose their favorite teacher.

1437
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,084
Since E-dam is too young to do it himself,

1438
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,619
-his mother has done the honor.
-I see.

1439
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,289
She has observed E-dam's new friends

1440
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,391
and ranked them.

1441
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,793
What's Jin-kyung doing out of the blue?

1442
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,628
A SUDDEN SHOW OF AFFECTION

1443
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,697
I'm betting all I own
on Jin-kyung not winning.

1444
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,400
-She craved his snack.
-She ate all his snacks, ma'am.

1445
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,369
If it turns out
she chose Jin-kyung as the winner,

1446
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:08,872
we'll interpret it as her
being Jin-kyung's fan

1447
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,173
and contest the result.

1448
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,809
To be honest,
I think I opened his heart first.

1449
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,177
What?

1450
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,279
I prepared the rocking horse performance.

1451
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,816
For your information, I met E-dam first.

1452
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:20,817
Let's not forget

1453
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,285
he likes me best.

1454
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,021
He kept visiting my little camp.

1455
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,022
I get it, folks.

1456
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,391
But you were not so attentive.

1457
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,827
When you help a toddler drink,
you must mind the angle of the bottle.

1458
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:34,331
We saw E-dam's mood miraculously improve

1459
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,066
only after I changed his diaper.

1460
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,737
BASICALLY, THEY'RE CLAMORING
FOR RECOGNITION

1461
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,973
Those don't matter. I met E-dam first,

1462
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,609
and I'll remember E-dam for e-ternity.

1463
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,743
There he goes again.

1464
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,445
I knew he'd make
one of his dad jokes again.

1465
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,447
A SILLY JOKE SADDENS E-DAM

1466
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,349
I'll start from third place.

1467
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,250
In third place…

1468
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,552
WHO IS E-DAM'S THIRD-BEST FRIEND?

1469
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,620
…is Sae-ho.

1470
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:57,687
I'm in third place?

1471
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,122
It's not bad, though.

1472
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,390
You seem disgruntled.

1473
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,659
Not at all. It's more than enough.

1474
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,061
I mean it. Giddy-up!

1475
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,163
-Giddy-up!
-Your eyes seem sad.

1476
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,064
THIRD PLACE IS GREAT

1477
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,732
I'll now announce the runner-up.

1478
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:10,200
In second place

1479
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:12,936
-is Woo-jae.
-My gosh.

1480
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,505
I got second place?
Gosh, thank you, E-dam.

1481
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,407
-Why does he get second place?
-Well done.

1482
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,443
-The devil is in the details.
-The top three are good enough.

1483
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,078
Maybe his mother is Woo-jae's fan.

1484
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,947
Let's face it. I orchestrated
everything behind the scenes.

1485
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,849
He loved my sunglasses.

1486
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,184
Let's move on to fourth place.

1487
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,819
-Three of you remain, right?
-Sure.

1488
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,921
It'd be upsetting
to place in the bottom two,

1489
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,489
so I'll announce the winner only.

1490
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,391
Come on, I met him first.

1491
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,626
His mood lifted dramatically
after I changed his diaper--

1492
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,062
Who held him
as he soothed his hungry stomach?

1493
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,564
Who prepared the milk bottle?

1494
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,568
I'll announce the winner.

1495
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,635
But I'm the one E-dam…

1496
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,504
See? Ma'am.

1497
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,239
-Ma'am.
-He wants Woo-young to hold him.

1498
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,507
Please take this into account.

1499
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,508
Please.

1500
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:52,909
Did you see him…

1501
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,279
He's over the moon, ma'am.

1502
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,316
-Don't raise your voice in front of him.
-She has a point.

1503
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:02,052
He's hiccupping because you startled him.
Let's get him some water.

1504
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,587
-That's elementary.
-Who startled you?

1505
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:04,588
I'm over the moon.

1506
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:05,889
Here's some water, E-dam.

1507
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,193
I'll now announce the winner.

1508
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:12,662
WHO CAPTURED HIS HEART

1509
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,298
AND WON THE HONOR
OF BEING E-DAM'S BEST FRIEND?

1510
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,601
Congratulations,

1511
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,436
Sook.

1512
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,205
See? I'm so devoted that I help him drink
until the last minute.

1513
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,407
You hiccupped, didn't you?

1514
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,842
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

1515
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,978
-But the diaper…
-This is so wrong, ma'am.

1516
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,848
THEY ALL CRAVED THE HONOR
OF BEING NAMED E-DAM'S BEST FRIEND

1517
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:35,452
Jin-kyung finished two bags of his snacks.

1518
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,522
-The rice puffs and popcorns--
-I only ate ones that fell on the floor.

1519
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,423
ONE COULD MAKE A MEAL
OUT OF THE SNACKS YOU DROPPED

1520
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,492
Wait. I think you dropped it on purpose.

1521
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,094
-Sir.
-"Sir"?

1522
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,662
Tell us who placed at bottom.

1523
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:46,596
You want to know?

1524
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,665
Let's be honest.
I can't have placed at bottom.

1525
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,300
You could find this upsetting.

1526
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,769
Considering the amount
of the snacks Jin-kyung ate…

1527
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,904
Be honest with me. I--

1528
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,805
How odd to see you paired up again.

1529
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,140
THE MARRIED COUPLE FROM BEAT COIN

1530
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,809
THE TIES OF THE COUPLE
IS ALMOST UNBREAKABLE

1531
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:02,078
This pair shouldn't have children.

1532
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,313
I can't believe this.

1533
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,148
-They're a couple for sure.
-Honey.

1534
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,184
You barely contributed today.

1535
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,485
You don't get to say that.

1536
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,421
Instead of babysitting,
she stole the baby's food.

1537
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,423
A SIGH

1538
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,659
I'll announce the results
of Jin-kyung and Woo-young.

1539
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,560
Who's the loser?

1540
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,328
You're tied at fourth place. Congrats.

1541
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,896
-Ma'am.
-That can't be right, ma'am.

1542
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:20,931
-Sir.
-You've been with us.

1543
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,532
-Let's have a chat.
-We have a tie.

1544
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,034
-I want to talk to you.
-It's for real.

1545
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,570
The important thing
is the incredible gift.

1546
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:27,637
Right. I won!

1547
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,172
The winner gets the prize.

1548
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,373
-My gosh.
-Ma'am.

1549
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,910
"Award Certificate
issued to Kim Sook of Screwballs."

1550
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,980
"Though clumsy at moments,
you showed warm affection for E-dam

1551
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,982
while participating
in the child care mission."

1552
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,086
"As you have built the strongest bond
with E-dam as his one-day guardian,

1553
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,487
I give you this award certificate."

1554
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,489
My gosh, ma'am. Thank you.

1555
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,158
-You're a great judge of character.
-Thank you.

1556
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,459
You brought a bouquet too.

1557
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,527
The scent is amazing.

1558
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,696
THE JEALOUS PAIR…

1559
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,765
I'll tell you why she crowned Sook.
She gave her reason for the winner only.

1560
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:59,536
She praised how securely you held E-dam
while he was drinking his milk.

1561
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,405
While E-dam was having fun,
sitting on the floor,

1562
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,874
you responded with small gestures.
She found that impressive.

1563
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:09,179
She believes that he came out of his shell
thanks to Sook's efforts.

1564
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,516
-It's time to say goodbye to E-dam.
-I see.

1565
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,352
Please say your goodbyes.

1566
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,253
Bye-bye.

1567
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,088
Bye-bye, E-dam.

1568
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,324
-Can you say bye-bye, E-dam?
-It's time to say goodbye, E-dam.

1569
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,093
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1570
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,427
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1571
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,162
WE DON'T WANT TO LET YOU GO

1572
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,464
Take care.

1573
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,433
Let's wrap things up
after a photo with E-dam.

1574
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,502
Let's take a photo.

1575
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,637
He's like a doll.

1576
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,838
A SESSION PREPARED TO CHARM FUTURE VIEWERS

1577
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:40,877
BUT WE ENDED UP BEING CHARMED
BY THE FUTURE VIEWERS

1578
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,878
Gather around.

1579
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,979
AFTER SENDING E-DAM HOME

1580
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:46,349
You have three dishes. Grilled eel,
braised short ribs, and grilled ribs.

1581
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,285
-So fancy.
-I'll enjoy them.

1582
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:49,219
Thanks for the food!

1583
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,187
-I feel rather cramped here.
-You do?

1584
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:52,889
-I'll move.
-No, stay put.

1585
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,224
It's okay. Sit back down.

1586
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,892
-It's okay.
-I'll move.

1587
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,327
I can move my lunch box this way.

1588
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,361
Wait, Jin-kyung.

1589
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,997
I DIDN'T MEAN TO TELL YOU TO MOVE AWAY

1590
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,732
Why won't anyone sit next to Woo-jae?

1591
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,833
GIVING HIM SPACE LIKE HE WANTED

1592
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,169
-Thanks for the food.
-Thanks for the food.

1593
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,505
-Thanks for the food.
-We got our meal without a hassle today.

1594
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,140
I bet this is a high-end lunchbox meal.

1595
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,875
Each cost us 40,000 won.

1596
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,276
-I thought so.
-Really?

1597
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,444
-Come again?
-It cost 40,000 won.

1598
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,378
Per each?

1599
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:16,813
This cost 40,000 won?

1600
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,083
They added abalone
to the braised short ribs.

1601
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,084
Finish everything.

1602
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:28,558
YOU EARNED YOUR STRESS-FREE MEAL
THROUGH YOUR HARD WORK TODAY

1603
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,027
It's so good.

1604
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,763
The lunchbox meal place offers great food.

1605
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,365
By the way, the kids impressed me.

1606
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,067
They have great stamina.

1607
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,836
To be honest,
the session with the two-year-olds

1608
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,172
depleted all my energy for the shoot.

1609
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,074
After the session with the two-year-olds,

1610
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,276
-I had a short break in the car.
-I'm not lying.

1611
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,844
I thought I slept through the day.

1612
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,014
I slept so soundly.

1613
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,982
When I came to, I thought I was in my bed.

1614
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,451
I was so startled.

1615
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,686
I could tell how tired he was
from his eyes.

1616
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:58,188
-I bet they looked like this.
-Yeah.

1617
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,923
Didn't our session
only last a couple of hours?

1618
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,158
-With the two-year-olds?
-Two hours?

1619
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,027
-Just one hour.
-Just one?

1620
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,663
Woo-young did his dance and everything
in under one hour?

1621
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,498
You only spent one hour with them.

1622
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,999
It felt like half a day.

1623
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,236
I met this kid called Hae-sa earlier.

1624
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,671
She didn't speak a single word.

1625
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:15,605
No.

1626
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,741
She's shy around strangers,

1627
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,176
and that's why she kept silent.

1628
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,379
But I became her friend
by playing the makeup artist.

1629
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,414
I applied pretend makeup on her…

1630
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,815
What do I call them?

1631
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,917
-The products for your eyes.
-Eyeliner and eye shadows.

1632
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,119
I did the whole thing.

1633
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:31,554
Rub your palms like this and do this.

1634
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,857
RUB AND DAB

1635
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,425
SHE'S COPYING ME!

1636
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,194
THOUGH SHE KEPT HER SILENCE,
HAE-SA AND WOO-JAE DID COMMUNICATE

1637
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,663
I did my best playing the makeup artist,

1638
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,399
and that got her attached to me.

1639
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,134
When everyone was leaving,

1640
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,903
Hae-sa heard me saying goodbye,
turned around, and wouldn't leave.

1641
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,172
-She got so attached.
-Maybe you're projecting.

1642
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,074
-It's time to go.
-Bye-bye, Hae-sa.

1643
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,610
Let's meet again. Goodbye.

1644
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,545
HAE-SA GOT ATTACHED TO THE UNCLES

1645
00:56:56,212 --> 00:57:00,350
BUT SHE LEFT THE KIDS CAFÉ
WITHOUT LOOKING BACK

1646
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,420
I'm sure you got it all wrong.
What are you talking about?

1647
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,955
-You took care of the kids for the day.
-Right.

1648
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,190
Since we're on this subject,

1649
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,793
who do you think
would have been a difficult child

1650
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:13,363
to look after in their childhood?

1651
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,098
Oh, back when we were young?

1652
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,833
-I hear I gave my family hell.
-Really?

1653
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,635
What? You seem like the quiet type.

1654
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:19,936
Not at all.

1655
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:23,740
My mother had a close friend
back in the day, right?

1656
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:24,874
She visited our place,

1657
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,445
and my mother served her tea
in the living room.

1658
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:32,148
And there I was,
sitting by the window all by myself.

1659
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,417
Which floor were you on?
I'm getting goosebumps.

1660
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,419
-Second floor, I guess. Not that high up.
-Got it.

1661
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,122
I was tilting my head a few times like so,
and then…

1662
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,390
smashed the window.

1663
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,560
YOU DID WHAT?

1664
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,727
TAKEN ABACK

1665
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,628
Why?

1666
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,297
Beats me.

1667
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,132
One minute, my mother was chatting.

1668
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,234
-Then, the clang made her look back.
-With your head?

1669
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,736
Apparently, my head
was stuck in the glass panel.

1670
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,206
Just like this.

1671
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:59,342
-If the shards had pricked or stabbed me,
-You could've been badly hurt.

1672
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,344
-the injuries would've been fatal.
-Of course.

1673
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:04,247
-So you were rather difficult.
-I hear I was a big mess.

1674
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,748
I bet Woo-young was a sweet boy.

1675
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,917
-Woo-young?
-He's very devoted to his parents.

1676
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:08,985
I bet he was a handful.

1677
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,387
I used to be very obstinate.

1678
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,057
Let's say we were taking
a stroll down the street,

1679
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,825
and I spotted a toy somewhere.

1680
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,293
I would then start yelling.

1681
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,529
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

1682
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,764
CRACKING UP

1683
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,366
I'd keep at it until it was mine.

1684
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,434
MADNESS

1685
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,770
LOL

1686
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,507
-What a weirdo.
-It was practically a threat.

1687
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,208
THE OBSESSION MUST'VE HELPED HIM
WIN THE JYP AUDITION

1688
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,444
I WANT IT NOW

1689
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,579
That sounds like a motorcycle
or the racing cars in Formula 1.

1690
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:37,614
WHEN HE WAS OBSTINATE

1691
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,581
I'd keep at it.

1692
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:42,018
After I learned that my mother
checked my diary entries regularly,

1693
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,987
I left her hints. "I saw a toy today."

1694
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,855
"If my mom bought it for me,

1695
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,091
my grades might improve."

1696
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,592
THAT'S INGENIOUS

1697
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,794
-I was that thorough.
-You're really smart, Sae-ho.

1698
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,464
-How clever.
-"If my mom bought it for me,

1699
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,766
my grades would improve on the next exam."

1700
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:57,800
The thing is,

1701
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,736
my grades stayed the same
even when my mom bought it.

1702
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:00,803
AS EXPECTED

1703
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,305
That's incredible, Sae-ho.

1704
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,841
I have a question for you, Jin-kyung.

1705
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:09,512
Does La-el have a feature
identical to yours

1706
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,582
-that you hoped she wouldn't have?
-I can't wait to hear her answer.

1707
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:15,151
Be honest. I'm dying to know, Jin-kyung.

1708
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,787
I can think of a point
where La-el resembles you.

1709
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,989
She can be too honest.

1710
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:21,891
-Yeah.
-Right.

1711
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,259
-Doesn't she take that after you?
-Yeah.

1712
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:26,229
She shares her thoughts frankly,
even when it isn't necessary.

1713
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:29,933
Woo-jae found a point
that I hadn't considered.

1714
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:32,402
There's one more thing I'd like to share.

1715
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,404
She can be really funny.

1716
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,438
You're right about that.

1717
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,674
If you have a conversation with her,

1718
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:42,245
you're bound to laugh out loud
at least once during that conversation.

1719
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:45,148
She has a talent
to crack a big joke at least once.

1720
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,116
Why do you think Woo-jae
would pee the least?

1721
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,686
He's too thin to hold much liquid in.

1722
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,021
That's her gift.

1723
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,022
HONEST AND FUNNY LA-EL

1724
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,359
If La-el wants to be on a variety show,

1725
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,461
that may not be such a bad idea.

1726
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,196
I can say that because she has talent

1727
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,332
-for making others laugh.
-I suppose

1728
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,268
such gifts get passed down in the family.

1729
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,771
I've been very loud as a boy,
and I still am a big extrovert.

1730
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:11,641
My older sister has a boy called Je-an,

1731
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,344
and he's just like me when I was young.

1732
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,012
Recently, my sister sent me a clip

1733
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,215
of my nephew acting
as the host at a school event.

1734
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,451
-How cute.
-He guided kids through games.

1735
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:22,919
La-el does that too.

1736
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,921
He loves it so much.

1737
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,756
He loves all of our cast too.

1738
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,992
He's very proud to have me as his uncle.

1739
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,560
-How lovely.
-I'm so grateful.

1740
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,395
-He's right to be proud of you.
-He always tells me

1741
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,764
to work diligently
without any funny business.

1742
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:35,932
CACKLES

1743
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,900
He says everything hangs on me.

1744
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,869
-I had a similar conversation.
-How insightful.

1745
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,505
La-el said,
"You must lead a good and honest life."

1746
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:43,406
When I asked why,

1747
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,109
she said wherever my family members went,
they'd be labeled as my daughter,

1748
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,777
my younger brother,

1749
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,012
or my mother.

1750
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,847
My name would follow them everywhere.

1751
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,982
-She got that right.
-Yeah.

1752
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,451
So I said, "Okay, I'll do my best."

1753
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:56,919
She gave me an earful recently

1754
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,921
for my rash wardrobe choices.

1755
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,790
I had to kneel and everything.

1756
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:01,858
She also said,

1757
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,127
"People only bought it
because you swore on my life."

1758
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,096
SMOTHERING A LAUGH

1759
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,098
That's what she said.

1760
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,867
So I went, "I'll do better. I'm so sorry."

1761
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:13,836
-That phrase did help.
-She gave you the truth straight.

01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:16,806
