1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,603
ONE LOVELY AFTERNOON…

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,009
ONE MAN IS CLEANING
LIKE IT IS A PART OF HIS DAILY ROUTINE

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,011
Do you usually clean your home yourself?

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:11,945
I do, actually.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,513
I take part in cleaning quite often.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,216
My daily routine in the morning

7
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,785
is tidying up the place with my wife.

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,054
Do you listen to classical music
when you do the chores?

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,256
My playlist
consists mostly of ChoNam Zone.

10
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,424
A MAN OF REFINED TASTE

11
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,926
And I have a few other artists
that I like.

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,096
WE'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT HIS DAILY LIFE

13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,831
This is highly out of the ordinary for me.

14
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,133
THE SHOWRUNNER CHORTLES

15
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,002
SAE-HO IS ACTUALLY
PUTTING ON AN AFFECTED AIR

16
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,938
IN HIS NEW HOME

17
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,740
FOR HIM AND THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE

18
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,243
WAITING FOR HIS COSTARS

19
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,210
It must be them.

20
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,546
THE DOOR BELL CHIMES RIGHT ON CUE

21
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,214
Who is it?

22
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,416
Your neighbors.

23
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,484
MY NEIGHBORS?

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,353
They give off a menacing vibe.

25
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,221
Look, don't they look threatening?

26
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,123
THE NEIGHBORS LOOK HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,025
Hi, I live next door.

28
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,894
-I'm also a neighbor.
-Come on in.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,028
-Hey.
-Welcome.

30
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:02,929
Hello.

31
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,398
I hear you're hosting
a community meeting here.

32
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,668
-Hello, it's a pleasure.
-Welcome to my home.

33
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,602
Who are you supposed to be?

34
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,438
-Gosh, hello.
-Excuse us for the intrusion.

35
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,039
We're here for the community meeting.

36
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,808
-Man, what a nice pad!
-Welcome.

37
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,510
Thanks for having us.

38
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,680
-Don't make a face at the host.
-It's nice to be here.

39
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,981
What's wrong?

40
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:22,916
"Move your car."

41
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,217
-Wait--
-Everyone.

42
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,252
-"The complex belongs to its residents."
-Move your car.

43
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,822
-This unit is mine.
-Move your car, okay?

44
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,123
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,991
I just don't follow. Excuse me.

46
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,561
You're all welcome.
Could you introduce yourselves?

47
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,563
I don't get why he's being so hostile.

48
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,864
Who are you, mister?

49
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,998
"Move your damn car."

50
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,000
As if there's a car here.

51
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,002
Are you who I think you are?

52
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,604
I know. He's chronic fatigue.

53
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,341
-My inspo is Don Lee from The Neighbor.
-I see.

54
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,043
-"Move your car."
-You know what?

55
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,911
-He shouldn't get buffed.
-No, it looks weird.

56
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:52,979
Yeah, way too weird.

57
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,147
A HIDEOUS SIGHT

58
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,182
-His upper body is jacked.
-"Move your car."

59
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,784
But his legs are still scrawny.

60
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,986
STILL THIN AND SKINNY LIKE PAPER DOLLS

61
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,087
"Move your car."

62
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,057
Even with all that padding,
he's not as big as Don Lee.

63
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:04,991
By the way…

64
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:06,860
-Who are you?
-Oh, me?

65
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,828
I'm the owner of this unit.

66
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,097
I was actually told
that my tutee would be coming.

67
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,867
Hey, wait. Is your character
that tutor from the movie Wish?

68
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,001
You got it!

69
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,603
"Can you guess your friends' future?"

70
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,505
"They'll all end up as good-for-nothings."

71
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,742
Think of this place as your tutor's home
from your childhood.

72
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,943
-Wow.
-That's my pitch.

73
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,845
What sort of tutor
would have lessons here?

74
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,148
One that charges an arm and a leg.

75
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,115
MIRTHLESS LAUGHTER

76
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,750
I thought today's theme was neighbors.

77
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,718
That's right.

78
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,219
-So I dressed up as--
-Who are you?

79
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,254
Hello.

80
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,588
Are you a door-to-door saleswoman?

81
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,724
-Looks that way.
-I'm the PX Lady.

82
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,960
I've heard of that term,
but I don't really know what it means.

83
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,128
The PX Lady from the past, huh?

84
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,430
-The PX Lady?
-Back when I was young,

85
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,167
they used to do door-to-door sales.
Can we see your wares?

86
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,935
-I brought amazing stuff.
-Yeah?

87
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,537
I have everything.

88
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:51,838
All from the US?

89
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,573
Some are, and others are from Japan.

90
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,774
Anyway, I have everything.

91
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,011
STAY TUNED FOR THE PX LADY'S GOODS

92
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,647
-And you are?
-Oh, me?

93
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,215
I'm a researcher.

94
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,283
-She's Choi Yang-rak.
-I'm…

95
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,653
CACKLING

96
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,721
"Golly, it's snowing."

97
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,858
I study the energy of the universe.

98
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,294
Just one look told me everything.

99
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,229
-You're all--
-You look so much like Mr. Choi.

100
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,298
"For what it's worth…"

101
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,899
She's giving Ms. Paeng Hyeon-suk too.

102
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,301
At any rate, the cosmic energy…

103
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,835
-Two people in one.
-It's palpable.

104
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,837
-What?
-I can sense cosmic energy.

105
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,639
"The complex belongs to its residents."

106
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,308
-What now?
-That's from Concrete, right?

107
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,010
-The complex belongs to us, the residents!
-Remind me of the title.

108
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,111
-Concrete Utopia.
-Right.

109
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,479
Yes, Concrete Utopia.

110
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,715
This unit belongs to me.

111
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,650
YOO CHAE-MYUNG, LEE BYUNG-HUN, DON LEE

112
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,352
IS THIS THE BLUE DRAGON FILM AWARDS?

113
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,987
-"For what it's worth…"
-Anyway,

114
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,589
it's been a while since I had you over.

115
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,424
You visited my home in Mapo, remember?

116
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,325
Oh, right.

117
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,026
Welcome to my new place.
Please have a seat.

118
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,428
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-We go to every new home of his.

119
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:52,198
You know what your places have in common?
You always get a place with a great view.

120
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,299
This is a lovely place.

121
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,567
LET'S TAKE A TOUR

122
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,502
NOW THAT ALL INTRODUCTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE

123
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,072
HE'D WALK IN DAILY WITH A FLUTTERING HEART

124
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,941
TO SEE HIS BELOVED

125
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,477
NOT THIS GUY, OBVIOUSLY

126
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,347
HIS WIFE WOULD GREET HIM
IN THIS LUXURIOUS LIVING ROOM

127
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,816
LOOK AT THIS FANTASTIC VIEW

128
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,518
I've never seen anything like it.

129
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,487
It's a city view of Seoul?

130
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,356
THAT'S AMAZING

131
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,958
We got a lovely view of Namsan Mountain.

132
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,960
I can see Itaewon too.

133
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,329
My gosh, what a grand place this is.

134
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,732
-Wait, Sae-ho.
-Yeah?

135
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,067
I see you've expanded your collection.

136
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,069
-It looks more organized, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

137
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,006
THE BACHELOR SAE-HO COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED

138
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,708
THIS NEW LIFE AS A NEWLYWED

139
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,176
DON'T BE PATHETIC

140
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,180
BLISSFULLY HAPPY

141
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,549
I was so lucky
to have received this painting.

142
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,285
Lee Hyo-ri drew it herself, you see.

143
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,352
WOW

144
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,088
She gave me one of her paintings.

145
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,056
Isn't that her pet dog?

146
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,125
Yes, that's her puppy, Soon-shim.

147
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,259
HYO-RI'S ONE-OF-A-KIND GIFT

148
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,496
I asked if she could give it to me
while we were on the shoot,

149
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,631
-and she actually did after we wrapped.
-Really?

150
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,199
neaHOW COOL IS THAT?

151
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,202
ANY DISH WOULD LOOK DELIGHTFUL
WITH SUCH A BACKDROP

152
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,438
-How is it, Sae-ho?
-What do you mean?

153
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,506
-The married life.
-Yeah.

154
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,807
-It's wonderful.
-In what way?

155
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,375
You didn't even consider your answer.

156
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,378
But I mean it.
I'll tell you my favorite part.

157
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,781
Before getting married,
I would return to an empty home.

158
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,583
But now, I have my wife welcoming me back.

159
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,818
She'd say, "Hey, you're here."

160
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,154
-Hey, wait.
-I can hardly wish for such happiness.

161
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,189
I don't see anything
that'd belong to your wife.

162
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,591
-What?
-It looks like a bachelor's pad.

163
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,226
-What?
-Nothing says a woman lives here.

164
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,629
Her stuff is in her room.

165
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,431
If you ask me,

166
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,466
it looks like a well-off bachelor's place.

167
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,469
-To be honest, I got that vibe too.
-You did, right?

168
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,072
We should be able to see
signs of your wife…

169
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,174
-All the shoes are men's size too.
-…but there's none here.

170
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,509
DEAR SAE-HO'S WIFE,
WE'RE ONLY JOKING

171
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,678
It's much cleaner,
and it even smells good.

172
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,679
Fresh and aromatic.

173
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,814
Tell us this, Sae-ho.

174
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,149
Walk us through your morning routine.

175
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,052
I usually get a fresh cup of coffee.

176
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,655
I use this to get a cup of drip coffee.

177
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,990
-Sae-ho's big on showing off.
-I'll show it to you.

178
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,660
This is quite unique.
It's actually a ceramic tool.

179
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,895
-What's that?
-You pour some ground coffee…

180
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,997
-And water?
-…and add water.

181
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,933
-Then, the filtered coffee drips down.
-Really?

182
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,434
Hey, where did you get it?

183
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,469
In Japan.

184
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,537
-Hey.
-Can I examine it?

185
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,106
Why would you advertise that?

186
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,907
-I'm allowed to go on vacation to Japan.
-Are you serious?

187
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,576
You're being too harsh.

188
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,711
I don't get it.

189
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,179
I was visiting Kyoto when I--

190
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,781
-Kyoto?
-Yeah?

191
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,216
You're not at that stage yet.

192
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,250
What? I'm not?

193
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,120
You think he still has a long way to go?

194
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,422
-So the water seeps out of here?
-It trickles down.

195
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,224
-How fancy.
-I don't buy it.

196
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,694
-This is how it works.
-I just have to get one.

197
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,330
When you pour water
over this ceramic filter,

198
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,965
-the coffee trickles down.
-So neat.

199
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,333
Okay, here's a suggestion.

200
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,968
Let's make this a prize for today's games.

201
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,369
-Good idea.
-I'm in.

202
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,005
YOU'RE HANDING OUT
MY STUFF?

203
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,040
NOW, SAE-HO

204
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,009
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

205
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,647
We could really try something
when we play the games later

206
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,249
because I own another one.

207
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,485
I'm not kidding or anything.

208
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,953
I didn't see this coming,

209
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,789
-but I could…
-That was just a random idea.

210
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,090
Okay. I do have another one.

211
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,525
-Where did I keep it?
-No, wait.

212
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,727
I knew it could come off as rude.

213
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,095
-Not at all.
-It was just a joke.

214
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,129
By the way, guys,

215
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932
doesn't Sae-ho look like
he'd be Sook's partner?

216
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,734
Shall we say he looks like the PX Man?

217
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,536
CRACKING UP

218
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,138
They could be a door-to-door sales team.

219
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,139
They do.

220
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,675
I'll take your attitudes into account.

221
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,576
Oh, sure.

222
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,279
Come on, it's you guys.
I can give you whatever you want.

223
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,180
NICE ONE, SAE-HO

224
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,915
-I mean that.
-Can I have that?

225
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,816
-This?
-Yeah.

226
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,084
Not this one. It belongs to my mother.

227
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,519
Really? That came out of nowhere.

228
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,354
-And the picture behind you?
-It's my father's.

229
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,023
You suddenly have
your mother's items here?

230
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,691
What about the countless pairs of shoes?

231
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,959
They all belong to my wife.

232
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,094
But they look like
they'd be 270 mm in size.

233
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,362
Please leave.

234
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,064
What's your shoe size?

235
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,632
Me? I wear 260-mm shoes.

236
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,700
-260-mm shoes?
-Yeah.

237
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,268
I might have a little something.

238
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,970
You have 260-mm shoes?

239
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,104
REALLY?

240
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,373
-Mr. Muscle there…
-What on earth?

241
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,875
That's not necessary, Sae-ho.

242
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,443
This is such a lovely pair.

243
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,578
I wear 260-mm shoes too.

244
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,712
These are stunning.

245
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,447
-You don't wear 260.
-Try it on.

246
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,316
WHAT? WHY NOT?

247
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,017
-It's so pretty.
-Try standing up.

248
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,118
It's gorgeous.

249
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,253
FITS HER PERFECTLY

250
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,789
There's our Mr. Choi Yang-rak in Forces.

251
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,023
Don't you have any in 270 mm?

252
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,992
COME ON, THIS ISN'T A SHOESTORE

253
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,994
Hold on, Sae-ho.

254
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,395
What's in this for me?

255
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,898
-The shoes would only fit Jin-kyung.
-Here, Sae-ho.

256
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,334
I've given up coffee entirely.

257
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,836
None of these appeals to me.

258
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,938
I wonder what might interest this guy.

259
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,607
Do you think we came empty-handed?

260
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,875
A hat, maybe?

261
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,344
-Right, we brought presents.
-This is a housewarming.

262
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,713
Leave him be. He must have something else.

263
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,682
-Try feeling this bag.
-Look at that, it's leather.

264
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,150
-It's really nice.
-A leather bag?

265
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,119
It'd be perfect for a vacation.

266
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,787
-How cute is that?
-It's brand-new.

267
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,923
-Should you be giving it away?
-Don't give it to him.

268
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,024
Oh, I'm just bragging.

269
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,828
-Bragging?
-Bragging on the leather quality?

270
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,329
I should've known. It's so fancy.

271
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,797
This bag's fate will be decided

272
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,099
during the games.

273
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,500
-This one too?
-It's a prize.

274
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,935
THE TEAM IS IN FOR A TREAT

275
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,036
MR. HOMEOWNER LOST HIS MIND

276
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,304
Try it on. It's beautiful.

277
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,439
-Doesn't the color suit me?
-It'd be perfect for traveling.

278
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,574
I LOVE IT

279
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,742
-It looks great.
-Totally.

280
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:07,246
I'll present you with new items
one by one to maximize your fun.

281
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,681
Sae-ho.

282
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,783
We have no intention
to just take these gifts.

283
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,684
Is that right?

284
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,553
-But I do.
-We didn't come empty-handed.

285
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,754
We came prepared.

286
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,656
-But you came empty-handed.
-You didn't have to.

287
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,025
A FEW DAYS AGO

288
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,026
Three, two, one.

289
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,030
I hear we're visiting Sae-ho's place
for a housewarming party.

290
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,432
I didn't want to go empty-handed.

291
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,868
THEY PREPARED GIFTS FOR SAE-HO

292
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,536
How about a rice bowl set?

293
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:31,904
I do wonder, though.

294
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,907
Do we really need to bother with gifts?

295
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,076
Whatever.

296
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:37,977
COLD-HEARTED AS USUAL

297
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,445
Let me think.

298
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,047
This is actually very tricky.

299
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,348
SO, WHAT DID THEY BRING?

300
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,151
Why did you all bring so much stuff?

301
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,219
We couldn't come empty-handed.

302
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,622
-"The complex belongs to the residents."
-This isn't a full-on party.

303
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,190
-Even so.
-And we're all residents.

304
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,858
-Really, guys?
-We're all neighbors.

305
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,828
It's only right to bring gifts
if your neighbor's holding a housewarming.

306
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,863
I'm the PX Lady after all.

307
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,898
Why don't I go first?

308
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,232
Please go ahead.

309
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,068
Actually…

310
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:02,969
FLAP, FLAP

311
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,670
…when I thought of Sae-ho,

312
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,306
-this memory came to my mind.
-Stop it, will you?

313
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,374
FLAP, FLAP

314
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,742
Stop it, will you?

315
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,811
Grab his hand or something.

316
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,447
-Shall I tie him up with ropes?
-What's your problem?

317
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,949
-You're making my mind whirl.
-All these muscles, man.

318
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,785
I'm honestly curious.
What have you got underneath the shirt?

319
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,187
Oh, so you're curious?

320
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,256
-I'm taking my shirt off, okay?
-I thought he genuinely got buffed up.

321
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,958
-What is that?
-It's a muscle suit.

322
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,760
-That's a skin-toned blanket.
-A suit, huh?

323
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,462
-This is 100% all me.
-It's a blanket.

324
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,529
How annoying.

325
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,697
-This is all me.
-How lame.

326
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,165
-A blanket.
-You're pathetic.

327
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,668
-It'd be perfect for winter.
-Unbelievable.

328
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,603
You're messing around big time today.

329
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,774
I think Sae-ho would like my presents.

330
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,776
-What are they?
-When we were at Jin-kyung's,

331
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,145
we played a game with prizes.

332
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,381
Sae-ho was very disappointed
when he missed this.

333
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,783
That's how I learned
Sae-ho's taste in things.

334
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,085
-What was the prize back then?
-He's married now, so…

335
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,987
That whole box is mine? Thank you.

336
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,055
Thank you so much.

337
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,125
-Can I really take it?
-Use them with your wife.

338
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,827
BOX OPENED

339
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,964
I did admire these
when I saw them at Jin-kyung's.

340
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,132
That's right.

341
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,367
-You kept praising them.
-You bought me these?

342
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:10,836
Gosh, look at this.

343
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,271
-So elegant.
-That's beautiful.

344
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,207
I bought everything in pairs.

345
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,742
Man, I'm loving this.

346
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,445
How pretty.

347
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,414
Gosh, this is so lovely.

348
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,215
-What a fine choice, Sook.
-Frankly,

349
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,885
Sae-ho and I aren't close enough
to get this much stuff.

350
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,553
-How classy.
-Wow.

351
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,423
But the cameras are here,
so I have no choice.

352
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,323
So gorgeous!

353
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,092
-I love this shade.
-It's so pretty.

354
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,126
A PERFECT CHOICE FOR SAE-HO

355
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,828
SOOK'S FAVORITE POTTERY SHOP

356
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,997
Look how beautiful this is.

357
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,533
These mugs come in different shades.

358
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,867
Don't they look lovely?

359
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:42,968
ENCHANTED BY THE MUGS

360
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,105
This is so beautiful too.

361
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,041
How sick is this?

362
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,244
NEATLY LAID OUT "SICK" TABLEWARES

363
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,979
I want to get him something
he'd actually like.

364
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,347
EACH ITEM SELECTED WITH SAE-HO IN MIND

365
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,549
It looks cool, at any rate.

366
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,086
Hey, Sook!

367
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,121
I'm having a housewarming
with you as my only guest.

368
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,490
My gosh. These are practically art pieces.

369
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,192
-This is so cute.
-It's so lovely.

370
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,094
-It's charming.
-They all go together like this.

371
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,463
FINALLY SEEING THE COMPLETE SET
OF GRACEFUL TABLEWARES

372
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,131
So this makes a complete set?

373
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,632
Oh, like that, huh?

374
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,635
A PERFECT PAIRING OF COMPLEMENTARY COLORS

375
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,471
-Your presents are beautiful, Sook.
-Thanks.

376
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,638
A GREAT CHOICE FOR THE NEWLYWEDS

377
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,140
They're handcrafted designs.

378
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,708
These are amazing.

379
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,376
-Open the next one.
-You like them?

380
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:25,544
Yeah, you're the best.

381
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,347
-What did you bring, Woo-jae?
-Not after Sook.

382
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,982
It's the thought that counts.

383
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,352
Wait, let me explain. I was told
to bring something I had at home.

384
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,887
THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE

385
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:35,788
Don't worry about it.

386
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,957
We're all good neighbors, remember?

387
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,025
-I did bring something I treasure.
-That makes it good enough.

388
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,264
Hello, dear viewers
of Screwballs on Netflix.

389
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,565
I'm Screwball's…

390
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,535
fourth-oldest member,

391
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,137
Joo Woo-jae.

392
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,139
INTRODUCING

393
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,240
JOO WOO-JAE

394
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,076
A MODEL-TURNED-YOUTUBER

395
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,010
WARDROBE SNEAK PEEK

396
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,347
THE CONTENT CREATOR
BEHIND ALL THESE FASHION VIDEOS

397
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,551
NOT ONLY IS HE A STYLISH GUY…

398
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,886
Does it look good?

399
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:11,223
…HE'S A MASTER GIFT-GIVER!

400
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,026
So I need to find something

401
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,561
that suits Sae-ho.

402
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,096
This pair is lovely.

403
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,864
I treasure it so much.

404
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,633
All right. It's great.

405
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:21,534
CONTEMPLATING HIS CHOICE

406
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,235
This has great commercial value.

407
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,671
But more importantly,
I think he'd dig this style.

408
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,674
-I did bring something I treasure.
-That makes it good enough.

409
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,476
I guess this is all I learned from Sae-ho.

410
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,745
Look at this treasured T-shirt of mine.

411
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,114
-Here.
-I gave you this.

412
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,616
YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE "AMOUPRE"

413
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,886
I only wore it once to sleep in it.

414
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,957
Actually, Sae-ho gave it to me
just a few days ago.

415
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,193
Once gifted, it's mine.

416
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,528
I can give this to him
as a present, right?

417
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,599
-Didn't Sae-ho…
-I love it so much.

418
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,001
I treasure it so much
that I didn't even remove the tag.

419
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,636
Didn't he give it to us about a month ago?

420
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:58,571
Yeah… Uh… Umm…

421
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,039
Please leave.

422
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,041
-But--
-No, I love it.

423
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,776
-I was just pranking you.
-You were?

424
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,810
-Goodness.
-Come on.

425
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,245
You startled all of us.

426
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,581
If you think about it,
Woo-jae would never do that.

427
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,616
-He's got something else.
-Like my prank from earlier?

428
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,085
-He's not like that.
-I brought a pair that's too short for me.

429
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,120
It's just too short for me.

430
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,622
Hold it up to your body.

431
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,523
Hang on.

432
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,527
DRAGGING ON THE FLOOR

433
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,995
Try these on above your pants.

434
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,797
These jeans are just too short for me.

435
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,298
But they don't look short at all.

436
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,499
Try them on.

437
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,667
Go on.

438
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,936
Like I said,
this pair is too short for me.

439
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,472
-Yeah?
-The washed design is gorgeous.

440
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,074
-It's otherwise perfect.
-It's lovely.

441
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,142
-It is short on you.
-When I wear it,

442
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,711
-this is how it looks.
-Let me try it on.

443
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,579
-It is short on you.
-When I wear it…

444
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,914
DEFINITELY TOO SHORT FOR WOO-JAE

445
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,315
It's too big too.

446
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,085
I thought these would fit Sae-ho well,
since they are short in length.

447
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,519
I get it. I'll try them on.

448
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,755
-They're really too short for me.
-Yeah, I saw that.

449
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,626
HMM?

450
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,561
HUH?!

451
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,329
CRACKING UP

452
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,099
THE PAIR LOOKED BEAUTIFUL ON WOO-JAE

453
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,401
IS THAT A BURLAP SACK?

454
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,869
Wait. Just how…

455
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,272
PUFFS

456
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,172
Wait. Just how…

457
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,407
TOO SHOCKED TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE

458
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,509
-Woo-jae.
-Yeah?

459
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,877
Please leave.

460
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,646
KEK

461
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:14,546
What the heck is this?

462
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,415
I don't get it.

463
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,316
The jeans are weird.

464
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,652
They were short for Woo-jae,
but when Sae-ho wore them…

465
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,553
-It's a lovely pair.
-I think it'd fit me.

466
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,255
Try changing into this, Woo-young.

467
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,524
No, I can wear it above my clothes.
I bet it'd fit me.

468
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,592
YOU'RE TRYING IT ON TOO?

469
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,528
CHANGING HANDS TO FIND THE OWNER
LIKE CINDERELLA'S GLASS SLIPPER

470
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,230
See? A perfect fit.

471
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,365
Its length is perfect for Woo-young.

472
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,567
ANXIOUS

473
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,039
-Woo-young should get it.
-How can it look so different on him?

474
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,607
Hey, let me try it on one last time.

475
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,443
YOU WANT THESE JEANS?

476
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,178
-But he's looking good.
-I want to try them.

477
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,880
They look so cute on Woo-young.

478
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,416
The waist is 32 inches,
so it should be perfect for me.

479
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,884
If I let the waistband sit on my waist,

480
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,485
the leg length is too short.

481
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,020
WHAT'S THIS?

482
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,622
Your feet are completely covered.

483
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,191
-How is this possible?
-How strange.

484
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,392
EXTRA-EXTRA-LONG JEANS?

485
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,661
Your feet are completely covered.

486
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,197
AN ESPECIALLY PUZZLING FIT

487
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,599
-I swear they are short.
-Here, complete your look.

488
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,601
THROW IN THE AMOUPRE T-SHIRT

489
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,236
It's perfect, right?

490
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,438
Wait, he has one more item.

491
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,906
-He does?
-Looks that way.

492
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,307
So this was another prank.

493
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,343
Woo-jae isn't that kind of guy.

494
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,278
It's a proper present.

495
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,612
Given the weather…

496
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,282
I brought this to keep you warm.

497
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,683
In the middle of summer?

498
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,884
My goodness.

499
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,553
It's sweltering.

500
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,489
A puffer jacket
as we go through the dog days?

501
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,193
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
THIS DAY'S HIGHEST TEMPERATURE WAS 300

502
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,662
I hear a puffer jacket
is the best present in summer.

503
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,130
But we're getting heatwaves.

504
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,398
PRACTICALLY A ATTEMPTED MURDER

505
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,299
But it looks so cute.

506
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,434
Because it is cute.
I used to love it so much.

507
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,569
-It's lovely.
-It sure is.

508
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,903
It cost a fortune too.

509
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,538
-I dig the design.
-You can do this.

510
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,741
-Isn't it too big on him?
-It is.

511
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,442
-It's rather too large.
-It is, right?

512
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,177
-What?
-It doesn't fit him at all.

513
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,380
-It looks big on you.
-Way too big.

514
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,081
Hold on. Can I try it on?

515
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,017
-Let Jin-kyung try it.
-Just once.

516
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,518
-I want to try it too.
-Just this once.

517
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,719
LET ME TRY IT ON REAL QUICK

518
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,388
But I brought it for Sae-ho.

519
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,557
-Gosh.
-Hey, it looks perfect on you.

520
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,126
It hugs her frame perfectly.

521
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,794
It sure does. I'd say it's yours.

522
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,696
SO THIS IS WHY JIN-KYUNG
IS A CELEBRATED MODEL

523
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,033
TEARS

524
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,535
Woo-young already took off his jacket.

525
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,436
WAITING HIS TURN

526
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,271
You do look good.
It suits you better than me.

527
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,706
It's perfect, Jin-kyung.

528
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,808
You could wear it during winter

529
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,510
for a Gorpcore look.

530
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,511
And it's Jin-kyung's.

531
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,479
Woo-jae brought a gift for Jin-kyung.

532
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,014
Like I said, it's really pricey.

533
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,550
Why did you take off your jacket anyway?

534
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,586
To try it on myself,
but it does look perfect on Jin-kyung.

535
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,021
-Still, try it.
-Go ahead.

536
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,923
-You look amazing.
-Why did you take off your jacket?

537
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,091
-Can I try it on?
-Go on.

538
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,926
May I?

539
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,761
WHY ARE THEY TRYING IT ON? IT'S MINE

540
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,930
-I swear I didn't bring random stuff.
-This looks sick.

541
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,231
It looks great on Woo-young.

542
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,433
It sure has a unique look.

543
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,001
It goes well with your hair too.

544
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,537
It gives off that special vibe.

545
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,172
It has goose down filling.

546
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,174
I told you it was pricey, Sook.

547
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,844
It looks so good on him.

548
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,845
How do I look?

549
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,715
ON EDGE

550
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,251
Insulated with goose feathers, huh?
That's just amazing.

551
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,754
-Take it off.
-Hold on.

552
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,056
Why don't I give this
to the winner of the games later?

553
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,158
Wait. Hang on, guys.

554
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,227
-Does Sae-ho get nothing, then?
-It suits me too, right?

555
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,163
It was meant to be his, but don't worry.
I have another one.

556
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,231
-Really?
-I knew it.

557
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,199
Of course.

558
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,667
Okay, I enjoyed the pranks so far.

559
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,403
-Of course, Woo-jae's not like that.
-This is the real deal.

560
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,671
-This is it.
-I knew it.

561
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,272
-You like glasses, right?
-Glasses?

562
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,809
I think this is Sae-ho's cup of tea.

563
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,979
It's these horn-rimmed glasses,
and they're exquisite.

564
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,047
-My gosh.
-How lovely.

565
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,348
That's a real beauty.

566
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,349
Hang on.

567
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,722
-I kept them--
-I'm worried about the arms.

568
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,990
That's not an issue.

569
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,692
-It looks fine.
-The frame's rather narrow.

570
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,861
-It's because of his full hair.
-It looks too small.

571
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,663
-The arms are a bit bent outward.
-It's his face.

572
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,965
They're being spread apart.

573
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,500
-Let me take them.
-It's a fine pair!

574
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,402
-The frame is too narrow.
-Exactly.

575
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,704
I swear it's really a fine pair.

576
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,339
Yeah, it looks nice. I'm keeping it.

577
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,974
The frame is too narrow.

578
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,611
JIN-KYUNG TRIES THE GLASSES ON

579
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,512
The temples look fine.

580
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,679
HUH?

581
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,847
-See?
-Let me see.

582
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,016
-These have my name on them.
-They do look perfect on you.

583
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,284
That's true.

584
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,086
EYES WELLING UP

585
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,787
Choi Yang-rak wearing glasses.

586
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,389
You do look great,

587
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,092
but we don't want people mistaking you
for Mr. Choi. Let me try them.

588
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,560
They would suit Woo-young well too.

589
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,328
My gosh.

590
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,463
OH? WOW!

591
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,597
FINALLY FOUND THEIR OWNER

592
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,498
They're yours.

593
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,433
"Hello? Just a second.
I'll be right there."

594
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,202
"I don't have to join you? Got it."

595
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,538
I LIKE GLASSES…

596
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,006
THOSE ARE MEANT TO BE MINE…

597
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,974
FORLORN GESTURE

598
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,776
I took great care of these glasses.

599
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,479
I actually own a couple more pairs
with a similar design.

600
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,647
-Sae-ho.
-We get it, okay?

601
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,781
-In that case…
-Hold on.

602
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,449
…Woo-young can have them.
I'll take the jacket.

603
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,417
-No.
-That works, right?

604
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,885
No, no. I don't need the glasses.

605
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,221
Take it, then. Everyone except for Sook,

606
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,255
please leave.

607
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,491
Only Sook can stay.

608
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,726
-Wait--
-What sort of guest are you?

609
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,895
Even the puffer jacket?

610
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,131
I did sense that the frame was narrow too.

611
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,166
-An optician can refit them.
-I still love the design.

612
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,935
The arms are practically gonna rip apart.

613
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,803
-They can be adjusted.
-You know what?

614
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,338
YOU CAN DECIDE WHO LOOKS BEST

615
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,006
I have newfound respect for Woo-jae.

616
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,008
-You're so smart.
-Why's that?

617
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,644
You managed to find items
that are lacking in some way.

618
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,648
Dude, I even filmed a video
of deciding what to bring.

619
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,283
I thought long and hard about all this.

620
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,652
If he cuffs these jeans,
they might actually fit.

621
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,853
ALREADY MAKING FUN OF SAE-HO

622
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,057
I'd appreciate good presents,
but we do need good stories for the show.

623
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,758
So I'd say a job well done.

624
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,760
We got great bits from his gifts.

625
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,531
Why couldn't you even manage a smile
when we had really funny stuff?

626
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,999
HAHAHA

627
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,434
HAHAHA

628
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,702
You look so sad.

629
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,338
All right. I'm loving this.

630
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,639
YOU HARDLY SMILED FOR THE "GOOD" BITS

631
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,407
Why don't I share my presents next?

632
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,309
You can finish up, Jin-kyung.

633
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,444
What did you bring?

634
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,645
Oh, actually…

635
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,913
WHAT DID WOO-YOUNG BRING?

636
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,215
I'm here at my studio.

637
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,952
First off, I must say
I have a lot of stuff to sort out.

638
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,622
Behind me is this keyboard.

639
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,325
And on this side, I have these speakers,

640
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,095
a guitar, and a bass guitar.

641
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,164
Over here on this side

642
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,268
is the camping chair
Sook got me for a present.

643
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,038
I've been looking around
to find a suitable item,

644
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,072
but…

645
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,009
MULLING IT OVER

646
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,577
Oh, actually…

647
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,546
I didn't know Sae-ho got a place
in an apartment complex.

648
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,881
What's he on about?

649
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,317
I thought you'd have found
a place with a garden.

650
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,487
But I told you repeatedly
that my new unit was on the 31st floor.

651
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:33,292
I had to do some deep cleaning
at my studio recently.

652
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,094
HE BROUGHT SOMETHING FROM HIS STUDIO?

653
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,830
So I bought a broom.

654
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,933
Actually, I bought two.

655
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,902
Turns out I didn't need two of them.

656
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,139
You might need it in the future, so…

657
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,041
It'd be perfect
for cleaning your living room.

658
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,442
-Or your bathroom.
-That's true.

659
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,710
This could look like a floor lamp

660
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,045
if I place it in the back.

661
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,514
I didn't think
you'd try to find uses for it.

662
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,649
I brought it as a joke,
but now I feel moved.

663
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,818
I can place it here like this.

664
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:00,719
It looks out of place.

665
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,421
Your wife's going to hate me.

666
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,389
-Oh, it's just…
-She'll throw it away.

667
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,291
"WOO-YOUNG, MY WIFE WILL BE THRILLED…"

668
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,360
You can see yourself out. It's that way.

669
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,563
-The door is over there.
-Come on, you can use it later

670
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,765
when you get a place with a yard.

671
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,934
I guess, but I have no plans
of moving anytime soon.

672
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,203
-Is that right?
-Is that all you brought?

673
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,971
-Oh, no.
-There's another one there.

674
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,574
I'll tell you all about this.
I discovered a brand recently.

675
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:27,479
This Danish brand
has become one of my favorites.

676
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,549
-Sae-ho's still in his honeymoon phase.
-Hey, it's fancy stuff.

677
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,684
And good lighting sets up the right tone.

678
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,786
-You bet it does.
-There's no doubt about that.

679
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,987
-One more thing.
-Gosh.

680
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,957
I went to the shop for a specific model
and picked up the last one in stock.

681
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,727
-I think his wife would approve.
-It's hefty.

682
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:42,761
WILL THIS WIN HIM POINTS?

683
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,962
It's a cube, isn't it?

684
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,831
-Gosh, it's gorgeous.
-My goodness.

685
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,032
-It's beautiful.
-Cute, right?

686
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,767
-And those turn into a lamp?
-Yeah.

687
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,203
It sure looks pretty.
How do you turn it on?

688
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,238
-Try turning it on.
-Gosh, that's pretty.

689
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,941
-It's the ultimate mood setter.
-How lovely.

690
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,209
That goes well with my gift.

691
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,844
-I should put it in our bedroom.
-It's nice.

692
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,745
It's good, right?

693
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,814
A PERFECT ADDITION
TO THE COUPLE'S ROMANTIC BEDROOM

694
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,784
What do you do
with that sexy lighting turned on?

695
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,185
-Spill now.
-I want to know too.

696
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,320
I watch Screwballs.

697
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,857
-In such low lighting?
-That's unlikely.

698
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,893
That's impressive enough
to put Jin-kyung under pressure.

699
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,361
I don't feel that way.

700
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,963
-Did you bring your kimchi?
-No.

701
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,865
-Kimchi and dumplings?
-I'd love some dumplings.

702
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,971
EVERYONE IN THE SHOWBIZ INDUSTRY
KNOWS HOW TIGHT JIN-KYUNG AND SAE-HO ARE

703
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,106
By the way, Jin-kyung didn't come.

704
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,208
The situation was beyond my control.

705
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,010
I felt bad I couldn't make it.

706
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,345
But I felt terrible I missed it.

707
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,346
TO MAKE IT UP TO SAE-HO…

708
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,783
JIN-KYUNG DECIDED TO GO BIG
ON THE HOUSEWARMING GIFTS

709
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:44,256
We're now at one of my favorite shops
in Hannam-dong.

710
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,125
I'm going to get Sae-ho's presents here.

711
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,895
Sae-ho and I had a chat earlier
on the phone,

712
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:51,863
and Sae-ho said

713
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,467
while he didn't want me
to get it the wrong way,

714
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,904
but he'd really appreciate it
if I got something luxurious.

715
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,006
He said that in passing
like it was a joke.

716
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,541
I'm sure it was just a joke,

717
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,309
but that's what he told me.

718
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,078
I'm a fan of the towels
sold at this boutique.

719
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,615
I actually use the navy ones at home.

720
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,585
I believe I showed them
in one of my YouTube videos.

721
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,521
But obviously, Sae-ho would have towels.

722
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:21,092
This boutique offers
a range of these tasteful items.

723
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,528
ELEGANTLY ARRANGED LIKE AN ART GALLERY

724
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,331
Do you think
this would suit Sae-ho's place?

725
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,766
WOULD IT? HEH

726
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,870
I wonder what would go well
with the place.

727
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,672
LET ME SEE…

728
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,775
What do you think
about this porcelain piece?

729
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,710
This isn't it, is it?

730
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,644
I thought so too.

731
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,413
What about this washbowl?

732
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,484
Sae-ho could use it
to soak and wash his feet.

733
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,019
His feet and his face.
This could be useful.

734
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,689
I have this at home.

735
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,724
I use it as a soap dish.

736
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,694
For smaller soap bars and for larger ones.

737
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,928
JIN-KYUNG'S SOAP DISHES

738
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,563
They look lovely as a soap dish.

739
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,999
-Can I get these two as well?
-Of course.

740
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,434
AESTHETIC SOAP DISHES ADDED TO THE LIST!

741
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,270
I'm getting him a bunch of little items

742
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,239
like they form a set.

743
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,406
THEME: A GIFT SET

744
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,842
I'm getting this too. It's so charming.

745
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,677
It's a set of forks.

746
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,613
I'd like that one as well.

747
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,281
Two of this, please.

748
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,984
I'll take the saucers too.
Two of each, please.

749
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,021
HER BASKET IS FULL OF PRESENTS

750
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,956
I'm a bit worried, though.

751
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,826
ABOUT WHAT?

752
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,295
I don't want him to think
I got him a random rock.

753
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,198
This is actually a piece of art, Sae-ho.

754
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,167
Don't mistake it
for a random block of stone, okay?

755
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,202
A WARNING JUST IN CASE

756
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,404
HER MANAGER

757
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,839
-What?
-It looks like a pumice stone.

758
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,607
Pumice stone?

759
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,811
Sae-ho, I swear I'll end you
if you use this for exfoliation.

760
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,748
This isn't for exfoliating, okay?

761
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,785
IT'S EVEN FUNNIER
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE

762
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,923
PACKAGING THE GOODS HERSELF
AFTER CHECKOUT

763
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,093
What is it, Jin-kyung?

764
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,196
Here's some stuff I use at home.
It's my favorite, actually.

765
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,665
-So you got him those.
-Bath towels

766
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,067
-in navy.
-Towels? Wow.

767
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,201
These are hand towels.

768
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,103
My gosh. I love towels.

769
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,572
-Open one.
-These are gorgeous.

770
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,106
My gosh. How wonderful.

771
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,410
-It's amazing.
-This is a towel?

772
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,511
Is that a bath mat?

773
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,946
Why did you get so many?

774
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,414
-My gosh.
-You went big.

775
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,582
Why did you get so many?

776
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,883
I just ended up splurging.

777
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,184
Gosh, what are those?

778
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,086
-My gosh!
-Is that a plate?

779
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,254
Wow, a plate.

780
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,155
A HEAVY CERAMIC PLATE

781
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,823
-It's a beauty.
-Did you buy from the same shop?

782
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,724
No.

783
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,559
Look, Jin-kyung.

784
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,494
We got them color-coordinated somehow.

785
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,964
-They do look great together.
-I can't believe it.

786
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,165
Just what I needed!

787
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,701
Let's have the shoot
at my place from now on.

788
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,438
Those are such neat presents.

789
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,606
HOOKED ON GIFTS

790
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,077
My wife will be so surprised
when she gets home.

791
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,311
I bet she'll be delighted.

792
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,449
Those are incense sticks
but they don't emit smoke.

793
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,883
-What are these?
-Forks.

794
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,818
Oh, forks.

795
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,720
Don't light those on fire.

796
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,954
-My gosh.
-And that's it.

797
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,389
-Throw them in there.
-Thanks.

798
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,792
Sook and Jin-kyung
really went above and beyond.

799
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,462
-I love this so much.
-How cute are they?

800
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,163
-My gosh.
-Thanks again.

801
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,566
-How lovely.
-I mean it.

802
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,001
You didn't have to get me all these.

803
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,370
SAE-HO WOULD'VE FELT
THEIR DEEP AFFECTION FOR HIM

804
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,206
We had a lovely time opening up
all those gifts, sure.

805
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,675
But can I interest you
in some of my wares?

806
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,743
Of course.

807
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,545
Just take a look. You needn't buy
if nothing interests you.

808
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,080
So you've got something in there, huh?

809
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,415
-What's in there?
-It's so heavy.

810
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,251
-The suitcase looks so fine.
-It looks brand-new.

811
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,186
What did you bring, then?

812
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,189
-Gosh, here we go.
-She's got a variety.

813
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,090
What is it?

814
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,458
Wait, first things first.

815
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,962
Drink a bottle of this multivitamin each.

816
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,530
-Can we?
-Really?

817
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,366
-Here, drink up.
-I'm not missing this one.

818
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,568
You don't have to buy anything.
This is on me.

819
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,170
-Thank you.
-It's complimentary.

820
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,505
This is a must-have item.

821
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,040
It's the butt soap that Jennie uses.

822
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,341
-My gosh!
-A butt what?

823
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,276
-Jennie turned it into a sensation.
-What does it do?

824
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,178
It exfoliates your butt skin.

825
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,346
I hear it smells great.

826
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,981
-Really?
-They call it Jennie's soap.

827
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,849
Jennie's soap is all the rage now.

828
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,151
-It sure is unique.
-Ma'am.

829
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,253
-Do you have sweets like chocolate?
-I sure do.

830
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,187
Here you go.

831
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,322
-What about…
-I have some crackers too.

832
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,724
Man, that looks good.

833
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,527
One more thing. Snacks
aren't the only things I peddle.

834
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,328
I have clothes too. Look.

835
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,663
Here. It's incredible.

836
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,099
-Look at this lovely color.
-Cute! What's the make? Can I try it on?

837
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,334
-"VALENCIA"?
-Yes, that's it.

838
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,303
-"VALENCIA"?
-Shouldn't it be "Balenciaga"?

839
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,205
VALENCIA is a Korean brand.

840
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,374
Is this a legit prop? Can I buy it?

841
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,875
IS SHE DOING A BIT NOW?

842
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,645
We need to talk about this.

843
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,047
-There's a backstory to this.
-It looks light and breezy.

844
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,449
It was you, wasn't it?

845
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,717
You said I got it wrong.

846
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,218
There is indeed a backstory to this.

847
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,254
On the sixth episode of the first season,

848
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:47,392
we had the Horseback Quiz Show
for the Chaebol Heir Audition.

849
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,493
-Sure.
-Right.

850
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,130
DURING THE HORSEBACK QUIZ SHOW
ON EPISODE 6 OF SEASON 1

851
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,332
WHEN ASKED TO NAME 5 BRANDS
THAT HAD 4-SYLLABLE NAMES IN KOREAN

852
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,633
VALENCIA…

853
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,601
SOOK SUGGESTED VALENCIA…

854
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,269
-Wrong!
-Ferragamo… Darn it.

855
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,204
Balenciaga, not VALENCIA.

856
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,271
…ONLY TO BE TOLD SHE WAS WRONG

857
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,341
-I failed her, but…
-Turns out there is VALENCIA.

858
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,410
OUR HEARTFELT APOLOGIES TO VALENCIA

859
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,344
It's a Korean brand?

860
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,079
So VALENCIA is a legit brand!

861
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,381
Brands with a four-syllable name
always thrive.

862
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,617
VALENCIA, AMOUPRE… Wait, not AMOUPRE.

863
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,954
THIS GUY SOON BECOMES THE TARGET

864
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,990
HERE'S THE CORRECTION FOR OUR DEAR VIEWERS

865
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,593
-VALENCIA is a Korean brand.
-You bet it is.

866
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,361
-It has a long history too.
-Of course.

867
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,664
Our showrunner is just an idiot
who doesn't know any better.

868
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,166
We ask for your understanding.

869
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,502
-Once again, our apologies.
-We apologize.

870
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,438
THAT'S WHY WE PREPARED THIS

871
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,006
SO STYLISH

872
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,307
Why does he look so good?

873
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:37,842
Just why?

874
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,077
Let me try it, Woo-young.

875
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,013
Give it to me. I should try it.

876
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,682
IF IT'S NO PR TROUBLE TO YOU,
WE'LL HAVE THIS GUY TRY YOUR JACKET

877
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,984
Hey, you look sharp in that too.

878
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,019
I happen to love
cropped jackets like this one.

879
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,188
Looking good, dude.

880
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,023
You look so good in it.

881
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,925
Roll up the sleeves,
and it's perfect for an outing.

882
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,560
THIS ISN'T A PRODUCT PLACEMENT

883
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,895
Tell me about it.

884
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,830
I love it.
Look at these incisions on each side.

885
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,166
WE'RE MERELY MAKING UP
FOR OUR PAST MISTAKE

886
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,636
It looks good on me, Sae-ho, and Sook.

887
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,037
I like how light the fabric is.

888
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,672
Yeah, it's perfect for an outing.

889
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:08,573
It's adjustable.

890
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,474
ANYWAY, GOOD JOB, CAST

891
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,042
We wish you all the best, VALENCIA!

892
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,944
EVERYONE AT SCREWBALLS
WISHES VALENCIA'S SUCCESS

893
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,779
We've come to realize

894
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:18,049
that given how this place
is Sae-ho and his wife's home…

895
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:18,950
-Sure.
-Oh, right.

896
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,820
…we should respect
their privacy and boundaries.

897
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,555
I wish I could show you everything.

898
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,225
I propose we use this new name
instead of the housewarming party.

899
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,259
How's Living Room Party?

900
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,594
-Living Room Party?
-All right.

901
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,429
-It's cute.
-Living Room Party.

902
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,397
LRP.

903
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,867
I know all of you attended his wedding
apart from a certain someone.

904
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:36,835
That's right.

905
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,670
DANG IT

906
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,838
That's a great point.

907
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,372
A very important one.

908
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,908
Anyway, someone among the cast
missed the event.

909
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,044
-Can we see your wedding album?
-The album?

910
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,046
You'll find it behind you, Woo-young.

911
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,315
You missed it, didn't you?
We'll show you the photos.

912
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:51,983
-It's heavy.
-This one, right?

913
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,218
Yes, let's go over it.

914
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,519
Take a look, Jin-kyung.

915
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,687
LET'S LOOK AT THE PHOTOS

916
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,156
You won't be
in any of the photos, Jin-kyung.

917
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,992
-Goodness.
-Gosh, how lovely.

918
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,028
-Hey, that's Chang-hee.
-Yeah, it's him.

919
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,964
-My gosh.
-That's a must-have photo.

920
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,932
THE BRIDEGROOM AND HIS FRIEND OF 22 YEARS

921
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,068
You look amazing in the photos, Sae-ho.

922
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,603
That's him with his father.

923
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,404
-You look so fine.
-Is this your father-in-law?

924
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,606
Yes, they're my in-laws.

925
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,975
-Oh, your in-laws.
-Did you think they'd be hired actors?

926
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,044
Seriously, did you think they were actors?

927
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,714
It's just that I saw actors
who look like them on TV shows.

928
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,683
They are his parents-in-law.

929
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,786
That's right. Don't miss
the gorgeous flower arrangements.

930
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,355
They're so beautiful, aren't they?

931
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,124
-My gosh. This does take me back.
-Yeah.

932
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,260
-It's amazing.
-His mother and his mother-in-law.

933
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,295
Hey, there's G-DRAGON!

934
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,229
TAEYANG was there too.

935
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,864
TAEYANG AND G-DRAGON

936
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,066
-They look amazing even in photos.
-How photogenic.

937
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,234
You can say that again.

938
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,603
The photos are masterpieces.

939
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,505
Hey, this is so hilarious.

940
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,741
ON TIPTOES TO REACH HIS BRIDE

941
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,809
I didn't expect to see this one.

942
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,178
Only a few pages remain,
but we haven't seen you guys.

943
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,346
We hardly show up here.

944
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,515
That's because we only took a group photo.

945
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,317
-Just one?
-Well, yes.

946
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,586
Obviously, Jae-seok got a portrait.

947
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,655
-Of course.
-That's to be expected.

948
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,723
I can't help but make comparisons.

949
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,791
FEELS HURT

950
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,060
Our team is nowhere to be found.

951
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,361
It does hurt my feelings.

952
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,963
Oh, wait.

953
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,665
-Our show--
-It didn't air yet.

954
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,133
Oh, that's true.

955
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,200
We hadn't begun filming yet.

956
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,303
It took place
before we started working together.

957
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,004
Oh, was it before the reboot?

958
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,406
We hadn't made it back yet.

959
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,908
My gosh. You look so lovely.

960
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,243
I love these photos.

961
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,210
You look so nice.

962
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,947
-The photographer did a wonderful job.
-Tell me about it.

963
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,748
-They did a great job.
-They really did.

964
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:31,883
Once again, congratulations.

965
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,152
Thank you.
It's been a while since I saw the photos.

966
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,554
ONCE AGAIN, WE WISH YOU THE BEST

967
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,157
You'll remember how elated we were

968
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,426
to get a chance to work together
for Screwballs.

969
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,460
-Of course.
-Sure.

970
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,697
We've hit the half-year mark already.

971
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,199
-Has it been six months already?
-Yes, it has.

972
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,634
The Killer Training was six months ago?

973
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:51,703
-That's right.
-How time flies.

974
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,937
Unbelievable.

975
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,574
We had a team dinner
after the first shoot, remember?

976
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,110
We had a game to decide
who picks up the tab later.

977
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,011
-Right.
-Sure.

978
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:04,082
We have a plan for another team dinner
after today's shoot.

979
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,085
For today's team dinner,
half of the bill will be covered

980
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,586
by me, the small business owner.

981
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,254
-Come off it.
-We're not having it.

982
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,422
Let's have a fair game.

983
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,291
-Where's the fun in that?
-I'm not going, then.

984
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,894
TOUCHED

985
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,563
-I'm not going, then.
-Wait.

986
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,998
Let Woo-young handle the rest.

987
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,067
I have my reasons.
He didn't pay a dime the last time.

988
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,370
-Not a dime, okay?
-Dude, step up and chip in.

989
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,138
This can turn into an endless blame game.

990
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,241
Remember that time you paid
millions of won for the team dinner?

991
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,377
Sae-ho paid for an additional two million.

992
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,579
I picked up the tab for the next round.

993
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,747
For 57,000 won, right?

994
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,750
Seriously, 57,000 won?

995
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,184
It wasn't 57,000 won.

996
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,686
It was 59,000 won.

997
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,088
Don't you have a conscience?

998
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:44,989
I have none.

999
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,157
GO EASY ON YOUR YOUNGEST COSTAR

1000
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,893
We'll play games to decide
who pays for the remaining sum.

1001
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,461
They'll be individual ones.

1002
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,331
That puts me at a disadvantage.

1003
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,966
You think we get the upper hand?

1004
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,402
-He sure does!
-We all get the same odds.

1005
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,303
That depends on the games we're playing.

1006
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,073
-Let's play something luck can factor in.
-If we don't,

1007
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,374
Woo-jae's bound to win.

1008
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,876
PROTECT THOSE WHO AREN'T GOOD AT GAMES

1009
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:08,246
Today's games won't require you
to have brilliant minds.

1010
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,514
They're not of that sort.

1011
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,149
Did you have to phrase it like that?

1012
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,951
-Director.
-What a weird choice of words.

1013
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,487
Jin-kyung never mentioned
anything about minds.

1014
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,322
-Why did you bring it up?
-Why indeed.

1015
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,091
We don't need wit either?

1016
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,092
Well--

1017
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,494
Why are you bringing up wit?

1018
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,999
I'd say your ability to read the room
would matter most for today.

1019
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:28,900
I'm not so bad there.

1020
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,668
But you're known to be utterly clueless.

1021
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,504
Didn't we have a huge scandal recently?

1022
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,308
Well, just among ourselves.

1023
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,644
Damn it.

1024
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,845
LET'S CIRCLE BACK

1025
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,848
You'll be ranked
based on the games' results.

1026
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,318
We'll be bringing back the roulette
you used back in Busan,

1027
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,054
the one that made Woo-young sleep outside.

1028
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,090
There are 15 empty cells in total.

1029
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,257
Fifth place gets five cells.

1030
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,861
The others will receive four, three,
two, and one, in descending order.

1031
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,130
After all cells are filled,
we'll spin the roulette.

1032
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,599
If you're unlucky,
you can get selected with just one name.

1033
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,935
There's no need to despair
even if you place fifth.

1034
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,470
Exactly. I like the idea.

1035
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,006
Do we all chip in a certain percentage
based on our ranks,

1036
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,541
or does one person get the whole 50%?

1037
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,009
The latter was what we had in mind.

1038
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,144
-Really?
-Are you sure?

1039
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,380
-That was our original idea.
-Shall we, then?

1040
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,218
Please let us know if you have ideas.
We're open to changes.

1041
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,119
I'm good with it.

1042
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,787
Let's spin the roulette once more

1043
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,489
-after the loser is selected.
-Yeah?

1044
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,924
-If the loser is selected once more…
-What if they're chosen again?

1045
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,426
…then they can pay the whole amount.

1046
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,294
If another person is selected,

1047
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,563
-those two can share the burden.
-All right.

1048
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,598
Let's go with his idea.

1049
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,300
I can supply prizes
for the winner of each game.

1050
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,502
You'd do that? Okay.

1051
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,836
I'll get them set up here.

1052
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:41,839
Please go ahead.
That will keep everyone motivated.

1053
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,574
LET ME HELP, SAE-HO

1054
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,143
Let's get those prizes set up.

1055
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,281
We should get the prize pile here.

1056
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,850
THESE SO-CALLED HOUSEWARMING GUESTS
ARE PRACTICALLY ROBBERS

1057
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,785
What are they doing there?

1058
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:56,854
He's taking them away.

1059
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:57,989
THESE ARE MINE

1060
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,057
SAE-HO'S PRESENTS ARE ALL SET

1061
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,560
All right. Today's games will decide
who pays for the team dinner.

1062
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,794
Let's begin the first one.

1063
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,097
It's called "Who Bopped My Head?"

1064
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,032
"Who Bopped My Head?"

1065
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,667
"Who Bopped My Head?"

1066
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:13,404
You will each take a turn
to become the round's target.

1067
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,406
The remaining four will sit on the couch

1068
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,841
while the target sits on the floor.

1069
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,912
One among the four will bop
the target's head with the toy hammer.

1070
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,014
One second later, I'll blow the whistle.

1071
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,751
The target can then turn around
and guess who did it.

1072
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,121
We're free to trick the target, right?

1073
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,522
-Yes.
-We need solid strategies.

1074
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,191
I'll strike her, Sae-ho.

1075
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,293
I'll put in all my energy too,
swinging hard.

1076
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,828
-I'll land an epic hit on her.
-All right.

1077
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,497
Prepare to be amazed.

1078
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,399
I'll jump high enough to reach the ceiling

1079
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,201
and strike her down hard.

1080
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,669
YOU'RE LIKE A PACK OF CHILDREN

1081
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,704
That could seriously hurt her neck.

1082
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,907
-Let's decide by Rock-Paper-Scissors.
-Okay, the loser gets the hammer.

1083
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,609
Rock, paper, scissors.

1084
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,211
Rock, paper, scissors.

1085
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,979
SO, WHO WANTS TO BONK HER?

1086
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,914
Rock, paper, scissors.

1087
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,449
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Okay.

1088
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,917
I lost, so I'll bop her.

1089
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:00,885
-Okay.
-I lost.

1090
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:01,986
-Sure.
-Yeah.

1091
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,854
Ready.

1092
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:04,956
STAY STRONG, JIN-KYUNG

1093
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,490
Whoosh.

1094
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,491
He's scaring her.

1095
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,026
I lost, okay?

1096
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:09,961
I'LL BE OKAY!

1097
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,630
I CAN STAY STRONG!

1098
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,906
-Turn around.
-That hurt like hell!

1099
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,941
Hey!

1100
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,877
-Who's your guess?
-I swear I'll end you.

1101
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,980
That really hurt, okay?

1102
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,081
Who's your guess?

1103
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,949
-You.
-This is actually fun.

1104
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,986
-So, was it Woo-jae?
-I forgot to tell you one rule.

1105
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,687
To finish your round as the target,

1106
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,955
you must make a correct guess.

1107
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,859
I HAVE TO WITHSTAND HITS
UNTIL I GET IT RIGHT?

1108
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,895
Cut it out. That really hurt.

1109
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,397
At any rate, it wasn't me.

1110
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,566
Jin-kyung, you failed.

1111
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,635
-Turn around.
-We promise not to strike as hard.

1112
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,602
That really hurt.

1113
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,870
She must've been really startled.

1114
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,672
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

1115
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,174
Rock, paper, scissors.

1116
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,809
Rock, paper, scissors.

1117
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,877
-Okay.
-Okay.

1118
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,646
-Sook.
-Got it.

1119
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,348
EYES CLENCHED SHUT

1120
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,784
TEARS

1121
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,755
QUICK CONSPIRATORS

1122
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:11,656
WOO-JAE'S SLOW TO JOIN

1123
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:12,723
Sook.

1124
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,158
I'm afraid it wasn't her.

1125
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,360
-Dang it.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

1126
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,496
Rock, paper, scissors.

1127
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,564
DO IT, WOO-JAE

1128
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,832
I'LL STRIKE FROM THERE

1129
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,334
I WANT TO DO IT

1130
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,702
A SILENT DEBATE

1131
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,970
Come on, let me do it.

1132
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,612
HIS GAZE WANDERS IN PANIC

1133
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,082
How could you thrash my ear?

1134
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,950
Seriously, Woo-young!

1135
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,452
YOU THINK I DID IT?

1136
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,888
-You got it wrong.
-He banged my ear, okay?

1137
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:44,955
You failed.

1138
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,557
I'M SORRY, JIN-KYUNG

1139
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,958
-She got it wrong.
-She did.

1140
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,260
You're killing me.

1141
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,062
ROUND 4, MOVING ON FROM THE EAR INCIDENT

1142
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,663
Rock, paper…

1143
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,599
I COULDN'T AIM PROPERLY

1144
00:38:59,103 --> 00:38:59,937
SCRAMBLING

1145
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,905
What a soft blow.

1146
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,474
GUESS WHO DID IT

1147
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,478
STARING FIXEDLY

1148
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,049
Woo-jae.

1149
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,584
-Can we hear your reasoning?
-Why me?

1150
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,887
I think he softened the blow
so I wouldn't think it was him.

1151
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,057
-That's some analysis.
-Nice deduction work.

1152
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,126
Still, you failed.

1153
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,327
SAE-HO DID IT

1154
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,596
-My neck hurts.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

1155
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,964
-My neck hurts.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

1156
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,865
WHACK HER HARD

1157
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:28,933
Rock, paper, scissors.

1158
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,834
-Okay.
-Okay.

1159
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,768
Shall I? Okay.

1160
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,039
HEH

1161
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,009
Hold on. I think it was Sook.

1162
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:39,910
She got it right.

1163
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,345
Yes!

1164
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,780
How did you know?

1165
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,915
I somehow got the feeling

1166
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,818
that these guys were overdoing it.

1167
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,553
That tipped me off.

1168
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,556
We didn't exactly enjoy
having to hit you repeatedly.

1169
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:53,924
We felt bad too.

1170
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,826
You might win this thing.

1171
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,162
-Who smacked my ear?
-I did, but hear me out.

1172
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,563
-I didn't mean to--
-You brat.

1173
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,365
Honestly, I didn't mean to do that.

1174
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,566
I panicked too.

1175
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,569
I tried to hit you from this angle
so you wouldn't notice it was me,

1176
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,105
-and my hand slipped.
-By the way, I never bopped you.

1177
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,640
I'm telling the truth.

1178
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,908
HE MINDED THE ACCUSATION

1179
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,777
-Are you ready?
-I think

1180
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,212
-the second time feels right.
-I'll definitely hit you this time.

1181
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,348
-Okay.
-I'll swing it hard too.

1182
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,582
-I'll do it.
-Rock…

1183
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,550
Oh, so you're doing it?

1184
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,018
I'm swinging it with full force.

1185
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:21,986
Go easy on him.

1186
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,554
-I'm going in hard.
-Okay.

1187
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,090
YOU DO IT!
(PASS)

1188
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:28,893
LET WOO-YOUNG DO IT

1189
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,161
NO, YOU DO IT

1190
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,462
HE'LL KNOW IT WAS ME

1191
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,164
NO, HE WON'T!

1192
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,666
WHEN IS THAT BLOW COMING?

1193
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,270
CAN YOU GUESS WHO IT WAS?

1194
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,438
That was a nice one.

1195
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,375
Impressive reflexes, Sae-ho.
You reacted instantly.

1196
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,810
He might get it right.

1197
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:46,944
Judging by the snap…

1198
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,613
I think the blow came from this side.

1199
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,082
The angle couldn't have been ideal
for Sook to have hit me.

1200
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:56,120
Jin-kyung couldn't have adjusted
the force at just the right level.

1201
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,822
So it's either of these two.

1202
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,027
He kept saying he'd handle it,

1203
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:03,928
so he might've done it.

1204
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:04,962
I'll go with Woo-jae.

1205
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,731
HIS CHOICE IS WOO-JAE!

1206
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,301
DID HE WIN THE GAME RIGHT AWAY?

1207
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,669
-You failed.
-Was it Woo-young?

1208
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,671
-I told you, didn't I?
-I'm not telling.

1209
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,940
-I was so close. So close.
-I told you.

1210
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,942
We'd better step up.

1211
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,845
-I'm taking the hammer no matter what.
-Let's be more cautious.

1212
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,048
No exceptions this time.

1213
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,217
I swear I'm going to swing the hammer.

1214
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,055
Hey, I saw that.

1215
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,389
WHIPS AROUND

1216
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,591
Hey, I saw that.

1217
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,658
I SAW IT ALL

1218
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:35,626
I saw his hand move.

1219
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,028
He hit me from this side.

1220
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,397
WHIZZING

1221
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,567
I want to get the footage
of Sae-ho turning around.

1222
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,403
-Can we get a camera here?
-Please let's capture that.

1223
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,205
-It's so scary.
-He gave us a death glare.

1224
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,241
-What should we do?
-Just a minute, Sae-ho.

1225
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,743
-We need to redo this round with a camera.
-Yeah.

1226
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,278
-What?
-One more time.

1227
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,513
Woo-jae.

1228
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,413
-Wrong.
-You failed.

1229
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,515
Really?

1230
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,216
His reaction speed
is nothing like Jin-kyung's.

1231
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,418
Here's how she handled it. A bonk.

1232
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,455
"Ouch! Hey! How could you thrash my ear?"

1233
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,458
-"Hey! You!"
-"Hey! Was it you?"

1234
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,328
That gave us enough time
to pass around the toy hammer.

1235
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,031
Why don't you give me the action cam?
I can hold it.

1236
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,900
-Good idea.
-I loved how his eyes shone.

1237
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,768
Gosh, he scared me so much.

1238
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,303
Really?

1239
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,138
-Okay.
-I'm going to smack him this time.

1240
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,841
Here goes. Rock, paper, scissors.

1241
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:24,742
LET ME DO IT

1242
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,876
Rock, paper, scissors.

1243
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,879
I'm so scared!

1244
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:30,848
WHO BOPPED MY HEAD?

1245
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:31,815
I'm so scared!

1246
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,584
I'm petrified!

1247
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,221
CRACKING UP

1248
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,623
I'm so shaken.

1249
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,758
My gosh.

1250
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,660
-He reacts so quickly.
-Gosh, Sae-ho.

1251
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,694
Jin-kyung.

1252
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:45,529
Jin-kyung.

1253
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,864
Before we move on,

1254
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,666
I should remind you of the rule.

1255
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,100
Same as the previous round,

1256
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,202
you turned around
before I blew the whistle.

1257
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,871
-Wait, but I--
-He has a point.

1258
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,440
-I'm going with Jin-kyung.
-You reacted too quickly.

1259
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,075
-Come on.
-They're not wrong.

1260
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,810
-It's an issue.
-Still, I got it right.

1261
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:00,711
You reacted too quickly.

1262
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,980
If you turn around before the whistle,
it's a foul like offside.

1263
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,316
I turned before the whistle?
Okay, I got it now.

1264
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,152
Do you remember Mr. Suspicion
from when Taec-yeon came on Beat Coin?

1265
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,154
He's just made that face.

1266
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,622
Go ahead and do it, Mr. Suspicion.

1267
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,390
YOU'RE SO SUSPICIOUS

1268
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,125
See? That's the look.

1269
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,827
This time, it's really going to be me.

1270
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,963
Rock, paper, scissors.

1271
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,297
-It's going to be me.
-Okay.

1272
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,865
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

1273
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,200
-He's doing it.
-Yeah.

1274
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,571
That really hurt.

1275
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,074
He does seem startled.

1276
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,375
Jin-kyung.

1277
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,409
What do we do?

1278
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,577
What's your reasoning?

1279
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,511
It hurt like hell.

1280
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,349
-You failed.
-Really?

1281
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,084
Poor Sae-ho.

1282
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,621
-I'll do it.
-Go ahead.

1283
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,626
SWISH

1284
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,027
HEH-HEH

1285
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,030
Dang, this is so tricky.

1286
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,465
His expression is shifting.

1287
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,833
He's got amazing reflexes, though.

1288
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:59,069
He now looks more like,
"Please help me out here."

1289
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,305
Someone passed the hammer
after hitting me.

1290
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,944
Jin-kyung.

1291
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,613
-Why me again?
-You failed.

1292
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,281
Why do you stick with her?

1293
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,150
Because it's so difficult. I'm confused.

1294
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,790
WHAT WAS THAT JUST NOW?

1295
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:20,758
Woo-young.

1296
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,394
Tell us your reasoning.

1297
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,294
CULPRIT

1298
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,295
That's what my gut says.

1299
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,531
-You failed.
-I'm losing my mind here.

1300
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,107
Jin-kyung.

1301
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,275
WRONG!

1302
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,745
-Woo-young.
-That's correct.

1303
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,013
-You passed!
-Okay!

1304
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,350
FINALLY A SUCCESS IN ROUND 7!

1305
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,818
That was hilarious.

1306
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,053
But it's so tricky.

1307
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,020
It is indeed.

1308
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,523
Hey, Jin-kyung. You're in first place.

1309
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:54,992
WHO COULD'VE GUESSED?
JIN-KYUNG IS INDEED IN THE LEAD

1310
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,860
-I'm bonking him no matter what.
-Okay.

1311
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,996
-Yeah, you should do it.
-No matter what.

1312
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:01,398
My gosh!

1313
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:03,567
SPOOKED

1314
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:04,935
-I'm doing it.
-Don't get scared.

1315
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,377
You won't even turn around?

1316
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,013
Way to put a guy in a crappy mood.

1317
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,548
IT'S WORSE THAN HE THOUGHT

1318
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,616
-It's just…
-You should still turn around.

1319
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,018
It hurts pretty badly.

1320
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,020
-Jin-kyung.
-You failed.

1321
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,723
Jin-kyung should deal the blow.

1322
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,591
Do it, Jin-kyung.

1323
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,095
YOU DO IT, SOOK

1324
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:32,963
SCRAMBLING

1325
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,565
HEH

1326
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:39,570
It was Sae-ho, right?

1327
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:40,471
CONVINCED

1328
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:41,672
You failed.

1329
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,573
He's quick.

1330
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,841
IT WASN'T HIM?!

1331
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,909
YOU POOR FOOL

1332
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,711
-But he looked so guilty.
-It wasn't me.

1333
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,779
-Sae-ho.
-It wasn't me.

1334
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:50,547
I mean it.

1335
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,216
-We're not lying to you.
-Of course not.

1336
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:53,951
That wouldn't do.

1337
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,652
ROUND 3!

1338
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:03,427
WHO BOPPED MY HEAD?

1339
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,767
NERVOUS

1340
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,202
Woo-jae.

1341
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:13,837
Your reasoning, please.

1342
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,839
When I turned around,

1343
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:20,144
I didn't get the sense
that these two did anything.

1344
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,479
So the culprit has to be among these two.

1345
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,413
That's for sure.

1346
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,582
And the bop came at a steep angle.

1347
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,884
You'll get 12 bops today.

1348
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,553
THE CULPRIT WAS SOOK

1349
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,687
You failed.

1350
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:31,822
BOP NO. 4

1351
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,056
WHAT WAS THAT?

1352
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,691
I got it wrong?

1353
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:38,362
WAS THAT A BOP JUST NOW?

1354
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:39,930
Jin-kyung.

1355
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:41,999
You failed.

1356
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,171
-Sae-ho.
-You failed!

1357
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,539
BOP NO. 6

1358
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:49,673
Jin-kyung.

1359
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,175
Jin-kyung.

1360
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,276
You failed!

1361
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,644
EVEN A BLIND GUESS HAS A 25% CHANCE

1362
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,545
BOP NO. 7

1363
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,479
Sook.

1364
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,680
Sook.

1365
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,815
Sook!

1366
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:58,882
You failed.

1367
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,918
HOW CAN HE BE SO UNLUCKY?

1368
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,819
BOP NO. 8

1369
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:02,886
Sook!

1370
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,555
You failed.

1371
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,524
THE TOY HAMMER PASSED AWAY

1372
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,826
It broke.

1373
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,394
ALL TOGETHER THIS TIME

1374
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,295
BOP NO. 9

1375
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,667
TAKE A GUESS

1376
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,504
You look so funny.

1377
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,006
Sae-ho.

1378
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,942
We did it together this time.

1379
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,109
Dang it.

1380
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:27,945
What round are we in now?

1381
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,813
-What round are we in?
-It's the ninth one.

1382
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,081
It's the ninth round.

1383
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,883
You'll get 12 bops today.

1384
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,084
THIS MAY COME TRUE

1385
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,120
BOP NO. 10

1386
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:43,227
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GOT IT RIGHT

1387
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,397
IT WAS ME

1388
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:48,398
Sae-ho.

1389
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,168
You failed.

1390
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,472
BOP NO. 11

1391
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,008
Sae-ho.

1392
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:58,909
That is correct!

1393
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:00,911
FINALLY!

1394
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,346
I didn't bonk you that many times.

1395
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,648
-It was hilarious.
-Let's do our best with Woo-jae's game.

1396
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,549
So funny.

1397
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,351
Let's get some good bits
from Woo-jae's rounds.

1398
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,952
-Move forward.
-He's got good instincts.

1399
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:09,987
It was so difficult.

1400
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,755
I'm looking forward to this round.

1401
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:12,656
I'll go first.

1402
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,724
-Sure.
-Okay, Sook.

1403
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,058
-I'm going first.
-All right.

1404
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:16,627
-Go ahead.
-Can I?

1405
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,595
-Okay, you can go first. No, can I?
-Sure.

1406
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,398
Woo-jae's too smart, though.
Why don't we do it together?

1407
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,133
Any ideas? Who's our best bet?

1408
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,035
-How about a group effort?
-Okay, let's do it.

1409
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,970
-When the timing is right…
-You can do it, Sook.

1410
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,842
Sook.

1411
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,943
Your reasoning, please.

1412
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,877
I saw her do it.

1413
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:34,778
You did?

1414
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:35,913
I've got quick eyes.

1415
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,547
He sure is something else.

1416
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,783
When I turned around, I saw Sook…

1417
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,918
Thanks to my great vision,

1418
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,354
I could see Sook in slow motion.
She bonked me, shifted to one side,

1419
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,656
and passed the hammer to Jin-kyung…

1420
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,457
-I do feel bad about this.
-…who gave it to Sae-ho.

1421
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,027
-It means he understood my pattern.
-He's really something else.

1422
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,595
-You have a point.
-How do you do it?

1423
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:52,863
-You failed.
-Yes, you did.

1424
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,832
You're no better than us.

1425
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,770
ROUND 2

1426
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:01,538
I'll do it.

1427
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,114
Sook.

1428
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,849
-Your reasoning?
-Again?

1429
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:13,850
My dynamic vision.

1430
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,852
-He's like a bullet.
-I'll tell you more.

1431
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,555
She threw the toy hammer
before pulling her hand away.

1432
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,457
I happened to see her doing it.

1433
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,491
My apologies.

1434
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,061
You failed.

1435
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,929
-Yeah, you did.
-I failed?

1436
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,464
Sook should bonk him this time.

1437
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,665
-Okay.
-All right.

1438
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,167
You should actually do it, Sook.

1439
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,803
-I'll do it.
-I think he wants you to be the one.

1440
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,015
A SOLID POKER FACE

1441
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,985
You're the only smart person
on our team, Woo-jae.

1442
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,453
What should we do now?

1443
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,023
How comical.

1444
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,324
What should we do?

1445
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,859
I ended up hitting him too hard. My bad.

1446
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,427
Sook.

1447
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,029
HE'S UNWAVERING

1448
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,030
Your reasoning, please.

1449
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,532
-Did you see her do it?
-It was powerful.

1450
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,036
Was it, now?

1451
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,337
FEELING PROUD

1452
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,939
-This is fun.
-You got that right,

1453
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,007
but you failed!

1454
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,642
-This is hilarious.
-Next up is your fourth round.

1455
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,845
HE'S ALREADY IN ROUND 4

1456
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,646
Why don't I do it?

1457
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:17,748
I'll do it.

1458
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:18,915
Three, two, one.

1459
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,550
I'll do it. It was me.

1460
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,953
-Three, two, one.
-I'll do it. It was me.

1461
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,188
-Three, two, one.
-I'll do it. It was me.

1462
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:31,361
BLACKS OUT

1463
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,463
My gosh. You know what?

1464
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,665
When you actually see this episode,

1465
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,835
your blood might boil.

1466
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:40,837
You have to see how it all happened.

1467
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,939
I get it now that I'm back here
on the couch.

1468
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:44,007
TUNE IN AND GET THE RUSH

1469
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:45,876
-Jin-kyung.
-My gosh.

1470
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,577
Your reasoning, please.

1471
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:48,979
It's because…

1472
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,781
it was a sting rather than a bop.

1473
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:56,420
Someone pecked the back of my head
like a bee attacking with its stinger.

1474
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,523
Jin-kyung is the only person
who could've managed it.

1475
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,793
Your answer was Jin-kyung.

1476
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:03,827
That's correct.

1477
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,861
Which round were we in?

1478
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,596
-The fourth one.
-Did it hurt?

1479
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,632
Not really. It was like a sting.

1480
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,700
LEADING BY CLEARING THE MISSION IN ROUND 4

1481
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,602
Currently, Woo-jae is in first place.

1482
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,037
-Jin-kyung's in second place.
-I'm next.

1483
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,206
-Woo-jae leads by a landslide.
-Is Woo-young in fourth place?

1484
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,208
Here's an idea.

1485
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,510
We'll let Sook take first place.

1486
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,746
But instead, we'll hit her
with everything we've got.

1487
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,081
Come on, don't do that.

1488
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,216
-Let's take a turn each.
-How could we hit her?

1489
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,784
Fine.

1490
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,319
Just how?

1491
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,721
-There's a way to throw her off.
-I couldn't do it.

1492
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,491
She couldn't even guess who it is
if we base it on Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1493
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,726
-I could never hit her.
-Just do it.

1494
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,729
-I could never hit her.
-Just do it.

1495
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,432
-I could never hit her.
-Just do it.

1496
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:48,705
Sae-ho.

1497
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,708
I know it was you.

1498
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,609
What's your reasoning?

1499
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:55,879
It was him.

1500
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:57,914
-That is correct.
-Hot damn!

1501
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,350
How did you know?

1502
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,385
You hit me right after saying,
"I could never hit her."

1503
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,921
You made it so obvious.

1504
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,823
-Did I really do that?
-Yeah.

1505
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,258
"I could never hit her." Bonk!

1506
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,826
What a dumb thing to do.

1507
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,162
Anyone could've realized it was you.

1508
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,530
-Did I really do that?
-Sure!

1509
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,333
I DID THAT? REALLY?

1510
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,434
He did lay it on thick.

1511
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,302
"I couldn't do it.
I could never hit her." Bonk!

1512
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,405
Who does that?

1513
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,741
Did I really do that?

1514
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,610
After about 25 years
of working in this industry?

1515
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:27,777
THE VETERAN COMEDIAN'S MISTAKE

1516
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,446
Anyone could've known it was you.

1517
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:30,480
So I thought it must be him.

1518
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,616
I apologize. I thought
my acting was flawless.

1519
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,018
It might've worked if he had said it once.

1520
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,653
But he kept at it. "How could we hit her?"

1521
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,754
"I couldn't do it."

1522
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,889
"I could never hit her!"

1523
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,526
You made it super obvious.
Who wouldn't get it?

1524
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:43,426
Check the footage.

1525
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,628
"How could we hit her?"

1526
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,663
"I couldn't do it. I could never hit her!"

1527
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,964
MOCKERY ON REPEAT

1528
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,367
You're not so far
from hitting the 30th year milestone.

1529
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,702
He got so worked up…

1530
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,271
-I'm sorry, but please leave.
-…by himself.

1531
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,674
-I could never hit her.
-Just do it.

1532
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,343
TIMING ASIDE, HE LOOKS SO GUILTY

1533
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,244
Sae-ho.

1534
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,046
Hang on.

1535
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:07,384
-Do we win points on a sliding scale?
-Yes, for every game.

1536
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,019
So Sook won five points.

1537
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,854
-Woo-jae won four points.
-Four.

1538
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,756
That's how it goes. Who's in fifth place?

1539
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,191
-Me.
-Woo-young won one point.

1540
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,292
-One point?
-That's how it is.

1541
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,426
A DISSATISFIED GROAN

1542
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,828
Okay, I'm content.
Four points aren't too shabby.

1543
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,965
That concludes Who Bopped My Head,

1544
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,267
with Sook taking first place.

1545
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,335
-Congrats.
-Let's keep it up.

1546
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,003
WHO BOPPED MY HEAD?
WINNER: SOOK

1547
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,805
Dang, I made a critical mistake.

1548
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,941
AS THE PRIZE,
SOOK GOT THE CERAMIC COFFEE FILTER

1549
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,009
Jin-kyung had her eye
on that coffee filter.

1550
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,844
-Congrats.
-She can take it.

1551
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,848
ONE HOUR LATER

1552
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,722
WE DON'T GET WHY HE ALMOST LAUGHED,
BUT HE MANAGED TO REIN IT IN
