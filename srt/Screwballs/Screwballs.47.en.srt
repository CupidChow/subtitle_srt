00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,203
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:08,808
I am truly thankful to be able to give you
a New Year's greeting in 2026.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,610
Happy New Year.

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,278
Happy New Year.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,080
TO OUR VIEWERS, HAPPY NEW YEAR

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,815
We don't see Woo-young in the studio.

7
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,384
I heard that he is very sick.

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,552
Why don't we do our own opening for now?

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,256
I don't think Woo-young can return.

10
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,158
We have prepared
a group Deconstruction Show.

11
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,460
From now, you'll go into the bath

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,362
and reveal your true selves thoroughly.

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,530
For real?

14
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,366
<i>We were going to do</i>
<i>an upgraded Dancing Bunny Game.</i>

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,969
THE HOT BUNNY CLUB

16
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,004
TURNED UP THE HEAT IN THE HOT TUB

17
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,842
THE CHAOTIC PARTY

18
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,277
This won't work.

19
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,311
THEY CAN'T GO ON WITH THE GAME

20
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,479
<i>Sense the Bucket.</i>

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>The more buckets you get poured on,</i>
<i>the more points you will lose.</i>

22
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,550
Ready, go.

23
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,684
Stop.

24
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,053
Five buckets.

25
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,189
HERE COMES THE BIG ONE

26
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,191
<i>Announcing the first place</i>
<i>with the combined points</i>

27
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,360
from Dancing Bunny and Sense the Bucket.

28
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,394
It's Woo-jae.

29
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,362
WOO-JAE CAME IN 1ST

30
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,664
The three of you will
become body scrubbers

31
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,067
and lay the winner Woo-jae

32
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,369
on the body scrubbing bed

33
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,604
<i>to provide the high-end body scrubbing</i>

34
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,173
<i>from head to toe.</i>

35
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,607
I see dead skin cells.

36
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,809
This is humiliating!

37
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,677
This is really a deconstruction show.

38
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,947
WHAT IS THE NEXT
GROUP DECONSTRUCTION SHOW?

39
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,917
WASHING UP FOR THE NEW YEAR IS DONE!

40
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,120
NOW, IT'S TIME TO DRESS UP

41
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,359
THE SECOND SEGMENT
OF THE GROUP DECONSTRUCTION SHOW

42
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,296
WHY ARE ALL THESE VIBRANT COLORS HERE?

43
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,231
I haven't seen this in ages.

44
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,600
-Isn't this the personal color thing?
-Yeah, it is.

45
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,168
I've never done it before.

46
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,738
Do we do this by ourselves,

47
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,675
-or will someone help us?
-Those things must have made you wonder.

48
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,544
You can tell that
these weren't prepared by our staff.

49
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,913
-A professional?
-It was from a professional.

50
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,881
-I see.
-Yes.

51
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,218
Since we scrubbed off
all the dead skin cells for the New Year

52
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,354
and happened to be here
without any make up on…

53
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,989
-That's not true.
-What?

54
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,257
-It's not my bare face.
-Really?

55
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,292
-I have makeup on.
-Me too.

56
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,360
I don't.

57
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,896
-The basics are okay.
-But the faces that the public see

58
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,165
typically always have the basics applied…

59
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,399
-Right.
-…so this is right.

60
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,803
This time, we are going to
perform a personal color analysis on you

61
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,638
where we deconstruct your bare face

62
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,274
and uncover your true colors.

63
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,509
-Deconstruction.
-I'm curious.

64
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,944
Then, we will invite her in now.

65
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,448
We invited someone who is
very famous in the industry.

66
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,684
Please welcome
Personal Visual Director Hwang Si-yeon.

67
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,987
-Welcome.
-Hello.

68
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:34,988
DOES COLOR BRANDING STUDIO
CEO HWANG SI-YEON

69
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,657
We should greet you more formally.

70
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,226
-It's okay.
-Please forgive us for looking this way.

71
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,562
You're wearing the personal color outfits.

72
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,030
You're dressed perfectly for it.

73
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,532
It's like a blank sheet of paper.

74
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,200
-Yes, that's right.
-Exactly.

75
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,568
Please introduce yourself.

76
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:53,373
Hello, my name is Hwang Si-yeon
and I'm a personal color visual director.

77
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,875
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

78
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,445
Can you briefly explain
what personal color means?

79
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:03,583
Personal color analysis is
about harmonizing

80
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,520
a person's natural eye color,
hair color, and skin tone

81
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,322
to discover their unique colors.

82
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,758
Most people think all they need
is to whiten their skin,

83
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,059
but that's absolutely wrong.

84
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,628
It's like a famous painting.

85
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,830
One has to find
what colors harmonize with them.

86
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,833
Even the white color that you're wearing
has warm and cool tones…

87
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,103
-Right.
-…and the black has warm and cool tones.

88
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,005
We're going to
check that out in detail too.

89
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:30,210
Those colors will then be classified
into spring, summer, fall, and winter.

90
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,179
-But we live in an era of individuality.
-Yes, that's right.

91
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,448
Do we only have to look for
clothes that suit us?

92
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,549
No, not at all.

93
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,884
Once you know what suits you,

94
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,120
-you can use that as a standard to decide.
-I see. We're setting a standard.

95
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,958
Once you know that, you have
a better chance of succeeding in styling.

96
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,060
-You control that.
-If we know our personal color,

97
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,795
do we stand out more?

98
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,698
You do stand out more.
Also, it isn't just personal colors,

99
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,834
<i>but we'll analyze your body type</i>
<i>and image today too.</i>

100
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,936
Even if you know two out of those three…

101
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,004
Can you find out

102
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,106
-if designer labels suit us too?
-Of course.

103
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,441
LOOKING OVER

104
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,944
Get rid of everything
that doesn't suit you.

105
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:05,845
Let's give it a shot.

106
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,046
Let's give it a try first.

107
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:12,385
Are there any members
who dress in a way that suits them?

108
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,220
-Well…
-They all dress well though.

109
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,224
The person who surprised me
while I was monitoring for this

110
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,959
was Woo-jae.

111
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,527
Why was she surprised by that?

112
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,730
-She was very surprised.
-Why was she surprised?

113
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:24,731
Hear her out.

114
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,900
Isn't it obvious though?

115
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,271
Woo-jae had a lot of photos
on his Instagram,

116
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,273
but I went through all of them.

117
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,775
There weren't any worst looks
even when I reached the end.

118
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,311
All of them were his best looks,
to be honest.

119
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,346
-So--
-I don't need compliments.

120
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,547
This is just…

121
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,116
Okay. Please continue.

122
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,784
One thing I would like to point out

123
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,220
is that you should still try new things.

124
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,254
-I don't do that.
-No.

125
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:52,258
I know what looks best on me,

126
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,994
-so I kind of stay in that safe zone.
-Yes.

127
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,497
-Then, shall we begin the analysis?
-Yes.

128
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,798
Who's going first?

129
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,000
I already know my colors,
so I'll go first.

130
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,435
-Shall we do that?
-It's <i>Obangsaek</i>.

131
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,037
MINE ARE THE FIVE COLORS OF KOREA

132
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,371
Shall we give it a try?

133
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,307
Ms. Hwang, I was wondering…

134
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,776
When you see videos
of personal color analyses,

135
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,046
they show similar colors
in cool and warm tones

136
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,448
and the tone of their face
really does change, right?

137
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,317
You add an effect to do that, don't you?

138
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,751
Gosh. No.

139
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,353
Not at all.

140
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,421
Do you use CGI?

141
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,922
When you watch how…

142
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,324
You see, Jin-kyung,

143
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,092
you look the same. From here…

144
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,126
Are you sleepy?

145
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,429
She played in the water.

146
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,364
-Because I played in the water.
-You're sleepy?

147
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,534
NO WONDER, SHE WAS HAVING A LOT OF FUN

148
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,870
Firstly, when you test
whether you're a warm or cool tone,

149
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,739
you differentiate the colors too.

150
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,542
But you're supposed to
go from warm to cool

151
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,776
like this.

152
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,979
It is more accurate to
remove the yellow hue from the color.

153
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,014
Let me show you.

154
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,450
We'll check her warm and cool tone.

155
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,151
This side is the warm tone.

156
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,586
And this is the cool tone.

157
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,587
-Cool tone.
-Right?

158
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,289
-Warm.
-I'm cool tone.

159
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,790
The yellow hue increased a bit.

160
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,625
-Her complexion changes.
-Can you see it?

161
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,927
I'm definitely cool tone.

162
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,029
When it goes to a warm tone,
your face turns yellow.

163
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:03,930
Shall we try warm?

164
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,098
Your face turns yellow.

165
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,299
YELLOW

166
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,633
-Let's try with more yellow.
-Hey.

167
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,802
Is it changing because
of my facial expression?

168
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,204
Shall we try another color?

169
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,339
-Warm.
-Warm.

170
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,407
-Cool.
-Cool.

171
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,043
Can you see that her eyes look clearer?

172
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,479
Strangely, when it goes to warm…

173
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,115
-Her face turns yellow.
-…you look kind of sad.

174
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,217
When it goes to cool,
you look more refreshed.

175
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,885
-That's right.
-I'm definitely cool tone.

176
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,155
The truth is, we are choosing colors
that make your eyes stand out,

177
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,189
not brightening the face.

178
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,959
This side even makes her look shorter.

179
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,527
-She's small though.
-This is yellow.

180
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,828
SHE DIDN'T HEAR HIM

181
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,530
This is cool. You can see the difference.

182
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,998
-I'm cool-toned.
-Yes.

183
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,433
I'm definitely cool-toned.

184
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,667
It could be

185
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,770
-the colors too.
-I look great in <i>Obangsaek</i>.

186
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,039
Since it could be the color itself,

187
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,941
-let's try it with white.
-Oh, my.

188
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:49,876
-Warm.
-Warm.

189
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,777
-Warm.
-Cool.

190
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,612
-Definitely…
-She's cool-toned.

191
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,746
Yeah,

192
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,349
<i>I definitely look lame</i>
<i>when you go to this side.</i>

193
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,385
Since we analyzed using fabric,

194
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,788
let's use these boards now.

195
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,456
This is interesting.

196
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,491
Let's check it out with these.

197
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,559
TA-DA

198
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,960
This is the first one.

199
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,496
LOOKING COY

200
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,898
Like this.

201
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,100
This looks nice.

202
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,569
-This looks much better.
-Right? Better than the one before.

203
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,571
-How pretty.
-Your face brightened up.

204
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,706
Can you tell that
she looks prettier with this one?

205
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,909
-Doesn't this part stand out too much?
-Yes.

206
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,343
It isn't harmonious.

207
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,611
This is a cool tone.

208
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,646
You're cool-toned.

209
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,714
You look so good in this cool tone.

210
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,615
WINTER COOL, AUTUMN WARM

211
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,817
-This one's brighter.
-Yes.

212
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,619
-She looks too intense in this one.
-Is this <i>Obangsaek</i>?

213
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,955
This is chicer than <i>Obangsaek</i>.

214
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,457
You were a city girl.

215
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,193
Yeah, I'm more of a city than you think.

216
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,029
BUT WHAT SHE PREFERS IS OBANGSAEK

217
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,398
Now, let's really get started.

218
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,066
We haven't really started yet?

219
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,235
-Let's take a look at these color fabrics.
-Okay.

220
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,170
Red, yellow…

221
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,071
Not orange.

222
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,040
Green isn't for you.

223
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,608
No. Is that for surgery?

224
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,010
What is that? Am I getting a colonoscopy?

225
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,280
Blue looks rather good on you.

226
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,215
Is it a surgical gown?

227
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,150
Can you lean back a little?

228
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,218
Blue looks good on you.

229
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,920
But this one is a warm-toned blue.

230
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,422
Let's see the cool blue with it.

231
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,191
Cool blue? Hey, this is my favorite color.

232
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,559
-Cool blue.
-I like this color.

233
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,460
Warm blue.

234
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,998
This blue gives the impression
that it's pushing away the face.

235
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,967
If you want to look more natural,

236
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,668
-this one's better.
-I have this color.

237
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,769
THE COOL BLUE GOES WELL
WITH HER COMPLEXION

238
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,137
You're definitely cool-toned.

239
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,206
Let's try again. These are autumn colors.

240
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,041
I don't have any of these colors at home.

241
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,543
-They really don't suit you.
-Geez.

242
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,113
SHE LOOKS DISGUSTED

243
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,315
Hang on. Hang on.

244
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,418
When we sit there,
should we be making faces like this

245
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,753
when it doesn't suit us

246
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,321
and smile when it suits us?

247
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,257
I don't like these colors though.

248
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,626
I don't have any clothes
in this color at home.

249
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,094
For Sook,

250
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,729
colors aren't the issue.

251
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,764
You look good in vibrant colors.

252
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,199
Whether it's <i>Obangsaek</i> or urban…

253
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,602
-You need a drop of vibrant colors.
-Okay.

254
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,839
-But you dress too much in wood colors.
-Earth colors.

255
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,807
Those colors don't suit you.

256
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,243
Let's mix in some dark colors to that.

257
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,178
Dark colors.

258
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,680
I like colors like these too.

259
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,582
These colors suit you too.

260
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,717
-Purple suits you very well.
-I like these colors.

261
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,219
-Purple looks good.
-I like them all.

262
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,187
Sexy colors suit you.

263
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,124
But colors that are too warm-toned

264
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,592
make you look bloated.

265
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,061
Rather than that,
the wine color we saw earlier

266
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,362
-looks good on you.
-I like it.

267
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,430
That one looks good.

268
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,498
-I like it.
-Looks good.

269
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,199
-Yes.
-This is fascinating.

270
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,069
In terms of personal colors,
you definitely have one.

271
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,671
Now I'll move on to the next step,

272
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,573
and these fabrics differ in thickness.

273
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,308
You'll find out whether

274
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,510
you should dress in
light fabric or heavy fabric.

275
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,079
Let's check dynamic patterns first.

276
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,348
Don't think of these as cherries

277
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,150
but think of them as moving around.

278
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,084
I think it suits me.

279
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,619
Personally, I don't like it.

280
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,089
It's like you're wearing a tablecloth.

281
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,726
-The next one is a static pattern.
-Okay.

282
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,595
Static and dynamic.

283
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,663
Rather than a pattern
that's moving around,

284
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,232
-you look better with the static pattern.
-Yeah.

285
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,133
You're right.

286
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,136
Rather than dress up in gaudy styles,

287
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,005
you should wear static and neat patterns.

288
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,573
Like the way I'm dressed today.

289
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,508
The neat style suits you much better.

290
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,211
Certain patterns suit me more.
This one's much better.

291
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,879
-Yes, definitely.
-Yeah.

292
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,848
Shall we go with tweed which is heavier?

293
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,617
I don't like pink.

294
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,721
-Tweed doesn't look bad on you.
-Really?

295
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,622
It's static.

296
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,223
Was it when Sook

297
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,626
-did the blind date episode?
-This pink is okay.

298
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,529
Didn't she wear an outfit
that looked similar to that?

299
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,697
SHE PULLED IT OFF PERFECTLY

300
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,699
Yes, this is it.

301
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,707
HER EYES OPEN WIDE

302
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,242
WOO-HOO

303
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,579
TURNS INTO A SLY FOX WITH ONE FABRIC

304
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,180
It suits you very well though.

305
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,715
She looks like a loan shark.

306
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,717
This is another tweed.

307
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,987
FROSTY

308
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,590
-How dignified.
-Yes, it's tweed.

309
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,158
-I love this.
-But I think

310
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,861
-this one looks prettier than that.
-It does.

311
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,597
-It is dignified.
-This one is too flashy,

312
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,032
so it takes away from your face.

313
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,333
-This one is neat.
-It's neat.

314
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,103
-It would be nice if you wore this.
-I don't have anything like this at home.

315
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,872
I only have black clothes.

316
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,740
Even when I watch your YouTube show,

317
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,677
you always wear black-rimmed glasses
and a black hoodie.

318
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,512
-Yeah, they're all black.
-Yeah.

319
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,413
They're all black.

320
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,515
It would be a shame
to only wear that color.

321
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,416
Yeah.

322
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,384
Hey, it's <i>Obangsaek.</i>

323
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,386
I love these so much!

324
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,721
I don't think he'll come back!

325
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,056
I don't think he'll come back.

326
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,858
I think there's going to be a blood bath.

327
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:33,893
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE KNOWS HER STUFF

328
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,863
I don't think you're in a position
to worry about someone else.

329
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,132
I look good in <i>Obangsaek.</i>

330
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,468
-How unusual.
-How unusual.

331
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,570
Most people avoid those colors.

332
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,006
She has colors that suit her.
That's the worst.

333
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,875
How depressing.

334
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,444
My face looks muted with these.

335
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,079
It definitely looks different.

336
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,313
How fascinating.

337
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,215
This is your best image.

338
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,416
Tweed. Like me.

339
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,051
You have to wear tweed.

340
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,753
-It really suits you.
-You'll look great.

341
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,389
But Sook doesn't like tweed.
She likes that.

342
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,290
WHOO-HOO

343
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,958
SOOK PREFERS THIS SIDE

344
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,326
That's the worst.

345
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,529
MAY DIFFER FROM YOUR OWN PREFERENCE

346
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,864
These really suit you.

347
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,766
These are definitely shaman colors.

348
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,434
I look great in <i>Obangsaek.</i>

349
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,271
SOOK'S ANALYSIS ENDS

350
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,706
-Then, shall I go?
-Okay.

351
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,141
Sure.

352
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,176
-Have you done this before?
-Not even once.

353
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,546
I think he'll have
many colors that suit him.

354
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,681
Woo-jae is--

355
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,417
I bet my colors are pretty limited too.

356
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,753
-Is Woo-jae kind of dark?
-Yes.

357
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,588
-Right?
-I'm rather dark.

358
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,756
Warm tone may suit him.

359
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,658
This time, since you say
you have dark skin,

360
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,628
let me measure your face
with a colorimeter.

361
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,797
-There's a thing called a colorimeter.
-Really?

362
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,166
We can check his skin tone with this.

363
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,234
Let's try.

364
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,936
Do you think you have
a yellow hue to your skin?

365
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,304
Or is it redder?

366
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,940
I think it's more red
even though I don't drink.

367
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:56,942
What is that?

368
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,511
What's that?

369
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,446
If I put it against his skin like this,

370
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,514
it shows us the color.

371
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,616
Let me check your forehead too.

372
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,551
But he is kind of…

373
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,919
Your forehead is very tanned.

374
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,122
<i>Your forehead and cheek.</i>

375
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,291
-<i>It's that different?</i>
-<i>It's darker.</i>

376
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,659
Your skin isn't red,

377
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,060
but it can look drained.

378
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,929
That's right.
That's why people always ask me,

379
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,798
"Why do you look so tired?"

380
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,167
-You have to wear a pink base.
-I'm not tired though.

381
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,936
Yeah, his face does look rather pale.

382
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,672
STARTING WOO-JAE'S ANALYSIS

383
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,573
Let's see.

384
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,341
This is the warm tone.

385
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,877
Warm doesn't suit you.

386
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,978
Neither one suits me.

387
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,313
-Warm tone.
-What's going on?

388
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,781
None of them suit you.

389
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:37,950
-Ew.
-Ew.

390
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,119
This one suits him less
than the warm or cool.

391
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,987
The ones with faded colors

392
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,923
<i>look duller to me.</i>

393
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,658
<i>None of them suit him.</i>

394
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,127
Cool tone. Here's another color.

395
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,829
Your face looks so yellow with this one.

396
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,463
-Yeah.
-When she put those on me…

397
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,865
Your face looked…

398
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,800
-My face didn't just have a yellow hue.
-It was yellow.

399
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,135
It was just yellow.

400
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,703
How fascinating.

401
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,672
-Let's try blue.
-I think this will suit him.

402
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,340
That's the complementary color of yellow.

403
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,042
This one has less yellow. This is warm.

404
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:03,943
-Not for you.
-No.

405
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,578
This one's cool.

406
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,013
-He's cool-toned too.
-Warm and cool.

407
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,315
<i>I think this suits him so well.</i>

408
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,217
-<i>He's cool-toned.</i>
-<i>Cool tone.</i>

409
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,285
Rather than mixing in gray,

410
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,654
-stick to clean colors.
-Your face looks grim

411
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,423
-when you wear gray.
-Yeah.

412
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,859
But he hasn't found
a color that suits him yet.

413
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,028
-It's white. This will suit him.
-This is white.

414
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,330
How strange.

415
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,333
Why doesn't anything suit him?

416
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,469
Why don't we let Woo-jae get some sleep?

417
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,537
What about this?

418
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,706
This one is really the worst.

419
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,840
His face turns gray.

420
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,977
Rather than that,
the cool white looks much better.

421
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,979
<i>You seem to already know your colors.</i>

422
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,414
I'm going to lie down next to Woo-young.

423
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,217
-That may be better for me.
-Right?

424
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,753
-Why doesn't…
-Finding a personal color isn't the issue.

425
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,689
Why does his face look…

426
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,291
Why does he look like that?

427
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,293
DRAINED

428
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,662
Can you put your face through this?
This one's warm.

429
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,164
Wait. Does it suit him?

430
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,532
I look yellow.

431
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,768
WINTER COOL

432
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,169
-This one's better.
-Less yellow.

433
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,238
-It's much better.
-He's cool-toned too.

434
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,440
Most people who work at offices

435
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,676
call this the "going home early" look.

436
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,611
-When they want to look sick…
-Hey.

437
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,079
You look really sick.

438
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,881
Boss,

439
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,083
my stomach isn't feeling well.

440
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,518
-Seriously.
-Definitely.

441
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,553
When you're doing a presentation,
use clean colors.

442
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,521
For presentations.

443
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,823
The presentation that I prepared

444
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,891
-is this.
-Much better.

445
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,027
It'll determine our company's future.

446
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,528
He looks totally different.

447
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,263
-I must be cool-toned.
-You're totally cool-toned.

448
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,766
Let's see.

449
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,801
Cool-toned pink. Doesn't suit you.

450
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,936
Red doesn't suit you.

451
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,604
I don't have any red clothes.

452
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,406
Pink looks better than red though.

453
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,440
Pink doesn't suit you.

454
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,275
<i>Between pink and red, red is the worst.</i>

455
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,110
<i>Red is the worst.</i>

456
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,445
Yellow doesn't suit you either.

457
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,314
Green doesn't suit you. No way.

458
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,082
-Why don't they suit you?
-Blue either.

459
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,417
No.

460
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,452
-Why don't they suit you?
-Not this one either.

461
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,521
-No.
-What the heck?

462
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,989
-This one's okay.
-It suits him.

463
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,190
Pink isn't bad.

464
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:03,028
I've been wearing clothes
that suit me well up until now, haven't I?

465
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,830
You can live only wearing black.

466
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,733
-You don't need colors.
-He dresses himself very well.

467
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,201
None of those colors suited him.

468
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,104
I wear a lot of colors other than black.

469
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,238
And they

470
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,241
-look okay on me too.
-What she's holding now suits him.

471
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,377
This one? I think this may be the best.

472
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,412
Let me do the worst one. The warm tone.

473
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,715
Don't people usually do the best one?

474
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,283
-The worst?
-The worst.

475
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,417
Let's see the vivid colors.

476
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,385
HERE COMES THE WORST

477
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,519
Yikes.

478
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,656
THE JEERS ERUPT SIMULTANEOUSLY

479
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,791
What the heck is that?

480
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,093
It's the same vivid as before.

481
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
But these are warm tones.

482
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,428
-Those were cool.
-Hang on.

483
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,297
Did you see a monster or something?

484
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,199
Look at your own face.

485
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,301
-Look at your face against orange.
-Orange?

486
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,202
Here's orange.

487
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,604
Look at your face against orange.

488
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:47,940
SPITTING

489
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,509
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

490
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,511
I hate the way I look in the mirror.

491
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,546
Geez. What the heck?

492
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,382
-No.
-Why don't any of them suit him?

493
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,684
-No. None of the colors suit him.
-Oh, my gosh.

494
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,651
Nothing suits him.

495
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,020
You shouldn't hang out with him.

496
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,455
-This is what you should know.
-No vivid colors.

497
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,957
You have to know that

498
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,459
-I put a lot of thought into how I dress.
-You dress well.

499
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,094
I consider so many things.

500
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,630
Shall we see?

501
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,266
-These are winter dark tones.
-Dark?

502
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,568
-It suits you!
-These look the best on you.

503
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,771
If he adds a bit of yellow-- Oh, my gosh.

504
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,439
Oh, my gosh.

505
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,308
It suits you.

506
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,944
You look different.

507
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,347
-You look different.
-This suits me.

508
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,281
Yes.

509
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,249
It suits you so well.

510
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,150
FLIPPING THROUGH THEM AGAIN

511
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,118
-This looks good on you.
-Navy blue suits you.

512
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,054
-This suits you.
-This one suits you too.

513
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,124
He poses only when the colors suit him.

514
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,160
-Navy blue suits him well.
-Yes.

515
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,961
Gosh, he's incredible.

516
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,864
-Show us the worst.
-Any bright colors?

517
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,400
-What's the worst?
-We did the worst earlier.

518
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,736
-Let me show you the even worst one.
-Show us.

519
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,938
These are truly…

520
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,408
TOTAL MISMATCH

521
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,476
From earlier…

522
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,079
GIVES HIMSELF A "DISLIKE"

523
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,983
-My goodness. Geez.
-What tone is this?

524
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,853
-These are strong colors. Primary colors.
-Primary colors.

525
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,989
Is there any benefit
if these colors suit you?

526
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,460
<i>If these colors suit you, you can</i>
<i>style yourself in a way that stands out.</i>

527
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,328
I want to try those colors.

528
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,298
And so… What is the bottom line?

529
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,134
-Nothing suits me?
-You just have to wear black.

530
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,436
The winter dark from earlier?
Yes, it's winter dark.

531
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,739
But there's a warm and cool in black too.

532
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:31,777
This one is a warmer black.

533
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,746
This one is a cool black.
Do you see the navy blue?

534
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,048
-These two.
-Cool.

535
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,382
-You're cool-toned.
-I'm cool.

536
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,186
-When you wear suits, wear cool navy blue.
-Your face looks much brighter.

537
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,221
Take a look at this.

538
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,455
DEEP SIGH

539
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,057
That one made me sigh.

540
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,392
-It looks heavy, doesn't it?
-Hang on a second.

541
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,662
I get that we're trying to
decide whether it suits me or not,

542
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,198
but what is this?

543
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,435
Why would you do this to me?

544
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,539
What is that?

545
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,707
THIS IS FUN

546
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,810
Got it. Even when I wear black,
I should wear a cool-toned black.

547
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,145
That one suited you so well.

548
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,015
People wonder if they should
only wear colors that suit them.

549
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,018
But even with black,
there's a warm and cool tone.

550
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,620
Let me put them on either side.

551
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,321
-This is warm. This is cool.
-Yes. Cool.

552
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,389
Cool is for me.

553
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,124
-You're cool-toned.
-Definitely suits you.

554
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,225
Wow!

555
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,694
Wow!

556
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,795
Boo.

557
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,497
I get it.

558
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,232
-I didn't do that.
-You didn't?

559
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,168
LAUGHING

560
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,670
-That one.
-Okay. Cool black.

561
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,605
-And winter dark.
-Cool black.

562
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,841
You're the paragon of winter dark.

563
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,043
Your image is more serious
than I expected.

564
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,745
It's better to consider the seriousness--

565
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,712
Than you expected?

566
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,214
THAN YOU EXPECTED?

567
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,215
What the heck?

568
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,217
These are the best.

569
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,086
The best colors for you
are winter dark colors.

570
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:48,987
LOOKING FANCY

571
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,022
And the worst?

572
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,758
The worst colors for you
are warm bright colors.

573
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,259
There's something worse than this.

574
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,061
I'll show you another one.

575
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,763
Gosh, these really are the worst.

576
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,501
-But Sook looked good in vivid colors.
-Doesn't my face look so bright?

577
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,136
-Look. These look much better.
-Totally.

578
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,504
What about this?

579
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,838
HIS COMPLEXION BRINGS OUT THE JEERS

580
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,540
-You look ugly.
-Come on.

581
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,276
You can just say that it doesn't suit me.
No need to do that.

582
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,611
TEASING THEIR YOUNGER BROTHER
IS SO MUCH FUN

583
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,712
Worst of the worst.

584
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,348
THE JEERS IN SURROUND SOUND

585
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,050
Oh, my gosh!

586
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,119
HMM

587
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,656
I said you should

588
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,593
think in terms of
a broad spectrum earlier,

589
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,061
but you have a narrow spectrum.

590
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,763
Narrow?

591
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,764
Very narrow.

592
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,933
That way, you can have a clear preference

593
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,237
and you can be the top example
for people who want to copy that.

594
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,438
<i>These look so pretty.</i>

595
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,740
<i>Do you mean the winter dark?</i>

596
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,641
<i>Yes, winter dark.</i>

597
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,576
-<i>Winter dark.</i>
-<i>Spring bright is the worst.</i>

598
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,446
-That's it.
-Thank you.

599
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,314
Those colors suit you so well.

600
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,950
I haven't done this in so long.
I'm getting nervous.

601
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,487
-Thank you.
-Boo!

602
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,622
She hasn't done anything.

603
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,857
She hasn't done anything yet? Got it.

604
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,891
Don't be that way.

605
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,294
-Don't make any flat-out critiques.
-He hasn't even started.

606
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,295
I thought he started.

607
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,464
Sorry. I really thought you started.

608
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,034
Your face is very symmetrical.

609
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,369
-Really? Thank you.
-Yes.

610
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,937
Your eyebrows are symmetrical too.

611
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,105
-Really?
-Yes.

612
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,573
Your ears are slightly different.

613
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,475
They're different? I'll make them match.

614
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,910
THEY'RE DIFFERENT? I'LL MAKE THEM MATCH

615
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,346
-They're different?
-He's funny.

616
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,817
I heard that my eyes are uneven.
Is that okay?

617
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,386
-They look fine.
-Thank you.

618
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,921
But your jaw seems long.

619
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:30,889
Shall I make it short?

620
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,025
SHALL I MAKE IT SHORT?

621
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,793
-Look ahead.
-What is that?

622
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,161
Is that the golden ratio?

623
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,764
Yes. Do you see that
there's room in the jaw area?

624
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,133
When I align it
with your nose and between your eyebrows,

625
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,868
-your forehead is narrow…
-Yes.

626
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,636
…and your chin is where your lips are…

627
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,606
FACING TROUBLE FROM THE FACE ANALYSIS

628
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,675
Your jaw is supposed to be here.

629
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,843
But you seem to have a long jaw.

630
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,211
-I see.
-He's all jaw.

631
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,579
JAW ON THE LONG SIDE

632
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,682
Yes, go ahead.

633
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,350
THE GOLDEN RATIO FILM

634
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:03,722
It would be better if you wore a V-neck
when you wear shirts.

635
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,059
Wow! Jin-kyung has the golden ratio.

636
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,760
-Really?
-Seriously.

637
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,329
-How can you tell?
-Put her nose here.

638
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,830
Her nose and between her brows.

639
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,465
-Top and bottom.
-The jaw matches.

640
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,300
It matches between the brows too.

641
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,035
-It really suits you.
-It matches here.

642
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,705
-Her eyes are right there too.
-This is for small faces.

643
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,605
You try, Sook.

644
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,442
Excuse me. This is my time.

645
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,245
Your ratio is very good too.

646
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,015
This is where my nose goes.

647
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,084
You guys are rude.

648
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,720
THE ANALYSIS STARTS AMID INDIFFERENCE

649
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,221
-Warm.
-Warm.

650
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,322
Wow.

651
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,890
COOL

652
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,792
This one's definitely…

653
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,761
-He's cool-toned too.
-He really is.

654
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:47,032
Most Koreans have
yellow hues in their skin,

655
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,067
-so green doesn't suit them.
-That's right.

656
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,268
That's why I chose green.

657
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,670
WHAT ABOUT THIS TIME?

658
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,771
Geez.

659
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,107
Excuse me. Hang on, Jin-kyung.

660
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,211
She said "Geez"
before Ms. Hwang opened the fabric.

661
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,348
She jeered while she was opening it.

662
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,318
Warm. Cool.

663
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,086
-You look better--
-Cool-toned is better.

664
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,654
<i>He's cool-toned.</i>

665
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,857
<i>He looks old with warm tones.</i>

666
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,458
Let's try <i>Obangsaek</i>.

667
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,726
-Let's see.
-Here's <i>Obangsaek.</i>

668
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,827
I think it'll be okay.

669
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,229
-Let's go!
-Okay.

670
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,263
Poop!

671
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,731
POOP

672
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,503
FLIPS THROUGH THE OBANGSAEK FABRICS

673
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,171
THE PRIMARY COLORS ARE TOUGH ON SAE-HO TOO

674
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,773
-Wait.
-They don't suit you either.

675
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,141
-Gosh.
-They aren't for you.

676
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,977
-This is hard.
-The blue doesn't look bad.

677
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,412
-Pink looks good.
-That one's okay.

678
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,780
Pink suits you surprisingly.

679
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,847
I like pink.

680
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,016
He tends to wear a lot of pink,

681
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,618
so we could be used to seeing it on him.

682
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,820
Let's try the winter cool tones
with more pink in them.

683
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,288
These were Sook's best colors.

684
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,123
-Winter cool?
-Let me try them on you.

685
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,558
Winter, cool bright.

686
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,660
-This one looks good.
-It's much better.

687
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,362
Your face is coming alive.

688
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,197
It looks good. This one looks good too.

689
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,698
This green looks good.

690
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,300
-What?
-You're winter cool.

691
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,935
-These are nice.
-These look good.

692
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:57,903
Wow.

693
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,004
All of them suited you.

694
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,306
-Winter cool tone.
-Nice to meet you.

695
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,841
-Let's check these two.
-Winter cool.

696
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,676
That must be the comedian tone.

697
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:05,677
THESE THREE ARE
ALREADY COOL-TONED

698
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,778
Winter cool tone.

699
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,313
This is summer. That one was winter.

700
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,481
This one is summer.

701
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,982
-It has more white.
-It suits you.

702
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,385
-Right? Rather than winter dark…
-That isn't bad either.

703
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,686
…how about a brighter tone?

704
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,555
-It suits him.
-Not bad.

705
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,190
I think summer may suit you too.

706
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,459
Yeah, Hawaiian shirts would suit you.

707
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,594
-This is it.
-Sae-ho.

708
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,429
You're clearly summer.
Isn't this pink better?

709
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,497
I like it.

710
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,799
I'm glad that you can
at least find clothes that suit you.

711
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,368
It's a compliment. I'm being nice.

712
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,838
-Is that summer cool?
-Yes, it's summer cool.

713
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,072
-Really?
-It suits you.

714
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,607
Like this. Half and half.

715
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,776
-What a relief.
-He's summer cool tone.

716
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,544
-What?
-I'm being nice.

717
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:40,679
-Yeah?
-It's a compliment.

718
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,614
This one's even more summer cool.

719
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,883
-Like this.
-No, not that one.

720
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,151
This one isn't bad either.

721
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,686
Lots of colors look good on you.

722
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,587
Should I add this?

723
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,056
I guess I look good
in a wide range of colors.

724
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,325
GIGGLING

725
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,893
Can you show us that one?

726
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,361
The one that suited me.

727
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,929
-Was it winter dark?
-Yes.

728
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,298
-Can you show us some chic colors?
-Chic colors.

729
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,867
Woo-jae's colors.

730
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,336
-This isn't bad.
-It isn't bad.

731
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,204
-It isn't bad.
-It looks good.

732
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,673
-Instead of doing this…
-It looks good.

733
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,975
…what if I did this?

734
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,776
-He looks better with white.
-Yeah.

735
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,845
-Rather than just dark--
-What's up with his brows?

736
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,381
-Why is he…
-What's up with his brows?

737
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,049
Why is he trying to look cool?

738
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,921
Surprisingly, he doesn't have
any worst colors.

739
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,358
Also, some of you had colors
that didn't suit you,

740
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,127
but you don't have any colors
that don't suit you. Just the tone.

741
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,762
-She's right.
-Sae-ho…

742
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,398
-I'm glad you have that at least.
-That's why he loves fashion.

743
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,332
-What?
-What?

744
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,868
I said something nice about you.

745
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:38,770
-It was nice.
-Okay.

746
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:39,804
Shall we take a look?

747
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,239
I don't like this one.

748
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,576
-Red comes up a little with these.
-That's right.

749
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,745
-His face looks drained.
-He looks drunk.

750
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,880
We didn't see that earlier with white.

751
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:49,948
I avoid this color.

752
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,449
You look like you have a bad liver.

753
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,586
He has a bad liver.

754
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,555
-These aren't great.
-It's the fatty liver look.

755
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,390
-You can see the redness up here.
-Yeah.

756
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,025
His nose looks red too.

757
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,428
I can see
the dramatic difference in this one.

758
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,897
-In a bad way.
-Yes.

759
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,198
It looks like he has food poisoning.

760
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,402
FOOD POISONING TONE

761
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,370
What was the tone you just showed us?

762
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,607
-It's autumn mute.
-Autumn mute definitely doesn't suit you.

763
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,808
Autumn.

764
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,477
So you can't wear a trench coat
by the stone wall path.

765
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,679
Okay.

766
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,815
You would look the best in a white studio.

767
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:24,883
Okay.

768
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,687
Let's check your image too.

769
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,689
Embroidery.

770
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,490
These are dynamic patterns.

771
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,025
-Not bad.
-It suits you.

772
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,393
-It suits you.
-You look good.

773
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,663
I think this will suit him.

774
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,298
-It suits you.
-This is dynamic.

775
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,199
EVEN PULLING OFF HERRINGBONE

776
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,267
Both look good.

777
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,336
You look good in herringbone.

778
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,638
I like the herringbone pattern.

779
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,606
It suits you well.

780
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:48,673
It looks good, doesn't it?

781
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,109
Then, let's try this one.

782
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,877
-Alpaca.
-Not that one. No.

783
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,845
-It's not bad.
-No.

784
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:54,946
-I think it's okay.
-No.

785
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,915
-It's not bad.
-That one makes him…

786
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,783
-It makes him look like a wild animal.
-Yeah.

787
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,019
-It's a compliment.
-Is it?

788
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,454
LOOKING LIKE A WILD ANIMAL:
RELIABLE, RESILIENT, RUGGED

789
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,990
These are summer light.

790
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,691
You're clearly summer light.

791
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,826
HIS BEST COLOR IS
BRIGHT AND VIBRANT SUMMER LIGHT

792
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,294
This is your worst.

793
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,495
HIS WORST IS AUTUMN MUTE

794
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,231
-You look like a barbarian.
-Come on.

795
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,733
You look like Bigfoot.

796
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,534
-Bigfoot?
-It's a compliment.

797
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,669
-Is it a compliment?
-It is.

798
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,739
Keep saying nice things to me.

799
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,107
Yeah, that was something nice.

800
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,011
You know, I'm an emotional person.

801
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,014
I haven't looked at myself in the mirror
like this for so long.

802
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,915
-Really?
-Yeah.

803
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,284
I look like I have some tragic back story.

804
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,620
That was something useless
that I had to hear.

805
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,988
What? Was that a compliment?

806
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,356
-It's a compliment.
-It is.

807
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,725
-Didn't you say it was useless?
-But it was nice.

808
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,860
The worst and the best.

809
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,229
You should wear light and neat fabric.

810
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,530
-Light and neat.
-Yes.

811
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,266
Sae-ho has a surprisingly wide range.

812
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,035
Yeah, he has a broad spectrum of colors.

813
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,237
-He has a broad spectrum.
-It's very broad.

814
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,172
STARTING JIN-KYUNG'S
PERSONAL COLOR ANALYSIS

815
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,907
Your head is very small.

816
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,809
-My head?
-Hey, Jin-kyung.

817
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,544
Hey.

818
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,812
You look the best right now.

819
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,681
YOU LOOK THE BEST RIGHT NOW!

820
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,083
Since she's been selling kimchi,

821
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,052
that look suits her.

822
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,086
SOMEHOW HER PERSONAL COLOR IS KIMCHI

823
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,088
Jin-kyung looks the best right now.

824
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,190
-It suits her.
-Yeah.

825
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,892
This side is the warm tone.

826
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,427
-And then…
-Everything goes with her.

827
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,429
All of them… You know,

828
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,365
she has a broader spectrum
than the three of you.

829
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,001
Oh, I think I get it.

830
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,171
Since she has such an intense face

831
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,574
no matter what color she wears,
it doesn't outshine her.

832
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,109
This might suit you too.

833
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,777
HOLDS UP THE SKY-BLUE FABRIC

834
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,245
-Warm.
-It suits her.

835
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,014
-They all suit her.
-Gosh.

836
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,749
-This one suits her.
-Both suit her.

837
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,853
There are people like her
who aren't limited to either warm or cool.

838
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,388
They have a broad spectrum.

839
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,757
-They look the same.
-This side stands out to me.

840
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,158
-Maybe middle?
-Is she warm-toned?

841
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,294
-I like the middle.
-Yes, the middle.

842
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,528
They're similar.

843
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,330
I like the warm side.

844
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,032
No, cool suits her too.

845
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,967
I think the color stands out
on the cool side.

846
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,535
Why do they all look good on her?

847
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,038
-You've all become pros at it.
-How bizarre.

848
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,807
Warm. Cool.

849
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,075
-She looks good in both.
-Yeah.

850
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,211
That's why I like the white on her.

851
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,347
CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE

852
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,715
-Warm.
-Warm.

853
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,250
-Cool.
-She looks good in all of them.

854
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,053
-She's more middle than warm.
-She isn't affected by tones.

855
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,955
She is more neutral,

856
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,890
-between warm and cool.
-They all look good.

857
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,425
All the colors look good on you.

858
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:21,493
Oh, not this one though.

859
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,394
When the colors are brighter,
it looks better.

860
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,097
-I really don't like this side.
-This is gray.

861
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,067
People like her
look good in blue tones, not gray tones.

862
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:29,968
There's a big gap.

863
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,102
-Gray doesn't suit her.
-No.

864
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,171
-Blue tones look better than gray on you.
-Yes.

865
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,573
-Clean colors.
-Clean colors suit you.

866
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,010
When I get male customers
who look good in either blue or gray,

867
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,246
I suggest they get laser hair removal.

868
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,015
-I had to do it 20 times while crying.
-Really?

869
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,552
Personally, I would like to grow a beard.

870
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,188
But what if others don't
want you to grow one?

871
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,190
-I'm being nice.
-Are you?

872
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,525
All right, then.

873
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,592
I feel much more at ease.

874
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,394
Shall we try these?

875
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,129
Check out the colors.
These are warm tones.

876
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,632
-This isn't bad.
-That suits you.

877
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,634
-Red definitely looks good.
-It suits you so well.

878
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,470
Red really does look good on her.

879
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,238
-It's her best color.
-You know,

880
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,575
you really do look better
in red than orange.

881
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,310
The best color of your life.

882
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,646
Wow. It looks so good on you.

883
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,114
It looks great.

884
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,650
-Yellow. Not bad.
-She looks good in all of them.

885
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,684
They all suit her.

886
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,787
Now that we've done warm,
let's move on to cool.

887
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,622
While we were saying
that everything suited her,

888
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,158
she made this face
as if she was clueless to it.

889
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,261
It's really pissing me off
all of a sudden.

890
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,030
Have you heard of Haha Universe?

891
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,599
Everyone thinks I'm cool,
but I'm oblivious about it.

892
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,568
EVERYONE THINKS I'M COOL
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M COOL

893
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,736
I definitely like
cool tones than warm tones.

894
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,839
Even in red, this one's cool.

895
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,775
<i>The cool red definitely seems</i>
<i>cleaner to me.</i>

896
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,510
<i>It feels like I can see your face better.</i>

897
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,247
Because Jin-kyung likes to be funny,

898
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,616
I sometimes think she looks funny.

899
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,484
-But she has a very attractive face.
-Totally.

900
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,787
She has a charismatic face.

901
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,754
HMM

902
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,090
So everyone does that
when they look in the mirror.

903
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,692
MY FACE LOOKS ALL RIGHT

904
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,161
This one's the deep color.

905
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,830
Everything looks good.
Why does everything look good on her?

906
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,499
-These are dark colors.
-They suit you.

907
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,002
You can wear these two colors together,

908
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,971
but don't add this on top of these.

909
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,572
-Don't do this.
-Geez.

910
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,874
This is the worst.

911
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,208
Darker is better.

912
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,810
All of you are cool-toned.

913
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,311
-We're all cool-toned?
-Yes.

914
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,648
As you can see,
this is your best and this is your worst.

915
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,352
Your worst and your best.

916
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,089
WORST, BEST

917
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,458
This side looks much better. Wow.

918
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,860
Would these look good on Jin-kyung?

919
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,062
I think they'll look good.

920
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,764
No one looked good in these.

921
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,832
SPARKLES DIDN'T SUIT ANYONE YET

922
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,034
LET'S SEE

923
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,769
-Wow!
-They look good on Jin-kyung!

924
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:45,737
It isn't bad.

925
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,206
-It suits you, Jin-kyung.
-It really suits you.

926
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,641
Dynamic patterns don't look bad.

927
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,276
Try the snakeskin print.

928
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,077
Snake is going to be tough.

929
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,014
There's this snake and another one.
It doesn't look bad.

930
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,148
It looks good on you!

931
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,651
It really looks good on you.

932
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,252
These are all dynamic patterns.

933
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,555
Dynamic patterns seem to look good on you.

934
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,791
-These look good too.
-Jin-kyung…

935
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,594
What you can't wear is
what Sook wore, which is tweed.

936
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,695
I'm curious about this.

937
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,796
It won't suit me.

938
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,197
-Something like this.
-No.

939
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,367
BOO

940
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,903
THUMBS DOWN

941
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,805
-Now, here's your best tone.
-Am I cool-toned?

942
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,106
You're totally cool-toned.

943
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,841
But you can handle warm tones too.

944
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,610
You're a hybrid, Jin-kyung.

945
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,845
This was the best for Woo-jae,

946
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,781
-but rather than that…
-This was his best?

947
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,950
We'll layer a lighter tone.

948
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,419
-A little more color looks better on her.
-Yes.

949
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,387
It should be more vibrant than this one.

950
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,256
That's it. That's the one.

951
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,258
She's right. Your face really stands out.

952
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,760
-She needs higher saturation than me.
-That's correct.

953
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,062
SPREADING HER ARM OUT

954
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:44,996
What has gotten into her?

955
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,164
Her back must be hurting.

956
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,900
Let me grab the worst one for you.

957
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,001
Let's see her worst.

958
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,537
Just looking at those colors,
I can tell they're the worst.

959
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:53,938
Those aren't for us.

960
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,506
OH…

961
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,275
THE JEERS COME POURING OUT

962
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,242
I hate them.

963
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,311
-Really? They look good to me.
-Darn.

964
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,813
-No.
-Wait. No.

965
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:02,714
Geez.

966
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,750
-Darn. I shouldn't have seen that.
-No.

967
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,485
These things really don't suit me.

968
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,789
Something sexier would look better on you.

969
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,092
Rather than that,
something silky like this is better.

970
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,593
-That's it.
-Yeah, that's it.

971
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,095
That's it. Silky is good.

972
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,765
Jin-kyung looks good
in elegant clothes like that.

973
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,866
Something luxurious.

974
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,067
LUXURIOUS JIN-KYUNG

975
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,103
You should go to an award show.

976
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,307
ENDING THE ANALYSIS
BEFORE SHE REALLY GOES TO AN AWARD SHOW

977
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:34,212
LOOKS GOOD IN BOTH WARM AND COOL TONES
HIGH SATURATION, DYNAMIC PATTERNS SUIT HER

978
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,213
I really hate myself in these.

979
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,749
-Let's move on.
-Is there something else?

980
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,450
She'll conduct body type analyses.

981
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,353
Due to the time limit,
we'll take one person who volunteers.

982
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,956
Me. I'm in the worst condition.

983
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,291
They're all models here.

984
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,060
CONSULTING PART 2
BODY TYPE ANALYSIS

985
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,628
<i>This is so fun, Ms. Hwang.</i>

986
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,529
<i>Thank you.</i>

987
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,265
What will we do next?

988
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,433
I'll analyze your body type.

989
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,002
I analyzed your personal color and image,

990
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,505
but there's an area
that can't be solved by those two.

991
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,674
For example, if you want to wear black,
should you wear something like me

992
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,976
or wear something long?

993
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,111
The body type analysis will
help you figure that out.

994
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,647
I personally think what you're wearing

995
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,583
-is perfect for your body type.
-Definitely.

996
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,519
-It's slightly cropped.
-Yes.

997
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,155
It wouldn't look good
if I wasn't wearing this belt.

998
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,856
-<i>I have to wear it…</i>
-<i>It looks longer.</i>

999
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:19,957
<i>That's right.</i>

1000
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,859
So I can't wear it low like this.

1001
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,494
-I have to wear it further up.
-I see.

1002
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,097
I have to use the belt
as an accent point too.

1003
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,833
I wore my personal color today.

1004
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,904
Can you tell Sook how to dress
for her body type?

1005
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,474
Body types are pretty simple
once you learn what's involved.

1006
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:40,078
Firstly, there's skeletal analysis
and body type analysis.

1007
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:43,881
Body type analysis is things like this.
Thinking that the hourglass body

1008
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,017
or the pear-shaped body is pretty.

1009
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,286
You focus on the silhouette.

1010
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,022
Skeletal analysis is literally
assessing the bone structure.

1011
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,624
If you spread your hands out like this,

1012
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:57,161
you can see the bones in people
like Jin-kyung or Woo-jae.

1013
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,529
You can see the bones in some.

1014
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,997
In Sook's case,

1015
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,599
the bones aren't visible.

1016
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,902
This isn't about being skinny or fat.

1017
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:08,106
Even while you're sitting,
take a look at your knees.

1018
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:12,009
-Woo-jae's knees protrude more.
-You're right.

1019
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,613
But in Sook's case, it appears
as though your knees don't stick out.

1020
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,615
-All of his bones are protruding.
-Yes.

1021
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,984
There are some who have protruding bones.

1022
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,019
Why is your elbow so pointy?

1023
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,422
Show us one more time.

1024
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,023
THOSE ELBOWS LOOK LIKE
THEY CAN CUT WITH JUST A TAP

1025
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,525
It's pointy.

1026
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,860
You're messing around a lot.

1027
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,862
He's messing around so much.

1028
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,565
So when I feel your body,
it's very round and plump.

1029
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,968
The fact that she is pretty muscular

1030
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:41,038
and has a round and plump figure
means she has a straight body type.

1031
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,574
I'm what you call a wave body type.

1032
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:48,179
My body type doesn't have a lot of muscle,
and I have softer curves.

1033
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,848
-That's the wave type.
-Wave body type.

1034
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:54,418
Someone like IU
doesn't have a muscular body.

1035
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,721
She has a more delicate figure.

1036
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,089
There are types like that.

1037
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,457
Are you saying you're like IU?

1038
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,424
No.

1039
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,727
That's what she's saying.

1040
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,195
What the heck?

1041
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,497
-No way.
-Did you check?

1042
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,933
Did you check her identity?

1043
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,101
Did you check her ID?

1044
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,235
We'll check.

1045
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,205
So first of all…

1046
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,240
Come on. Why?

1047
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,610
Come on. Geez!

1048
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,479
Be careful. She may overpower you.

1049
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,780
Watch out.

1050
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,848
What are you going to do?

1051
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,284
-I was going to measure your body.
-Come on!

1052
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,986
What are you going to measure?

1053
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,655
Your body. Your shoulders.

1054
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,290
Look ahead.

1055
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,892
Let me check your shoulder line.

1056
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,861
Your shoulders are quite broad.

1057
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,663
It's 40.

1058
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,565
Okay. Your shoulder line is 40.

1059
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,599
Let's do your chest.

1060
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,767
Why?

1061
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,204
You're weird.

1062
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,272
-Why do you want to measure my chest?
-Turn around.

1063
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,173
Let's turn around.

1064
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,008
-Geez.
-Let's see.

1065
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,744
MEASURING

1066
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,215
I'm not watching for my own sake.

1067
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,083
-Look at me!
-Is she done measuring?

1068
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,218
Let's do your waist.

1069
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,053
What? Why?

1070
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,455
Then, measure from under.

1071
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,624
MEASURING

1072
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,559
She's desperate to reduce the waist size.

1073
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,095
-Measure from underneath.
-Okay.

1074
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,964
HOVERING AROUND

1075
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,198
ARE WE DONE?

1076
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,299
Your hips.

1077
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,400
Why are you being like this?

1078
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:18,903
This is the last one.

1079
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,271
Are you sure you checked her ID?

1080
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,773
Why do you have to measure my hips?

1081
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,543
How is it? Is she similar to Don Lee?

1082
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,178
WHAT IS THE RESULT
OF THE MEASUREMENT?

1083
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:28,546
GIGGLING

1084
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,514
Hang on.

1085
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,183
What is this?

1086
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,385
Did you draw my body?

1087
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,753
You're like a gourd bottle.

1088
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,088
I'm like a gourd bottle?

1089
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,290
Isn't a gourd bottle shape very bad?

1090
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,259
Isn't this the gourd bottle?

1091
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,161
It's goes like this up here but…

1092
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,062
HEHEHE

1093
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,331
You're laughing at me
because your figure is like IU's.

1094
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,335
First of all, your shoulders are size L.

1095
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,536
Because of your shoulders,

1096
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,108
there's a chance
it may not close down here.

1097
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,344
Also, your waist is a bit big.

1098
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,546
-Like this.
-But you measured…

1099
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,914
But you measured from underneath.

1100
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,616
It's large up here

1101
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,784
and it gets smaller here.

1102
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,152
Wait, my breasts get smaller?

1103
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,553
What the heck?

1104
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,024
-Why does it get smaller?
-Your chest is a size M.

1105
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,127
Her shoulders are a size L,
but her chest is a size M.

1106
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,063
What the heck?
Why would my chest get smaller?

1107
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,965
Your stomach is size XL.

1108
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,233
My stomach is size XL?

1109
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,001
MY STOMACH IS SIZE XL?

1110
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,336
I quit!

1111
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,371
I quit this segment.

1112
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,773
Just a little bit more.

1113
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,741
-How can my stomach be a size XL?
-Is she almost done?

1114
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,277
We just met for the first time
but she's so rude.

1115
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,211
THE GOURD BOTTLE GETS UNCOOPERATIVE

1116
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,081
We just met but she says
my chest is small but my stomach is huge!

1117
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,683
How can that be?

1118
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,584
She's almost done, isn't she? Okay.

1119
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,053
-Hey, Sae-ho.
-How can that be?

1120
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,088
-Large, medium, X-large?
-I'm offended.

1121
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,791
I'm so offended that I can't do this.
What the heck?

1122
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,760
STRATEGY MEETING

1123
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,163
Just say that this kind of

1124
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,765
-body type is very good.
-Very good. Okay.

1125
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,501
And say that people like this
are considerate

1126
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,271
-and charitable.
-They're considerate and charitable.

1127
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,041
How can she treat me like this
just because she has a figure like IU?

1128
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,409
Does that make sense, Jin-kyung?

1129
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:06,510
She's the lucky type.

1130
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,845
-Say that.
-You're the lucky type.

1131
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,213
You're the lucky type.

1132
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,715
I don't like the gourd bottle.

1133
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,083
Use something else.

1134
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,217
-Like what?
-Whiskey bottle?

1135
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,352
-Whiskey?
-Coke bottle?

1136
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,886
You're like a whiskey bottle.

1137
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,822
Hey, remove the part that I'm a size XL.

1138
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,357
-Say she's generous.
-She's generous.

1139
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,991
She says you're generous.

1140
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,094
-You're very generous.
-Okay.

1141
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,261
She's generous.

1142
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,396
-Tell me again.
-Okay.

1143
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,931
Your shoulders are a size L.

1144
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,300
Your chest is a size M.

1145
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,235
Your waist is size XL and your hips are--

1146
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,837
-Don't say that.
-She said I was size XL again.

1147
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,905
MA'AM, WE WENT OVER THIS

1148
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,340
Negotiate well, Sae-ho.

1149
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,242
-Overall…
-Overall.

1150
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,143
MUMBLING

1151
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,178
-What is she doing?
-He needs to negotiate well.

1152
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,815
WHY IS HE MAKING A DEAL WITH THIS

1153
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,550
Did she even measure me properly?

1154
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,652
-Her waist is…
-Did she measure me properly?

1155
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,788
How can a person be
the shape of a gourd bottle?

1156
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,156
-We're done.
-Okay.

1157
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,624
Tell me again.

1158
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,025
And your shoulders…

1159
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,694
are the size of Korea's most beloved host.

1160
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,463
-Your chest is warmer than anyone else's.
-Okay.

1161
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:01,465
What about my waist?

1162
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,800
-Your waist is…
-Yes?

1163
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,035
very generous.

1164
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,071
-That's pretty good.
-Yes.

1165
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,472
-And…
-What about my hips?

1166
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,108
Your hips are a size S.

1167
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,878
Why are my hips a size S?

1168
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,147
-Hey!
-Gosh. Why did you say that?

1169
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,615
FEELING DIZZY, MA'AM!!!

1170
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,284
Say that her hips are very hip.

1171
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,385
-All done.
-I'm offended.

1172
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,788
-She'll tell you about your hips.
-She's ready.

1173
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,523
I'm so offended right now.

1174
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,125
Your shoulders are the size
of Korea's most beloved host.

1175
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,860
Your chest is warmer than anyone else.

1176
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,096
-Your waist is very generous.
-Very generous. Yes.

1177
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,063
Your hips are hip.

1178
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,432
-It's hip.
-Very good.

1179
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,399
They're hip.

1180
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,534
That's good enough.

1181
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,970
I'm not joking, but when I hear that,
I can't even imagine it.

1182
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,238
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THAT BODY TYPE

1183
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:45,576
The good news is that she can
turn your already charming body type

1184
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,712
-to an even more charming body type.
-Exactly.

1185
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,215
What do people with
a gourd bottle body type wear?

1186
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,053
First of all, you should not wear anything
that emphasizes your waist.

1187
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,688
-Remember that.
-I have no waist.

1188
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,225
If you wear a belt like me
that emphasizes your waist,

1189
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,728
take a look at the mirror
and see what it looks like.

1190
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,232
If you emphasize it like this,
your stomach looks bigger.

1191
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,366
Just wear it straight.

1192
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,534
EMPHASIZING HER TUMMY MAKES IT LOOK BIGGER

1193
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,570
-Take a look at your shoulder line.
-Okay.

1194
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,639
-It makes your shoulders look broader.
-Yes.

1195
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,609
Instead, you can raise it like this.

1196
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,944
-Align it with my shoulders?
-Yes.

1197
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,645
Highlight your shoulder line.

1198
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,347
Just doing this would look better

1199
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,317
-than when it goes down like this.
-It makes me look bigger.

1200
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,352
-Don't raise it like this though.
-I see.

1201
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,487
Just slightly.

1202
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:30,688
-Also…
-Okay.

1203
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,323
…loose sleeves like these are good.

1204
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,458
You can actually roll them up.

1205
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,526
-Looks longer.
-Yes.

1206
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,127
This draws attention to the upper body.

1207
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,530
It makes your shoulders look broad.

1208
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,831
Look at those muscles.

1209
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,067
-This is for the straight body type.
-That's hip-hop.

1210
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,468
As you can see,

1211
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,136
you don't have to roll them up.

1212
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,339
If you do this, this area

1213
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,241
-looks too stuffy.
-I see.

1214
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,208
Upper body focused.

1215
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,477
Stand next to me so I can show you.

1216
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,312
This area is pretty long.

1217
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,047
-My chest line is long.
-Yes.

1218
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,482
Hers is high.

1219
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:02,086
That's why her chest line
is on the higher side.

1220
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,588
So if you roll your sleeves up,
it looks even higher.

1221
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,290
A-HA!

1222
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,592
That's why big bags look good on Sae-ho.

1223
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,661
-He has a similar body to Sook.
-Yes.

1224
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,030
You have to move
the focus to the lower body.

1225
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,065
Because they're more upper body focused,

1226
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,501
-you have to lower it.
-Lower the focus with a big bag.

1227
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,570
-Should I use a big bag too?
-No, you should not.

1228
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:20,905
Wait. Yes, you can. Sorry.

1229
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,473
GIGGLING

1230
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,141
You get a yellow card, Ms. Hwang.

1231
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,010
She's all over the place.

1232
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,345
-Also, this…
-Match this line.

1233
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,081
-Let me lower this.
-Okay.

1234
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,684
-Rather than letting it hang like this…
-Yes?

1235
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,619
…slightly adjust it to the waistline.

1236
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,155
Don't lift it up like this though.

1237
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,790
Leave it right about here.

1238
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,091
-Align it with your pants.
-Yes.

1239
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,861
If you align it to this, it looks good.

1240
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,130
But let me demonstrate this
with an example.

1241
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,699
These are high waist pants.

1242
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,835
Rather than that, it is better
if you wear it along your waistline.

1243
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,170
The trendy low waist style…

1244
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,339
-What about "sagging"?
-No, not that.

1245
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,807
-She can't?
-I don't have a waist.

1246
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,509
Wear it neatly like this.

1247
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,977
LOOK AT ME

1248
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,079
You look so great right now.
The balance is perfect.

1249
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,014
-Hey. Look.
-Wear that.

1250
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,384
-Your shoulders are rather broad, right?
-Yes.

1251
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,552
-It's wide, right?
-Yes.

1252
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,221
I'm sorry, but down here is
a little bit boxy.

1253
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,556
Since it's boxy…

1254
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,524
HUFFING AND PUFFING

1255
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,026
…it can all look boxy
if you wear something too wide.

1256
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,161
Slightly slimmer?

1257
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,596
So you should wear a boot cut.

1258
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,497
-I like boot cuts.
-Yes, boot cuts.

1259
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,599
Look at her shoulders.

1260
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,634
When you align the shoulders
with down here,

1261
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,869
-it makes your waist appear slimmer.
-Yes.

1262
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,371
To the side, like this.

1263
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,640
That way, your shoulders don't look broad

1264
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,041
and it hides this area too.

1265
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,577
The focal point becomes this end.

1266
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,579
Now, try this on.

1267
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,248
If you wear something that
fits the shoulder line, you look slim.

1268
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,350
WOW!

1269
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,951
The fit looks very neat.

1270
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,753
You really look tall, Sook.

1271
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,356
What about cropped tops for Sook?

1272
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,424
I was about to put that on her.

1273
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,627
-She really looks tall.
-Sorry but can I buy these?

1274
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,061
SORRY BUT CAN I BUY THESE?

1275
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,364
I have an award show to attend
at the end of the year.

1276
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,431
I'd like to…

1277
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,066
You can't wear cropped tops.

1278
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,935
Because she is top heavy,

1279
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,703
you have to draw the eyes downward.

1280
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,639
Basically, Sook has to wear clothes

1281
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,741
-that lower the center of mass.
-That's right.

1282
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,743
She has to focus on that.

1283
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,811
-Wow!
-She looks sturdy.

1284
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,046
You look short, right?

1285
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,181
This part gets emphasized, Sook.

1286
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,183
-Also…
-The shoulder line.

1287
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,819
…if you want to wear
just a plain white T-shirt,

1288
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,956
you can create a shoulder line
by wearing a backpack.

1289
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,392
Or you can wear a fake collar like this.

1290
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,427
Just let it hang in the front.

1291
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,962
Like this.

1292
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,097
If you let it hang like this,
it creates a line.

1293
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,666
Sorry, but can I buy this?

1294
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,101
HOW MUCH IS IT?

1295
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,005
Some people would tie it like this.

1296
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,807
Since you don't want the eyes up here,

1297
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,510
she has to lower her bust point.

1298
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,779
-She looks totally different.
-Like this.

1299
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,881
She should lower it like this.

1300
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,983
Like the '90s rom-com actor look.

1301
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,618
Where did you buy this?

1302
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,821
And now for the look
that you shouldn't wear.

1303
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:54,591
I told you that you shouldn't wear
anything that accents your waistline.

1304
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,294
This one accents your waistline.

1305
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,797
IF SHE WEARS A JACKET
THAT ACCENTS HER WAISTLINE

1306
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,432
As the waist is emphasized…

1307
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,499
It looks so weird.

1308
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:04,768
This area becomes…

1309
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,770
-It looks so weird.
-…more boxy.

1310
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,707
Rather than looking boxy,
the other look where it just falls…

1311
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,776
In my case, I need to
change the focal point to my upper body,

1312
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,345
I would make my neckline narrower.

1313
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,914
But she shouldn't make it narrow.

1314
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,016
-Should I lower mine?
-Let's undo one button.

1315
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,385
Lower the neckline just a little bit.

1316
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,220
Lower the center of mass. I see.

1317
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,790
-She has to lower it like this.
-I have to lower it.

1318
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,626
It makes her neck appear longer.

1319
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,196
For example, if Sook looks good in

1320
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,765
boot cut pants, can she not wear a skirt?

1321
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,467
Shall we take a look at skirts?

1322
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,735
I don't look good in skirts.

1323
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,970
You do look much better in pants.

1324
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,205
-Just wear pants.
-Yeah.

1325
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,607
Take a look. Let me show you one thing.

1326
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,976
-Just let me wear pants.
-Let's see.

1327
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,413
If she wears something like this,
all you see are her calves.

1328
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,416
But it would look better if she
pulled it up a little into a mini skirt.

1329
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,585
-It looks okay.
-You look nice.

1330
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,221
-She has to show her thighs.
-You have to show your thighs.

1331
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,624
If she only shows this much,
her legs would look short.

1332
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,459
-I see.
-Make it shorter.

1333
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,729
-Go above the knee line. Let me show you.
-You look so cute.

1334
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,199
Since my body's focal point
is my lower body,

1335
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,537
I wore ankle socks
to make my legs look longer.

1336
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,440
But since she has pretty muscular calves,

1337
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,309
-let's try lowering these.
-Okay.

1338
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,045
When you lower the socks like this,
this part is too…

1339
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:23,914
It's too thin,

1340
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,150
so the balance seems off.

1341
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,919
So for those who have muscular calves,

1342
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,821
they should raise their socks

1343
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,323
to slightly cover up

1344
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,526
this area.

1345
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:36,827
It's the same with boots.

1346
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,763
They should cover this area
and create a line.

1347
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,065
-That would be the best look for them.
-I see.

1348
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,202
A professional really is different.

1349
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:49,840
The personal color analysis
was very accurate too,

1350
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,910
-but the body type one is very clear.
-Yes, it is.

1351
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,679
You've all received my consultations now.

1352
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,681
Since I couldn't do everyone's body type,

1353
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,651
I prepared something
that includes the three of you too.

1354
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,019
I made this.

1355
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:05,289
I'm going to do a personal consulting now.

1356
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:08,058
First of all,
these are the standards for analysis.

1357
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,193
It had to be this one.

1358
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,161
-These are Woo-jae's pants.
-Yes.

1359
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:14,064
-Being tall doesn't mean it's better.
-Right.

1360
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,933
-Body proportions are what matter.
-Yes.

1361
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,936
-Proportions are important.
-I wanted to point that out.

1362
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,705
As I said before, we create a silhouette

1363
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,608
by combining our bones, muscles, and fat.

1364
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,743
Why am I there?

1365
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,013
That dress makes her look
very proportional.

1366
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,648
Yes, that's right. Her ratio is--

1367
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,418
Her shoulders are large, chest is medium,
and extra-large down here.

1368
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:35,686
Let's stop. Okay?

1369
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,321
-The dress, right?
-The gourd bottle.

1370
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,022
This is what I prepared.

1371
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,024
VARIOUS VERSIONS OF SOOK

1372
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,060
-That's so funny.
-There's straight, wave, and natural.

1373
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,828
These are the body types.

1374
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,366
So of the three body types,
Sae-ho and Sook have

1375
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,702
-the straight body type.
-You look good in that picture.

1376
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,370
I chose the best ones.

1377
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,538
Is that when you won the award?

1378
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,407
-You look pretty.
-Take a look at her collarbone.

1379
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:01,278
People whose collarbone isn't visible
typically have the straight body type.

1380
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,647
<i>There are those whose bones are visible</i>
<i>when they exercise,</i>

1381
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,250
<i>and there are those whose muscles</i>
<i>are visible when they exercise.</i>

1382
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,417
<i>The more Sae-ho exercises,</i>

1383
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,587
<i>he is the type</i>
<i>who has more visible muscles.</i>

1384
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:11,922
So that's his body type.

1385
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,191
Woo-young has the wave body type.

1386
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,692
Why is that there?

1387
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,262
What the heck? I can't stand that.

1388
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,230
Look at his face.

1389
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,499
His body is different from Sae-ho's.

1390
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,067
They angle downwards

1391
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,602
and this area is a little longer.

1392
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,472
That's why he wears ties often

1393
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,841
to make his neck appear slimmer.

1394
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,342
You know what? Woo-young has

1395
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,111
-a really nice body.
-He does.

1396
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,045
Yeah, it's very nice.

1397
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,381
-It's very nice.
-His waist is like an hourglass.

1398
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,250
It makes his waist look very defined.

1399
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,219
But isn't his facial expression too much?

1400
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,122
Sae-ho makes that face.

1401
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,624
I didn't know Woo-young back then.

1402
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,559
-Man, but that face.
-Natural body type.

1403
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,560
-Natural.
-Yes, natural.

1404
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,195
The bones are visible.

1405
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,764
-Hey, it's Woo-jae.
-Look at Jin-kyung.

1406
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:54,865
Look at how awesome

1407
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,333
-her collarbone looks here.
-Yeah.

1408
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,068
That is very attractive.

1409
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,137
No matter how much weight Jin-kyung gains,

1410
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,438
her collarbone will be visible.

1411
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,942
That is a huge asset for her.

1412
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,276
So you are categorized into

1413
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,111
two straight body types,
one wave body type,

1414
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,747
-and two natural body types.
-Okay.

1415
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,117
I started off with Sook's collection.

1416
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:17,821
These are all the costumes
you wore on <i>Screwballs</i>.

1417
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:18,989
Look at the Bardem one.

1418
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,057
From here, I saw--

1419
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,359
Bardem dressed well.

1420
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,462
The shoulder line aligns perfectly.

1421
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,496
It aligns perfectly.

1422
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,699
That's right. Oh, yeah.

1423
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:29,967
You can dress like that.

1424
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,135
This is so insane. My goodness.

1425
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,806
-I picked out the best and worst outfit.
-Okay.

1426
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,241
The worst ones are the ones
where the hair is too big

1427
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,776
and these areas are puffed up.

1428
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,212
Rather than wearing things
that emphasize the upper body…

1429
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,247
But I love this outfit.

1430
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,984
It's the worst when it emphasizes

1431
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,685
-the upper body, right?
-That's correct.

1432
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:49,753
Why is this the worst?

1433
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,787
If you look carefully,

1434
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,490
<i>it emphasizes the upper body</i>
<i>and the neckline looks stuffy.</i>

1435
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,791
<i>The attention-stealing pattern.</i>

1436
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:58,528
Because the upper body is emphasized,
the lower body looks too skinny.

1437
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,297
You should shift the focus from the top

1438
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,533
and balance out the upper and lower body
to create your best look.

1439
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,634
Wait, this is my best?

1440
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,236
This is my best?

1441
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,138
-The shoulder line matches.
-Sook.

1442
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,073
Think about that time.

1443
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,609
When she walked in the store,
we didn't recognize her.

1444
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,178
-That means it was the best.
-That's the best?

1445
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,980
-It suited you.
-You didn't recognize me.

1446
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,750
If you remove the scarf,
the shoulder line matches.

1447
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:22,119
-And you wore boots.
-Oh, yeah. I wore boots.

1448
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,854
You're right.

1449
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,188
So I recommend this outfit

1450
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,556
-for <i>Screwballs</i>.
-What?

1451
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,191
What the heck?

1452
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:32,062
These were what I could find
from what you wore on <i>Screwballs</i>.

1453
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:34,297
-They're the best combinations.
-That's right.

1454
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,266
You should wear miniskirts,

1455
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,769
and if you feel shy about it,
combine them with boots.

1456
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,404
-You'd look much prettier.
-Miniskirts?

1457
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,505
Yes, that's right.

1458
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,806
Now, I took a look at

1459
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,141
your hair length too.

1460
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,542
-I had a variety…
-Bardem is…

1461
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,977
-…of hairstyles.
-You had a lot.

1462
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,246
You had such a variety of hairstyles.

1463
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,481
If I were to choose the best,
it would be these two.

1464
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,250
-What?
-Let me tell you what this means.

1465
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:55,919
If you raise the focal point
in your upper body to above the bust,

1466
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,921
your neck wouldn't look so stuffy.

1467
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:58,955
Isn't Bardem better?

1468
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,758
Yes, that one is okay.
But this one looks prettier.

1469
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,693
This one is also a best look.

1470
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,662
How did she do that Bardem style?

1471
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,663
CHUCKLE

1472
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,231
How did you do that makeup, Sook?

1473
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,534
There's no makeup.

1474
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,269
-That's just my face.
-Right?

1475
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,303
It's amazing.

1476
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,671
That isn't CGI, is it?

1477
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,307
Geez. She even resembles Javier Bardem.

1478
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,077
You could either grow it all the way down

1479
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,412
to lower the bust point completely.

1480
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,047
-Or grow it very long?
-Exactly.

1481
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,850
If your hair is medium length,
your neck looks stuffy.

1482
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,753
<i>It would be better</i>
<i>if you exposed this area.</i>

1483
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,455
That's why these are the bests and worsts.

1484
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,156
The focal point changes.

1485
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,192
It would look better

1486
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,727
if you dispersed the attention
gathered around the neck area.

1487
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,097
It's fascinating that
the one on the right is the best.

1488
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,465
IT'S FASCINATING THAT IT'S THE BEST

1489
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,233
Let's see who's next. It's Jin-kyung.

1490
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,868
-Gosh. Look how fancy she is.
-She was

1491
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,370
actually so glamorous and beautiful.

1492
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,606
-And she wore such a huge variety.
-Hey.

1493
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,576
What kind of lives have we been living
based on those photos?

1494
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:55,178
Actually, she doesn't have
that many worsts.

1495
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,547
But the reason why I chose
these worst looks

1496
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,150
is because the regular fit
can make you look too frail.

1497
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,085
What you're wearing today

1498
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,387
is an oversized fit
with sleeves that fall lower.

1499
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,690
It looks better
when the sleeves fall lower.

1500
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,860
<i>It would look rather stuffy</i>
<i>if you raised the sleeves like Sook,</i>

1501
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,328
-<i>and you would look frail.</i>
-<i>I see.</i>

1502
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:15,765
That's why you would look prettier
if you wore a loose fit like this.

1503
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,268
This was also pretty.
I noticed that you carry

1504
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,170
a lot of big bags.

1505
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,906
You add volume by carrying big bags.

1506
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,808
You look so cool, Jin-kyung.

1507
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,309
-She looks so cool.
-Is this her?

1508
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,944
I can't see her face.

1509
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,013
This is her best fit.

1510
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,448
WHAT IS JIN-KYUNG'S BEST FIT?

1511
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,482
-My collarbone.
-Yes.

1512
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,184
You look so cool and pretty

1513
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,553
-when you wear things that are draped on…
-So cool.

1514
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,989
…and look as though they were
effortlessly thrown on.

1515
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,457
I forgot she's not a comedian.

1516
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,925
I FORGOT JIN-KYUNG WAS NOT A COMEDIAN

1517
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,593
Hey, it's Milo Lee.

1518
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,661
Oh, my goodness.

1519
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,397
Sae-ho had the fanciest neckline

1520
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,599
and wore such a variety of styles.

1521
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,901
The octopus one is his best.

1522
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,170
-For real.
-The lymph node one on the right.

1523
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,472
-Lymph nodes?
-That's when it got inflamed.

1524
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:57,140
These are his worst looks.

1525
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,576
-I included the octopus costume.
-That's the worst?

1526
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,611
As you can see,
the focus is on the upper body.

1527
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,381
Rather than emphasizing this area,

1528
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,249
he should try to emphasize the lower body.

1529
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,150
-Really?
-Yes.

1530
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,052
Your proportions look better that way.

1531
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,954
<i>Not distinguishing the face and the neck,</i>

1532
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,056
<i>not clearly defining your waistline,</i>

1533
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,425
<i>and wearing bulky collars.</i>
<i>Things like these.</i>

1534
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,828
Instead of a double-breasted jacket,
you should wear a single-breasted one.

1535
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,031
SHE RECOMMENDS A SINGLE-BREASTED JACKET
RATHER THAN DOUBLE-BREASTED

1536
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:24,267
Lower the focal point
using an oversized bag where you can carry

1537
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,302
-your knickknacks.
-Yes.

1538
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,403
He shouldn't emphasize

1539
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,572
-his upper body either.
-That's correct.

1540
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,307
That's why this is his best look.

1541
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,374
THIS IS SAE-HO'S BEST LOOK

1542
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:34,411
-This is like the cardigan Sook wore.
-Yes.

1543
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,046
You can wear these colors with it.

1544
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,581
Cover the ankle too.

1545
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:38,682
The colors pop too.

1546
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,317
He had lost some weight then.

1547
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:41,952
That was not too long ago.

1548
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,153
-Really?
-Yes.

1549
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,788
My wife took that photo of me.

1550
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:45,989
She edited it a little.

1551
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,692
-She edited the photo?
-I thought you looked good.

1552
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,161
-Let's move on to Woo-young.
-Woo-young.

1553
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,264
What I would like to briefly show you

1554
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,467
is that he sticks to
the neckline that suits him,

1555
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,835
so there weren't any worst looks.

1556
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,570
Yeah, he looked good in that.

1557
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:01,671
That one was so pretty.

1558
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,941
There's nothing else
besides the dropped shoulder line.

1559
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,577
<i>But he raises the shoulder line</i>
<i>with the hoodie so…</i>

1560
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,013
He wears a lot of puff sleeves
or layered looks.

1561
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,147
He has a nice body.

1562
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,082
-Yeah.
-As you can see,

1563
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,585
he keeps that neckline pretty high.

1564
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:19,456
He would often raise the focal point
that is downward.

1565
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,725
-Last up is Woo-jae.
-Well,

1566
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:22,759
he's a top model.

1567
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,160
-He looks good in everything.
-Yes.

1568
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,395
He looked so good.

1569
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:28,965
It was the hardest to find his worst look.

1570
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,267
These are his best and worst.

1571
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,636
WHAT IS WOO-JAE'S BEST AND WORST?

1572
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,171
THE CONDITIONS OF HIS WORST LOOKS ARE…

1573
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,440
His face is the worst part
of the worst looks.

1574
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:39,509
-That's right.
-But…

1575
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,846
But you know what's interesting?
Those two worst looks

1576
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:45,749
are costumes, so I don't
really put a lot of effort into it.

1577
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:47,517
When I was putting those on,

1578
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,987
<i>I thought to myself,</i>
<i>"These really don't suit me."</i>

1579
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,056
-<i>Really?</i>
-<i>I thought that about those two.</i>

1580
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,526
That's right. Just like Jin-kyung,
you have to lower the shoulder line.

1581
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,262
The regular fit can make you look frail.

1582
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,498
-And you can't wear tight pants.
-Right.

1583
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:04,567
So your best looks are
loose fit shirts like this.

1584
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,670
<i>Also, the loose fit jacket</i>
<i>you wore earlier is good too.</i>

1585
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,205
-<i>You have the same body type as Jin-kyung.</i>
-<i>Yes, I do.</i>

1586
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,274
The truth is you dress so well

1587
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,009
that it was hard for me to choose,

1588
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,445
so I prepared this instead.

1589
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,414
<i>These are your Instagram posts.</i>

1590
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,149
That was my first post on Instagram.

1591
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,117
-That's right.
-It was in 2013.

1592
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,919
It was my first post 12 years ago.

1593
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,523
-You haven't changed.
-You haven't changed from your first post.

1594
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:27,757
You haven't changed.

1595
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:32,896
But he comes across
as a more well-mannered person then.

1596
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:34,431
-He looks innocent.
-Yes.

1597
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,932
-He looks kind.
-He looks polite.

1598
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,534
Surprisingly, I was more impolite.

1599
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,468
-Were you?
-Yes.

1600
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,303
You really look rude in that one.

1601
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,404
So you improved.

1602
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,307
He is a textbook example
of the natural look.

1603
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,776
Every man aspires to achieve this look.

1604
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,511
The so-called boyfriend look.

1605
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,914
Most of the looks
that women send their boyfriends

1606
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,083
-have a loose fit top.
-That's right.

1607
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,985
He doesn't wear anything too tight
and field jackets really suit him.

1608
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,254
-All of them look good.
-Even I am amazed

1609
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,156
that all of those
weren't taken in one year.

1610
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,425
They were taken in different years.

1611
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,594
-Yes, you're…
-It means I always satisfy them.

1612
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,597
-What the heck?
-It would be nice if he had some manners.

1613
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:08,898
He's so rude.

1614
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,400
All is fine except that he's rude.

1615
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,302
That is all that I prepared.

1616
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,137
THE CONSULTING HAS ENDED

1617
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,739
You analyzed us perfectly.

1618
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:20,577
-Ms. Hwang studied us a lot.
-She did a lot of research.

1619
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:24,247
You all received a high-quality analysis.

1620
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,316
Thank you so much
for preparing everything so well.

1621
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,784
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1622
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,886
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1623
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,956
<i>On the next episode of </i>Screwballs<i>.</i>

1624
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,658
-For the year 2026.
-For <i>Screwballs</i>.

1625
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,327
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1626
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,261
Thank you!

1627
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,863
<i>Welcome.</i>

1628
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,598
-<i>Kim Sook camping.</i>
-<i>It's so nice.</i>

1629
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,533
<i>She set up an omakase outside.</i>

1630
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,902
<i>I prepared 32 dishes for you.</i>

1631
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,237
-Thirty-two?
-Yes.

1632
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:48,972
I caught this cuttlefish myself.

1633
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,941
THE FLAVORS ARE INSANE

1634
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,710
Oh, my gosh. It's so good.

1635
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,645
Isn't it the best
that we're friends with Sook?

1636
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,547
You are so charming, Sook.

1637
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,815
I love you.

1638
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,450
It's meaningful that we're together.

1639
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:01,985
<i>Gosh, I'm so happy.</i>

1640
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,386
If it tastes fishy, hit me.

1641
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,587
I have to hit you.

1642
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:05,889
-Is it fishy?
-You told us to.

1643
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,090
Stop messing around.

1644
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,291
It is snowing so much that

1645
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,827
you can't see anything
in Gapyeong right now.

1646
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:11,728
THAT SCREWBALL

1647
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,730
-Which college?
-Sydney Maritime University.

1648
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,265
-What's your major?
-<i>Haenyeo</i>.

1649
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,866
-You majored in <i>Haenyeo?</i>
-Where?

1650
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,935
You don't just chop people,
you chop kimchi too.

1651
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,170
RUDENESS IS A GIVEN

1652
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,439
You're so annoying.
I hope you never come back.

1653
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,274
Are you going to eat these for free?

1654
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,543
What if we have fun
talking and goofing around?

1655
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,911
When is Sook's birthday?

1656
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:28,945
Isn't it obvious?

1657
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,213
How can you not know this?

1658
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,781
-When was it?
-I'm suddenly confused.

1659
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,783
I thought at least
one of you would guess it.

1660
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,652
What the heck?

1661
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,787
-Who was born on June 11th?
-No one, you idiot.

1662
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,355
Why did you write June 10, Jin-kyung?

1663
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,090
I misread yours.

1664
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,627
WILL KIM SOOK CAMPING END WELL?
