00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,581
FIVE ORDINARY LOOKING PEOPLE

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,419
ARE ENJOYING THEIR VACATION

3
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,289
RIGHT THEN…

4
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,391
Hello?

5
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,495
-Please find my little sister.
-What on earth?

6
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,331
-My sister, Na-bak, has gone missing!
-Who is it? What's it about?

7
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,700
Kim Na-bak, the vocalist
from the girl group, doLIVE.

8
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,235
-Is this for real?
-What is she saying?

9
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,170
-I haven't heard from her for three days.
-Who is it?

10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,405
She's not at her dorm.

11
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,409
Something bad must've happened to her.

12
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,711
Let's roll, guys.

13
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,847
IT'S TIME TO REVEAL
THEIR TRUE IDENTITIES

14
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,857
CHO SAE-HO
FLASHMAN

15
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,795
HONG JIN-KYUNG
WONDER WOMAN

16
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,434
Consider me a punching bag.
I'm just a weak kid from Weak Hero.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,501
JANG WOO-YOUNG
WEAK HERO

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,642
JOO WOO-JAE
OPTIMUS PRIME

19
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,048
KIM SOOK
HONG GIL-DONG

20
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,019
-All right!
-Let's go!

21
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,256
Breaking news.

22
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,093
Authorities confirmed that Ms. Kim Na-bak
of the beloved girl group, doLIVE,

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,062
has been missing for some time.

24
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,298
Her agency stated
that they couldn't reach Ms. Kim

25
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,134
since the afternoon of the 11th

26
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,471
and that she was last caught
on a CCTV camera near her dormitory.

27
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,807
Her whereabouts since then
remain a mystery.

28
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,710
Ms. Kim has been working
on producing her group's upcoming album

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,847
and has appeared in a variety of shows,
including variety shows and TV series.

30
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,584
This shocking incident will reverberate
across the entertainment industry.

31
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,887
The police are now investigating
the disappearance of Ms. Kim,

32
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,388
retracing her last steps first.

33
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,694
THIS IS DOLIVE'S DORMITORY,
WHERE KIM NA-BAK WAS LAST SEEN

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,296
-Where are we? Is this it?
-This seems to be it. Let's go.

35
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,665
-What's going on?
-Who the heck is he? Is he on our team?

36
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,501
We can wait a bit for the introductions.

37
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,536
MR. GREEN MAN SEEMS TO
WANT THE LEAD ROLE

38
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,205
-What's all this?
-Look ahead.

39
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,975
Is someone waiting for us here?

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,077
Hold on.
This may be the scene of the crime.

41
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,145
AN OMINOUS VIBE

42
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,880
Does it seem plain and peaceful?

43
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,116
-Is this the place?
-I think it's safe to enter.

44
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,284
HEROES' CAREFUL APPROACH

45
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,755
2ND FLOOR
LIVING ROOM - ENTRANCE

46
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,391
PAST THE ENTRANCE

47
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,660
Gosh, how pretty.

48
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,395
A UNIQUE INTERIOR AWAITS
BEHIND THE ORDINARY FACADE

49
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,131
THE SMELL OF PINE IS IN THE AIR

50
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,833
IN THIS 2-STORY DORM
SHARED BY THE IDOL GROUP

51
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,135
LOOKING AROUND

52
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,304
-My gosh.
-They share a log cabin together?

53
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,572
NOW, THEY MUST FIND CLUES

54
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,275
TO SAVE KIM NA-BAK,
DOLIVE'S MISSING VOCALIST

55
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,976
Let's take a seat in the living room.

56
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,780
We were just told
that Na-bak had been kidnapped.

57
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,917
A member of doLIVE has been kidnapped.

58
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,218
We've come to save her.

59
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,321
-Wait, not so fast.
-What's your deal?

60
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,822
-Isn't he Shrek?
-This case

61
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,891
will be the last one I work on
before I retire.

62
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,060
You'll see me unmask
for the first time after 44 years.

63
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,029
-Look forward to it.
-No, don't.

64
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,363
-Just don't.
-Please don't.

65
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,499
I hope you won't be so startled
to see me unmasked.

66
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,334
Wait, you look amazing right now.

67
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,069
I'll now show you my face.

68
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,370
-Come on, dude!
-Don't do it.

69
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,773
Oh, dear. Put it back on.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,609
-Just look at her expression.
-Put it back on.

71
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,110
FAILED TO MEET THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS

72
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,845
-Why would you…
-Look here.

73
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,281
-I'm concerned your popularity will drop.
-You think so?

74
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,983
THEN…

75
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,818
You seem pretty relaxed.

76
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,054
-Actual Transformers sound like that.
-I hear you.

77
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,589
Who are you?

78
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,657
-Reveal yourself!
-That must be the kidnapper.

79
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,860
So you volunteered to look into
the unprecedented kidnapping of an idol.

80
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,928
I'm impressed.

81
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,164
-The guy sounds familiar.
-Who are you?

82
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,466
I'll drop you a hint.

83
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,703
A HINT?

84
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,974
All events took place here,
the shared living space of the group.

85
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,809
Since that's the case,

86
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,745
you'll have to find all the hidden clues
and uncover the truths

87
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,814
to get to the bottom of this case

88
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,517
and find the missing Kim Na-bak.

89
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,388
ALL CLUES ARE IN THIS DORM

90
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,224
How you handle this case will tell me

91
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,660
if you're true heroes
or some weakling posers.

92
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,263
I'll keep a close eye on you.

93
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,065
Bear in mind
that if you fail to solve the case,

94
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,234
you'll be made to pay the price.

95
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,272
Now, time isn't on your side.

96
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:37,277
Search the rooms for clues
that will help you find Kim Na-bak.

97
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,813
Would finding Kim Na-bak
be the end of this case?

98
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,148
Put your mask back on.

99
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,485
I don't get you at all.
What nonsense are you talking about?

100
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,552
HEARTFELT PIECE OF ADVICE

101
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,654
Did you have to snap at me

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,789
-to wear the mask?
-The guy said there are clues here.

103
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,857
MOVING ON TO THE NEXT ROOM

104
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,727
2ND FLOOR - DOLIVE'S ROOM

105
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,230
DOLIVE'S ROOM

106
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,834
They won a number of trophies.

107
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,536
Look, "SBC's So Popular."

108
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,671
TROPHIES PROVE THEIR FAME

109
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,972
Let's check everywhere.

110
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,440
-Hey, look.
-What?

111
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,942
Look at the monthly planner.
Right, they live here.

112
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,110
VISIBLE RIGHT UPON ENTRY

113
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,780
MONTHLY PLANNER FOR JUNE

114
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,081
KDS' MUSIC BUNKER, MBS' MUSIC LUNCH

115
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,716
Their calendar is jam-packed.

116
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,152
HIGHLY SOUGHT-AFTER GROUP IS FULLY BOOKED

117
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,689
Which one of them is Kim Na-bak anyway?

118
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,425
HONG GIL-DONG FOUND SOMETHING ON THE WALL

119
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,759
Isn't that Woo-jae?

120
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,163
DOLIVE'S POSTER ON THE WALL

121
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,031
Gosh, that's incredible.

122
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,533
THEY ALL LOOK SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR

123
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,335
They came up with clever names.

124
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,903
Our crew members are great at it.

125
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,707
Wait, look at Kim Na-bak.

126
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,809
She looks so much like Woo-jae!

127
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,411
AT A GLANCE,
ANYONE MIGHT MISTAKE THE TWO

128
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,780
I found something here.

129
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,549
BUT WOO-JAE ISN'T INTERESTED

130
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,217
I found a diary, guys.

131
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,154
A DIARY OF "KNB" ON THE TABLE

132
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,857
Let me read you one of the entries.

133
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:02,729
"I secretly tried on Young-GD's dress
that she jumped through hoops to secure."

134
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,399
"It seemed much nicer than mine,
so I decided to let her off the hook."

135
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,168
KIM NA-BAK SWAPPED HER DRESS
WITH LEE YOUNG-GD'S IN SECRET

136
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:13,106
"I was the talk of the town tonight.
Perhaps it was thanks to that dress."

137
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,808
"I did quarrel with Young-GD
after the event."

138
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,411
It must be her, then.
The kidnapper has to be Young-GD.

139
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:19,979
Young-GD?

140
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,483
COULD LEE YOUNG-GD HAVE KIDNAPPED HER?
AFTER THE FIGHT OVER THE DRESS?

141
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,118
Young-GD?

142
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,187
"Both Woo-jae and I had
some free time today,

143
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,123
so we had a date in his car."

144
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,292
"Woo-jae's such an empathetic person."
She got that right.

145
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,628
"Chats with him are always delightful."

146
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,065
Shouldn't we have to add this "Woo-jae"
to our list of suspects?

147
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,833
But she got along fine with him.

148
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,236
HER DIARY SUGGESTS THEY WERE ON GOOD TERMS

149
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,272
"Beauty's acting career forced us…

150
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,908
-Is that Na-bak's diary?
-…to cancel an event." Yeah.

151
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,010
Who's Beauty? Apparently,
doLIVE had to cancel an event

152
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,445
-because of her acting gig.
-Beauty?

153
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,679
-That'd be me.
-What was that?

154
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,582
They had to cancel an event
because of her acting gig.

155
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,784
HAN BEAUTY, AN ACTOR-IDOL

156
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,854
The head of the agency told me
that I'd be given the "center" position.

157
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:06,893
Beauty argued that I had no right when
she learned that I'd be replacing her.

158
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,930
IN THE END, BEAUTY LOST
THE "CENTER" POSITION TO NA-BAK

159
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,199
DID HAN BEAUTY KIDNAP HER OUT OF SPITE?

160
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,500
We have so many suspects.

161
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,603
RIGHT AT THAT MOMENT

162
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,039
SHREK SPOTS SOMETHING

163
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,509
First off, we should check this out.

164
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,378
I think this might be a hint for us.

165
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446
Look.

166
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,081
The Post-it notes on the board

167
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:33,553
are color-coded in orange, pink, blue…

168
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,122
-You get it, don't you?
-Sure.

169
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,024
The same goes for the fish in the bowl.

170
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,026
They're color-coded.

171
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,595
WHAT DOES THE COLOR OF THE FISH
HAVE TO DO

172
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,831
WITH THE COLOR OF THE POST-IT NOTES?

173
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,100
Wait. The pink notes
are for character-building classes.

174
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,002
The yellow ones are for lessons.

175
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,472
The orange ones are for music shows.

176
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,777
WHAT'S THIS?

177
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,878
BOOKINGS FOR JUNE

178
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,481
MANAGER'S PLANNER LISTS
ALL THE MEMBERS' ENGAGEMENTS

179
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,216
Hold on.

180
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,851
There's a priority of engagements.

181
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,786
Character-building classes come first.

182
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,923
EVENT PRIORITY IS FOUND
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CALENDAR

183
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,793
Next are music shows, lessons,
variety shows, and other events.

184
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,330
-I'll count character-building classes.
-Pink notes.

185
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,499
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

186
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,633
First off…

187
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,337
We should always start from note-taking.

188
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,005
So they had
eight character-building classes.

189
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,740
They only attended three music shows.

190
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,375
"Dance lesson."

191
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,477
-They had 12 lessons in total.
-Got it.

192
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,146
-What about variety shows?
-One, two, three…

193
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,448
-Just three.
-Okay.

194
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,351
-They had five other events.
-Got it.

195
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,986
I'll write them down.

196
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,487
DO THESE NUMBERS MEAN ANYTHING?

197
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,024
Wait. They had
many character-building classes.

198
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,693
What could possibly be here?

199
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,761
Whose are these?

200
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,431
-Do you know whose these are?
-A pair of gloves?

201
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,499
THAT'S SO RANDOM

202
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,134
THE PAIR IS ESPECIALLY LONG AND WHITE

203
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,369
Why do we have these here?

204
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,204
Those are mine.

205
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,872
Are you for real?

206
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,107
DANG IT

207
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,044
THE GLOVES' OWNER
IS PREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING

208
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,412
KIM NA-BAK'S DIARY

209
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,783
Why don't we write down the relationship
between Na-bak and others?

210
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,351
Who does she have bad blood with?

211
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,288
-Han Beauty…
-Okay, Han Beauty.

212
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,355
"CENTER" RIVALS

213
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,091
-Don't forget Lee Young-GD.
-She's had beef with Young-GD too?

214
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,660
-Yeah.
-Things are bad between them.

215
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,095
It didn't seem like
No Joints liked her either.

216
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,964
"No Joints is older than me."

217
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,301
"I hate how she acts like we're peers
whenever we're on a show together."

218
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,904
-Na-bak had pent up issues.
-That much is clear.

219
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,673
-She doesn't get along with anyone.
-No.

220
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,275
It says Sook and her smoking habits…

221
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,977
Did she mind my doing that?
Wait, it's not me.

222
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,745
-Well, yeah.
-Did she argue with that Kim Sook?

223
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,582
Apparently, she snapped
and yanked Sook's hair.

224
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,716
KIM SOOK, HEAVY SMOKER

225
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,318
So they fought, huh?

226
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,153
She has some issues for sure.

227
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,389
I don't think Kim Na-bak
conducted herself well.

228
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,159
Kim Na-bak doesn't get along with anyone.

229
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,129
KIM NA-BAK HAS HAD BAD BLOOD
WITH ALL OF HER GROUP MEMBERS

230
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:01,233
THIS MEANS ALL OF THEM
ARE POSSIBLE SUSPECTS!

231
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,769
Hold on.

232
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,672
-Look at these photos.
-Yeah, I've seen them.

233
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,143
POLAROIDS DECORATING THE PILLAR

234
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,919
Hold on. I noticed something strange.

235
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,020
What is it, Jin-kyung?

236
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,523
-Na-bak took a photograph with Woo-jae.
-Yeah?

237
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,792
But Young-GD also took one with him.

238
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:31,564
Woo-jae must've been involved
with both Na-bak and Young-GD.

239
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,099
So she stole him from her colleague?

240
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,968
Maybe the girls found out
about Woo-jae two-timing them.

241
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,572
Couldn't that have driven
Young-GD and Na-bak into fighting?

242
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,707
"Both Woo-jae and I had
some free time today…"

243
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,808
I suppose.

244
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,043
NO ONE CARES

245
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,846
WOO-YOUNG GOES OVER THEIR ALBUMS

246
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,614
Their first album was titled "Dance."

247
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,751
Just Dance? Dance, plain and simple.

248
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
IT ONLY FEATURES THEIR DEBUT SONG

249
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,788
That's Not Enough.

250
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,792
I See, You See.

251
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,229
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT TITLE SCREAMS
"INTENSE, DANCE-HEAVY TRACK"

252
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,033
WOO-YOUNG DIDN'T FIND
ANY CLUES FROM THE ALBUMS

253
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:13,039
DESPITE THEIR EFFORTS,
NO LEADS HAVE TURNED UP SO FAR

254
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,275
It's just a fish bowl.
There's nothing special about it.

255
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,578
THE FISH BOWL LOOKS UNREMARKABLE

256
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,881
I don't think there are leads
in this room.

257
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,884
IN THE END, HE LEAVES THE ROOM

258
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,852
Excuse me.

259
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,256
When can we chat again?

260
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,725
Help us out, will you?

261
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,127
No, let's try this.
Come write this, Woo-young.

262
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,762
WEAK-WILLED HERO…

263
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,132
REVIEWING THE MANAGER'S PLANNER AGAIN

264
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,004
I bet there's something missing
on the monthly planner for June.

265
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,607
The 6th, the 7th…

266
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,742
Music Lunch.

267
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,845
On the 8th, they were set to appear
on SBC's So Popular.

268
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,748
Character-building class,
vocal lesson, dance lesson…

269
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,717
Matched. Matched.

270
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,385
-That's another match, right?
-Yeah.

271
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,586
That's a match. That too.

272
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,690
DETAILS ON THE CALENDAR AND PLANNER MATCH

273
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,526
IS THERE REALLY NOTHING
HIDDEN ON THE CALENDAR?

274
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,096
I wonder why this side is left empty.

275
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,332
WHILE THE JUNE CALENDAR IS FULL

276
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,235
NOTHING IS ON THE JULY CALENDAR

277
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,570
Shall we fill this side up?

278
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,239
Let's write the July engagements down.
I read them in the planner.

279
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,007
-Yeah, they're on here.
-Exactly.

280
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,109
Will it change anything?

281
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,544
-I'll write them anyway.
-Okay.

282
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,246
Orange notes for music shows.

283
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,614
Music shows.

284
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,416
Pink notes for character-building classes.

285
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,852
I doubt we're supposed to
put up everything.

286
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,919
What's the clue?

287
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,922
You don't think we're supposed to do this?
What are the Post-it notes for then?

288
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,624
-I still don't think this is it.
-Really?

289
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,794
I wonder why they put them here.

290
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,062
THEY MUST BE SIGNIFICANT IN SOME WAY

291
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,264
The Post-it notes
must be here for a reason.

292
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,933
Look at those Post-it notes.
Shall we put them on the July calendar?

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,836
-Do we put these all up?
-Let's do that. You never know.

294
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,004
HE TENDS TO JUMP INTO ACTION

295
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,206
-Huh?
-What's wrong?

296
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,876
-What? There are photos inside.
-Kim Na-bak and…

297
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,313
INSIDE THE FIRST ALBUM ARE PHOTOCARDS

298
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,015
-Only this album has photos.
-I see what these are.

299
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,217
-No others have them.
-These are photocards.

300
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,886
-It's the only one.
-Those are the photocards.

301
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,187
I bet these are just props.

302
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,722
But other albums don't have any.

303
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,924
On Tuesday, July 1st,

304
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,059
they have an outside event.

305
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,761
-Can you put these on?
-I'll take them.

306
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,730
-Just match the colors.
-All right.

307
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,431
An outside event. A festival.

308
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,066
But seeing how they left it empty,

309
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,570
they wanted us to put
the information up there.

310
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,776
AN IN-DEPTH STUDY
OF DOLIVE'S MONTHLY ENGAGEMENTS

311
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,845
I can't be sure
if this will get us anywhere.

312
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,914
Is there meaning in all this?

313
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,115
An outside event on the 15th.

314
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,617
THOSE WITHOUT IDEAS OR TRICKS

315
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,953
MUST HANDLE THE BUSY WORK…

316
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,388
A character-building class and a shoot.

317
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,356
An outside event on the 31st. That's it.

318
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,858
THEY WENT OVER
THE PLANS OF 31 DAYS

319
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,293
JULY CALENDAR COMPLETED

320
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,628
They do have a tight schedule.

321
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,832
They have many more bookings
compared to June. It must've been rough.

322
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,899
-I know.
-Right.

323
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:01,841
NUMBER OF BOOKINGS FOR JULY SPIKED
COMPARED TO THAT OF JUNE

324
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,745
-Hey, just a second.
-What is it?

325
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,080
-Hey, just a second.
-What is it?

326
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,783
Character-building, music shows, lessons,
variety shows, and outside events.

327
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,785
-Yeah?
-That's the list of priorities.

328
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,986
In that case… Let's see.

329
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,487
They need character-building the most.

330
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,356
-How many classes do they have?
-Wait!

331
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,659
-We have a D.
-What?

332
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,127
What's next? Music shows?

333
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,195
THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

334
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,832
DID HE JUST DRAW A "D" WITH HIS HAND?

335
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,367
-"D"?
-Yeah.

336
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,137
-That's what you see?
-Yeah.

337
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,873
-They must form an alphabet each.
-It's an N!

338
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,342
An N! I see an N here. An N.

339
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,310
-Great.
-Wait. Lessons are yellow, right?

340
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,378
THEY FOUND LETTERS?

341
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,946
GOSH, THIS IS UNEXPECTED

342
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,115
THE PINK POST-ITS REVEAL THE CLUE

343
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,317
THE LETTER "D"

344
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,019
-I found an N here.
-We've got an N.

345
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,255
THE LESSON SCHEDULE
FORMS AN "N"

346
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,223
And the outside events… That's an E.

347
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,225
THE OUTSIDE EVENT SCHEDULE
FORMS AN "E"

348
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,661
FIND THE ALPHABETICAL LETTERS
THAT THE SCHEDULES FORM

349
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,830
AND ARRANGE THEM
ACCORDING TO THE SET PRIORITY

350
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,431
CHARACTER-BUILDING: PINK
MUSIC SHOWS: ORANGE

351
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,833
LESSONS: YELLOW
VARIETY SHOWS: GREEN

352
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,901
OUTSIDE EVENTS: BLUE

353
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,803
We then get "dance."

354
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,672
That's it. "Dance."

355
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,409
THE CLUE IS REVEALED AT LAST

356
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,944
That's it. "Dance."

357
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,414
Their first album was titled "Dance."

358
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,650
Just Dance?

359
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,051
Dance, plain and simple.

360
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,553
-That must mean their first album.
-"Dance."

361
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,855
"Dance." Great!

362
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,490
We're on fire here.

363
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,791
Great job.

364
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,359
-Let's check the CD.
-"Dance."

365
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,560
WHAT CLUE WILL THEY FIND?

366
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,297
-These were in that album.
-These must be the clue.

367
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,433
PHOTOCARDS OF THE MEMBERS

368
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,302
-It was the only album with photos.
-"In the Water."

369
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:40,105
AND THE SONG, "IN THE WATER"

370
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,173
These must be the clue.

371
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,175
-It was the only album with photos.
-"In the Water."

372
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,244
-Something must be in the water!
-Oh, that's it.

373
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,046
-I did go through it.
-This must be it.

374
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,380
-This is it.
-Shall I take these

375
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,749
and put them on the Post-it notes?

376
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,917
What's this?

377
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,687
What can this be?

378
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,655
THERE IT IS!

379
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,624
-This is it.
-Found it.

380
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,025
It's a key, guys.

381
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,661
But I did go through this earlier.

382
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,163
-I'm getting chills.
-All right.

383
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,633
-Let's go to the management room.
-I rummaged through this.

384
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,102
And you thought of checking
beneath the stone. You're a genius.

385
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,604
-That was incredible. You did us a solid.
-Well done.

386
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,239
-He sure did.
-I'm glad we put those up.

387
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,075
-Tell me about it.
-Sae-ho, your suggestion

388
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,444
turned out to be a stroke of genius.

389
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,611
All right!

390
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,247
LET'S FIND OUT
THE LEAD THEY MISSED

391
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,850
SOOK FOUND PHOTOCARDS EARLIER

392
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,319
IF THEY TAKE OUT
THE MISSING KIM NA-BAK'S PHOTO

393
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,621
AND PUT THE REMAINING PHOTOS TOGETHER…

394
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,492
STONE

395
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,663
STONE IN THE WATER

396
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,766
THEY'VE CERTAINLY COME A LONG WAY
SINCE EPISODE 13 OF BEAT COIN

397
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,702
WE DID IT

398
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,770
Where's the key?

399
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,638
I have it here.
Let's go to the management room.

400
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,073
It was amazing.

401
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,541
-How smart you are.
-It was great.

402
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:50,976
You're so bright.

403
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,013
Goodness.

404
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,548
WHY IS HE LINGERING?

405
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,650
How on earth
did they see an A out of that?

406
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,419
This is fun.

407
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,754
Woo-young.

408
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,957
IT TURNS OUT THEY MADE A MISTAKE
WHILE PUTTING UP THE POST-IT NOTES

409
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,826
-We're here.
-Look. It's the management room.

410
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,894
It's upstairs.

411
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,962
Man, how fun is this?

412
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,097
3RD FLOOR - APPEARANCE
&amp; MENTAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT ROOM

413
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,000
THEY LEAVE THE TRIUMPH OF
THE FIRST ROOM BEHIND

414
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,004
IT'S TIME TO OPEN THE SECOND ROOM

415
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,339
APPEARANCE &amp; MENTAL HEALTH
MANAGEMENT ROOM

416
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,107
APPEARANCE &amp; MENTAL HEALTH
MANAGEMENT ROOM

417
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,010
GYM EQUIPMENT TO HELP THEM STAY IN SHAPE

418
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,148
COSMETICS AND OTHER TOOLS
TO ENHANCE THEIR LOOKS

419
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,051
WHAT LEADS WILL THEY FIND HERE?

420
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,286
Mental health, huh?

421
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,988
-Looking good.
-They must receive therapy here.

422
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,891
Look, they're filming us.

423
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,492
A STRANGE CAMERA

424
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,630
"FACE ID" LABEL

425
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,965
I suppose we must pass
the facial recognition test?

426
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,835
CAN THAT BE TRUE?

427
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,470
WOO-JAE TRIES IT

428
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,639
Face recognition failure.

429
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:56,575
YOUR FACE WAS NEVER REGISTERED,
BUT YOU THOUGHT IT'D WORK?

430
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,812
"WHAT SHOULD I DO?"

431
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,414
A COOL GUY LIKE ME DOESN'T GIVE UP

432
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,816
TWO FOLDERS ARE ON THE SCREEN

433
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,318
THE FOLDER "FACE ID" CATCHES HIS EYE

434
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,953
IS THIS IT?

435
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,088
A code?

436
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,457
We have to find a code.

437
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,292
CLICK THE FOLDER "FACE ID"

438
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,329
YOU'LL SEE A PLASTIC SURGEON'S
CONSULTATION FILE

439
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,732
BUT TO ACCESS THE FILE, YOU NEED A CODE

440
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,401
We have to find a code.

441
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,002
A CODE?

442
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,704
"Therapy notes. Kim Na-bak."

443
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,272
WILL THE OTHER FOLDER HOLD A CLUE?

444
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,942
LET'S CLICK THE FILE ANYWAY!

445
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,678
KIM NA-BAK'S THERAPY NOTES APPEAR

446
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,013
"She considers even a small weight gain
as a significant one."

447
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,649
"Her obsessive attitude toward weight
suggests a high level of stress."

448
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,151
They say she's emotionally unstable.

449
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,887
"She expresses anxiety, saying
that her secret should never be revealed."

450
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,324
"But she refuses to discuss
the actual secret throughout the session."

451
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,160
WHAT IS THE SECRET THAT NA-BAK
WANTED TO HIDE SO BADLY?

452
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,996
HE FAILS TO FIND ANY LEADS
OTHER THAN THE THERAPY NOTES

453
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,432
Na-bak must've been on these medications.

454
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,601
Goodness.

455
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,903
-Weight-loss drugs.
-It must've been rough on her.

456
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,240
HINTS OF NA-BAK'S OBSESSION
WITH HER WEIGHT

457
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,375
She was rather fixated on her weight…

458
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,811
AS A FELLOW IDOL,
HIS HEART MUST GO OUT TO HER

459
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,747
WHILE THE TEAM ROAMS THE ROOM
WITHOUT FINDING ANYTHING CONCRETE

460
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,617
FLASHMAN FINDS SOMETHING

461
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,020
A FILE?

462
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,023
PLASTIC SURGEON'S CONSULTATION FILE

463
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,759
For the Face ID,
these might come in handy.

464
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,929
-We have their photos here.
-They did a consultation with a surgeon.

465
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,900
MEMBERS OF DOLIVE HAD A CONSULTATION
WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON

466
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,334
-"Plastic Surgeon"?
-It's this file.

467
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,702
THE FILE THAT WAS LOCKED UNDER A CODE

468
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,206
THE NAMES ARE THE SAME!

469
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,974
THEY MAY FIND CLUES
FOR THE CODE HERE

470
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,509
Who's this with a huge sum for a quote?

471
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,913
HER QUOTE EXCEEDS 17 MILLION WON

472
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,448
HMMM

473
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,816
Thirteen million? That's huge.

474
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,854
Epicanthoplasty, double eyelid surgery,
and facial contouring cost 7.8 million.

475
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,391
But the last photo is missing the price.
I think we have to fill it in.

476
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,994
FLASHMAN BELIEVES THAT IS THE KEY LEAD
FOR THE CONSULTATION FOLDER'S CODE

477
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,296
We've got a calculation quiz.

478
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,398
-Woo-jae, crunch the numbers.
-It's a calculation quiz.

479
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,267
Run the numbers
and find out the missing quote.

480
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,536
Are there overlaps?

481
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,405
Were they recommended the same procedure?

482
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,573
I bet they did.

483
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,410
In that case, we have a linear equation
with multiple unknowns.

484
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,179
A LINEAR EQUATION WITH MULTIPLE UNKNOWNS

485
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,315
I have a sheet of paper here.

486
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,184
-I can write up equations right away.
-Be my guest.

487
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,286
-Can I get a pen?
-Here.

488
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,388
Gosh, you're incredible.

489
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,458
-Let's say the total amount is X,
-He studied hard.

490
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,261
which includes the prices
of double lid surgery,

491
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,129
-epicanthoplasty…
-Epicanthoplasty.

492
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,531
…facial contouring…

493
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,368
-Lip filler injection.
-…lip filler, and face-lift.

494
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,770
This much equals 4.8 million won…

495
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,239
Just take out the nose job.

496
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,108
Na-bak was recommended all the procedures
these two were suggested

497
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,309
except for the nose job.

498
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,211
INTUITIVE SOOK
DOESN'T NEED EQUATIONS

499
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,480
-Look, Sae-ho.
-Yeah?

500
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,749
If we take out 6.4 million
from the 7.8 million…

501
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,418
Eye-related surgeries are canceled out,
leaving the nose job and lip filler.

502
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,554
So facial contouring
costs 1.4 million more

503
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,689
compared to the nose job
and lip filler combined.

504
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,425
How much did the lip filler cost again?

505
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,661
We can strike out
the nose job and the face-lift.

506
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,330
The difference between lip filler
and facial contouring is 4.8 million, no?

507
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,133
So the difference between lip filler
and facial contouring is 4.8 million.

508
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,470
Facial contouring minus lip filler,
and you get 4.8 million won.

509
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:15,340
Facial contouring gets struck out.
So 4.8 million minus 1.4 million

510
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,742
equals a nose job.

511
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,210
In that case…

512
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,445
a nose job costs 3.4 million won.

513
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,981
-A nose job costs 3.4 million?
-Yeah, it does.

514
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,150
Take out 3.4 million from 13 million.

515
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,785
-It's 9.6 million.
-In that case…

516
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,587
Add 9.6 million and 7.8 million.

517
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,655
-That's right.
-Yeah.

518
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,857
-Let's add 9.6 million and 7.8 million.
-That's how it works.

519
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,458
-In total, it's 17.4 million.
-Okay.

520
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,328
So the code is 1, 7, 4, 0.

521
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,396
-Confirm.
-There you go.

522
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,465
IT OPENED

523
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,535
TRIUMPH OF SOOK'S INTUITION
AND WOO-JAE'S CALCULATION

524
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,771
-I can't believe it.
-Great job, Woo-jae.

525
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,939
-I knew it'd work.
-It's insane.

526
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,742
WHAT IS THIS ANYWAY?

527
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,678
FACE ID CAN ONLY RECOGNIZE
THE FACE IN THE PHOTO

528
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,681
TO GET READY, YOU MUST APPLY MAKEUP
WHILE WEARING THE DESIGNATED EQUIPMENT

529
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,749
So I must apply makeup
to look like this photo.

530
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,084
Could we perhaps print the photo?

531
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,487
"You must apply makeup
while wearing the designated equipment"?

532
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,790
TO GET READY, YOU MUST APPLY MAKEUP

533
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,725
WHILE WEARING THE DESIGNATED EQUIPMENT

534
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,561
-Maybe we have to apply makeup to him.
-He has to use those?

535
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,496
We've got the tools here.

536
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,132
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK

537
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,001
-This person?
-Who is it?

538
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,703
-You have a delivery.
-A delivery?

539
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,904
We get deliveries here?

540
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,373
-What the heck?
-Who is it?

541
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,141
-A delivery?
-Who on earth are you?

542
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,344
-Get over here, you.
-Who are you?

543
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,611
ARE HEROES ALLOWED TO BEAT PEOPLE UP?

544
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,046
-Get him in the corner.
-Don't let go.

545
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,848
If it's something fishy,
we're not letting you go.

546
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,916
YOU'RE SO DONE THEN

547
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,285
If it's some weird stuff…
It's a portable TENS unit.

548
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,954
This doesn't look good. A TENS unit?

549
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,622
IT STIMULATES MUSCLES TO RELIEVE PAIN

550
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,725
Can you give me a minute, Woo-jae?

551
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,859
-Me?
-Yes.

552
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,128
-You're the recipient.
-The order must've been made in your name.

553
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,597
Don't try anything funny on me.
I won't stand for it.

554
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,199
This must be the equipment
you have to wear.

555
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,500
"The designated equipment."

556
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,735
-I get it now.
-She's right.

557
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,603
It should go to the person
who has to wear makeup.

558
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,605
-That's you in the photo.
-So it's you.

559
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,474
HMM…

560
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,676
-It's you.
-Na-bak is you.

561
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,311
This is really bugging me.

562
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,379
BUT THEY'RE NOT WRONG

563
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,115
EMBRACE YOUR FATE

564
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,583
Dang it! It hurts already!

565
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,418
-I don't buy that.
-Come on.

566
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,486
He hasn't turned it on yet.

567
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,124
What's the current level now?

568
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,191
It feels so weird!

569
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,793
-You're hopeless.
-He's weak.

570
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,861
It feels weird!

571
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,195
This isn't me moving my arms.

572
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,030
Are you sure it's safe?

573
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,599
-It's all good.
-Shouldn't we dial it down?

574
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,167
-We should.
-Apply the rouge.

575
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,436
-Do I have to do it myself?
-Let's hurry.

576
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:25,604
No, I don't think so.

577
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,872
No, he has to do it.

578
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,507
-He has to do it himself?
-Yeah.

579
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,775
-What on earth?
-But he can't.

580
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,611
-He can't do it.
-What do we do?

581
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,680
My gosh.

582
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,149
You poor thing.

583
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,284
Goodness, Na-bak.

584
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,887
-Are we done?
-Your lips are.

585
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,055
Next up is the eyeliner. Take this.

586
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,390
BUZZ, BUZZ

587
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,458
KEK

588
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,027
-My gosh.
-It's so funny.

589
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,896
-He did fine with the numbers…
-He's shaking badly.

590
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,634
Why don't you put the mirror down?

591
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,937
He has to apply false eyelashes too.

592
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,539
There you go. Put down the mirror.

593
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,241
WHAT ON EARTH GOES ON
IN PRODUCTION MEETINGS?

594
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,443
Looking good.

595
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,877
-Create some depth now.
-Depth?

596
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,978
If I put the tip here,

597
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,413
the machine will do its job.

598
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,248
See it doing the work? There we go.

599
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,050
-He's picked up some tricks already.
-Okay.

600
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,251
Apply these false lashes.

601
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,320
Did Na-bak get false lashes
on her bottom or top lashes?

602
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,755
On her top lashes, for sure.

603
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,024
-What is this anyway?
-Those are false lashes.

604
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,425
How am I supposed to apply them?

605
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,128
-Close your eyes and put them on here.
-Right on your lash line.

606
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,097
TAP, TAP

607
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,199
How will he ever manage it?

608
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,835
Hold them up by your eyeline
and put them on when the unit jolts you.

609
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,137
-Here comes the jolt.
-Did you cut them up?

610
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,473
-They have to be cut up…
-Did they stick?

611
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,741
-I did it. Okay.
-You did it.

612
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,276
He's good at this.

613
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,945
I should become a makeup artist.

614
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,814
-Is there a contouring kit as well?
-Yeah.

615
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,116
-Contour won't take so long.
-It's done.

616
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,551
-My gosh.
-You're doing great.

617
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,253
-Man, you're good.
-It's going well.

618
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,321
-You think I'm done?
-Yeah.

619
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,388
-He's talented.
-Try it.

620
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,823
MAKEUP COMPLETE

621
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,025
Tell him he's nailed it, you punks!

622
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,427
All right. Face ID!

623
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,362
All right. Face ID!

624
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,430
WILL IT WORK?

625
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,401
Facial recognition success.

626
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,770
-Okay.
-Take the lashes off him.

627
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,838
HE'S DONE ALL HE COULD

628
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:07,906
KNOCK, KNOCK, AGAIN

629
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,808
-What on earth? Who is it?
-It's another delivery.

630
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,877
KIM JONG-HO
PART-TIME COURIER

631
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,044
We have another package.

632
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,947
GOT A MYSTERIOUS LETTER

633
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,817
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

634
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,152
"Mr. J already has the key."

635
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,988
We must have a key of some sort.

636
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,758
-By "Mr. J," they could mean me, Woo-jae…
-Who can that be?

637
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,460
-…or Woo-young.
-Oh, you're right.

638
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,995
What key are we supposed to have?

639
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,496
One of you must have the key.

640
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,899
-Bring it here.
-Can it be inside my wig?

641
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,967
"Mr. J already has the key"?

642
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,269
Wait, when we got here…

643
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,603
Hold on, freeze.

644
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,705
Jin-kyung, you came here
straight from your car, right?

645
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:41,773
-Yeah.
-Hey, Sae-ho.

646
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,075
-You came straight from your car, right?
-Yeah.

647
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,877
Sook. Same goes for you, right?

648
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,113
-Along with your managers and all?
-Sure.

649
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,015
Has the crew given you anything?

650
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,750
Anything other than the mics, that is.

651
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,519
-Can it be inside the mic pouch?
-It has to be, right?

652
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,587
Maybe I have it with me.

653
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,888
Check the mic pouch.

654
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,057
THEY START RUMMAGING
THROUGH THEIR MIC POUCHES

655
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,259
Did I get it wrong? Maybe I was reaching?

656
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,395
-Not at all. It's likely.
-It's worth checking.

657
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,963
-It's possible.
-Yeah.

658
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,164
Jeez, you.

659
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,432
-What's the matter?
-It's here.

660
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,500
Geez, you.

661
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,668
-What's the matter?
-It's here.

662
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,003
-Really?
-That's incredible.

663
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,305
-My gosh.
-I found it.

664
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,573
You're on a roll today.

665
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,674
I got it.

666
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,076
-Do you play escape games all the time?
-Not at all.

667
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,945
-What's going on?
-My gosh.

668
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,012
Which room is the key for?

669
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,480
-The dining room.
-How are you so good?

670
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,749
I suppose we made some progress.

671
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,820
DINING ROOM

672
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,756
-We're doing great. I mean, the mic pouch?
-It was incredible.

673
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,792
-All right.
-My gosh.

674
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,996
WHAT SECRET AWAITS THEM
IN THE DINING ROOM?

675
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,766
-Guys.
-Hello!

676
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,834
WHAT WAS THAT JUST NOW?

677
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,836
-Huh?
-How come you're here?

678
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,606
Are you the new trainees I heard about?

679
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:48,807
Didn't you make pancakes?

680
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,475
You could've just knocked.

681
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,778
You used to make pancakes, didn't you?

682
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,448
WATCH OUT FOR HIS LOOK-ALIKE

683
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,216
Hello.

684
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,885
Hello. Where are we? What can we do here?

685
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,053
DINING ROOM

686
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,925
2ND FLOOR - DINING ROOM

687
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,827
DINING ROOM

688
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,731
THE MEMBERS' OBSESSION WITH WEIGHT LOSS
SHOWS CLEARLY

689
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,399
First things first.

690
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,068
Are we supposed to eat something here?

691
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,205
I notice this padlock here.

692
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,341
A BOX WITH A PADLOCK IN THE KITCHEN

693
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,344
-How do we crack that lock? With a code?
-"Banned Food List."

694
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,979
It's like a directional pad.

695
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,247
THEY MUST ENTER DIRECTIONS

696
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,815
A directional pad? That's clever.

697
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,119
I think we're supposed to
find the clue using this chart.

698
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,654
What with the calorie information…

699
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,557
CAN THE BANNED FOOD LIST
ON THE WALL GIVE THEM A CLUE?

700
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,625
BANNED FOOD LIST

701
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,029
First off, aren't you at all hungry?

702
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,096
-Sure.
-We are hungry.

703
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,899
I think I've got it.
Okay, let's take a look.

704
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,435
What is that? "Weight Change Chart?"

705
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,503
WEIGHT CHANGE CHART

706
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,739
A CHART ON THE REFRIGERATOR
DETAILS THE MEMBERS' WEIGHT CHANGE

707
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,877
If you ask me, this chart will tell us
the directions in the code.

708
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,311
-I guess.
-Right?

709
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,348
-Let's check Na-bak's data.
-Look here.

710
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:07,185
Na-bak weighed the least
until other girls took her place.

711
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:08,787
NA-BAK: PURPLE

712
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,289
NO JOINTS AND HAN BEAUTY
OVERTOOK HER AFTER MAY

713
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,024
Two other girls now weigh less than her.

714
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,526
Let's check the food on the list.

715
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,094
-Let's keep this.
-What are we checking?

716
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,762
Shall we get something to eat?

717
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,231
-My gosh.
-Everyone, here's your snack.

718
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,634
-It's the worst.
-The trainees staying here…

719
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,402
-I thought you were a chef.
-…are preparing

720
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,605
to release a new album.
That's why their diet is limited to these.

721
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,307
-What on earth?
-I love it.

722
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,375
It's a light meal.

723
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,710
-Here you go.
-Can we eat this?

724
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,778
But tomatoes aren't on the list.

725
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,747
Of course not. You won't find it there.

726
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:36,815
THAT'S A BANNED FOOD LIST

727
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,882
Come here.

728
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,117
LET'S BRAINSTORM OVER A SNACK

729
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,185
Let's all sit down.

730
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,587
Cucumbers aren't on the list either.

731
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,557
I wonder how many calories this holds.
Did you say it wasn't on the list?

732
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,125
-Nope.
-It wasn't there.

733
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,660
Everyone.

734
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,994
Everyone.

735
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,863
Can you guess how many calories
a potato contains?

736
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,798
-Do you have a pen?
-Now.

737
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,067
How many calories
does a cheeseburger contain?

738
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,902
-It contains 700 kcal.
-That's correct.

739
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,205
Eat it, and you won't ever
get in shape for your promotion.

740
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:02,407
-Understood.
-I won't bother.

741
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,675
What about ice cream?

742
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,210
-That has 1,000 kcal.
-Correct.

743
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,611
Do you think you could debut

744
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,947
-even after eating it?
-Is he giving us a hint?

745
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,081
-No.
-That's right.

746
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,783
I think he has an idea of sorts.

747
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,218
HMM…

748
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,121
Let's talk about that padlock.

749
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,124
It shows four directions.
Up, right, down, and left.

750
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,259
-I'd say the code is a pattern.
-We have to find it.

751
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:25,130
Kim Na-bak weighed the least in the group

752
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,165
until she gained a bit after May.

753
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,233
-Yeah.
-Right.

754
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,101
Let's take that into account.

755
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,403
THE ONLY LEAD THEY HAVE
IS THE WEIGHT CHANGE CHART

756
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,606
Her fellow members
had extreme weight loss.

757
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,908
You won't believe my troubles

758
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,812
working as a personal chef
for this idol group.

759
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,481
The girls sneak out
to get snacks all the time.

760
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,417
-Behind their manager's back!
-So they sneak out for snacks?

761
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,320
-He seems to be giving us a hint.
-Yeah.

762
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,690
Would we have to find out
who snuck out to eat?

763
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,459
They tried to be secretive, all right.

764
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,495
But to do that, they'd have to
discard all the evidence, right?

765
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,364
So they try to hide it

766
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,465
or throw it away.

767
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,500
That means it's still somewhere.
Let's find it.

768
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,903
-So they hid it, huh?
-Will it be inside the refrigerator?

769
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,705
-They must've left a trace of some sort.
-Yeah.

770
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,474
There it is.

771
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,075
FOUND FROZEN FOOD

772
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,510
"Boneless chicken feet."

773
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,679
-It's a gold mine.
-They kept them all here.

774
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,347
They kept their secret snacks there.

775
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,417
See if any are on the banned food list.
We might have to calculate calories.

776
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,119
Chicken breast, chicken feet…

777
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,089
BUT THOSE TWO ITEMS
AREN'T ON THE LIST

778
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,092
These girls would buy things
like the chicken feet here

779
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,495
and keep them inside the fridge.
How crazy is that?

780
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,598
There would be proof
of their purchase, right?

781
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,201
-Pardon?
-Think about the proof!

782
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,236
-It must be hidden somewhere.
-I bet they did that.

783
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,405
Sneaking around the staff's back!

784
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,807
Why does he keep stressing
that they snuck around?

785
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,010
What sort of idol trainee does that?
Kids these days…

786
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,012
BUT THE PROOF IS
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND

787
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,550
Maybe it's not inside this room.

788
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,752
CAN THE PROOF BE ELSEWHERE?

789
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,022
THEY STEP OUTSIDE

790
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,457
-Found it!
-Here it is!

791
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,592
-You can go.
-What is it?

792
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,193
-Found it!
-Here it is!

793
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,162
THEY FOUND IT?

794
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,931
Oh, so it was here all along.

795
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,534
RECYCLE COLLECTION BAGS
OUTSIDE THE DINING ROOM

796
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,936
MOST ARE PLAIN WASTE
SORTED OUT TO BE RECYCLED

797
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,738
AND YET…

798
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,507
DISCARDED RECEIPTS
WERE ALSO THERE

799
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,810
Let's take them all in.
So they had burgers and all.

800
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,011
-Come here, Sae-ho.
-Okay.

801
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,145
RETURNED WITH THE RECEIPTS

802
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,480
Look. "Burger Ping."

803
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,416
-They had burgers, fries, and milkshakes.
-"Cheeseburgers."

804
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,419
ITEMS ON THE RECEIPT ARE
ALSO ON THE BANNED FOOD LIST

805
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,154
Let's leave a tick with a marker.

806
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,490
-We might get the direction here.
-Exactly.

807
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,925
THAT'S A NICE INSIGHT

808
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,695
Look at all of you. You're so sharp today.

809
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,731
Read the receipts for us, Sook.

810
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,532
I'll read the oldest one first.

811
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,502
-By the date, got it.
-I'll read older ones first.

812
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,538
"Cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes."

813
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,407
Fries.

814
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,476
-Milk shake. So it goes like this.
-Does it create a pattern?

815
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,745
Oh! Keep going. Go on. I think this is it.

816
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:57,348
Next, "rosé tteokbokki, Korean corn dogs,

817
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,017
-and pork cutlet."
-There it is.

818
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,586
-Found another one.
-Yeah, it's a pattern.

819
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,854
THEY CRACKED IT

820
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,822
LINK THE ITEMS ON THE RECEIPT
IN THE EXACT ORDER

821
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,659
AND A DIRECTIONAL PATTERN SHOWS UP

822
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,260
-Moving on to the third receipt.
-Okay.

823
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,396
"Macarons, ice cream, and cake."

824
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,231
-Macarons, ice cream…
-Ice cream.

825
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,299
-…and cake.
-Cake.

826
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,100
Cake. So it's a pattern for up.

827
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,102
BANNED FOOD LIST

828
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,538
Next, "pepperoni pizza,

829
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,541
baked spaghetti with cheese,
and creamy pasta."

830
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,310
-Okay.
-So that's a left symbol.

831
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,614
Finally, "mala hot pot,
sweet and sour pork, and mala stir-fry."

832
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,083
"Mala hot pot,
sweet and sour pork, and mala stir-fry."

833
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,584
-That's an up symbol. All right.
-Okay.

834
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,653
The answer is
down, left, up, left, and up.

835
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,289
Down, left, up,

836
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,058
left, and up.

837
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,326
SLOWLY ENTERS THE CODE

838
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,297
IT UNLOCKS

839
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,865
I'M SO PROUD OF US

840
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,033
How cool is that?

841
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,735
-We're on a roll.
-Is that a key?

842
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,804
-"Authorized personnel only."
-"Authorized personnel only"?

843
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,973
-Let's get going.
-It's upstairs.

844
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,108
Take a cucumber each.

845
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,743
-Sir.
-But why?

846
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,912
-We must need it somehow.
-There must be a reason.

847
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,113
Maybe it can work as a weapon?

848
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,781
We're brilliant. Let's go.

849
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,049
Let's go!

850
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,318
-Thank you, Chef.
-Thank you, Chef.

851
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,520
Are you sure you didn't run
a pancake joint before?

852
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,955
Oh, that's my uncle.

853
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,625
"Authorized personnel only." This is fun.

854
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,230
Things are going smoothly today.

855
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,065
THE LAST ROOM FINALLY OPENS
AFTER COUNTLESS TRIALS

856
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,968
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

857
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,009
ROOM FORBIDDEN TO EVERYONE
EXCEPT FOR AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL

858
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:34,045
-So this is it.
-What an interesting place.

859
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,481
A HUGE MAP HANGS ON THE WALL

860
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,817
Look at all these uniforms
with Kim Do-yeong's name on them.

861
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:40,985
Someone's a fan of baseball.

862
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,053
UNIFORMS ARE EVERYWHERE

863
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,622
What an interesting place.

864
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,724
The occupant here must love baseball.

865
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,792
SEARCHES THE PLACE THOROUGHLY

866
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,527
Look at all this stuff.

867
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,363
There's an itinerary here.

868
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,336
INSIDE THE FILE
UNDERNEATH THE SPANNER

869
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,171
This woman visited some place…

870
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,240
Oh, it's the makeup studio.

871
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,109
She then went clubbing.
Let's check this out on the map.

872
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,177
WENT CLUBBING AT NIGHT!

873
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,012
Look. There's a suitcase.

874
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,581
We'd need a code for this too.

875
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,216
Right?

876
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,552
There's something inside it too.

877
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,720
I get it now.

878
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,589
We'd have to figure out the code for this.

879
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,826
I wonder why she kept this here.

880
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,429
Why would she need these tools?

881
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,764
TOOLS IN A DORMITORY FOR IDOLS?

882
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,199
Why did she keep them around?

883
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,468
Let's crack the suitcase open with them.

884
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,670
-Shall we check the diary first?
-Okay.

885
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,507
THEIR PLAN IS TO RETRACE
THE OWNER'S STEPS USING THE MAP

886
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,876
She first went to a makeup studio
to get their face done.

887
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,745
Okay, the makeup studio.

888
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,180
A RECORD OF A MAKEUP SESSION

889
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,948
Let's continue.

890
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,650
She went clubbing at night.

891
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,051
Clubbing?

892
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,719
Club, checked.

893
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,854
The makeup studio…

894
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,522
The next day,
she went to a plastic surgeon.

895
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,858
-A clinic's right here.
-Then…

896
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,162
She wrote, "I'm so lucky
to have a favorite pub nearby."

897
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,098
Next, she dropped by the agency.

898
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:01,766
Where is it?

899
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,768
It must be the recording studio here.

900
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,770
It's DRVR Entertainment.

901
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,006
"I feel awful today. They asked for
an additional chorus recording session."

902
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,409
"If I had known I'd run into Kim Na-bak,

903
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,444
I wouldn't have gone to the agency.

904
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,013
"Still, the recording studio
is my favorite place…"

905
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,548
We checked the studio,
didn't we? This one.

906
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,217
Sure, the recording studio.

907
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,587
THEY SEEM TO HAVE VISITED
THE RECORDING STUDIO AND THE AGENCY

908
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,789
"When you need to mull things over,

909
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,190
-this café is the best."
-The café.

910
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,959
SHE PLANNED SOMETHING
AT THE CAFÉ THE NEXT DAY

911
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,026
Here it is.

912
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,897
"I return to the dormitory daily,
but today's casing made it feel special."

913
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,332
THEN, THEY WENT TO THE DORM

914
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,933
-The dormitory.
-The dorm?

915
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,604
ON THE NEXT DAY…

916
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,472
-She visited the stationery store.
-July 11?

917
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,142
She bought a suitcase.

918
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,410
A RECORD OF BUYING A SUITCASE
AT THE STATIONERY STORE

919
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,580
-What does it say about the suitcase?
-She went to the pharmacy next.

920
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,149
It says…

921
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,884
-There's a number, 15:13.
-Look, 15:13.

922
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,387
That's 3:13 p.m., so you could try 313.

923
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,455
At 15:13, huh?

924
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,056
Plain 313?

925
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,694
-It won't open.
-Got it.

926
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,962
Next, the pharmacy.

927
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:08,065
-Hold on. Let me use this.
-Here's the pharmacy.

928
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,468
Her last stop was the baseball stadium.

929
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,337
-Where is it?
-Here.

930
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,273
-Where?
-Up here.

931
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,440
SHE WATCHED A BASEBALL GAME

932
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,542
Next up is a bank.

933
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,177
-Here it is.
-The bank.

934
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:23,014
They then went to a tool shop.
I mean, a hardware store.

935
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,582
BANK, HARDWARE STORE

936
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,717
She bought a chair in a superstore.

937
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,252
Then, she hit the outdoor equipment shop.

938
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,023
Next, she went to a furniture store.
Then, the coin karaoke.

939
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:38,162
THEY CHECKED ALL THE PLACES
MENTIONED IN THE DIARY

940
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,932
I think the sequence matters.

941
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,100
Don't worry. We can write that down too.

942
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,037
WOO-JAE AND SAE-HO
CONNECT THE DOTS IN SEQUENCE

943
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,039
Read the diary for me.
She visited the makeup studio

944
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,307
-and then the club.
-Right.

945
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,908
What comes next?

946
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,877
-The plastic surgery clinic.
-The clinic.

947
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,745
Next up…

948
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,314
SHOULD I OPEN THE SUITCASE?

949
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,381
Is it locked, Sook?

950
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,916
Yeah, it's locked.

951
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:04,088
I SHOULD START USING MY WITS TOO

952
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,656
I think you can just unzip it.

953
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,526
I think you can just unzip it.

954
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:14,065
IT JUST OPENS

955
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,766
CACKLING

956
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,102
-A suitcase.
-What? How did you open it?

957
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,737
All we needed to do was unzip it.

958
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,906
SHE'S LOST HER MIND

959
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,941
We'd have to figure out the code for this.

960
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:30,248
SHE SPENT 15 MINUTES RACKING HER BRAIN
FOR A CODE TO AN UNLOCKED SUITCASE

961
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,551
TO THINK IT JUST OPENED!

962
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,419
What is all this?

963
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,188
Those are the tools this woman purchased.

964
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,522
FULL OF OMINOUS-LOOKING TOOLS

965
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,824
STUNNED

966
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,792
Who knew it would open so easily?

967
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,661
How did you do it?

968
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,895
It's just…

969
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,366
The zipper sliders
weren't placed in the lock.

970
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,900
Did the crew make a mistake?

971
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,068
It looks that way.

972
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,771
NO, WE DIDN'T

973
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,307
-Come on.
-I kept trying different codes.

974
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,808
STILL,
WE'RE HAPPY THAT YOU OPENED IT

975
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,777
-I kept at it.
-Why didn't we consider that?

976
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,412
Sook kept working with the lock.

977
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,947
-Third stop.
-Third stop.

978
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,548
-Fourth stop.
-Fourth stop.

979
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,817
THEY'RE ALMOST DONE
WITH CONNECTING THE STOPS

980
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,986
ACCORDING TO THE SEQUENCE

981
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,454
Sixteenth stop.

982
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,591
Sixteenth stop.
Seventeenth stop. That's it.

983
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:15,326
Have you found anything?

984
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,333
I can't find any meaning here.

985
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,870
Let's go through everything.
Search the clothes for cards and stuff.

986
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,638
This might have a hint too.

987
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,074
Right, the crime scene
would have all the clues we need.

988
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,843
That probably means she loves baseball.

989
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,879
I'm sure this side
has a hint or something.

990
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,481
But she cleaned up the place neatly.

991
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,718
Aren't we going to open that?

992
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,987
"Confidential."

993
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,956
"Confidential."

994
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:51,329
FINALLY FOUND THE "CONFIDENTIAL"
FILE AND A MANILA ENVELOPE

995
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,266
You can go over this.
And I'll take a look here.

996
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,336
FLASHMAN CHECKS THE CONTENTS
OF THE MANILA ENVELOPE

997
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,470
Hey, wait.

998
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,340
-"Ghost singer"?
-"Ghost singer contract."

999
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:06,410
GHOST SINGER CONTRACT

1000
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,179
"Ghost singer"?

1001
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,315
Gosh, I've got chills
running down my spine.

1002
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,650
So she must've sung for them.

1003
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,119
-The girls…
-It mentions the service provider.

1004
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,855
She must've signed the contract
to be Kim Na-bak's ghost singer.

1005
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,492
A DOLIVE MEMBER THAT NO ONE KNEW ABOUT

1006
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,027
-"Go High Note."
-"Go High Note."

1007
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,196
KIM NA-BAK'S GHOST SINGER,
GO HIGH NOTE

1008
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,131
Didn't we see "Go High Note" earlier?

1009
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,266
I'm sure I read her name somewhere.

1010
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,468
Look.

1011
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,370
WOO-JAE GOES OVER THE CONFIDENTIAL FILE

1012
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,871
Come here, Sae-ho.

1013
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,973
Come and look, Woo-young.

1014
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,541
On August 3, 2021,

1015
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,643
-Go High Note was in fifth place.
-Right.

1016
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,847
A REPORT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF
DEBUTING IN THE CONFIDENTIAL FILE

1017
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,383
TEST RESULT FROM AUGUST 3, 2021

1018
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,820
HIGH NOTE'S SKILLS AS A VOCALIST
WON HER 5TH PLACE

1019
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,959
NA-BAK GOT CRITICIZED FOR HER SINGING
AND PLACED 6TH

1020
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,329
But her rank in the group dropped
to sixth place on August 27, 2021.

1021
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,131
Na-bak took her spot.

1022
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,432
She was overtaken by Na-bak.

1023
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,101
"Sixth place, Go High Note."

1024
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,237
"An outstanding talent,
but her looks are holding her back."

1025
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,774
So the top five trainees made the group,
but the ones below didn't get to debut.

1026
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,941
Hey, Go High Note!

1027
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,376
Go High Note must've taken her.

1028
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,913
Go High Note must've come to have…

1029
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,415
-She must begrudge Na-bak.
-…resentment.

1030
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,749
-Na-bak took her spot.
-Right.

1031
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,652
AFTER FAILING TO MAKE THE TEAM,
HIGH NOTE SIGNS THE GHOST SINGER CONTRACT

1032
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,554
Doesn't it mention Go High Note?

1033
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,257
-High Note is the problem.
-Let me see.

1034
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,359
See if there's a mention of High Note.

1035
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,228
Wait, who's the diary's owner?
Are we sure it's Kim Na-bak?

1036
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,731
NOW THAT THEY THINK ABOUT IT…

1037
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:38,502
THE NAME SOUNDED FAMILIAR
FOR A REASON GO HIGH NOTE

1038
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,872
The diary's owner is Go High Note!

1039
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,811
I'm a member of doLIVE too.
Why won't the agency take care of me?

1040
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,479
When I presented
Na-bak's photo as my goal,

1041
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,915
the surgeon said I'd have to risk my life.
We're not so different.

1042
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,616
Why would she refuse to greet me?

1043
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,085
She's nothing without me!

1044
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,487
I'LL END IT ALL!

1045
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,255
This details her plot.

1046
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,924
THINGS ARE FINALLY FALLING INTO PLACE

1047
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,325
"Look forward to how I manage it."

1048
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,360
-This is it. She must be the culprit.
-And we're right here!

1049
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,929
I bet she did it.

1050
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,263
We're right here.

1051
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:11,235
She must've bought this suitcase
to put Kim Na-bak inside.

1052
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,537
-"Its size and weight are perfect."
-You're right.

1053
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,407
Then she must've kidnapped
Na-bak on June 11!

1054
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,110
You must be right. She bought a chair
and some climbing ropes that day.

1055
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,848
-"I earned money as her ghost singer…"
-To think I'm using it on her…"

1056
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,917
"It's annoying and funny at the same time.
Still, I have to see this through."

1057
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,554
So, her plan worked out.
Then, she bought that piece of furniture.

1058
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,289
-Let me see.
-She then went to the coin karaoke.

1059
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,657
She bought a closet.

1060
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,392
PURCHASED A CLOSET
THE DAY AFTER THE KIDNAPPING

1061
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,863
Na-bak might still be here. She could be
stuck in some closet in this house.

1062
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,631
-Where are the closets?
-Why else would she buy it?

1063
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,533
-I don't see any.
-Try opening that door.

1064
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,102
-A lead must be in a closet.
-That's just a wooden panel.

1065
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,771
We're supposed to push, aren't we?

1066
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,340
FOUND A SUSPICIOUS LOCKER

1067
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,642
THIS LOCKER MIGHT GIVE THEM A LEAD!

1068
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:56,247
The locker you're trying to open
belongs to the owner of this lodge.

1069
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,450
It's their private property.
Please keep that in mind.

1070
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,684
Sorry about that.

1071
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,254
Na-bak must be kept inside a closet.

1072
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,824
OTHER THAN THE LOCKER,
NOTHING HERE COUNTS AS A CLOSET

1073
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,759
Shall we check other rooms?

1074
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:09,827
Other rooms?

1075
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,062
Are there no closets here?

1076
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,266
-Shall we check out that room?
-You're leaving?

1077
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,601
That must mean
we're supposed to stay in here.

1078
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,403
-Guys, come back in.
-How kind.

1079
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,272
-"You're leaving?"
-"You're leaving?"

1080
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,706
ALL THE LEADS ARE IN HERE

1081
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,842
LET'S SEARCH THE PLACE AGAIN!

1082
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,510
I think this panel can be opened.

1083
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,848
THE HEROES CHECK
EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY

1084
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,518
BUT THEY ARE UNABLE
TO FIND ANY NEW LEADS

1085
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,053
I'm sure we're almost there.

1086
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,126
What did you get from the map?

1087
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,327
Did you find nothing?

1088
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,162
-It was just…
-Well…

1089
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,732
Excuse me. Are we close
to finding the answer?

1090
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,768
TRIES TO CONTACT THE GAME'S ARCHITECT

1091
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,304
HMM…

1092
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,174
Are we nowhere close?

1093
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,677
HMM…

1094
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,913
Can't you tell us
if we're doing well or not?

1095
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,182
Just a word of criticism
or compliment would do.

1096
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,885
Naturally… How should I say this?

1097
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,287
-The whole crew…
-I bet we blew your minds.

1098
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,289
We're indeed amazed
at your progress today.

1099
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,991
Get us a fried chicken as a treat.

1100
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,796
Is the cucumber a lead for us to use?

1101
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:21,098
IS THERE A SECRET TO THE CUCUMBERS?

1102
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,868
BEFORE THEY LEFT THE DINING ROOM,
THE CHEF GAVE THEM A CUCUMBER EACH

1103
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,204
-We must need it somehow.
-There must be a reason.

1104
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,405
Maybe it can work as a weapon?

1105
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,444
-Sir.
-Yes?

1106
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,512
Is the cucumber a lead for us to use?

1107
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,014
A SHARP QUESTION

1108
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,185
The trainees in fifth and sixth place
are central to…

1109
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,555
Wait, cucumber?

1110
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,726
I have no idea
why the chef gave them to you.

1111
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,028
I bet Director Kwon improvised for fun.

1112
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,196
HONEY, I'M ON SHOOT, I LOVE YOU

1113
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,164
What's the suitcase for, then?

1114
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,333
-I think…
-High Note must've used it.

1115
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,302
It's the kidnapper's trail, so to speak.

1116
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,005
-It shows us what she meant to do.
-And her visit to the hardware store.

1117
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,907
What about these baseball uniforms
marked with Kim Do-yeong's name?

1118
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,410
Why are there so many of them?

1119
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,412
ALL THE UNIFORMS OF KIM DO-YEONG

1120
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,881
CAN THE ATHLETE
BE HIGH NOTE'S ACCOMPLICE?

1121
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,884
I'm a huge fan of Kim Do-yeong.

1122
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,653
THAT WAS THE SHOWRUNNER'S
PERSONAL TOUCH

1123
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,423
THEY BREEZED THROUGH SO FAR
BUT NOW THEY'RE STUCK

1124
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,992
I'm touching this board here.
Is this a good idea?

1125
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,664
Can you repeat that again?

1126
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,333
I'm hovering around the board.
Do you approve of the idea?

1127
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,670
HMM…

1128
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,706
-I guess that's a no.
-We probably should look someplace else.

1129
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,274
-I do approve.
-Oh, he approved.

1130
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,076
We're on track.

1131
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,280
THIS IS IT?

1132
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:48,752
THE HEROES FOCUS ON THE MAP AGAIN

1133
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,487
Let's see what we can find here.

1134
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,022
RECONNECTING THE DOTS

1135
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,425
-She bought the ropes here.
-Connect the dots.

1136
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,694
-We've already done that.
-That's all I can see.

1137
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,395
Especially for the final day.

1138
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,630
RETRACING THE STEPS

1139
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,699
It does feel like we're stuck here.

1140
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,369
I wonder if the count matches.
It might not, actually.

1141
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,440
-It's so confusing.
-Should we start from the beginning?

1142
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,874
WILL THEY CRUMBLE HERE?

1143
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,143
The coin karaoke near the dorm.

1144
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,079
REVIEWING THE DIARY ENTRIES

1145
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,581
-That's the time, right?
-Yeah.

1146
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:24,021
One of my favorite songs
happens to be BIGBANG's "Day by Day."

1147
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,290
"Day by Day," huh?

1148
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,357
GAME ARCHITECT'S HINT

1149
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,425
-Let's see.
-"Day by Day."

1150
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,194
He obviously meant one day.

1151
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,329
"DAY BY DAY"?

1152
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,630
One day at a time.

1153
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,699
Look, Sae-ho. The diary contains…

1154
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,738
And he mentioned "Day by Day"
as one of his favorite songs.

1155
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,540
Would we have to sing a song together?

1156
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,212
Let's just take a seat here
and have a chat.

1157
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,848
DAY BY DAY?

1158
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,683
JUNE 4

1159
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,586
At the end, she visited the coin karaoke…

1160
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,155
She wrote down both date and time.
Look, it says 11:06 a.m.

1161
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,423
JUNE 6

1162
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,491
EXACT TIME UNAVAILABLE

1163
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,627
JUNE 7

1164
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:04,695
JUNE 8

1165
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,230
03:13 P.M.
EXACT TIME UNAVAILABLE

1166
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,398
I'd say that's what we have so far…

1167
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,435
What's your take on this case?

1168
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:12,636
JUNE 9

1169
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,771
EXACT TIME UNAVAILABLE

1170
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:14,838
JUNE 10

1171
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,741
The connecting lines don't overlap.

1172
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,409
-They don't.
-They are all separated.

1173
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,578
JUNE 12

1174
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,148
-Why did she write the times?
-Where's her last stop?

1175
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:25,716
Is it this place?

1176
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,217
Sae-ho!

1177
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,920
-Come with me for a sec.
-Okay.

1178
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,790
Don't connect all the stops.

1179
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,691
-Let's just connect stops for a day.
-Got it.

1180
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,493
-So…
-The club and the makeup studio.

1181
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,561
Let's see.

1182
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,496
-The club… That's it for that day.
-Yeah.

1183
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,031
IF THEY CONNECT
ONLY A DAY'S WORTH OF STOPS…

1184
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,333
-So…
-The club and the makeup studio.

1185
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,335
-The plastic surgery clinic.
-Then, the pub.

1186
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,738
She stopped by the agency
and went to the recording studio.

1187
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,873
She visited the café
and returned to the dorm.

1188
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,942
She went to the stationery store
and the pharmacy.

1189
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,045
A baseball game ticket. The stadium.

1190
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,881
-It was the only place she visited.
-All the strokes might form a word.

1191
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,750
First, the bank. Next, the hardware store.

1192
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,351
It was the only place she visited.

1193
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:04,254
The superstore
and the outdoor equipment shop. Like so.

1194
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,358
What's next?
The furniture store and the coin karaoke.

1195
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,262
The lines connecting each day's stops
are rather short but linked.

1196
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,698
-You feel me?
-Yeah.

1197
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,769
I've got it. It's a character.

1198
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:20,771
-That's a vowel.
-So…

1199
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,007
If we assemble all the letters…

1200
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,043
Wait… It's "basement"!

1201
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,811
The basement!

1202
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,046
THE LINES FORMED A WORD

1203
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,850
BASEMENT

1204
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,151
The basement!

1205
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,620
The basement!

1206
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,422
-The basement!
-The basement!

1207
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,090
-It's the basement.
-The basement.

1208
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,458
-Let's go.
-That's incredible.

1209
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,993
-She must be downstairs.
-I've got chills!

1210
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,665
"Basement."

1211
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,801
-The connecting lines formed a word.
-Yeah.

1212
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,769
-"Day By Day," that did the trick.
-Man, the chills.

1213
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:57,007
I took you for ragtag amateurs,
but you turned out to be quite bright.

1214
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,610
-My gosh, Woo-jae is a genius.
-I love how it's going.

1215
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,945
-You really are brilliant.
-The basement.

1216
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,415
If I were you, though,
I wouldn't let my guard down just yet.

1217
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,853
The real deal is just about to begin.

1218
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,388
So it hasn't begun yet?

1219
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:16,260
It has been confirmed that the place
Kim Na-bak visited last was the basement.

1220
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:20,030
Now, you'll each take a turn
to go down to the basement.

1221
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,000
You must find a hint each
and return upstairs.

1222
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,902
-Dang it.
-They set up a haunted house.

1223
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,605
THE CLUES ARE IN THE BASEMENT

1224
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,109
All five clues must be combined

1225
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,878
for you to find the missing Kim Na-bak.

1226
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,113
Bear that in mind.

1227
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,417
I'm plucking up my courage.

1228
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,192
