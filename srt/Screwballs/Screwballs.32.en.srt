HIGH-CLASS MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,315
Hello there.

DRESS CODE: BUSINESS FORMAL

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,185
I'm Kim Sook, a female entrepreneur.

00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,086
TODAY'S TOPIC

9
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,021
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,690
I own about eight companies

11
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,926
and I am thinking about
selling two of those.

12
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,561
Is there anybody who's blind out there?

13
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:29,662
LOOKING FOR A PUSHOVER

14
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,831
SHE HEARS PANTING

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:33,933
My gosh.

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,268
What are you…

17
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,537
Mr. Cho?

18
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,638
Gosh, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,877
-What's going on?
-I'm sorry.

20
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,346
-Sorry? In Korea?
-I'm sorry.

21
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,382
-A little bit busy. Business meeting.
-Yeah?

22
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,717
It just finished. I'm sorry.

23
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,218
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes, Mr. Cho.

24
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,787
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

25
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,856
I'm Cho Sae-ho of Saeho Industries.

26
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,191
Oh, I see.

27
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,592
I've heard a lot about you.

28
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,727
Please have a seat.

29
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,129
I should have met up with you before

30
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,898
-regarding the takeover.
-So you want to

31
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,466
-take over my company?
-Excuse me.

32
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,001
-I've got a business call.
-Okay.

33
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,438
Hello, Mr. Cho.

34
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,972
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Aren't you Mr. Cho?

35
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,275
I'm in a meeting. I'll call you later.

36
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,877
Okay. Please check your email.

37
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:18,778
Thank you.

38
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,113
-I'm sorry.
-Was it from America?

39
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,148
-Yes, we had--
-But it's two in the morning there.

40
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,583
I got a call. One moment.

41
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,651
Sure.

42
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,153
Hai. Moshi moshi.

43
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,155
Hai, Mr. Cho desu.

44
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,125
IT SEEMS LIKE HE GOT
A CALL FROM JAPAN THIS TIME

45
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,760
Email check onegaishimasu.

46
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:34,994
Why check so many emails?

47
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,496
I sent an email to Japan.

48
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,730
Pepperoni.

49
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,432
AFTER THAT
HE HAD CALLS FROM ITALY

50
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,900
AND AFRICA

51
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,104
FOR SOME REASON,
HE SEEMS VERY SUSPICIOUS

52
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,438
-Okay!
-Hello.

53
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,174
-Who is this?
-Do you know what time it is?

54
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,809
-Father--
-What do you mean?

55
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,411
Is that how Father taught you?

56
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,312
Ms. Kim was waiting.

57
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,680
This is my younger brother.

58
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,182
-No.
-Hello.

59
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,685
Your boss is my dad.

60
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,588
LAUGHING

61
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,689
Did you know that?

62
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,690
About what?

63
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,725
-Your boss.
-Yes?

64
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,327
I'm at the top though.

65
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,628
Really?

66
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,797
-What company is that?
-Greet me formally.

67
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,566
I'm Ms. Kim Sook of Company Elena.

68
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,668
I'm involved in graphic cards.

69
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,036
-Really?
-In Yongsan.

70
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,071
Nice to meet you.

71
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,806
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

72
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,074
Yes, I'm Kim Sook.

73
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,542
Oh, hello.

74
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,477
-Mr. Jang.
-You're all here.

75
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,378
Nice to meet you.

76
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,647
I run an AI business.

77
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,150
-My company is called Shoot.
-Oh.

78
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,751
-You're from Shoot.
-Yes.

79
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,919
-Shoot.
-Yes.

80
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,489
I started off with a product called Shoot,

81
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,892
and now, I've moved onto Screwed.

82
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,360
-Screwed.
-Yes.

83
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,162
THE NAME "SCREWED"
DOESN'T SEEM ODD FOR THIS MAN

84
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,531
-Hello.
-Hello.

85
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,066
I work as a fund manager in Wall Street.

86
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,868
-Aren't you the owner of The Kimchi?
-No.

87
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,403
-The owner of The Kimchi?
-No.

88
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,772
Pardon me, but you messed up,
so can you start over?

89
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,673
Wall Street?

90
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,477
Hello. I'm a fund manager in Wall Street.

91
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,379
-Something's in your teeth.
-I'm Mr. Hong.

92
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,446
It's gone.

93
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,548
-Mr. Hong?
-I'm Mr. Hong.

94
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,483
People think I'm a woman
because I'm pretty,

95
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,185
-but I'm a man.
-Is that so?

96
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,620
-Nice concept.
-I see.

97
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,155
You see, in the case of Mr. Hong,

98
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,924
he made a contract with my company,

99
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,661
so I bought the stocks
that he told me to buy,

100
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,363
but it dropped so much that…

101
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,098
-You should've bought more then.
-Excuse me.

102
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,700
You can't talk about actual events.

103
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,135
No, that's not it.

104
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,103
END OF THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING SKETCH

105
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,406
BACK TO THE FRUSTRATING LIFE OF STOCK APES

106
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,842
-So you all have dressed up for a change.
-Yes.

107
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,544
You look nice today.

108
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,714
PUTTING ASIDE THE COLORFUL MAKEUP

109
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,715
I love you.

110
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,183
I told him to stir-fry me.

111
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,218
I'll do just that.

112
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,420
But they really do look nice.

113
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,322
-Both Woo-young and Woo-jae.
-Everyone does.

114
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,257
-He always dresses nice and neat.
-I know.

115
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,259
The guys look good in suits.

116
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,362
It's been a long time
since I haven't worn a wig on this show.

117
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,530
That's right.

118
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,664
-It's your real hair?
-Yes.

119
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,199
It grew a lot.

120
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,869
I'm not just saying this.
Jin-kyung really is a fashionista.

121
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,504
Yes, she was a model,

122
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,472
but she's so stylish.

123
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,540
I know.

124
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,175
You look good too.

125
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,810
-Really?
-Looks like you got remarried.

126
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,779
-Really? Wait, what?
-Yes, you look like a groom.

127
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,815
-Doesn't it seem weird to dress like this?
-I know.

128
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,084
That thing up there
is making me really uncomfortable.

129
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,118
Let's take this down.

130
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,720
-Come on. God of Talk?
-What's this?

131
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,754
It's too much pressure.

132
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,390
It's the toughest when you
start off with something like this.

133
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,358
It's the ideal vibe.

134
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,959
We do need something like this.

135
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,527
You see, we have been

136
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,265
making people laugh
using slapstick instead of our words.

137
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,434
I think we should use this opportunity
to reevaluate ourselves.

138
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,770
But while you were busy talking,

139
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,739
our main writer let out a huge yawn.

140
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:33,640
It's okay.

141
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,508
A BIT EARLIER

142
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,910
BECAUSE SHE CAME TO WORK AT 5 AM

143
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,213
-It's boring.
-Don't concern yourselves with that.

144
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,715
Even if someone yawns at what I say…

145
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,883
THE SOUND OF VIEWERS YAWNING

146
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,818
We prepared today's theme

147
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,854
to be dignified so that

148
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,423
it befits your classy dress code today.

149
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,793
An ability that an entertainer must have
is the ability to talk well.

150
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,694
Yes.

151
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,496
We are going to take the time

152
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,500
to find out who is the God of Talk
by doing a thorough examination.

153
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,569
-Then, please take a seat.
-Okay.

154
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,672
We call it "fun stories."

155
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,639
Yes, fun stories.

156
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,176
Let's open up the floor
to some fun stories.

157
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,578
By the way, there will be
an award for today as well.

158
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,014
Since we're choosing the God of Talk,

159
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,850
we have a total of three rounds prepared.

160
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,486
In the first round, you will
have a small Talk Box

161
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,221
where we hear your stories,

162
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,890
and afterwards, the staff will vote.

163
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,859
So the first award

164
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,495
will be the God of Talk
chosen by the staff members.

165
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,564
Let me ask you something.

166
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,300
"Don't look up. Look for an opening."
You think you're so great?

167
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,035
ROUND 2
MEMBERS CHOOSE THE GOD OF INTERVIEW

168
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,339
What Jin-kyung says
may not resonate with you.

169
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,473
It does.

170
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,475
-It does? Then, I apologize.
-Then, she's right.

171
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,043
ROUND 3
VIEWERS CHOOSE THE GOD OF TALK

172
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,379
We will have a total of three awards.

173
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,550
Of course, there will be a huge reward
at the end of today's filming.

174
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,419
Let's think of it lightly.
It's among ourselves.

175
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,488
It's too exhausting
to think of a funny story.

176
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,323
-Yeah.
-Just share a recent story

177
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,792
-that's ridiculous.
-Let's talk about how we've been.

178
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,960
This was a while ago.

179
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,428
It was a bit painful for me.

180
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,796
-Something painful?
-Yes, painful.

181
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,899
I wasn't so well-known
during my early days of modeling.

182
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:11,304
There was a meet-and-greet with fans
organized by my agency.

183
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,705
Yes, of course.

184
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:16,509
But since there were such different levels
of fame among all the models,

185
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,544
they changed it
so that we all sat in a row.

186
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,346
So everyone can meet the fans equally.

187
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,281
Yes, so they can
get autographs from everyone.

188
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,251
Someone came to me,
so I asked them their name.

189
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,521
When I asked their name
after writing "To," they said,

190
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,790
"And what is your name?"

191
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,859
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

192
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,161
-Hang on.
-Gosh. You know what?

193
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,764
Hang on.
I think I've heard this story before.

194
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,198
-This guy is scary.
-Why?

195
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,667
Didn't I tell you this story
about Nam Chang-hee?

196
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,236
You're right.

197
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,105
How did you spin it like that?

198
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,074
-How did he do that?
-Good job.

199
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,909
-Is this really Nam Chang-hee's story?
-Yeah,

200
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,811
it's Nam Chang-hee's story. So what?

201
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,280
-You can use it.
-Why?

202
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,516
"And what is your name?" That's too funny.

203
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,750
Do you have any?

204
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:58,818
Well,

205
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,187
mine isn't a funny story.

206
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,588
It's kind of scary.

207
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,956
-Is that okay?
-Nice.

208
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:04,857
Yes.

209
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,592
-Is it really okay?
-Yes.

210
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,628
This really happened.

211
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,297
I was in my studio by myself
a few days ago.

212
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,632
There are a few rooms there.

213
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,368
I had the door closed
and wore my headphones

214
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,703
while I was recording for hours.

215
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,705
After that, my ears got kind of deafened.

216
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,142
Right then, from outside my room…

217
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,578
WOO-YOUNG HEARD A STRANGE SOUND

218
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,346
I heard a sound like that.

219
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,481
-Oh.
-Yes.

220
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,350
But when you go out of the room,
there's a hallway

221
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,485
and then another door.

222
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:37,924
But it seemed like the sound
came from the hall, not outside.

223
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,858
That's scary.

224
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,194
-Like they were right outside the door.
-Right outside?

225
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,628
No.

226
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,065
I thought that I was feeling very groggy,

227
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,067
so I tried to compose myself.

228
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,969
-In the studio--
-Were you there by yourself?

229
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,704
-Yes, I was.
-That must've been so scary.

230
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,173
The thing is, the songwriter

231
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,175
whom I am close to

232
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,678
and Min-jun have always said
they saw a ghost at our studio.

233
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,579
EVERYONE SAW THE GHOST

234
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,314
-You see ghosts in studios.
-It looked like

235
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,583
-just white, like this.
-Don't tell me.

236
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,885
It looked just like white smoke.

237
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,487
They said it just passes by like this.

238
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,522
But I practically live there, you know?

239
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,590
It could really be smoke.

240
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,491
But

241
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,793
I have never felt it.

242
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,595
But I realized it was my turn.

243
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,629
How scary.

244
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,564
That's how I felt, but I was so scared.

245
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,168
THE STRANGE SOUND WOULDN'T STOP

246
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,203
-It wasn't a man's or woman's voice.
-Oh, my.

247
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,371
So I thought,

248
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,574
"If I don't open the door,
it won't get resolved."

249
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,576
-You have to see for yourself.
-Yes, you do.

250
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,947
-I opened the door and said, "Who is it?"
-Okay.

251
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,848
-And went out.
-Yes.

252
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,120
WHAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THAT STRANGE SOUND?

253
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,057
Lee Jung-jae was on TV saying,

254
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,359
"Freeze!"

255
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:47,994
He was saying, "Freeze!"

256
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,296
HE WAS EARNESTLY LISTENING

257
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,365
-Darn it.
-Someone left it on?

258
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,599
It was Squid Game.

259
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,701
DARN… GIVE ME BACK
MY 1 MINUTE AND 30 SECONDS

260
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,703
I'm going to kill you.

261
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,374
I was already nervous
when he started making those noises.

262
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,543
-From what point was it made up?
-You got nervous?

263
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,511
He could have another story.

264
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,445
This is really scary.

265
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,115
Do you want a scary story
that isn't funny at all?

266
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,517
-Yes, go ahead.
-I can't believe anything they say.

267
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,152
Hey, this one's for real.

268
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,657
This was when I was living
with my sister in an apartment in Mapo.

269
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,791
One morning,

270
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,994
my sister got up

271
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,262
and said, "Sook,

272
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,531
there's a male ghost here."

273
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,199
-Gosh.
-That's what she told me.

274
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,868
She said she saw him.

275
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,269
He was very tall.

276
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,537
-In your place?
-In our place.

277
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,471
She said it passed by.

278
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,539
How can you live there?

279
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,075
I got so scared when she told me that.

280
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,344
This happened one day
when I got home after filming.

281
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,880
We filmed outdoors that day,

282
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,481
so I came home late in the night.

283
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,250
I was so tired, you see.

284
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,119
-You can't even wash up on days like that.
-Right.

285
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,055
I just carried my bag like this,

286
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,891
went straight to my bed,

287
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,825
and fell asleep.

288
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,360
You could get night terrors that way.

289
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,262
While I was asleep…

290
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,697
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP?

291
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,866
…I felt this cold chill.

292
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,571
So I pulled the blanket over me
as I slept.

293
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,407
But something felt strange. When I looked,

294
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,609
the blanket was gone.

295
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,444
THE BLANKET DISAPPEARED

296
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,412
When I looked next to me, it was there.

297
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,047
So I pulled it over me again.

298
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,016
Right then, someone next to me

299
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,652
pulled the blanket off of me

300
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,786
and said, "Don't hog it."

301
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:22,788
"Don't hog it."

302
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,891
-Oh, my gosh.
-Sook.

303
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,793
-Stop lying.
-It really happened.

304
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,363
-It got pulled off while I was like this.
-I got chills.

305
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,664
Then, he said, "Don't hog it."

306
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,200
So I got straight up, picked up my bag,

307
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,068
and left like this.

308
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,237
I was so tired.

309
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,773
I was so tired, but I picked up my bag

310
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,974
-and left.
-That was awesome.

311
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,076
The next day, we put our place up for sale

312
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,678
and moved out. That was in Mapo.

313
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,580
Gosh, this one was scary.

314
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,482
Did you really hear him say that?

315
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,317
I heard it right by my ear.

316
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,219
He said that
and the blanket got pulled off.

317
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,488
Someone I know

318
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,256
can really see ghosts.

319
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,391
He can really see ghosts.

320
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,826
Since he's in Korea, he sees ghosts here.

321
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,496
So if someone asks him,
"What are the ghosts wearing?"

322
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,431
They are mostly people
who died a long time ago,

323
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,733
so he usually sees them wearing hanbok.

324
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,568
-That's right.
-And on some days,

325
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,604
he'd see someone wearing
a military uniform.

326
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,207
But then, he went to the United States
for the first time.

327
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,176
Since he sees ghosts in Korea,

328
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,944
he wondered if he'll see them
in the States.

329
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,113
Sure enough, someone approached the door

330
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,482
and opened it while he was sleeping.

331
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,851
He felt the door open
and someone coming in.

332
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,486
When he looked over,

333
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,688
it was a Caucasian ghost.

334
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,990
A Caucasian male. But you see,

335
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,426
he was wearing Levi's jeans.

336
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,395
Oh, is it different in every country?

337
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,099
-Hang on.
-A cowboy started walking in.

338
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,534
And he knew it was a ghost.

339
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,705
-He was wearing the vintage 501 bootcut.
-Wow.

340
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,339
HOW PREPOSTEROUS

341
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,407
Bootcut.

342
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,477
Shouldn't we change the subject
from scary stories?

343
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,879
-Why did we start sharing scary stories?
-Have you

344
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,148
experienced anything while filming?

345
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,216
Any absurd experiences?

346
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,453
I had a shoot in Thailand a while ago.

347
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,254
It was when I was a reporter.

348
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:06,125
I had to meet a bear and do something.

349
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,226
-A huge bear.
-Okay.

350
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,028
-It's already funny.
-When I got there,

351
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,031
they said I had to
open the cage and feed it meat.

352
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,899
When I asked
how I was supposed to do that,

353
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,135
they said these bears were
raised by humans

354
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,571
-from when they were cubs.
-Raised by people.

355
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,472
You can't trust that.

356
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,307
They said nothing has ever happened

357
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,542
-with people.
-I'm already getting a bad feeling.

358
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,279
-They said all the tourists that visited…
-I'm getting a bad feeling.

359
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,848
…have fed the bear meat.

360
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,850
When I held out the meat like this,

361
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,718
the bear approached me.

362
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,955
Then, it took the meat and ate it

363
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,656
as if it were thanking me.

364
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,225
-Like a person?
-Yes.

365
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,493
-Nothing happened.
-Okay.

366
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,228
I was wondering if I did okay

367
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,430
-when the trainer came over.
-Yes.

368
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,799
He had huge claw marks across his face.

369
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,468
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

370
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,569
It was this big!

371
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,873
He said, "No problem."

372
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,143
-From what point?
-Sometimes he hits you…

373
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,277
-From when?
-…when he's mad.

374
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,512
But besides that, he's okay.

375
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,447
Tell me, from what point?

376
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,915
-What?
-Your exaggeration.

377
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,984
It's from the beginning.

378
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,319
Why does my exaggeration matter?

379
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,854
-Why does it matter?
-As long as

380
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,624
-we all laughed, it's okay.
-He had these

381
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,593
huge claw marks and his shirt was torn up.

382
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,594
That was hilarious.

383
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,429
-Oh, my god!
-Oh, my god.

384
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,430
That was so funny.

385
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,465
What a relief.

386
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,966
I feel so at ease now.

387
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,102
Wasn't the Levi's story good?

388
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,170
Levi's and…

389
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,404
LEVI'S AND THE BEAR CLAW MARKS

390
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,339
-Listen--
-They were all made up.

391
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,641
It was all made up.

392
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,176
It was funny. Wasn't it hilarious?

393
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,511
Wasn't it funny?

394
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,013
Are there any more?

395
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,949
The thing is,
the funniest stories we can share

396
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,051
are stories related to our bowel movement
or some sort of urgent situation.

397
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,920
Is there anything like that?

398
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,188
You see,

399
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,958
don't we all have a public image?

400
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,793
I have a short one.

401
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,095
I was out and about
with an acquaintance of mine.

402
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,964
He was a very well-mannered person.

403
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,433
He asked if there was a bathroom nearby,

404
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,135
so I told him that there were none.

405
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,970
But he said, "Anywhere would be fine."

406
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,806
So we found a gas station restroom

407
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,975
and wondered if he'd be okay with it,

408
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,810
but he went like this.

409
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,779
Then, he casually came out.

410
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
-Super casual.
-Okay.

411
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,816
When I asked if it went well,
he said, "Yes, let's get going."

412
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,817
But I kid you not,

413
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:13,853
the socks he was wearing

414
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,221
were gone.

415
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,323
…were gone.

416
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,959
He was wearing dress shoes.

417
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,394
He sat like this
and he definitely had socks on.

418
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,730
I'm serious! He definitely had socks on.

419
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,533
-He definitely used them.
-Come on.

420
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,968
Absolutely sure?

421
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,836
This is always in his repertoire.

422
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,105
-It's one of the 20 stories he has.
-I'm serious!

423
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,841
Even his expression was cool. You see,

424
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,710
he wasn't embarrassed at all.

425
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,212
It was as if he said, "Come at me."

426
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:41,881
Let's get going.

427
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,351
His expression was silently telling me

428
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,620
to not ask him about anything.

429
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,890
That was hilarious.

430
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:51,957
That was the best.

431
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,525
Why don't you share five more stories?

432
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,493
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

433
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,961
-Our stories are--
-One last one.

434
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,398
-So funny.
-I couldn't meet this person yet,

435
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,200
so I wasn't able to apologize to them.

436
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,435
There is someone I'd like to apologize to.

437
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,305
When I am out and about,
there are people who recognize me now.

438
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,341
When someone says, "Hey, Mr. Cho Sae-ho."
I'd say hello back.

439
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,578
Unless it's a very unique situation,
I would take pictures with them too.

440
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,414
We were filming
You Quiz on the Block one day.

441
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,883
We were supposed to
film in the Yangjae-dong area,

442
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,951
so I left home when…

443
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,487
my stomach started aching.

444
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,290
But if I went in my own toilet,

445
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,591
-I'd be late.
-You'd be late.

446
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,294
Let's say we were
supposed to meet at 7:20.

447
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,863
I would have arrived
at around 7:30 or 7:35.

448
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,298
-Can't do that.
-I don't like that.

449
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,667
I thought, "I'll get there early instead

450
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,536
and ask to use the bathroom
as my stomach hurts."

451
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,672
They'd understand
if I'd say hello first and go.

452
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,775
They'd think I came on time
but had to go as my stomach hurt.

453
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,276
So I said, "Sung-ho, let's go."

454
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,778
But then, it was as if

455
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,914
someone was grabbing hold of my stomach.

456
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,815
You can't hold that.

457
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,085
It was like someone was
punching my stomach as if to challenge me.

458
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,488
A professor who came on You Quiz
once told us that

459
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,325
if we are really about to go,
we can use our heel

460
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,827
to press right here.

461
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:02,728
-Plug it?
-Plug it?

462
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,929
-Plug it?
-When you do that…

463
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,432
If you plug it,
it can get resolved somewhat.

464
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,934
So since I was sitting in the back,
I got on the back seat

465
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,070
with my seat belt on

466
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,338
and rode the car like this.

467
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,173
-I see.
-"Sung-ho, step on it."

468
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,209
Despite doing that,
it didn't work after a while.

469
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,711
-Oh, no.
-It didn't work.

470
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,479
-I was…
-You've reached your limit.

471
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,613
I was…

472
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,383
I was getting so desperate.

473
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,751
-I said, "Hey."
-Okay.

474
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,119
"Stop the car!"

475
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,788
"Stop the car anywhere and let me out!"

476
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,359
The place he dropped me off
was by a building in Yangjae-dong.

477
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,194
And there was a bus stop in front of it.

478
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,895
Since it was morning rush hour,

479
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,865
-there were people in front of the stop.
-Right.

480
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,502
While I was passing by,
a man grabbed me like this.

481
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,337
He said, "Mr. Cho Sae-ho." But I couldn't…

482
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,773
BUT TO SAE-HO,
EVERY SINGLE SECOND MATTERED

483
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,241
I felt bad about doing this,

484
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,143
but I slapped his hand…

485
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,511
GET OUT OF MY WAY

486
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,179
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

487
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,114
…and went.

488
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,316
How shocked…

489
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,353
-You had no choice.
-…he must have been that morning.

490
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,689
-Right?
-Go and get Sung-ho.

491
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,757
It's for real.

492
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,625
I want to know if it really happened.

493
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,161
He must've been so shocked.
He was just happy to see me.

494
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,963
Celebrity Cho Sae-ho did that.

495
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,431
I'm truly sorry.

496
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,333
-That's so funny.
-How many toilet stories

497
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,868
-do you have?
-So funny.

498
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,171
I'm truly sorry about that morning.

499
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,140
I didn't mean to do that,

500
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,642
but if I greeted you that morning,

501
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,811
I would've offended you even more.

502
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,447
-I'm sorry I slapped you before I knew it.
-He's so awesome.

503
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,482
We should just call this episode

504
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,351
-"The Cho Sae-ho Special."
-For real.

505
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,519
Cho Sae-ho's Talk Box.

506
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,887
We should all support Sae-ho.

507
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,657
These are like Mandeuk Series
or Choi Bul-am Series from ages ago.

508
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,026
I wish we can make these
the Cho Sae-ho Series.

509
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,261
Do it.

510
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,096
All right. Then,

511
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,165
-is our group chat open?
-Yes.

512
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,166
It's a landslide win.

513
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,802
Come on.
Let's just give it to Sae-ho already.

514
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,303
The voting ended.

515
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,705
-With approximately 98 percent…
-Gosh.

516
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,541
-…of the votes.
-Of course it should be Sae-ho.

517
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,742
GRINNING

518
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,077
Congratulations, Mr. Cho Sae-ho.

519
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,779
CONGRATULATIONS, MR. CHO SAE-HO

520
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,514
UNSURPRISINGLY, THE WINNER
OF ROUND 1'S TALK BOX IS CHO SAE-HO

521
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,716
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

522
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,019
-My latte.
-Can we drink while we shoot?

523
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,153
Is it 70 cups?

524
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,188
WOO-YOUNG'S PENALTY
70 CUPS OF COFFEE ARRIVED

525
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,624
THE CAST AND STAFF ALL ENJOYED THE DRINKS

526
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,494
All right, if you look over there,
you will see a banner.

527
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,829
BANNER?

528
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,530
"High-class Celebrity Club?"

529
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,299
-Celebrity club.
-Celebrity club?

530
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,700
Welcome.

531
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,336
This is High-class Celebrity Club.

532
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,639
Among the celebrities
who are active in Korea,

533
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,842
only the ones who meet
the special qualifications

534
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,544
can join this prestigious club.

535
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,213
There's a frame over there.

536
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,214
As you can see,

537
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,549
-the best MC of Korea…
-It's Jae-seok.

538
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,486
…Mr. Yu Jae-seok is
the first honorary member.

539
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,222
We've registered him without his consent.

540
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,991
For those who join, we'll provide
one health checkup per year,

541
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,227
holiday gifts,
and a 50th debut anniversary gift, etc.

542
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,062
These benefits will be provided for a fee.

543
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,431
You may support or sponsor the high-class

544
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,533
year-end awards ceremony and other events.

545
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,868
There are a lot of things.

546
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,703
Yes, this is a nice place.

547
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,607
-It's so nice.
-As I said, not just anyone can join.

548
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,108
There are some qualifications.

549
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,745
Can you read the qualifications,
Woo-young?

550
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,148
-Yes, of course. You prepared a lot.
-Yes.

551
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,849
I'll read it.

552
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,052
"Qualifications
for the High-class Celebrity Club.

553
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,823
One, must be an entertainer
for over 10 years."

554
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,057
1. MUST BE AN ENTERTAINER
FOR OVER 10 YEARS

555
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,494
"Four, must have
overcome hardships by oneself."

556
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,429
-I overcame a lot by myself.
-Well,

557
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
I can relate to that.

558
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,400
"Five, must excel in
quick thinking and creativity."

559
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,635
AGREED

560
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,069
It depends,

561
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,039
-but the fact that we're on TV…
-Yes.

562
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,576
Lastly.
"Seven, must be a role model for others."

563
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,013
-This one's kind of tough.
-This one's tough.

564
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,048
I can be a fashion model,

565
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,683
but I can't be a role model.

566
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,018
He's right. Not anyone can join.

567
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,654
But I think we sufficiently qualify

568
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,989
in at least four or five
of the categories.

569
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:51,990
Yes.

570
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,460
We have judged that
you possess these qualities,

571
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,796
so we would like to give you a chance

572
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,531
to join the High-class Celebrity Club.

573
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,201
In a little while,
you are going to be interviewed.

574
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,836
We aren't already members?

575
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,805
You have to apply now.

576
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,106
I SEE

577
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,107
As the God of Talk,

578
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,443
even in a tense situation like interviews,

579
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,645
you must use your conversational skills
to win the heart

580
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,681
of the person who is
putting pressure on you.

581
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,917
The interviewer
who will conduct your interviews later

582
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,820
for the High-class Celebrity Club

583
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,322
will be yourselves.

584
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,490
So we interview each other.

585
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,059
Look in front of you.

586
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,927
There's a document for each of you.

587
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,129
It's a self-introduction.

588
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,631
THE SELF-INTRODUCTION IS
DIVIDED INTO FIVE CATEGORIES

589
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:36,034
Then, I'll give you about 15 minutes.

590
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,604
When did I start the company?

591
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,606
2005.

592
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,710
EVERYONE STARTS WRITING
THEIR SELF-INTRODUCTION

593
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,678
I've never written something like this.

594
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:56,221
THE MEMBERS ARE WRITING
MORE SERIOUSLY THAN EXPECTED

595
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,390
I'm done writing.

596
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,391
Me too.

597
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,492
JIN-KYUNG, WOO-YOUNG FINISH FIRST

598
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,461
-I have one more to write.
-Okay.

599
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,632
I didn't think Woo-jae
would write so much.

600
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,400
Aren't you getting paid?

601
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,068
SNORTS

602
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,370
Am I the only one getting paid?

603
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,673
I think this should be good enough.

604
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,174
You wrote a lot.

605
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,409
My gosh. What's all this?

606
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,811
I wrote everything,

607
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,813
but I wrote one too haphazardly.

608
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,150
EVERYONE IS DONE WRITING
INCLUDING THE LAST PERSON WOO-JAE

609
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,020
All right. Let's conduct the interviews.

610
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,721
When the interview is over,

611
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,324
you must fill out the score on the spot.

612
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,126
We'll decide each individual's final score

613
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,895
based on the average scores
from the interviewers.

614
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,732
INTERVIEW ORDER: SOOK, JIN-KYUNG,
WOO-YOUNG, WOO-JAE, SAE-HO

615
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,834
Please line up for the interview.

616
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,902
-Okay.
-Yes.

617
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,905
INTERVIEW NUMBER 1
KIM SOOK

618
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,340
THE INTERVIEW ROOM FEELS CLASSY
JUST LIKE ITS NAME

619
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,208
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

620
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,343
-Hello.
-Yes.

621
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,277
Hello.

622
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,479
THE FIRST INTERVIEWEE KIM SOOK
SEEMS NERVOUS

623
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,816
THEY THOROUGHLY REVIEW HER RESUME

624
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,319
First of all, welcome.

625
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,219
Yes.

626
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,055
Ms. Kim Sook.

627
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,022
Yes, nice to meet you.

628
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,757
You were born in 1975.

629
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,758
Yes.

630
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,827
How does it feel to be 50 years old?

631
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:10,962
Hang on a minute.

632
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,765
-What's wrong?
-How could you ask a question like that?

633
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,666
What?

634
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,402
We're all interviewers here.
You went too far.

635
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,637
You're a funny guy.

636
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,172
I just thought you were mature.

637
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,207
I'm enjoying it more than I expected.

638
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,743
When I turned 50,

639
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,347
I thought I would think I was old.

640
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,049
But I feel younger than I expected.

641
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,050
Oh, very nice.

642
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,454
Actually, if we're going to be precise,
you're 51 years old.

643
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,422
Come on. Listen.

644
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,825
Why are you all being like this?

645
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:40,859
Do you have children?

646
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,794
BAFFLED

647
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,829
I ought to hit you.

648
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,130
That jerk.

649
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,031
We don't know.

650
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,500
All right. I don't have any children.

651
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,235
Since you're here,

652
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,738
let me ask you a few things.

653
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,106
We read about how you grew up.

654
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,908
Yes. You were born in Busan
as the youngest child.

655
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,777
It says you were in charge of being cute.

656
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,279
Can you show us how you acted cute?

657
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,483
I always sat on my father's lap.

658
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,485
You sat on his lap?

659
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,387
I sat there like it was the seat of honor.

660
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,123
I would eat when someone fed me.

661
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,091
-You were loved very much.
-Yes.

662
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,526
Is "spoiled" the word

663
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,961
-we could use?
-Yes, that's right.

664
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,764
Can you show us how you laughed back then?

665
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,865
-Back then?
-Yes.

666
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,367
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

667
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,803
LAUGHING OUT LOUD

668
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,704
How cute.

669
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,305
SATISFIED

670
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,007
Your dimples are really deep.

671
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,976
Yes, they were even deeper back then.

672
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,344
Can you laugh one more time?

673
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,846
-It even lifts our spirits.
-Yes.

674
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,785
TIP FOR INTERVIEWS
HIGHLIGHT YOUR STRENGTHS

675
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,887
Let me give you the question
for all interviewees.

676
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,355
Mr. Cho Sae-ho is newly married.

677
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,256
Yes.

678
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,325
When he has a child
after planning to have one,

679
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,362
-can you give a name for his child?
-Nice.

680
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,263
Very nice.

681
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,964
-Their last name should be Cho.
-Sure.

682
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,066
I don't mind at all.

683
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,234
This is a variety show.

684
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,737
-Yes.
-You can give them a funny name.

685
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,805
THINKING CAREFULLY

686
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,474
Since we say "Peekaboo"
when someone is cute,

687
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,242
how about

688
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,410
KKa?

689
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,311
Cho Kka?

690
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,846
CHO…

691
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,514
SMIRKING

692
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,016
Not bad.

693
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,584
-Since it comes from peekaboo.
-Yes.

694
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,853
It's the Kka from peekaboo.

695
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,489
-What is wrong with her?
-It's from peekaboo.

696
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,324
Uncles and aunts can call them Cho Kka--

697
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,559
That was funny.

698
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,994
I personally think that was funny.

699
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,630
Then, what if I have a cute daughter?

700
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,098
-If you have a daughter?
-Yes.

701
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,469
Gosh. Well, there is a cute name.

702
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:31,870
What is it?

703
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,575
It's okay. Yes.

704
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,143
What about an English name?

705
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,411
-Oh, okay.
-English?

706
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,378
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

707
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,013
Was it Hawaii that says

708
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,948
"Ola"?

709
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,383
-Ola is pretty.
-Ola.

710
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,718
-Cho Ola.
-Oh, Cho Ola.

711
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:47,719
Cho Ol…

712
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,521
-Ola!
-Not bad.

713
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,622
-Yes.
-Cho Ola.

714
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,591
It's okay. It's okay.

715
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,493
We need things like quick thinking.

716
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,561
I think the name Ola is cute.

717
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,230
-Got it.
-Thank you.

718
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,564
Thanks. We got enough.

719
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,266
-Thank you for your time.
-No problem.

720
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,667
Thank you for your time.

721
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,104
WHAT DID THEY THINK
OF KIM SOOK'S INTERVIEW?

722
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,306
-Show us your score at the count of three.
-Yes.

723
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,509
One, two, three.

724
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,010
Show us.

725
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,845
Six points, 7.5 points.

726
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,247
10 points.

727
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,715
-Nine points.
-I gave her nine.

728
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,418
My personal feelings
were included in my scoring.

729
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,788
She is my role model
in this entertainment world

730
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,324
and like an older sister,
so I had to give her a perfect score.

731
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,493
-Yes, thank you.
-Since she's your senior?

732
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,829
Did you give me one point
but quickly changed it?

733
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:31,730
No.

734
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,065
You left a strong impression,

735
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,701
and the reason why I couldn't give you
one extra point

736
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,404
was because you look quite different

737
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,705
from the photo you submitted.

738
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,108
So I had to…

739
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,044
From this photo,
I thought you were Ms. Oh Eun-young.

740
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,413
-At a glance, you really do look like her.
-Yes.

741
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,550
-You lost one point in this regard.
-Okay.

742
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,918
Okay. Thank you very much.

743
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,553
Thank you for your time.

744
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,087
Thank you.

745
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,924
INTERVIEW NUMBER 2
HONG JIN-KYUNG

746
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,294
-Let's begin.
-Okay.

747
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,697
AS EXPECTED,
THE INTERVIEW STARTS SOLEMNLY

748
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,066
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

749
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,536
First of all, it seems like
you have appeared on many shows.

750
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,538
Are you going to go on Single's Inferno?

751
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,474
-On Single's Inferno? Me?
-Yes.

752
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,777
You have to appear on
many shows in the future.

753
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,247
Did you have these big plans
when you joined that show from season one?

754
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,382
You have to fill your filmography.

755
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,517
I respect that.

756
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,851
-Jin-kyung, now--
-I am

757
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,421
okay with it as long as
the producers there are okay with it.

758
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,523
THIS INTERVIEWEE IS READY
TO EMBRACE HER 2ND YOUTH

759
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,992
Shouldn't you go on EXchange now

760
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,627
rather than Single's Inferno?

761
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,198
-Does my ex-husband have to be on it too?
-Yes.

762
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,033
-Both of you should.
-I don't know about that.

763
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,435
I'm interested but…

764
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,637
You have to discuss it with him, right?

765
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,841
-I'd like to ask you about your childhood.
-Yes.

766
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,510
You said you had to endure
verbal and physical abuse.

767
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,313
It seems like you had
a very tough time at school.

768
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,183
This is the first time
I'm talking about it on TV.

769
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,151
After I debuted,

770
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,555
the person that cared for me

771
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,924
was, to be honest,

772
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:11,096
very abusive physically and verbally.

773
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,666
Those things left me traumatized.

774
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,471
After overcoming that person
who gave me a hard time in my youth,

775
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,607
it's easy for me to deal with
whoever I meet.

776
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,946
So I'd like to ask you
a follow-up question.

777
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,216
Can you recommend
something for dinner today?

778
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,917
-Nice. A great question.
-Yes.

779
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,952
How are those related?

780
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,620
Excluding kimchi and dumplings.

781
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,390
I typically don't eat dinner.

782
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,991
-I see.
-It became a habit of mine.

783
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,326
-So I--
-Sorry, our dinner.

784
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,727
Recommend a dinner menu for us.

785
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,829
Can't you eat what you want?

786
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,431
You seem to lack comprehension.

787
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,799
Yes. Well, no.

788
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,300
TIRED

789
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,836
Then, let me ask you this. Right now,

790
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,873
-you run a kimchi business, right?
-Yes.

791
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,775
I'd also like to personally thank you

792
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,511
for the kimchi and dumplings you sent
on my birthday.

793
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,412
CHARACTER +1

794
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,547
You're such a kindhearted person.

795
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,582
Will you send them every year?

796
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,752
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

797
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,188
-Just making sure.
-Do I owe you something?

798
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,823
I can buy it myself,

799
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,525
but she insisted that I don't buy it.

800
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:17,262
That's because Sae-ho is
like family to me.

801
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,565
Who would accept money from family?

802
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,866
-Forever.
-I have a question.

803
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,168
As long as I run this business.

804
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,102
Thank you.

805
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,637
-Jin-kyung.
-Yes?

806
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:30,642
Do you have the same amount of affection
for all of the Screwballs members?

807
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:34,579
I do not.

808
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,881
Then, don't say who it is,

809
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,485
but can you score the four members
with 10 points being the highest?

810
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,125
HOW MANY POINTS ARE THE MEMBERS
IN JIN-KYUNG'S HEART?

811
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,394
HMM

812
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,428
Ten points.

813
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,631
Hang on. You said 10 points
while you were looking at Sook.

814
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,899
We'll all know at this rate.

815
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,134
Ten points, ten points.

816
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,869
-Ten points, ten points.
-Yes.

817
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,003
THEY ALREADY KNOW WHO THEY ARE

818
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,138
-Third place?
-Eight points.

819
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,072
Eight points.

820
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:01,973
OH

821
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,375
AND…

822
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,346
-Four points.
-Please leave.

823
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,248
SULKING

824
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:11,683
Four points.

825
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,851
Jin-kyung, please leave.

826
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,153
Ten points, ten points,
eight points, four points.

827
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,188
She's an honest person.
It says so in the back.

828
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,323
That felt great.

829
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,426
I only gave him four points

830
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,162
because it went up a lot recently.

831
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,631
It felt like you were
being generous with those four points.

832
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,600
He used to be two points.

833
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,138
You're pretty honest
about how you differentiate people.

834
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:37,776
Along with your honesty,
let me ask you a sensitive question.

835
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,512
It says you were born
on December 23rd, 1977.

836
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,513
Yes.

837
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,082
Was it your choice to be born?

838
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,717
DUMBFOUNDED

839
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,886
ANSWER ME ALREADY

840
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,921
What the heck was that?

841
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:50,922
What does that mean?

842
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,090
You went down to six points.

843
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,325
The points went down.

844
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,661
It was a very important question for me.

845
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,130
Was it your choice or someone else's?

846
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,198
Stop it.

847
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,902
Later on, what would you like to write

848
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,103
on your gravestone?

849
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,505
But it has to be one line.

850
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,740
What would you write?

851
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,676
I would

852
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,812
not write what I want to say,

853
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,413
but someone clearly came to

854
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,981
-see my gravestone, right?
-Yes.

855
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:20,018
I would like to write something
for that person.

856
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,419
What would you like to write?

857
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,689
"Live for yourself. Be happy."

858
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,091
TOUCHING

859
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,961
Then, shouldn't you be more polite?
You don't know who'll come.

860
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,163
"Please live for yourself."
Something like that.

861
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,965
Okay. I'll stick with two points.

862
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,100
You keep losing points.

863
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,403
Two points are just right for him.

864
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,205
I can feel your kind heart.

865
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,107
You want to leave something
for the person who came to see you.

866
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,342
-Live for yourself.
-Live for yourself.

867
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,677
-Be happy.
-Be happy.

868
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,579
THE 2ND INTERVIEWEE
SHOWED SINCERITY IN THE END

869
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,347
It was so touching in the end.

870
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,281
-In various ways.
-Yes.

871
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,449
-That was it.
-Thank you.

872
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,550
We have to score you.

873
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,451
Yes, that's right.

874
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,552
Oh, her score.

875
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,486
TIME TO SCORE HER

876
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:01,025
HOW DID THE INTERVIEWERS FEEL ABOUT HER?

877
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,329
You may reveal your score
at the count of three.

878
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,331
One, two, three.

879
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:07,732
Gosh.

880
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,835
I see the point.

881
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,437
-I gave her 1.9.
-Hey!

882
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:16,274
-Why you…
-Because she gave me two points…

883
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,077
Well, to be honest,

884
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,012
I wanted to score her lower than that.

885
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,714
But one point seemed too low.

886
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,283
I promised you endless kimchi,
but you gave me four points?

887
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,351
-I…
-Four points?

888
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,852
-I have a reason.
-What is it?

889
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,455
Because I love you as a sister,

890
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,457
I gave you four points.

891
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,360
-The four letter word.
-I couldn't express it any other way.

892
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,729
-I love you.
-Doesn't the number four mean death?

893
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,097
No. It means "I love you."

894
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,298
Love. That's why it's four.

895
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,201
Woo-young, what happened?

896
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,702
Why did you give her five points?

897
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,904
The reason why I did this

898
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,506
is because you showed yourself
to be well-balanced

899
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,643
and exemplary in your interview.

900
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,511
You are no more or no less than that.

901
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,180
LAUGHING

902
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,315
You're just five points.

903
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,550
And I didn't get to hear the answer

904
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,387
to what I really wanted to know.
Did you choose to be born?

905
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,354
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

906
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,489
I really want to know.

907
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,591
I really want to know.

908
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,193
You didn't even recommend a menu.

909
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,330
-You didn't do anything I asked.
-He's right.

910
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,431
He's right.

911
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,532
Yeah, you get five points.

912
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,501
I'm upset with you.

913
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,503
I gave her 10 points.

914
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,238
I was touched by what you said at the end.

915
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,440
I almost cried.

916
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,976
-Ms. Hong, you got a total of 20.9 points.
-Yes.

917
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,246
I hope you can live for yourself as well,
Jin-kyung.

918
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,547
-For real.
-Thank you.

919
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,115
Live for yourself. Be happy.

920
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,350
RESPECT

921
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,486
-I'm getting emotional.
-Yes.

922
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,055
Hello.

923
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,457
-Hello, Mr. Jang Woo-young.
-Nice to meet you.

924
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,625
-Hello.
-Have a seat.

925
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,693
Hello.

926
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,727
Where is his resume?

927
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,895
LET'S SEE

928
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,829
Mr. Jang Woo-young.

929
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,199
NERVOUS

930
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,669
THE INTERVIEWERS CAREFULLY
GO THROUGH HIS PAPERS

931
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:53,938
Hello--

932
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:54,872
Nice reaction time.

933
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,274
Hello--

934
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,608
Nice reaction time. Very nice.

935
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,710
TAKE THAT!

936
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,278
-He caught it.
-Hello.

937
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,546
Very nice.

938
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,914
HE'S NERVOUS BUT SEEMS TO BE ENERGETIC

939
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,316
-Mr. Jang Woo-young.
-Yes.

940
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,418
Why do you have
so many women's clothes at home?

941
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,319
Oh!

942
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,688
Let me ask you point-blank.

943
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,690
-How old is your girlfriend?
-Okay.

944
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,092
Why so many women's clothes?

945
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,293
How old is your girlfriend?

946
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,527
-What's going on?
-What?

947
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,862
You have someone. How old is she?

948
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:18,763
What? What?

949
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,131
Is she older or younger?

950
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,500
-Why aren't you wearing your promise ring?
-Say something.

951
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,335
-You always wear it. Why haven't you?
-What?

952
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,536
When was your last kiss?

953
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:26,437
Yeah?

954
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:31,442
Since you're here,
we put some pressure on you.

955
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,877
Can you

956
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,114
introduce yourself in a rap.

957
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,715
Along with a dance.

958
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,218
IT SUDDENLY FEELS LIKE "SHOW ME THE MONEY"

959
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,386
Aren't you going to do it?

960
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,820
-Yes, I will.
-Okay.

961
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,424
-I'll give it a shot.
-Okay.

962
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,396
My name is

963
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:52,997
My name is

964
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:55,666
Your name is

965
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,301
Different

966
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,270
-Nice.
-Different names. Okay.

967
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,739
WHAT DO I SAY NEXT?

968
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,441
How predictable.

969
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,477
PREDICTABLE?

970
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,445
But

971
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,648
The way you feel
The way I feel

972
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,716
Are alike

973
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,786
-Nice rhyming.
-Nice.

974
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:15,787
We are

975
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,321
High-class

976
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,589
Celebrity Club

977
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,292
INTERVIEWEE 3 PRESENTED
A HIGH-CLASS RAP

978
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,894
Can you express that in dance?

979
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,732
Okay. He seems very flustered.

980
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,934
-So how old is your girlfriend?
-What?

981
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,903
-How old is she?
-When was your last kiss?

982
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,305
-Will you marry her?
-Is she older or younger?

983
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,074
-Singer or actress?
-Why are you seeing her?

984
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,776
Okay. This is High-class Celebrity Club.

985
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,511
How will you dance at a club?

986
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,612
HOW WILL YOU DANCE AT A CLUB?

987
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,580
If you're at a club.

988
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,748
Your club dance.

989
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,716
Give me a genre you'd like to see.

990
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:46,684
Well…

991
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,753
-I'd like girly hip-hop.
-Girly hip-hop?

992
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,055
Girly hip-hop.

993
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,792
-Oh.
-Hey.

994
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,360
Is this girly hip-hop?

995
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,165
Is this the same girly hip-hop
that I know?

996
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,200
Oh, my gosh.

997
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,268
How about popping? Can you pop?

998
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,104
POPPING? GOT IT

999
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,505
Can you cha-cha?

1000
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,842
CHA CHA CHA

1001
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,809
Okay, please sit down.

1002
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,078
You said you could do any dance.

1003
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,713
DISAPPOINTED IN HIS DANCE SKILLS

1004
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,749
You're known for being frugal.

1005
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,653
-You haven't changed your car in 10 years.
-Yes, that's right.

1006
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,689
It's a car you've had for a long time.

1007
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,224
How many women rode in that car?

1008
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,693
How many women have you gone through?

1009
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,927
-How many times?
-All right.

1010
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,462
How many were there?

1011
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,465
-Tell us their names and ages.
-How long was the longest relationship?

1012
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,700
What?

1013
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:36,734
Tell us right now.

1014
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,570
Is there anything they left behind?

1015
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,073
Mr. Jang, you seem very…

1016
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,541
-What?
-At this moment…

1017
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,076
-How many have been in your car?
-What?

1018
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,244
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1019
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,546
You seem to be bad
at thinking on your feet.

1020
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,581
We're not asking you to really tell us.

1021
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,050
We thought you could
respond in a clever and witty way.

1022
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,586
-You aren't answering at all.
-Exactly.

1023
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,455
-You just keep saying "What?"
-Yes.

1024
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,257
CAN'T HIDE THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT

1025
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,758
When did you debut?

1026
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,094
I debuted in 2008.

1027
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,095
The year 2008.

1028
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,531
Then, this year would be…

1029
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,200
Subtract from 25…

1030
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,235
CALCULATING

1031
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,136
What?

1032
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,671
What?

1033
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,606
-You've been active for 17 years.
-Yes.

1034
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,507
Active for 17 years.

1035
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,677
-Your car is--
-Did you just subtract 8 from 25?

1036
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,480
-Yes.
-That was fast math.

1037
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:26,551
-Then, let's briefly try out some basics.
-Okay.

1038
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,287
Look at the mirror

1039
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,522
and say something
you want to say to yourself.

1040
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,958
Call yourself first.

1041
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,860
WHAT I WANT TO SAY
TO MYSELF IN THE MIRROR

1042
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,562
WHO HAS BEEN WORKING HARD FOR 17 YEARS

1043
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,596
Woo-young.

1044
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,233
What?

1045
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,535
What?

1046
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,271
Yeah? What?

1047
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,172
THAT PSYCHO

1048
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,107
-He's getting negative 20 points.
-Okay.

1049
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,176
-Hang on.
-Please take this.

1050
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,711
And go back to your seat.

1051
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,915
-What I just handed you is a time machine.
-Okay.

1052
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,219
Where would you like to go
in that time machine?

1053
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,388
With this time machine,
I'd like to go back

1054
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,357
to the time I first met

1055
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,192
the four of you before me.

1056
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,327
-Nice.
-Why?

1057
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:14,332
I wasn't quite happy
with how things went back then.

1058
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,868
I think I didn't leave
such a good impression on you.

1059
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,003
Yes, you're right.

1060
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,639
So I'd like to rewrite that moment.

1061
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,875
Why don't you come in again as if
you are meeting us for the first time?

1062
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,211
You were wearing a Matrix outfit.

1063
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,646
LET'S GO BACK TO THE START!

1064
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,982
We'll think of it as meeting you
for the first time too.

1065
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:31,882
ONE SUMMER DAY IN 2022

1066
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,217
Who's the next member?

1067
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,819
-Who is it?
-Who could it be?

1068
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,753
How have you been?

1069
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,555
-Hey, hello.
-Who's that?

1070
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,157
Isn't that Woo-young of 2PM?

1071
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,559
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah?

1072
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:43,794
SAME THING ON REPEAT FOR THE 3RD TIME

1073
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:44,729
Yeah?

1074
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,897
Is that your concept right now?

1075
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,266
He's taking the easy route today.

1076
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:49,834
Are you nervous?

1077
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,968
PLEASE STOP

1078
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,770
You seem to be struggling with this.

1079
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,706
In the future, when you have
a child of your own,

1080
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,775
what would you like to name them?

1081
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,210
-You're a Jang.
-It's Jang.

1082
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,512
-My child's name?
-Yes, your child's name.

1083
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,714
I would…

1084
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,783
-If it's a son…
-Yes.

1085
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,352
…I'd like to name him after me,
Jang Woo-young.

1086
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,920
-What?
-Really?

1087
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,055
Oh, I see.

1088
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,526
His answer doesn't show
any quick thinking at all.

1089
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,695
Has anyone actually done that?

1090
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,298
So I'd like to be the one to start it.

1091
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,066
What if your wife objects?

1092
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,435
I'll divorce her.

1093
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,237
I'LL DIVORCE HER

1094
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,172
That's a simple solution.

1095
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,641
Then, let me ask you
about your daily life.

1096
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,611
Your studio seemed unnecessarily big.

1097
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,314
Are you really making music there?

1098
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,548
Are you doing something else?

1099
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,516
What?

1100
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,451
-Aren't you doing something else?
-What?

1101
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,019
Listen, Mr. Jang Woo-young.

1102
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,187
You should get out!

1103
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,155
THIS IS AN INTERVIEW!

1104
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:45,289
What on earth?

1105
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,224
What are you doing?

1106
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,859
Let's just score him.

1107
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,362
I want to be with the four of you.

1108
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,597
I'd like to join this club.

1109
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:54,999
Yeah?

1110
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,767
Can you hear me? Yeah?

1111
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,902
All right.

1112
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,204
Can you hear me?

1113
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,172
We can hear you.

1114
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,807
HOW WILL WOO-YOUNG BE SCORED
AFTER TORMENTING THEM?

1115
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,276
One, two, three.

1116
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,277
REVEALING HIS SCORE

1117
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,411
WHAT?

1118
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,346
-What?
-What is it?

1119
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,246
Ten points?

1120
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,549
I will give him one point.

1121
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:12,483
Wow.

1122
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,984
You get one point for your dance.

1123
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,554
You didn't do anything else.

1124
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,823
My score is in this, actually.

1125
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:19,724
What is it?

1126
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,991
I give him 10 points.

1127
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,660
What?

1128
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,295
-Why?
-Because it was something fresh.

1129
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:25,996
I knew it.

1130
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,264
Do we need anything else?

1131
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,734
Joo Woo-jae is hot these days.

1132
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,535
How many points?

1133
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,637
-I gave him 1.1.
-1.1.

1134
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,206
And what's your score, Jin-kyung?

1135
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,375
-Even a point is too generous for him.
-Yes.

1136
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,876
It's for old time's sake.

1137
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,877
He got 13.1 points.

1138
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,545
-Come back here.
-Come back here.

1139
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,114
Or just get out.

1140
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,548
-Don't come back.
-Yes, just leave.

1141
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,518
-What?
-Gosh, darn it.

1142
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,919
INTERVIEW NUMBER 4
JOO WOO-JAE

1143
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:49,820
It's me.

1144
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,888
RESUME
NAME: JOO WOO-JAE

1145
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,656
Hello there.

1146
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,226
-Please accept my bow, dear interviewers.
-Why?

1147
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,294
-Thank you.
-Very nice.

1148
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,295
STARTS OFF WITH BOWING DEEPLY

1149
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,164
You're well-mannered.

1150
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,234
Geez. I already dislike you
because of that deep bow.

1151
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,869
Honorable Interviewers.

1152
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,204
-Yes.
-I've come to try out the interview.

1153
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:10,508
I'll do my best to
give you witty and sincere answers,

1154
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,879
handsome and beautiful interviewers.

1155
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,347
Let's dive in.

1156
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,550
This may seem a bit of a sensitive topic,

1157
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,285
but let me ask you a question.

1158
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,488
Well, you see here

1159
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,323
-a red and blue helmet.
-Okay.

1160
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,125
Which color would you use?

1161
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,428
WHICH COLOR WOULD YOU USE?

1162
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,595
Well, you see,

1163
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:33,564
it's just life, right?

1164
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,933
These are just props.

1165
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,435
They're props.

1166
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,069
-Yes, pick one.
-Pick one of these two.

1167
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,271
Pick one.

1168
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,605
-Wow.
-Geez.

1169
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,808
-You have to choose.
-This is it?

1170
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,143
But, sir.

1171
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,013
-I have discovered something.
-Yes?

1172
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,948
-Why do you keep raising the red one?
-No.

1173
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,883
I'll leave them right here.

1174
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,084
-Wow.
-Which one?

1175
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,186
-This is tough.
-Pick one.

1176
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,189
-These are gears you use for tae kwon do.
-Right.

1177
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,390
-Wow.
-Which one?

1178
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,958
I have skin trouble,

1179
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,627
so I can't use any gears.
I apologize, dear interviewers.

1180
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,528
TRIES TO LET IT SLIDE

1181
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:08,399
After I get treated and get accepted,
I'll wear it in front of you.

1182
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,601
Sorry about my skin issue.

1183
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,604
Is there anyone who can pick one?

1184
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,272
Why can't you pick one?

1185
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,775
-Woo-young, which one?
-Isn't yours already decided?

1186
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,713
Isn't yours already decided?

1187
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,182
HAVE YOU LOST IT?

1188
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,086
Are you trying to destroy me, you jerk?

1189
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,322
You know, I've been putting up with you.

1190
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,823
-You psycho.
-What's wrong?

1191
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,725
I'm going to kill you, you jerk.

1192
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,961
-This is quite interesting.
-It's amusing.

1193
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,529
-I'm going to kill you.
-But I…

1194
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,598
-Hey! How dare you.
-This is so entertaining.

1195
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,666
You're really testing me, you jerk.

1196
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,567
I'll kill you.

1197
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,302
-This is so amusing.
-All right.

1198
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,471
-Your specialty is doing impressions?
-Yes.

1199
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,174
-Let's see.
-Can you do Lee Seung-hwan?

1200
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,042
Do an impersonation
of Lee Seung-hwan's singing.

1201
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,345
-Why did you do it?
-Very good.

1202
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,513
How about Kim Min-jong?

1203
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,181
Now

1204
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,115
-Kim Jang-hoon?
-What?

1205
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,116
Yeah

1206
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:00,918
Kim Dong-ryul?

1207
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,488
Cho Sae-ho?

1208
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,393
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ME?

1209
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,861
All right.

1210
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,463
-You're good.
-You're good.

1211
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,099
We read about how you grew up.

1212
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,235
"I did not grow up
confined to standardized thinking.

1213
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,104
I grew up with music and movies."

1214
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,339
-You wrote so eloquently.
-You're so good at this.

1215
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,407
"I liked breaking the mold."

1216
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,677
"Except for the law, I didn't like rules.
I like being unconventional."

1217
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:27,578
Are you so great?

1218
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,746
Yes, I am great.

1219
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:29,713
Are you very great?

1220
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,315
Because I am so great--

1221
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,816
Did you write this to show off?

1222
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,386
-No.
-You wrote about things like

1223
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:38,422
"I think I can accept
everyone for who they are."

1224
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,723
"I haven't gotten into fights."

1225
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,492
-Is this…
-Yeah.

1226
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,561
Shouldn't you hear me out after asking me?

1227
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,795
You think you're so great?

1228
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,264
Because I am so great, I applied to

1229
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,900
this High-class Celebrity Club.

1230
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,436
-What about us? Are we bad?
-Shouldn't you be great to join?

1231
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,004
No, all of you here are great.

1232
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,207
-Why? Because you've joined this club.
-Look,

1233
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,411
in your skills that set you apart
from others, you wrote,

1234
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,546
"I am not that smart.

1235
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:06,383
But thankfully, the others beside me
keep the bar pretty low."

1236
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,852
How many have you insulted just now?

1237
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,287
Four people.

1238
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,958
-You can count fast.
-Okay.

1239
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,292
Let me ask you something.

1240
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,330
-He counts fast.
-Your motto in life is

1241
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:20,864
"Don't look up. Look for an opening."

1242
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,132
That sounds cool.

1243
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,100
Are you so great?

1244
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,202
ARE YOU SO GREAT?

1245
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,504
Are you? I'm just asking.

1246
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,676
-Just admit it.
-I don't think that I am that great.

1247
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,011
All right.

1248
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,646
Is that all you want to hear?

1249
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,848
"Don't look up. Look for an opening."
What does that mean?

1250
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,117
I used to work as a model.

1251
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:43,554
I didn't think I should
aim to be the best model.

1252
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,656
-Okay.
-Be a colorful model.

1253
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:46,724
-Got it.
-Oh.

1254
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,292
Got it.

1255
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:53,998
Let's move on. Everyone wrote about
how they overcame their hardships.

1256
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,767
-May I briefly ask you a question?
-Sure.

1257
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,602
-Mr. Cho Sae-ho.
-Yes?

1258
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,739
I don't think you were
this passionate in the other interviews.

1259
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,907
It's because of the way you wrote it.

1260
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:04,908
Even the way you sit--

1261
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,276
Just listen up!

1262
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,214
In the part about writing
your experience of overcoming hardships,

1263
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,751
everyone else wrote
their experiences of how tough it was.

1264
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,587
"I think of them as an experience
rather than overcoming them."

1265
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,821
-You think you're so great?
-What?

1266
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,757
Are you so great?

1267
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,792
He's just spewing out maxims.

1268
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,827
-Whenever…
-Have you been to the hospital?

1269
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,964
…I experienced hardships,

1270
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,133
I didn't think of them as hardships.

1271
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,968
I just thought of them as experiences.

1272
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,103
It says to write an experience
of overcoming them!

1273
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,872
It's because I never overcame them.

1274
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,174
I experienced them,
so I have no experience.

1275
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,344
Gosh, he has so much to say. Look at this.

1276
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,278
Right here. Geez.

1277
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,913
What's this? What the heck is this?

1278
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,150
I have 1.32 million subscribers
and 1.37 followers.

1279
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,317
You think you're so great?

1280
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,721
Are you so great?

1281
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,791
Fine, I only have 120,000.

1282
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,025
HE MUST HAVE HIT A NERVE

1283
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,560
This is how you are.

1284
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,929
Engineering College, Hongik University.
Are you so great?

1285
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,165
USING THE INTERVIEW
TO SAY WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY

1286
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,266
Are you so great?

1287
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,169
You know, these are things I accomplished.

1288
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:09,173
-He's great and good at counting.
-You're bragging too much though.

1289
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,774
You won the fashionista award.

1290
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,242
-You think you're so great?
-What are we doing?

1291
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,011
-My gosh.
-Goodness gracious.

1292
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,313
You were in a movie called Can't Hide It?

1293
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,414
Why didn't you hide it?

1294
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,818
-Did you hide it?
-What's the point?

1295
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,219
I don't have

1296
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,388
the most beautiful wife like you, Mr. Cho.

1297
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:25,789
That'll be all.

1298
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:26,690
THE END OF SCOLDING

1299
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,258
-That's it.
-Are you done now?

1300
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,161
I really liked your answer.

1301
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:35,299
I'm sorry. I get that this is
an interview under pressure,

1302
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,300
but it was just pressure.

1303
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,035
To be honest, you're pretty great, right?

1304
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,672
You lived a pretty happy life, Woo-Jae.

1305
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:46,210
And you've spent a long time
receiving the love from the public.

1306
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,112
-Now, it is time for you to leave.
-Okay.

1307
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,947
Perhaps that's 100 years down the road.

1308
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,182
What would you like to write
on your gravestone?

1309
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,517
WHAT WOULD I LIKE TO SAY ONLY GRAVESTONE?

1310
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,321
Well, there is something I want to write.

1311
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,288
What is it?

1312
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,558
I want to use the blank space.

1313
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,526
-Blank?
-Blank space?

1314
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,595
-Yes, I'd like to use that space.
-Okay.

1315
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:05,562
Well…

1316
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:12,369
THE QUESTION MAKES HIM THINK DEEPLY

1317
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,744
Jang Woo-young's girlfriend is "blank."

1318
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,646
-That's funny.
-Good.

1319
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,915
-Very good.
-That's how I'll leave it.

1320
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,083
-Okay.
-Good.

1321
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,951
You're getting a lot of points at the end.

1322
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,021
-You were very funny towards the end.
-Yes.

1323
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,557
His answer showed how much he thought

1324
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,892
-of me.
-Will you use it?

1325
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,394
-"Jang Woo-young's girlfriend is 'blank.'"
-Blank.

1326
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,464
If I were to die first,
I hope Woo-young would

1327
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,999
come visit me

1328
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,134
and write in that space

1329
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,235
with a permanent marker.

1330
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,136
The answer?

1331
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,238
-Write the answer?
-It's for his sake.

1332
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:52,509
We really pressed Mr. Joo
more than others during his interview.

1333
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,379
No, I didn't feel pressured at all.

1334
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,148
I was thinking that
the interview was very relaxed.

1335
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,917
-Excuse me.
-You see?

1336
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,353
But if you're going to be this lax,

1337
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,422
-don't do interviews.
-Fine.

1338
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,257
Write a poem using your name, Joo Woo-jae.

1339
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,325
-Joo.
-Okay.

1340
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,693
I feel so pressured right now.

1341
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,162
-Okay. Joo.
-This is the final one.

1342
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,597
Hurry up. Joo.

1343
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,333
People usually expect humor,
but it can be touching.

1344
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,501
HE FACES A CRISIS AFTER SHOWING OFF

1345
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,470
-You can pay us off.
-It would be better if it was funny too.

1346
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,840
-A lot of points are at stake.
-Yes.

1347
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,641
-Joo.
-Joo.

1348
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,444
You acted so cocky,
but you can't say a thing.

1349
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,284
When Joo Woo-jae dies.

1350
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,485
-Woo.
-Woo.

1351
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,287
Woo-young will come.

1352
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:38,856
-Jae.
-Jae.

1353
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,557
Please write your girlfriend's name.

1354
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,793
HE KILLED IT

1355
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,230
WHY IS HE PICKING ON ME UNTIL THE END?

1356
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,664
-Good.
-Was it good?

1357
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,967
-It was good.
-That'll be all.

1358
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,068
Let's score him.

1359
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,870
That was awesome.

1360
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,004
Thank you.

1361
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,540
I am so sick and tired of this.

1362
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,342
The scores. One, two, three.

1363
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,977
HIS INTERVIEW WENT FAVORABLY
WHAT IS HIS FINAL SCORE?

1364
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,545
-Woo-jae.
-It's pretty high.

1365
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,180
Eight points.

1366
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,815
Seven points.

1367
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,116
I only liked his acrostic poem.

1368
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,486
-Only his poem was good.
-I really liked his poem.

1369
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,088
You get three points.

1370
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,556
-He got zero at first.
-Let's move on.

1371
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,125
We attacked you pretty viciously,

1372
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,894
but you were fine until the end.

1373
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,496
Now that I have experienced it in person,
I can say that

1374
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,465
interviews are really

1375
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,133
all about brazenness and boldness.

1376
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,201
REMEMBER BRAZENNESS AND BOLDNESS

1377
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,570
-That's all you need.
-Any last words?

1378
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,006
High-class Celebrity Class?

1379
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,674
I don't give a crap.

1380
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,875
EVEN INTERVIEWERS ARE
PASSERSBY ON THE STREET

1381
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:32,876
Let's rescore him.

1382
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,711
Has everyone gone?

1383
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:35,646
Cho Sae-ho hasn't.

1384
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,580
Sae-ho hasn't?

1385
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:37,714
Let's do this, Sae-ho.

1386
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,883
-Everybody.
-Let's do this!

1387
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,152
Get ready. The battle is about to begin.

1388
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:47,291
Just think of the first four
as never even having started.

1389
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,725
I'm getting nervous.

1390
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,495
Hurry up. Let's get moving.

1391
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,130
INTERVIEW NUMBER 5
CHO SAE-HO

1392
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,464
All right, Mr. Cho Sae-ho.

1393
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,600
Come in.

1394
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,237
Are you so great?

1395
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,706
HE'S MUCH CALMER
THAN WHEN HE WAS AN INTERVIEWER

1396
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,308
-Introduce yourself.
-Hello.

1397
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,810
My name is Cho Sae-ho.

1398
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:07,844
I didn't ask you.

1399
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:08,946
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1400
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:10,280
-All right.
-Okay.

1401
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,682
-Is…
-Have a seat.

1402
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:12,683
Yes, ma'am.

1403
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,852
THE CHAIR SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED

1404
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,921
BUT HE SITS DOWN WITHOUT SAYING A WORD

1405
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,123
Okay,

1406
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,825
turn your head to the side you like.

1407
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,094
PAYBACK TIME

1408
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,663
I learned this when I was young.

1409
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,099
I shouldn't turn my head
but look up to the sky,

1410
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:33,704
so I will look up.

1411
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,073
These are just props.

1412
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,341
This interview…

1413
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,176
-This interview…
-Yes.

1414
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,877
You have a mission during the interview.

1415
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,013
Before the interview ends
and you are scored,

1416
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,181
you must eat all of this.

1417
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,950
This is your mission
during this interview.

1418
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,952
May I do the interview while eating?

1419
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,287
Yes, you may.

1420
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,188
I'm jealous.

1421
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,590
That isn't a mission. It's a perk.

1422
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,558
She's right.

1423
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,059
-You don't have any drinks.
-Okay.

1424
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:56,960
You must eat it all.

1425
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,295
Are you married, Mr. Cho?

1426
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,197
-Yes, I'm married.
-You're lying.

1427
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,398
NOM NOM

1428
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,367
What were the terms of your marriage?

1429
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,502
On October 20th, 2024,

1430
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,804
I got married.

1431
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,240
Is your wife your first love, Mr. Cho?

1432
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,746
My first love…

1433
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,319
JUST LAUGH IT OFF

1434
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:23,253
Answer the question.

1435
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,055
-Is she your first love?
-She's my last love.

1436
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,490
MY WIFE IS MY LAST LOVE

1437
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,759
-Is she your first love?
-She's my last love.

1438
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,461
Can you guarantee that?

1439
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,396
Well…

1440
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,432
SELF-IMPLODING

1441
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,768
Things are going smoothly today.

1442
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:38,735
Jin-kyung.

1443
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,170
I will

1444
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,039
protect it until the end.

1445
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,908
Someone wanted to protect theirs too.

1446
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:45,976
I'm determined…

1447
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,378
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

1448
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,447
I seem to have dug my own grave instead.

1449
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,083
Why do your eyes look so sad?

1450
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,486
My eyes aren't sad.
I briefly choked on the hamburger earlier.

1451
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,488
-Want some water?
-I'm okay.

1452
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,223
-Have some water.
-I'm okay.

1453
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,259
-Let's change your chair. Stand up.
-Let's change it.

1454
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,629
-Here you go.
-He's responding well

1455
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,264
to these tough situations.

1456
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,465
But he seems…

1457
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,566
It's quite comfortable.

1458
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,902
-You never complain.
-He's right.

1459
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,870
I've never complained in life--

1460
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:16,606
Despite that, you do have
complaints of your wife, don't you?

1461
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,308
-I don't--
-Tell us one.

1462
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:21,078
Is there anything you would like
your wife to improve a little?

1463
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:22,913
-There can't be none.
-Well,

1464
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,983
I wish my wife would
open up to me a little more.

1465
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,286
If there's anything lacking,

1466
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,321
-I wish she would tell me.
-Oh, I see.

1467
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,024
-You don't want her to hold it in.
-No, I hope not.

1468
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,325
This is an important question.

1469
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,060
Could you please answer it?

1470
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,362
-Yes.
-It'll reflect hugely in your score.

1471
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,831
-Understood.
-Okay.

1472
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,200
Please send a video letter
to your ex-girlfriend.

1473
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,004
IN ANGUISH

1474
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,109
You have to do this one.

1475
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,678
If you're going to react so negatively,

1476
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,279
why should we even interview you?

1477
00:51:56,346 --> 00:52:00,083
Can't you speak more easily
because you don't have feelings for her?

1478
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,019
-It's strange that you're hesitant.
-Despite that, I am…

1479
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,221
Then, Ms. Hong,

1480
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,424
why don't you send a video letter

1481
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,793
to your ex-husband first?

1482
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,529
-Nice.
-You should show him how it's done.

1483
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,165
-The interviewees can follow.
-She's on good terms with him.

1484
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,334
-I know.
-You don't have to mess with her.

1485
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,736
Our interviewer should
show him how it's not a big deal

1486
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,372
so that he can be shown an example.

1487
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,674
I'll be honest, oppa.

1488
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:27,277
OPPA…

1489
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,679
I'll be honest, oppa.

1490
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,781
I think there will be
so many articles about this.

1491
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,985
You think about your articles
but not mine?

1492
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:36,853
How does that make sense?

1493
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,421
How does that make any sense?

1494
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:40,190
You worry about your article.

1495
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,092
-He's a newlywed too.
-What about me?

1496
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,360
I've only been married a year.

1497
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,095
That's what that place is about.

1498
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,597
-Did you forget how you treated me?
-Okay.

1499
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,233
I hope everyone in the world is happy.

1500
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,836
To be honest,

1501
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,605
I've been in touch with him
yesterday and today.

1502
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,174
We are so close.

1503
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,178
Actually, La-el, her dad, and I,
the three of us,

1504
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,413
went to a mul naengmyeon place.

1505
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,183
The three of us went there
and really enjoyed the food.

1506
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,817
The three of us were eating like that,

1507
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,719
but others seemed more bothered by it.

1508
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:10,954
-The onlookers?
-Yes.

1509
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,191
-They looked very uncomfortable.
-That's how comfortable you were.

1510
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,593
We really do get delicious food together.

1511
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,528
-You have a healthy relationship.
-Yes.

1512
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,597
I'm thankful for that
and I'm rooting for him.

1513
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,399
She is leaving a letter for him.

1514
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:26,436
La-el's dad is someone I really like.

1515
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,839
If something like that happens to me,
I'll do a similar video letter too.

1516
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,942
I was the only one
who sent a video letter.

1517
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,244
THANKS FOR THAT
AND WE'LL JOIN YOU NEXT TIME

1518
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,346
-Here's the real last question.
-Okay.

1519
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,681
Seriously,

1520
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,584
when can we meet Cho Sae-ho Junior?

1521
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,618
You see,

1522
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,354
I'm dying to give them some allowance.

1523
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:45,922
They'll be so cute.

1524
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,057
Actually,

1525
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,661
this is a little bit
of a delicate subject.

1526
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,931
Right now, I enjoy
the time I spend with my wife

1527
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,499
-so much.
-You're so happy.

1528
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,336
-It may sound selfish.
-You haven't thought of it.

1529
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:03,974
It's true that I don't want
the child to take that time away.

1530
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,976
-The present is so precious.
-Yes,

1531
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,345
she'll have to devote her time.

1532
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,748
The job as a mom is
such a tough job, right?

1533
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,150
-Of course.
-She'll spend a long time with that child.

1534
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,786
I sometimes wonder if I can do my best

1535
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,056
to be with her throughout those times.

1536
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,493
She'll definitely be a good mom,

1537
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,962
but I'm not sure if I can be a good dad.

1538
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:30,400
So when I can
truly dedicate myself to my child,

1539
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,035
I think I can plan to have one.

1540
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,136
HE WANTS TO BE A DEDICATED DAD

1541
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:34,404
Thanks for your honest answer.

1542
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,474
You've answered the questions
more earnestly than I expected.

1543
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,510
-Yes, I did.
-I was very touched by it.

1544
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:44,481
INTERVIEWER CHO SAE-HO

1545
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:48,785
APPLICANT CHO SAE-HO

1546
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,855
ON THE VERGE OF A SPLIT PERSONALITY

1547
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,391
IT IS IMPORTANT WHERE ONE SITS

1548
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,825
Please reveal his score.

1549
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,260
One, two, three.

1550
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,495
-Gosh, it was…
-Oh.

1551
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,063
-What? One point?
-Wait.

1552
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,998
Since you're number one husband material.

1553
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:02,999
IT MEANS HE'S NO. 1 HUSBAND MATERIAL

1554
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,234
THANK YOU

1555
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,736
My score is close to a perfect score.

1556
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,540
-I'm like Sook.
-You gave him a perfect score.

1557
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,475
I couldn't hide
my personal feelings for him.

1558
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,643
Thank you.

1559
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,011
What's this? Is it five points?

1560
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,414
Since his name is Cho Sae-ho,
I tried to include that.

1561
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:18,882
I SEE

1562
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,917
-I like the number five too.
-How creative.

1563
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,219
-That was creative.
-I added the strokes to five to make "Ho."

1564
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,321
You're number one.

1565
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,488
Thank you.

1566
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,657
HIGH-CLASS CELEBRITY CLUB

1567
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:31,428
Let me announce the final results.

1568
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,631
In the Talk Box
we briefly conducted earlier,

1569
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,033
the staff chose the God of Talk.

00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,236
In this round, the members
chose the God of Talk.

1571

00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,510
Me?

1575
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:48,578
1ST PLACE KIM SOOK

1576
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,946
It's because I went first.

1577
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,114
I'm glad I went first.

1578
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,619
-It was safer to go first.
-It was safer to go first.

1579
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,188
We went too far later on.

1580
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,622
Woo-jae was close, wasn't he?

1581
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,726
Just so you know, Sook came in first
with 8.125 points.

1582
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,994
Second place was
Woo-jae with seven points.

1583
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,997
Third place was Sae-ho with 6.25 points.

1584
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:11,968
Fourth place was
Jin-kyung with 5.225 points.

1585
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,870
Woo-young, you got 3.2 points.

1586
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,506
Wait, Woo-young got
more points than I expected.

1587
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:17,941
He got a lot of points.

1588
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,309
You gave him 10 points.

1589
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,510
Oh, I gave him the points.

1590
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:21,945
I must've lost my mind. Geez.

1591
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,214
What? Yeah?

1592
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,616
HIGH-CLASS CELEBRITY CLUB

1593
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,719
THE HIGH-CLASS TALK WILL CONTINUE

1594
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,055
ONE HOUR LATER

1595
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,157
I live in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul.

1596
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,127
I'm in my third year of middle school.
My name is Kang Ji-yoon.

1597
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:38,661
Third year of middle school.

1598
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,565
THIRD YEAR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL MEANS
SHE'S THE SAME AGE AS LA-EL

1599
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:45,301
From the key word we got,

1600
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:48,605
I don't think someone your age
should send something like that.

1601
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,540
If he is 24 years older,

1602
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:51,775
is it your teacher?

1603
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,676
-I know.
-This isn't right.

1604
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:57,781
What I'm worried about is that
a lot of friends of mine

1605
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,483
are fangirling over idol groups.

1606
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:05,622
But I'm the only one who likes
Woo-jae who is much older than me.

1607
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,057
MAN, UNBELIEVABLE

1608
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,259
Really?

1609
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:10,693
Yes.

1610
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,396
He's going to get cocky about this now.

1611
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:14,898
I can't stand him.

1612
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,866
You think you're so great?

1613
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,273
