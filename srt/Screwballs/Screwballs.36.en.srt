1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,703
IN SOME PLACE IN GANGJIN

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,109
THERE WERE FARMHANDS WHO RULED THE VILLAGE

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,712
TODAY'S DRESS CODE: FARMHAND

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,848
It's good to see everyone.

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,449
Hello.

6
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,953
The madam I am working for

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,123
has about 80 places

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:24,791
that I manage.

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,859
Why?

10
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,127
To make money.

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,928
-Oh, she runs a business?
-Yes.

12
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:29,963
Of course.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,531
So I bought this for myself

14
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,932
from Cartier.

15
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,334
REALLY?

16
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:36,736
It's Cartier.

17
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:37,670
LANKY CHECKS IF IT'S REAL

18
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,372
-This time--
-It's really Cartier.

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,573
-Really?
-Yes.

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,009
After cleaning Madam's house, we went to

21
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,477
the department store Galleria.

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,779
Can a farmhand do that?

23
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,015
Don't you know the times we're living in?

24
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,884
Farmhands are different from before.

25
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,287
-You know, I think--
-Farmhands used to only work in one place.

26
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,323
Nowadays, if you work well like I do,
you get called from many places.

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,559
Don't you know The Organizing Queen?

28
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:00,994
I help out with organizing too.

29
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,696
The reason why
I'm not motivated from the opening

30
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,665
-is because we made a pact.
-Right.

31
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,300
-That's right.
-Farmhands.

32
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,902
What will we do with farmhands?

33
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:09,836
Put a twist on it?

34
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,604
We decided to test the waters,

35
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,873
so we all agreed on
dressing up as farmhands.

36
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,642
Pure and simple.

37
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,645
So I dressed up as a farmhand today.

38
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,415
I simply added a couple of details
to switch up the perspective.

39
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,583
Then, I stood up there.

40
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,919
-It was demoralizing.
-What's going on?

41
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,921
Honestly, when I saw

42
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,690
that person, I thought,
"There's nothing we can do about this."

43
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,460
I'll do my best in the main segment.

44
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,828
-Me too.
-I'll stay out of this.

45
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,464
-What's wrong?
-I'd like to apologize in advance too.

46
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,933
-Those two are also…
-These two as well.

47
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:40,967
-Welcome.
-Hello.

48
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,836
You should just say hello
and be done with it.

49
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,238
-Hello.
-Hi.

50
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,640
-Hey.
-I'm Oh-sung.

51
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,809
My name is Han-eum.

52
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:50,944
Aren't you Monk Sanzang?

53
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,911
Nice to meet you.

54
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,413
You look like Monk Sanzang.

55
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,048
I am called Han-eum.

56
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,883
We are very good friends.

57
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,218
-You're good friends?
-Yes.

58
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,353
How did you get here?

59
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,454
I took "hit the road."

60
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,889
You took "hit the road"?

61
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,458
Then what about you, Han-eum?

62
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,961
How did you get here?

63
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,062
HELP ME OUT, SOOK

64
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,463
-Keep it funny.
-Fork in the road.

65
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,364
Fork in the road.

66
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,600
-What?
-I took the "fork in the road."

67
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,169
-A fork?
-A fork.

68
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,104
You were in
this funny business for a while.

69
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,272
But you said you took

70
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,640
-the "fork in the road?"
-Wait.

71
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,841
What did you take?

72
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,277
-Oh, me?
-Yes.

73
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,478
As for me…

74
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,781
Let's see how funny you are.

75
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,150
What did you take?

76
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,050
FEELING THE PRESSURE

77
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,852
I am so sorry.

78
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,054
I can't possibly beat yours.

79
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:35,955
RAN OUT OF AD LIB

80
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,924
-Hello.
-Oh, my.

81
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,592
-What's up with him?
-Hang on. What?

82
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,560
Who's this guy?

83
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,763
-Hello.
-Oh, my.

84
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,298
AND WHAT'S THIS?

85
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,232
Who's this guy?

86
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,101
Isn't this episode a farmhand special?

87
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,068
Vroom.

88
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,937
Did you not get the message?

89
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,105
I'm here. Vroom, vroom.

90
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,707
-Did you get the wrong message?
-Come on.

91
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,743
Didn't we get the message
to dress up as farmhands?

92
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,111
THE CULPRIT
WHO DEMORALIZED THE OTHER FARMHANDS

93
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,579
-Why so gross?
-He's like Hong-chul.

94
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,480
I am

95
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,215
the dude

96
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,417
who rides bikes. The dude.

97
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,385
The dude?

98
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,220
-The dude?
-Yes, the dude.

99
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,189
-I'm a biker dude.
-I couldn't even imagine

100
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,490
that he'd take this route.

101
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,593
How did you get dude from farmhand?

102
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,894
Aren't you hot, Woo-young?

103
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:15,795
CURRENTLY 28 DEGREES CELSIUS

104
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,963
He's a dude.

105
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,298
SCOFFS

106
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,566
I'm a bit hot.

107
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,502
-He's even wearing gloves.
-You know--

108
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,636
-I'm a bit hot.
-It lights up?

109
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,171
Let me ask you one thing.

110
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,907
We were asked to dress as farmhands,
so how did you end up as a dude?

111
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,842
I didn't want to do as they said.

112
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,911
-There was something within me.
-Rebelliousness.

113
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,646
I wanted to twist it as soon as I heard.

114
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,014
I'm here. Vroom, vroom.

115
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,150
THE RESULT OF THAT

116
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,420
The thing is, the dress code
we gave you was farmhands.

117
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,355
There is one dude though.

118
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,724
The term farmhand refers to

119
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,627
a strong, reliable worker
hired by a farming household

120
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,462
to handle fieldwork and other tasks.

121
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,265
Most people think farmhands
were of the lowest class,

122
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,767
but unlike slaves who were lowest class,
they were farmers.

123
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,436
-For real?
-They voluntarily worked

124
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,604
for wealthy households.

125
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,738
-Of course.
-Voluntarily?

126
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,207
-I didn't know that.
-I did some research.

127
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,408
Farmhands didn't just work.

128
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,776
They worked

129
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,778
for a wage.

130
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,014
Their lives were

131
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,782
pretty good
if they worked for a rich family.

132
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,618
So they're classed as farmers?

133
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,586
-Yes, they're farmers.
-Not slaves?

134
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,623
That's why there were
scandals with the madams.

135
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,624
They were close by.

136
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,861
Good job. You said what I wanted to say.

137
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,329
I'm a dude.

138
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,431
-What are you saying?
-That's why farmhands had…

139
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,000
-What are you saying, man?
-…so many…

140
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,635
Why are you clapping?

141
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,937
When the madam is in her room,

142
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,340
she'd say, "Dol-soe, are you there?"

143
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,075
"I'm right outside, my lady."

144
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,443
"Come in here briefly."

145
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,078
"May I come in?"

146
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,580
Geez, that is so lewd.

147
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,048
-Yeah.
-What?

148
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,950
-It's lewd.
-When I saw that as a kid--

149
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,018
-That's not lewd.
-It is.

150
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:45,918
No, it isn't.

151
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,887
This is what I was saying.

152
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,055
"Dol-soe, are you there?

153
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,557
Come into my room
and catch the cockroach."

154
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,859
-That was it.
-Right.

155
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:54,927
Geez.

156
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,664
Am I the only one
that thought it was lewd?

157
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,233
She must've thought
of the cockroach's pose.

158
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,735
COME ON

159
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,437
-The way it walks.
-Come on.

160
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,639
Isn't it time for some lewd stories?

161
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,940
Don't make me the weird guy.

162
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,710
You went too far though.

163
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,345
WHATEVER

164
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,114
-Madams are scared when--
-You're no fun.

165
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,783
Let me ask you this.

166
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,619
Tell us whose family you work for.

167
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,387
Well, as for me,

168
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,856
-when my master guy…
-Master guy?

169
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,925
…says he wants to go on a trip,

170
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,994
-I'd immediately say, "Get on."
-I see.

171
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,429
The madam would like that.

172
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,030
-Quick delivery.
-My lady

173
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,832
is innocent but obsessive.

174
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,334
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT NOW?

175
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,401
-About you?
-Yes.

176
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,903
-Your madam is?
-Yes, she is.

177
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,572
She's pure,
but that's her unexpected charm.

178
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,506
Oh.

179
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,841
How did you find out about that?

180
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,609
GRINNING

181
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,278
Geez. Come on.

182
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,980
Are you two in a relationship?

183
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,882
SHHH

184
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,184
-He is.
-What the heck?

185
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,418
He's having a fling with her?

186
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,820
-As for me--
-How can I say it?

187
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,457
Our company is systemized well.

188
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,591
-Company?
-Farmhand company?

189
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,126
Yes, my farmhand company.

190
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,528
Our president provides very good benefits,

191
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,098
so we just use English names.

192
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,566
-It's horizontal.
-Yes, it is.

193
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,567
-Kelly?
-Sebastian,

194
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,870
Tony, Scarlet, etc. That's how we run it.

195
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,172
-Regarding parental leave…
-You have that?

196
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,340
…we get three years.

197
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,376
-Three whole years?
-Yes, three years.

198
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,144
If we have one child, we get two cows.

199
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,946
If we have two children, we get five cows.

200
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,047
That's so nice.

201
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,348
It's amazing!

202
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,984
The president of
our company is right here.

203
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,319
I'm not the president.

204
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,453
I have a boss too.

205
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,155
-But he works for me.
-That's right.

206
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,823
-I am his boss…
-Yes.

207
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,592
…so I don't do any physical labor.

208
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,960
I do the accounting.

209
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,561
Weren't you carrying a pack frame earlier?

210
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,630
You know what?

211
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,500
-Sounds like a typical pyramid scheme.
-She was carrying a pack frame.

212
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,169
Well, I do accounting.

213
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,137
Money issues.

214
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,807
I exchange yuan or dollars
into Korean currency.

215
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,475
That's the kind of work I do.

216
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,244
Most of my deliveries are to her.

217
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,513
She calls me all the time.

218
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,014
It's a huge company.

219
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,948
Then,

220
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,450
you all help each other out.

221
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,552
It's all working out well for you.

222
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,855
You all belong to various companies.

223
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,457
Since you worked so hard,

224
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,326
-I thought you'd be exhausted.
-Yes, that's right.

225
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,363
So we prepared a special time
for all of you farmhands.

226
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
Really?

227
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,732
The Farmhand special.

228
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,167
Today's theme is

229
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,401
Farmhand Holiday.

230
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,903
FARMHAND HOLIDAY

231
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,471
-That's so sweet.
-I love it.

232
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,574
This is a village
called Byeongyeong in Gangjin.

233
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,608
It's so pretty here.

234
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,210
-It's so pretty.
-What a pretty village.

235
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,745
-It's like a fairy-tale village.
-Yeah.

236
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,447
You were napping so you didn't see it,

237
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,948
but the fortress was

238
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,550
-so pretty.
-I want to go see it.

239
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,855
THE STONE WALL PATH BATHED IN SUNLIGHT

240
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,259
THE FORTRESS OF GANGJIN
SCULPTED BY THE PASSAGE OF TIME

241
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,230
By the way, do you see
the stone wall next to you?

242
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,531
-Yes.
-It's a cultural heritage.

243
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,834
This is from way back when?

244
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,135
Yes, it's a cultural heritage.

245
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,839
You know, I noticed that
it looked different than the ones in Jeju.

246
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,742
By the way, even within Gangjin,
Byeongyeong-myeon is

247
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,980
actively carrying out
urban regeneration projects.

248
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,316
That's why some young people
have come down from Seoul

249
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,320
to use their expertise
to start businesses here,

250
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,522
and it's also being
developed as a tourist destination.

251
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,692
As a result, it has been selected
as the best area in urban regeneration

252
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,696
by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
and Transport.

253
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,798
-This alley is so pretty.
-It's so nice.

254
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,267
I also heard that
there's a bulgogi village here.

255
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,002
-Bulgogi alley?
-Their bulgogi is famous.

256
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,737
PLANNING TO VISIT SHORTLY

257
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,405
Lately, I have been

258
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,774
obsessed with bulgogi.

259
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,209
-All of a sudden?
-What?

260
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,478
-Aren't we going to the bulgogi village?
-Yes.

261
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,180
-Are the portions big?
-Of course.

262
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,149
I'm sure they'll have enough for you.

263
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,151
-They'll have three pieces for you to eat.
-Yeah.

264
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,520
-How many pieces?
-Three.

265
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,454
Two?

266
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,823
-Show us.
-Four pieces?

267
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,691
-Show us.
-Oh, yeah.

268
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,860
Since we're going anyway, eat five pieces.

269
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,429
-You've improved.
-Stop. He got sick last time he ate a lot.

270
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,999
-All right.
-I'm excited about the bulgogi.

271
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,767
All you farmhands have been
working so hard.

272
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,502
Now, you get to go on vacation together,

273
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,571
-so please enjoy it.
-I'm excited.

274
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,406
The farmhand that worked hard,
take a leave.

275
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,309
The perfect farmhand holiday
is waiting for you.

276
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,112
-The first spot is already interesting.
-Okay.

277
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,713
It's the building behind you.

278
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,081
It looks pretty plain, right?

279
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,516
-It does.
-That building?

280
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,717
Shall we head over there?

281
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,052
-Okay.
-What is it?

282
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,854
The village looks prettier in the evening.

283
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,222
Vroom.

284
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,290
Over here.

285
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,158
Gosh, what is this?

286
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,593
I smell something delicious.

287
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,664
AS YOU WALK ALONG
THE SERENE STONE WALL PATH

288
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,065
YOU DISCOVER AN UNEXPECTED

289
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,767
HOT SPOT

290
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,069
-Hello.
-Hello.

291
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,004
-Wow! Look at that.
-What is that?

292
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,372
STYLISH PUB

293
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,607
Is it a brewery?

294
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,442
I think it's a brewery.

295
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,877
That's awesome.

296
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,212
This is the first holiday spot
for Farmhand Holiday.

297
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,648
Thanks to Gangjin's youth support program,

298
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,885
the business owner who used to
make makgeolli and beer in Seongsu,

299
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,854
moved to Gangjin,
and sells his own handcrafted beers

300
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,523
at his brewery called Hamel Brewery.

301
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,992
-I've heard of Hamel before.
-Hamel?

302
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,961
-Hamel's Journal.
-Right.

303
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,697
-The Dutch person from Hamel's Journal…
-Oh, Hamel?

304
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,933
…was also exiled here in Gangjin.

305
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,468
-He was?
-Yes.

306
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,303
That's why Hamel Museum
is right next door.

307
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,237
-Wow.
-Wow.

308
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,007
That Dutch person spent
a long time here in Gangjin?

309
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,375
Exactly.

310
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,045
You know, I was enjoying
this traditional beauty of Korea,

311
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,515
but then, I turned around
and saw this very hip brewery.

312
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,650
-It's so nice.
-For real.

313
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,951
This place suits Woo-young.

314
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,219
I was surprised by it.

315
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,022
-May I introduce the owner of this place?
-Yes.

316
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,023
-Are you curious?
-Yes.

317
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,358
He came here from Seongsu.

318
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,927
-He returned to the countryside in a way.
-I know.

319
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,528
Hello.

320
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,197
Hello, sir.

321
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,099
He must've been working.

322
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,467
-Hello.
-Hello.

323
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,035
Please introduce yourself.

324
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,604
My name is Kim Hui-eun.

325
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,272
Just like Hamel, I'm stuck here,

326
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,442
but I'm making beer
and traditional liquor instead.

327
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,445
You moved here from Seoul?

328
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,513
Yes.

329
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,281
What did you like about this place?

330
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,950
It must not have been easy.

331
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,552
-There are so many people in Seongsu.
-It's a hot spot.

332
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,987
Isn't it nearly impossible?

333
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,456
He mentioned
the urban regeneration project, right?

334
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,859
I guess I found an opportunity in Gangjin.

335
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,861
Then, what about your business in Seoul?

336
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,095
The one in Seongsu-dong?

337
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,964
-I formed a co-op…
-Okay.

338
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,433
-…so it still runs in a small scale.
-In Seongsu?

339
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,669
THE CEO LISTENS CAREFULLY

340
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,606
Then, do you get customers here?
Are there a lot of tourists?

341
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,442
We have a lot.
Maybe around seven people a day?

342
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,877
-Seven?
-Yes.

343
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,278
But your store is huge.

344
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,380
-What about weekends?
-Seven people is…

345
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,182
-I'm sure you get a lot.
-10 on weekends.

346
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,717
WHAT?

347
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,885
You know what I think?

348
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,288
He doesn't make a profit
from the number of customers.

349
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,891
After brewing his beer,

350
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,360
he probably sells
and distributes them elsewhere.

351
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,196
Exactly. For example,
as you can see, there are many here today.

352
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,864
Today is the most customers I've had.

353
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,866
Since opening your brewery?

354
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,201
After opening it?

355
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,170
There were times when we had more,

356
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,038
-but there are many today.
-How many more?

357
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,140
We get a lot of tourist groups.

358
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,377
Our main sales channel
is through distribution.

359
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,145
-I see.
-It's through distribution.

360
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,248
-So you're kind of like a manufacturer.
-That's right.

361
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,450
But since we're here,

362
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,385
we can't just leave.
Can we have some beer?

363
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,352
We have to try it.

364
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,755
Can we taste what he made?

365
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:07,927
So Farmhand Holiday will be
carried out as a team competition.

366
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,129
Through the team game,

367
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,931
you can either win

368
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,201
-the beer that he made or not.
-Oh.

369
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,636
-That's how it'll be.
-I really want to try it.

370
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,071
The lager looks good.

371
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,775
Do you all enjoy drinking alcohol?

372
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,411
He's dependent and she's an alcoholic.

373
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,345
-Hey!
-And him?

374
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,781
-He drinks until he's hammered.
-You know,

375
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,383
the only time I do that
is during team dinners with Screwballs.

376
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,719
The two of us don't drink alcohol.

377
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,722
-We don't drink.
-To be honest, I should drink less.

378
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,492
I think he's been saying that
for the last three years.

379
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,726
Don't you drink a lot less?

380
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,861
How much less?

381
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:46,165
I used to drink six to seven days a week,
but it went down to five days.

382
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,733
-That's a lot?
-Five days.

383
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,634
For two days.

384
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,002
I guess you're just healthy.

385
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,505
But you know, I'm sure I'll die someday.

386
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,974
-Isn't this a special beer?
-Yes.

387
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,008
He made it himself.

388
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,743
IT IS FILLED WITH THE OWNER'S

389
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,677
LOVE AND CARE

390
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,348
It isn't just the countless common beers.

391
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,116
A truly special beer is at stake

392
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,353
in this game that we are about to play.

393
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,854
The title of this game is

394
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,422
Words Accomplish Anything.

395
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,324
Words Accomplish Anything.

396
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,560
I think Sae-ho used to say this a lot.

397
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,996
We say this to someone every now and then.

398
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,732
Hey, does that make sense to you?

399
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,934
He'd say, "Does that make sense to you?"

400
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,703
The meaning of this game though

401
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,772
is exactly that.
Words can accomplish anything.

402
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,508
It means
words can accomplish anything you want.

403
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,577
You are all farmhands right now, right?

404
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,045
-Yes.
-However,

405
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,048
in this game, you get to be
someone else rather than a farmhand.

406
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,317
You can be a top star or a madam.

407
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,455
You'll get a chance to win opportunities
to rise to a variety of statuses.

408
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,990
I told you it was a team competition.

409
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,294
You'll get various topics
based on statuses and situations.

410
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,798
Each person has to create
a coherent sentence that fits the topic.

411
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,801
I'm going to give you a word in each turn.

412
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,206
You have to start your sentence
with the word I give you.

413
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,508
For example, if the topic is farmhand

414
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,411
and I said the first word is "I."

415
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,680
-I saw it with my own eyes, my lady.
-Exactly.

416
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,014
You can say that.

417
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,951
Once again, if the topic is farmhand

418
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,120
and I say the first word is "now."

419
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,857
-Now is the time, my lady?
-That's correct.

420
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,326
Woo-young, the topic is farmhand.
Start a sentence with "now."

421
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,161
Now, I can do anything, ma'am.

422
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,062
Very good.

423
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,865
Then, it doesn't matter that
all of us start the sentence with "now"?

424
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,067
-I'll be giving different words.
-Oh.

425
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,702
THE TOPIC IS THE SAME
BUT THE FIRST WORD IS RANDOM

426
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,339
Then, I'll give you the topic.

427
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,241
I want a swig of that.

428
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,375
Madam.

429
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,276
TOPIC FOR ROUND 1
MADAM

430
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,911
-It's "madam."
-Madam?

431
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:46,118
THE MADAMS THAT GLADLY GAVE
THE FIVE FARMHANDS SOME TIME OFF

432
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,287
Okay, Woo-jae.

433
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,455
WORDS ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
MADAM SERIES

434
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,357
"I."

435
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,491
I'm lonely.

436
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,393
Now is the time.

437
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,794
He's crazy.

438
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,162
THE FARMHAND NEIGHBOR FEELS ASHAMED

439
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,497
What's wrong?

440
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,798
THIS IS HOW MY MADAM IS

441
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,300
Oh, the madam said that.

442
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,936
-I'm the madam, right?
-That's right.

443
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,337
Your turn, Sook.

444
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,238
"Let."

445
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,973
Let me give you everything.

446
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,642
THAT HOUSEHOLD'S THE SAME

447
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,844
Let me give you everything.

448
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,079
Just do as I say.

449
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,915
Come on, now.

450
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,183
Sorry. Let's stop the game briefly.

451
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,119
May I ask what you are offering?

452
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,321
-Well, you know…
-I'll buy them a house

453
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,290
and a horse. You know…

454
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,257
He worked well.

455
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,792
-It has many meanings.
-Yeah.

456
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,693
Okay.

457
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,128
You're up, Jin-kyung.

458
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,096
"Did."

459
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,765
Did you get my bed ready?

460
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,135
What? Is this the pattern?

461
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,136
The madam seems to be…

462
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,838
-She may have a servant.
-Okay.

463
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,073
Okay, Sae-ho.

464
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,708
"Come."

465
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,077
Come inside.

466
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,746
Isn't it too hot outside?

467
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,581
The inside would be hotter.

468
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,749
Let's go inside.

469
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,185
I have a fan.

470
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,154
Since it's going to be hotter inside…

471
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,689
Why does the madam

472
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,590
sound so scary?

473
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,859
-You're up, Woo-young.
-Jang Woo-young.

474
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,095
"Mum."

475
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,197
Mum's the word to your mom.

476
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,032
MUM'S THE WORD TO YOUR MOM

477
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,801
THEY MUST ALL WORK FOR THE SAME HOUSEHOLD

478
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,003
Why is the madam so seductive?

479
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,705
Mum's the word to your mom.

480
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,206
She could have given him

481
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,142
more allowance to him than last month
so it's a secret to his mom.

482
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,411
-Get your mind out of the gutter.
-Yeah.

483
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,879
It isn't in the gutter.

484
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,015
The farmhand was doing
what the madam ordered,

485
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,450
so why is it a secret to his mom?

486
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,286
You see, the madam and the mom
are school friends.

487
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,421
But since I ended up working at her house,

488
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,790
she had to be with her friend's son.
They had their reasons.

489
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,559
That's even sexier.

490
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,260
-With her friend's son?
-Yes.

491
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,595
Not with her son.

492
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,663
He's just working there.

493
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,865
-This is so trashy.
-He'd sweep and stuff.

494
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,234
It can be frustrating
from the mom's perspective.

495
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,802
Mum's the word to your mom.

496
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,004
The explanation is too long.

497
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,206
-You did it.
-Okay!

498
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,540
SUCCESS

499
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,609
Pick one, lager or IPA?

500
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,611
-Lager!
-Three lagers.

501
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,146
Just one glass.

502
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,881
We have to share the one glass?

503
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,216
FIVE OF US SHARE ONE GLASS?

504
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,984
We don't drink so it's okay.

505
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,687
-Wow. That looks amazing.
-Wow.

506
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,588
THE BEER IS BEING POURED

507
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,289
That looks so refreshing.

508
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,424
Start from Woo-young.

509
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,326
No, he'll drink all of it.

510
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,028
Let's play the loyalty game.

511
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,730
Sook and I will drink this much.

512
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,565
-The three of them can drink the rest.
-Okay.

513
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,867
-Can I drink now?
-Yes.

514
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,635
WOO-JAE WHO DOESN'T LIKE ALCOHOL
TAKES A SIP

515
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,371
What the heck?

516
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,240
What the heck are you doing?

517
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,310
HIS THROAT GULPS IT DOWN
AS SOON AS HE STARTS DRINKING

518
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,645
What the heck is he doing?

519
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,113
-I knew it.
-He's being funny.

520
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,314
-What the heck?
-I knew it.

521
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,817
-He can't even drink alcohol.
-He wanted to do that.

522
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,452
He did that to be funny.

523
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,387
You're going to pass out later.

524
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,023
Why would you
do that to yourself, Woo-jae?

525
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,191
HIS BODY REACTS AS SOON AS HE DRINKS

526
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,561
He's trying to give us a hard time.

527
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,997
-I know.
-Is he going to be okay later?

528
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,266
Wow! Sook,

529
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,869
take a sip. Even those
who don't like beer will like it.

530
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,938
Hey, it's really good.

531
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,440
TRY IT!

532
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:56,942
Jin-kyung, come on.

533
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:57,876
FINISHES IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION

534
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,978
HOW COULD YOU NOT EVEN HESITATE

535
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,046
-Isn't it good?
-Yeah.

536
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,015
-What are you guys doing?
-It's so good.

537
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:03,916
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

538
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,717
Geez. It smells amazing.

539
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,019
It's the best.

540
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,787
My gosh. Smell it.

541
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,788
LET'S SMELL IT AT LEAST

542
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,291
It's the best beer I have ever had.

543
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,258
It's really good.

544
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,160
Do they sell this anywhere?

545
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,228
Here.

546
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,864
You can buy it from here.

547
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,100
Do you sell this anywhere else
besides here?

548
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:23,869
BURP

549
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,204
BURP

550
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,039
BURPING AGAIN

551
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,108
BREATHING HEAVILY

552
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,409
BURP

553
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,046
HE WENT TOO FAR WITH THE ONE GLASS OF BEER
THAT HE DRANK TO SPITE THE OTHERS

554
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,581
BURP

555
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,184
I don't think we can play a team game.

556
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,719
LOOK AT HIM
DRINKING TOO MUCH IS HARMFUL

557
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,654
-I knew it, Woo-jae.
-Why'd you drink so much?

558
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,690
He didn't even drink like that
at our team dinners.

559
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,757
This is too funny.

560
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,293
You know what?
Gangjin's beer is definitely different.

561
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,461
-It's good.
-It's delicious.

562
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,529
It's really good.

563
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,730
He drank that much?

564
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,966
I drank this because I wanted to

565
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,767
protect Sae-ho and Woo-young

566
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,835
from alcohol.

567
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,771
Why me? I just wanted to taste it.

568
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,074
I wanted to be a shield for them.

569
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,308
Let's go.

570
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,711
The next topic is

571
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,045
Hong Jin-kyung.

572
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:07,946
Hong Jin-kyung?

573
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,081
Hong Jin-kyung?

574
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,883
MY COLLEAGUE HONG JIN-KYUNG?

575
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,084

It'll be the Jin-kyung I know.

578
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,362
Shall we start with Woo-jae?

579
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,099
-"Enough."
-Enough with the crap, Woo-jae.

580
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,400
ENOUGH WITH THE CRAP, WOO-JAE

581
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,603
YOU CAN HEAR HER VOICE IN THAT ANSWER

582
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,205
Success.

583
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,239
Sook, you're up.

584
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,140
"Straight."

585
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,842
Straight to bed.

586
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,311
I'm so sleepy.

587
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,445
JIN-KYUNG SLEEPS WELL ANYWHERE

588
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,548
I came here yesterday, but I'm so sleepy.

589
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:43,949
Success.

590
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,417
Okay, Jin-kyung.

591
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,119
"Jang."

592
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,787
Jang Woo-young, get lost.

593
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,290
SOUNDS FAMILIAR

594
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,891
Okay, Sae-ho.

595
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,825
"Look."

596
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,529
Look here.
Do I look like a pushover to you, Woo-jae?

597
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,664
IMPRESSIVE

598
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,433
You're really testing me, you jerk.
I'll kill you.

599
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,569
THE TONE AND LINES ARE SO JIN-KYUNG

600
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,970
It's totally possible.

601
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,205
Those are all Jin-kyung.

602
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,606
You're up, Woo-young.

603
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,141
-Give me a tough one.
-"Hey."

604
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,711
Hey, hey, hey.

605
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,580
THAT'S IT

606
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,281
-What was that?
-Fail.

607
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,816
-Why?
-What were you thinking?

608
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,785
-She says that a lot.
-"Hey, hey. What was that?"

609
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,286
That's what you should have said.

610
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,554
Woo-jae,

611
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,922
if you were Jin-kyung? "Hey."

612
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:24,823
Hey,

613
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,892
-look at him.
-Exactly.

614
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,093
Hey, what's that?

615
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,194
Hey, what's that?

616
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,462
Yeah. Hey, what's that?

617
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,964
Hey, what's that?

618
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,965
What's this?

619
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,166
Hey, what's that?

620
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,901
-Hey, what's that?
-Hey, what's that?

621
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,169
-You failed.
-Fail.

622
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,303
Of course he did.

623
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,838
Here's the next topic.

624
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,573
The topic is Joo Woo-jae.

625
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,774
Let's start with Woo-young.

626
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,976
-Yes, from me.
-Yes.

627
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,577

00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,756
"Not."

632
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,225
Not that all of them

633
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,294
are dumber than me,

634
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,496
but they basically
fall short of the standard.

635
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,298
The way he looks down on us.

636
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,766
The way he looks down on us.

637
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,002
People are going to think
that I'm really like that.

638
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,638
I'm not smart.
These guys are just too dim.

640

Do?

644
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,812
Do you know what magnesium is?

645
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,247
Basically, you know nothing.

646
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,548
Don't you know what it is?

647
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,418
I studied science.
Don't you know what magnesium is?

648
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,620
-People are going to believe this.
-It's true.

649
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,988
Okay, Jin-kyung.

650
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,156
"Isn't."

651
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,658
Isn't Ah-rin so pretty?

652
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,359
ISN'T MY NIECE AH-RIN SO PRETTY?

653
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,194
He just loves his niece so much.

654
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,431
-Isn't my niece Ah-rin so pretty?
-Shout out to my niece.

655
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,799
You're up, Sook.

656
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,234
"Why."

657
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,705
Why I ought to beat you all with this.

658
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,776
I can knock you all out
with this one punch, you know.

659
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,210

-That's it.

663
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,749
I?

664
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,852
I love you, viewers.

-Fail.

666
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,422
You never say that.

667
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,823
That was so wrong, man.

668
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,325
He must be drunk.

669
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,393
I always think that though. So why not?

670
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,529
-He must be drunk.
-That was unbelievable.

671
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,164
You've never shown that side to us.

672
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,165
Unbelievable.

673
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,933
Okay. My bad. Can I go again?

674
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,601
-Let me try again with "I."
-With "I."

675
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,171
-"I."
-I love all of our staff members.

-Fail.
-That was the worst.

677
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,541
What's wrong with it?

678
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,076
You should have said,

679
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,844
"I am a total brat.

680
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,714
Yes, I am a total brat."
Why didn't you say that?

681
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,716
But that's how I feel.

682
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,284
-But…
-Fail. You failed.

683
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,752
-Total failure.
-We don't need beer.

Yes, Jang Woo-young.

686

Jang Woo-young?

687
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,791
-I can't think of anything.
-There's not much.

688
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,094
You can just say some crazy stuff.

689
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,395

00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,336
"Yo."

710
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,139
Yo, I want to take you to my house

711
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,607
What? Yo, what?

712
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,642
-Yo, I want to take you to my house
-Yo, what?

713
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,412
Yo, I want to take you to my house

714
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,213
He says "yo" a lot because he raps.

715
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,083
Yo, I want to take you to my house

716
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,585
Since it's related to Woo-young,

717
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,487
I'll give you another chance
with another word.

718
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,557
"Man."

719
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,093
Man, I want to take you to my house

720
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,028
I KNOW "WORDS ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING"
IS THE NAME OF THE GAME BUT…

721
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,363
You're determined to do this.

722
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,231
-I'll give you another chance.
-Okay.

723
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,566
"All."

724
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,335
All, I want to take you to my house

725
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,239
You know, she is like me
in the way she repeats it.

726
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,541
She's persistent though.

727
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,476
-That persistence is like Woo-young.
-Yeah.

728
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,545
Why am I touched by that?

729
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,679
She knows me so well.

730
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,481
-I'll let this one slide.
-Okay.

731
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,449
Your turn, Sae-ho.

732
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,550
"Young."

733
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,518
Young?

734
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,456
-Just do something.
-Okay.

735
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,624
Young-gu isn't here!

736
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,092
-Like that?
-I don't do that.

737
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,895
-Doesn't he do that often? Doesn't he?
-Darn it.

738
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,199
THERE'S NO WAY TO HELP HIM
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT WORTH IT

739
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,600
Give me a different one.

740
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,702
He quickly changed his tune.

741
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,670
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE TOO

742
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,571
"Why."

743
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,807
WHAT DID HE DO?

744
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,042
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

745
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:44,749
HE DID A LOT OF THIS AND THAT

746
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,851
Why I ought to…

747
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,819
Why I ought to…

748
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,654
Jin-kyung, why I ought to…

749
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,323
He says that.

750
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,290
FAIL

751
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,625
-This isn't working.
-For real.

752
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,427
What does he say though?

753
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,528
Fail.

754
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,631
Pick something other than our members.
It's harder than I thought.

755
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,267
-Then, the next topic is--
-School president.

756
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,735
School president?

757
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,904
Let's do In-seok. Our producer.

758
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,240
THE TOPIC FOR ROUND 5
PRODUCER

759
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,342
-I'll go first.
-I want to go first.

760
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,376
Me first.

761
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,745
-You're all excited.
-I'm confident about this.

762
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,247
Let's start with Woo-young.

763
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,448
Okay, Woo-young.

764
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,450
WORDS ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
PRODUCER SERIES

765
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,684
"Just."

766
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,419
Just come out when I say it nicely.

767
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,988
JUST COME OUT WHEN I SAY IT NICELY

768
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,390
-Someone spoke like that?
-Come out when I say it nicely.

769
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,358
Is that the end?

770
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,993
Success.

771
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,160
This isn't about In-seok.

772
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,762
-It's about producers.
-Yes, producers.

773
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,030
You're up, Sae-ho.

774
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,431
"Hi."

775
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,002
Hi, Mr. Cho Sae-ho.
I'm Producer Park In-seok.

776
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,305
Thank you for being on our show.

777
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,439
-Fail.
-Why?

778
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,742
I wouldn't speak so formally to you.

779
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,845
No, you said I had to make it
into a sentence. That's why I did that.

780
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,980
-The producer--
-But it doesn't make sense.

781
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,282
It could be when you first met.

782
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,284
Are you the only
Producer Park In-seok out there?

783
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,687
-Are you the only one?
-I feel like he is, don't you?

784
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,456
-Someone with the same name.
-I think there's only one Park In-seok.

785
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,357
Success.

786
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,326
-Okay.
-Next is Jin-kyung.

787
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,295
"Sorry."

788
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,463
Sorry. There was a bit of a delay.

789
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,799
SORRY THERE WAS A BIT OF A DELAY

790
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,601
WASN'T IT JUST LIKE HIM?

791
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,436
Is this just a producer or In-seok?

792
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,904
IS THIS JUST A PRODUCER
OR OUR PRODUCER IN-SEOK?

793
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,240
Let me say this at this moment.

794
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,675
Sorry. There's a bit of a delay.

795
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,176
SORRY TODAY'S SHOOT ENDED UP THAT WAY TOO

796
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,844
Please be understanding.

797
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,246
I'll give you your word.

798
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,213
"Let's."

799
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,182
Let's start without Sae-ho.

800
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,619
Sae-ho won't be joining us from this week.

801
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,820
She nailed it.

802
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:29,988
Be honest, Sae-ho.

803
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:31,656
Haven't you experienced this?

804
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,558
All the time.

805
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,161
-A long time ago.
-A long time ago.

806
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,663
I heard that a lot too.
"We'll move forward without you."

807
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,565
Let's go, Woo-jae.

808
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,733
LAST ONE

809
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,636
-"Man."
-Man, this isn't funny at all today.

810
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,737
Stand up, all of you.

811
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,339
Hey, I'm Park In-seok.

812
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,473
Stand in a row.

813
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,874
What's going on?

814
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,242
Hey, come over here.

815
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,177
Go. Keep going.

816
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,612
THE PRODUCER KEEPING THE CAST IN CHECK

817
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,046
-Go.
-All right!

818
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,781
-Next! Next up.
-Go!

819
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,117
-Why you, scumbags!
-Nice.

820
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,720
I don't like the vibe today at all.

821
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,455
That will be all.

822
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,056
-Success!
-You pass!

823
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,224
Success!

824
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,592
-Fail.
-Why?

825
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,461
Come on.

826
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,129
I'm sure it happened at least once.

827
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,063
Let him try again.

828
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,365
-At least once.
-Stop joking.

829
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,833
-She's right.
-Just ask around.

830
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,135
-Okay. "Man."
-I'll go with "man."

831
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,104
Let's try again with "man."

832
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,272
Okay. "Man."

833
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,574
Where's my cellphone?

834
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,710
THE PRODUCER STARES AT HIS CELLPHONE

835
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,579
Man, it's 0.3 percent?

836
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,848
IT'S 0.3 PERCENT?

837
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,317
Beat Coin is only at 0.3 percent?

838
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,520
OUT OF THE BLUE,
THE PAINFUL PAST HAS BEEN DUG UP

839
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,422
Beat Coin is

840
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,723
only at 0.3 percent?

841
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,624
Success.

842
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,525
THEY CAN ALL RELATE

843
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,526
Please say "Success."

844
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:43,962
Success!

845
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,530
IT'S SAD BUT HE SUCCEEDED

846
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,832
All of them back there are sad.

847
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,367
Well, you know…

848
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,069
From Woo-young this time.

849
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,404
THE PRECIOUS BEER THEY WON
AFTER THEIR 3RD TRY

850
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,240
I WON'T LET THE LOW-TOLERANCE GUY
TAKE IT THIS TIME

851
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,043
-Wow.
-Woo-young.

852
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,477
When your lips touch the glass,

853
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,212
you won't be able to stop.

854
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,113
Watch out.

855
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,381
Since we didn't get to drink,

856
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,616
-let's drink it up.
-Okay.

857
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,486
He hit the half-way mark.

858
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,722
-That's it. He should stop right now.
-That's it.

859
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,993
He just left him the froth.

860
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,327
WOO-JAE WAS RIGHT

861
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,163
What the heck was that?

862
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,164
Isn't it so good?

863
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,733
All Sae-ho can do is smell it.

864
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,667
I can't believe this.

865
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,601
THEIR FRIENDSHIP IS ABOUT TO END

866
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,571
I'M PISSED OFF BUT LET ME STILL TASTE IT

867
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,539
The froth.

868
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,675
You get shaky at the end.

869
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,944
This is so not enough for me.

870
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,548
-This really isn't enough!
-It's so good.

871
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,550
-You know what it's like?
-I couldn't put it down.

872
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,385
It's like someone came over to my place

873
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,922
and said "Hello! Goodbye!"
That's what it's like.

874
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,457
As soon as I greet them,

875
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,093
they would say goodbye to me.
That's how it feels.

876
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,127
It left so quickly.

877
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,428
I wish I could have more.

878
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,496
-It'll be better next time.
-Then,

879
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,433
let's decide who can drink first
in the next game.

880
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,269
-The person whose line was the funniest.
-Yes.

881
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,170
An individual match.

882
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,405
-Yes.
-Okay.

883
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,640
-But they have to succeed.
-Yes, they do.

884
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,808
Geez.

885
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,009
In a relationship…

886
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:05,977
-I like it.
-Yeah.

887
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,812
-That's it.
-In a relationship,

888
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,380
they received a proposal.

889
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,348
-I see.
-Proposal?

890
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,616
-Yes, a proposal.
-To marry?

891
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,917
Yes, here we go.

892
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:13,818
A SITUATION LIKE THIS, FOR EXAMPLE?

893
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,987
-"That."
-Woo-young.

894
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:16,988
That's enough.

895
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,723
That's enough.

896
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,525
-We'll keep that in mind.
-Okay.

897
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,061
"It."

898
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:23,962
Woo-young.

899
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:24,863
It's enough.

900
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,264
-Come on.
-Geez.

901
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,767
How many are you blowing off, you lunatic?

902
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,667
WE'RE DONE IMITATING YOU

903
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,736
-"This."
-Sook.

904
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,106
This time would be my third wedding.

905
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,041
Will that be okay?

906
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,145
THE SHOCKING RESPONSE OF THE GIRLFRIEND

907
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,981
Sook is way in the lead.

908
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,215
I admit that was good.

909
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,418
-Let's do one last word in that topic.
-Okay.

910
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,553
If there's nothing special,

911
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,687
-it'll go to Sook.
-Okay.

912
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,523
THE ANXIOUS DRINKERS

913
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,590
"Okay."

914
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,491
Okay?

915
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:54,592
Jin-kyung.

916
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,761
Okay if I have a kid?

917
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,762
WAIT, THAT MEANS…

918
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:58,997
-Hang on.
-Hey.

919
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,632
-Isn't that about you?
-Hey.

920
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,599
-What?
-This is--

921
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,734
Okay if I have a kid?

922
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,569
She's determined to drink that beer.

923
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,437
Let's give the beer to Jin-kyung.

924
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,839
Jin-kyung wins.

925
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,440
Geez. "Okay if I have a kid?"

926
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,010
If you win the team game,

927
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,878
Jin-kyung gets to drink the beer first.

928
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,079
That was funny.

929
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,848
A job interview for a major company.

930
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:17,982
-Okay.
-Got it.

931
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,317
-A job interview.
-Then,

932
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,385
am I the interviewer or--

933
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,853
-No, the interviewee.
-Okay.

934
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,488
-You applied for the job.
-Okay.

935
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:28,560
FARMHANDS HAD EXPERIENCE IN INTERVIEWING
FOR THE HIGH-CLASS CELEBRITY CLUB

936
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:30,829
Woo-young can go first.

937
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,931
WORDS ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING
INTERVIEW SERIES

938
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,865
"Not."

939
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,433
Not kidding.

940
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,269
-Good.
-I am

941
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,704
confident.

942
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,539
Please hire me.

943
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,274
Success.

944
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,742
I bet he didn't get the job

945
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,312
-though he accomplished the mission.
-Yes.

946
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,280
If I were the boss, I'd hire him.

947
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,415
That was so funny.

948
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,417
I'd hire him too. That's why he succeeded.

949
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,052
All right, Sae-ho.

950
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:54,953
"Mom."

951
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,688
Mom is the CEO of this company,

952
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:00,024
so I came here
because I was told to do the interview.

953
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,793
-Success.
-Jin-kyung.

954
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,894
"Okay."

955
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,629
Okay if I have a kid?

956
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,899
What the heck?

957
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,768
There are companies
that won't hire you if you have a kid.

958
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,704
-You're up, Sook.
-Okay.

959
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,172
"Lee."

960
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,673
Lee Cheol-jin is my name.

961
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,476
I came from across the northern border,

962
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,880
but I would like to
give my best in making it in South Korea.

963
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,048
Please give me a chance!

964
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,151
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYMENT

965
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,887
Next up is Woo-jae.

966
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:29,787
"Are."

967
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,422
Are you the owner?

968
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,358
Listen up, sir.

969
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,860
This company's alcohol is good.

970
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,263
I tried it and you get pleasantly drunk.

971
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,665
-Are you the owner?
-I think he's drunk.

972
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,500
-He's really drunk.
-Drink up.

973
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,302
THE SENSELESS DRUNKEN JOB INTERVIEW

974
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,403
Fail.

975
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,806
-Doggone it.
-Excuse me,

976
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,875
why do you keep changing the rule?

977
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,744
-We were supposed to raise our hands.
-Right.

978
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,279
Hang on. That's because…

979
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,048
-That's for the first place.
-That was to decide who drinks first.

980
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,783
It went back to the team game rule.

981
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,251
-It was to decide who drinks.
-Look,

982
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,121
his intelligence went out the window
after he drank that beer.

983
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,722
He looks like the village idiot too.

984
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,525
Snow is falling from the sky.

985
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,760
EXCESSIVE DRINKING LEADS TO
LOSS OF INTELLIGENCE

986
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,495
-Isn't that right?
-Yes, it is.

987
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,396
That was good.

988
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,064
-One last round.
-Okay.

989
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,933
Let's have one last drink before we leave.

990
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,503
If we make it funny this time,
give each one of us a glass.

991
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,873
Something that could be said
between two people having a fling.

992
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,874
Something romantic?

993
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:28,846
A FRESH FLING WHERE JUST LOOKING AT
ONE ANOTHER MAKES YOUR HEART RACE

994
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,050
-Okay. I'll go first.
-Okay. You're first, Woo-young.

995
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:34,352
"As."

996
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:35,853
As you can see,

997
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,556
I think I like you.

998
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,559
AS YOU CAN SEE, I THINK I LIKE YOU?

999
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,027
Let's try it again.

1000
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,396
Woo-young, give it another go.
Is that okay?

1001
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,698
Think sharp.

1002
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,399
You have to think sharp, Woo-young.

1003
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,534
It's our last chance.

1004
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,602
The beard he drew on his face
looks so annoying.

1005
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,305
I couldn't even look at myself either.

1006
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,273
Okay. "As."

1007
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,742
As soon as we can, let's meet. I miss you.

1008
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,143
AS SOON AS WE CAN, LET'S MEET
I MISS YOU

1009
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,244
As you can see,

1010
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,381
don't you miss me so much?

1011
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,084
Can't you feel it?

1012
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,885
-Let's meet right now.
-Well,

1013
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,220
it makes sense so success.

1014
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,822
-So funny.
-Two people having a fling?

1015
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,790
I'm good with "do" too.

1016
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,560
You're good with "do"? What's that?

1017
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,461
HE'S A BIT BRAZEN

1018
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,395
"Can."

1019
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,329
NO WAY

1020
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,064
Do, do, do. Give me "do."

1021
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,600
BE NICE LET'S GO WITH "DO"

1022
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,670
-You can't request it.
-Are you a part of the staff?

1023
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,105
Turn in your paycheck then.

1024
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,506
All right. "Do."

1025
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,041
This better be funny.

1026
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,009
"Do."

1027
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,410
Do you like sashimi?

1028
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,279
I'll make some for you. Want to come over?
How about that?

1029
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,814
You should have started with "do."

1030
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,216
All right. I'll do better.

1031
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,185
HE MUST REALLY WANT THAT BEER

1032
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,287
-I'll go with "can."
-Okay. "Can."

1033
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,489
"Don't."

1034
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,257
AGAIN, NO WAY

1035
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,658
He went with "don't"?

1036
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,762
Don't say no.

1037
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:51,863
Can I kiss you?

1038
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,466
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT IN A WHILE

1039
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,001
Okay if I have a kid?

1040
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,605
How was it? Wasn't it good?

1041
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:01,839
-Success.
-Yeah. Success.

1042
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:03,608
"Sent."

1043
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:05,810
Sent money to your commissary account.

1044
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,946
Where the heck is this guy?

1045
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,848
Where is he?

1046
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,116
Okay, nice.

1047
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,584
It's possible.

1048
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,453
Is this about Sook's first love?

1049
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,355
-You're up, Sook.
-Okay.

1050
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,356
"Ex."

1051
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,291
Ex-boyfriend? Forgot about him ages ago.

1052
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,726
Now,

1053
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,394
I only have eyes for you.

1054
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,130
Want to get some instant noodles?

1055
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,299
-Okay, Woo-jae.
-In a fling, right?

1056
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,401
-Yes, it is.
-Show us how it's done, Woo-jae.

1057
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:31,803
"Let's."

1058
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,171
Let's?

1059
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,808
-I'll give you a chance to reconsider.
-He must really be drunk.

1060
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,676
Does it have to be "let's"?

1061
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,577
Yes. "Let's."

1062
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,680
Let's not be friends anymore.

1063
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,348
LET'S NOT BE FRIENDS ANYMORE

1064
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,783
Be in a relationship with me.

1065
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,985
BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME

1066
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,420
This one was good.

1067
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,621
-Good job.
-It was good.

1068
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,857
-Woo-jae, success.
-Okay!

1069
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,692
THE LAST ROUND WAS A SUCCESS

1070
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,728
By the way, are you going to
just keep giving us beer?

1071
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,297
We'll move on to bulgogi now.

1072
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,565
-Bulgogi?
-That sounds good!

1073
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:01,499
Gosh.

1074
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:05,436
BEFORE THAT,
LET ME DRINK UP THIS LAST BEER

1075
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,705
SAE-HO FINALLY GETS A CHANCE TO TRY IT

1076
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,040
-So good.
-Can I have a sip?

1077
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,908
-Stop it.
-You have had enough.

1078
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,076
-It's so good.
-Stop it.

1079
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,411
-I want a sip.
-You had enough.

1080
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,312
You're drunk.

1081
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,746
-Finish it, Sae-ho.
-It's so good.

1082
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,715
Finish it.

1083
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,950
Drink it all up.

1084
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,219
HE FINALLY GETS
A PROPER TASTE OF THE LAGER

1085
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,087
-It has a clean finish.
-It's so good.

1086
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,456
-I'm going to buy some.
-The carbonation is strong.

1087
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,225
If you drink this with something

1088
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,160
that's deep fried or a greasy burger,

1089
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,163
the flavor will go so well with that.

1090
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,366
-Let's buy a few.
-There's a really good brewery in Gangjin.

1091
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:39,170
That was all for the beer mission
at Hamel Brewery.

1092
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,738
-Let's move.
-Let's go.

1093
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,107
Is it pork bulgogi?

1094
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,243
You'd better kill three pigs.

1095
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,546
You know, I really love alcohol.

1096
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:49,814
-It's so good.
-But

1097
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,718
-this lager was really good.
-Can you write their phone number here?

1098
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,721
I've had beer from all around the world.

1099
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,022
How is this one so good?

1100
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,293
EVENING HAS ARRIVED IN GANGJIN

1101
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,863
Gosh. I think I'm drunk.

1102
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,000
My gosh. What do we do with you?
You only had one drink.

1103
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,601
Come over here, Woo-jae.

1104
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,938
BY THE WAY, HE ONLY HAD ONE GLASS

1105
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,274
ONE HOUR LATER

1106
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,642
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1107
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,743
We got this, Screwballs!

1108
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,810
Screwballs!

1109
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,112
Woo-young, go faster!

1110
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,413
-Woo-young!
-It might fall.

1111
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,815
It won't fall. I got it under control.
Just move fast!

1112
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,417
-Turn around.
-Turn around.

1113
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,219
-Turn around.
-Go.

1114
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,187
Get moving.

1115
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,087
-Go.
-Here I go!

1116
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,556
The last one.

1117
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,858
-No, come on!
-This isn't right!

1118
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,627
-Shouldn't we play the game though?
-Come on.

1119
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,662
SCREAMING

1120
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,330
-There's no one to give it to.
-Oh, no.

1121
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,865
I can see his butt.

1122
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,334
What do I gain from this?

1123
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,268
WHAT DO I GAIN FROM THIS?

1124
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,341
