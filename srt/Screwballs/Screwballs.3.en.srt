1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,103
Those boots are so cute.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,170
I'm wearing Uggs, too.

3
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,305
These are so warm.

4
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,573
MYSTERIOUS STROLL MID-TRAINING

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,774
I've got my Uggs on, too.

6
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,942
-Freeze!
-Jeez.

7
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,810
FREEZING UP

8
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,245
-Unfreeze.
-What?

9
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,147
I thought it was a game.

10
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,215
HAVING FUN, HUH?

11
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,549
-Hello.
-Hello.

12
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,617
Too cold!

13
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,252
THEY FIND REFUGE FROM THE COLD

14
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,855
It's a café again.

15
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,923
-Everyone.
-Please don't mind me.

16
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,228
Let's welcome Director Yoo Ki-hwan
from Netflix, our special visitor.

17
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,629
STANDING OVATION
FOR THE IMPORTANT GUEST

18
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,865
-Yoo Ki-hwan!
-Yoo Ki-hwan!

19
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,000
-Salute!
-Yoo Ki-hwan!

20
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,469
ALMOST READY TO OFFER THEIR SOULS

21
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,804
That's a nice touch.

22
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,205
-Nice to meet you.
-At ease.

23
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,273
WE LOVE YOU

24
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,576
-Let's do our best.
-He accepted Beat Coin to Netflix.

25
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,011
THANK YOU FOR TAKING US ON

26
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,379
-Director Yoo Ki-hwan.
-Thank you.

27
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,249
Our arrangement stands
until early next year.

28
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,151
-Can we ease up?
-I think so.

29
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,453
She doesn't normally dress up this much.

30
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,623
I really shouldn't be going this far.

31
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:57,991
I'm too old for it.

32
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,793
NO OLD-HANDS GO ALL OUT LIKE THIS

33
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,096
-Shall we go up to the second floor?
-Oh, the second floor?

34
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,465
-Is this a gallery?
-Is there a shooting gallery upstairs?

35
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,300
-Jeez.
-He's good.

36
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,335
SHOW SOME SELF-CONTROL
IN FRONT OF THE DIRECTOR

37
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,838
ABOUT TO GO UPSTAIRS
AFTER IGNORING WOO-YOUNG'S JOKE

38
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,506
Goodness. What's that?

39
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,574
I can see something.

40
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,109
AN EERIE CHILL

41
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,311
I've got a bad feeling about this.

42
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,882
This is sending a chill down my spine.

43
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,551
Is it because of the weather?

44
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,718
HEH

45
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,256
I haven't seen those trays in a while.

46
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,324
TRAYS?

47
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,726
Will our teamwork be tested
after the long break?

48
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,829
IT WASN'T A SHOOTING GALLERY
THAT WAS AWAITING THEM

49
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,897
IT WAS TRAYS

50
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,566
BOOT CAMP FOR KILLER RECRUITS 2025

51
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,469
Gee, it's been a while.

52
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,070
I think I'll enjoy this.

53
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,806
FAMILIAR AS IF THEY HAD
EXPERIENCED IT IN THEIR PAST LIVES

54
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,742
Do you remember
the killer's code of conduct?

55
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,778
"Killers are sexy."

56
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,480
"Killers are mind readers."

57
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,116
-Oh, right.
-Yes, I remember that.

58
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,418
To carry out your op perfectly,

59
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,822
you must read your target's mind
and anticipate their next move quickly.

60
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,993
So, your next training will require you
to read each other's minds.

61
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,162
It's Awaken Your Inner Eye.

62
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,300
We'll present you with questions
targeting one member at a time.

63
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,870
The other four killers

64
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,406
must guess their answer
and write it on their boards.

65
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,641
IF ANSWERS MATCH, IT'S A SUCCESS

66
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,877
-So the facts don't matter.
-Right.

67
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,512
-So the facts don't matter.
-Right.

68
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,648
A single unanimous answer

69
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,717
can end the training immediately.

70
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,018
Just one?

71
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,688
-You're underestimating us here.
-We didn't know better the last time.

72
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,090
It's insulting.

73
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,758
We won't go easy this time.

74
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,826
SO CONFIDENT

75
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,029
Promise us
you won't ask for some extra chitchat

76
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,798
after we cleared this mission.

77
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:46,866
-We won't.
-Wait.

78
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,101
Go with three right answers.

79
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,871
-Otherwise, it'll be over too soon.
-Sorry, but did you forget everything?

80
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,607
-We didn't know each other that well.
-We were young.

81
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,676
Back then, Sook was still in her forties.

82
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,978
We were practically babies.

83
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,246
I was in my thirties then.

84
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,314
HAHAHA

85
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,183
Wait, you're 40 now.

86
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,384
Time flies.

87
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,552
Woo-jae turned 40?

88
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,020
-Yes, I did.
-Goodness.

89
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,087
I'm 40 years old.

90
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,757
Do you need time to strategize?
Shall we get started?

91
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,458
LET'S DIVE RIGHT IN

92
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,360
Don't be childish, though.

93
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,430
We'll try a few without any strategies

94
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,299
and call a time-out if it seems hopeless.

95
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,034
THE KILLERS ARE CONFIDENT

96
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,936
-Please get the partitions in place.
-Okay.

97
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,071
Position the trays well, okay?

98
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,873
They can hurt us or break our bones.

99
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,007
-Damn straight.
-Okay.

100
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,777
Let's start with Sook,

101
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,713
-who'll be turning 50 this year.
-Okay!

102
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,048
-All right.
-I feel pretty good.

103
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,451
Here goes.
Where did Sook's last kiss take place?

104
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,922
MY LAST KISS?

105
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,757
Do you have an actual answer?

106
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,628
If it hasn't happened,
our answer should be "nowhere," right?

107
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,696
Correct.

108
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,131
BUT THAT WOULD MEAN
THAT SHE NEVER HAD A FIRST KISS

109
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,968
This is difficult.
I don't know what to write down.

110
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,869
THE TARGET IS CONFUSED HERSELF

111
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,673
What should I write to make sure

112
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,075
these rascals get it right?

113
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,142
Okay.

114
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,245
I'll go with a simple answer.

115
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,879
REVISITING MEMORIES OF KISSES

116
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,449
I doubt it happened recently.

117
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,285
Hey, this place existed
even back in the day.

118
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,988
Please show us your answers on three.

119
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,990
One, two, three.

120
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,659
Let's see.

121
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,727
You failed.

122
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,736
STARTLING

123
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,271
-I missed this sound.
-It's so clear.

124
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,972
-It sure is.
-I like how it rings.

125
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,073
I'm so awake now.

126
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,141
EYES WIDE OPEN

127
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,843
Did any of us get it right?

128
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,312
Remove the partitions
and see for yourselves.

129
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,713
Kick us off, Jin-kyung.

130
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,717
I remember Sook telling us
that her jailbird ex

131
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,919
used to be a truck driver.

132
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:47,987
So what's your answer?

133
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,922
-In a truck.
-My gosh!

134
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,924
-I knew it.
-Look, "in a car."

135
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,259
In a car?

136
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,794
THE ANSWER IS "IN A CAR"

137
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,362
-What's your answer?
-Woo-jae?

138
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,531
I worked under the premise

139
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,134
that a semicentennial
can be tech-savvy and lonely.

140
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,201
So…

141
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,836
A KISS IN VIRTUAL REALITY
USING NEW TECH

142
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,240
-I almost went with "in a car."
-And?

143
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,642
But since you said "back in the day,"
I changed my answer

144
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,710
to an old-school coffee shop.

145
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,911
PFFT

146
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,979
Seriously?

147
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,714
-They're all along the same line.
-What's yours?

148
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,250
I also thought it'd be a while back,
so I went with smoking room.

149
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,619
SMOKING ROOM

150
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,220
I actually like smoking rooms.

151
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,890
BACK IN THE DAY, SHE USED TO SMOOCH
WITH CIGARETTES COUNTLESS TIMES

152
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,292
-Which year was it?
-I'm curious, too.

153
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,393
It hasn't been that long.

154
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,895
-Seriously?
-Really?

155
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,363
It was in the 2000s.

156
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,165
AT LEAST IT WAS
AFTER THE NEW MILLENNIUM

157
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,800
-It's rather recent.
-It was in this century.

158
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,201
That's right.

159
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,103
-Can I ask one more simple question?
-Shoot.

160
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,604
Was it forced or not?

161
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,140
Looking back…

162
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,909
As you know, I don't drink.

163
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,478
-But this gentleman was very drunk.
-What on earth?

164
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,281
He may have no memories of our kiss.

165
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,250
Are you sure this drunk being
was a person?

166
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,385
You little…

167
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,255
We started off
with the eldest member of the group,

168
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,557
so we'll move on to the youngest next.

169
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,624
Woo-young.

170
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,892
Yes. Woo-young.

171
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,528
Let's say there was a bathhouse fire.

172
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,064
As he flees,
which body part would he cover?

173
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,035
Surely, we'll get this right.

174
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,471
SAE-HO ALSO WRITES HIS ANSWER
WITHOUT HESITATION

175
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,006
MEANWHILE, THESE TWO
ARE DEEP IN THOUGHT

176
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,708
-Could we…
-Here's the thing.

177
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,844
-Are we allowed to say this on air?
-I'm concerned, too.

178
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,245
SNICKERS

179
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,847
I know this will be on Netflix, but still.

180
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,148
ARE YOU SURE?

181
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,517
Guys, there are plenty of parts to cover.

182
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,619
I think we'll have to scrap this.

183
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,954
Why?

184
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,288
Jin-kyung's question

185
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,958
gave others too big of a hint.

186
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,560
Director, does that mean
my moment in this episode is done?

187
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,762
TEAR

188
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,398
-But I wrote this down.
-I had another spot in mind.

189
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,999
NUTS

190
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,634
-What's his answer?
-Let me see.

191
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,702
Nuts.

192
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,670
I'm not ashamed of my answer.

193
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,939
YOU-KNOW-WHERE

194
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,409
-You-know-where…
-This isn't too bad, right?

195
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,710
I went with "you-know-what."

196
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,878
SHE DID GET IT RIGHT

197
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,146
By the way, Jin-kyung,

198
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,380
a warning for what you just did.

199
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,448
Why?

200
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,583
Asking whether you can write something
gives it away to us.

201
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,018
We don't like easy games, okay?

202
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,453
All right.

203
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,422
-Our next target is Jin-kyung.
-Okay.

204
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,992
Your YouTube channel,
Real Study King, is doing very well.

205
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,061
In celebration of your success,
we'll quiz you on common knowledge.

206
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,431
-I'd love that.
-Let's test your knowledge.

207
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,199
Who was nicknamed the father of music?

208
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,970
JIN-KYUNG LEARNED SO MUCH
THROUGH HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL

209
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,606
There's no way Jin-kyung won't get this.

210
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,009
Two names come to mind.

211
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,677
Not the mother of music?

212
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,512
Father.

213
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,548
-I might get it wrong.
-Father of music?

214
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,384
There's no way
she doesn't know the answer.

215
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,586
I can't be sure if this person

216
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,921
was called the father or the mother.

217
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,456
But I think she might fool around.

218
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,057
No, I mean it.

219
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,525
Father of music?

220
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,128
-I have no idea.
-I'm confused, too.

221
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,196
Are you ready?

222
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,064
Isn't this the guy?

223
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,200
-Hold up your board on three.
-I can't be sure.

224
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,901
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

225
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,903
-Is this right?
-I'm not sure.

226
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,338
-You failed.
-We failed?

227
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,975
CLANG

228
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,978
WHAT ARE THE KILLERS' ANSWERS?

229
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,180
-Is it because of me?
-Did I get it wrong?

230
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,249
-What are your answers?
-Isn't it because of me?

231
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,885
Everyone got the same answer
with different spellings, except one.

232
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,754
-Four got it right.
-What the heck? Beethoven?

233
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,290
ISN'T BEETHOVEN THE ANSWER?

234
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,859
WHAT ON EARTH…

235
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,495
-Are you serious?
-Isn't Beethoven the father of music?

236
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,729
MY WORLD FELL APART JUST NOW

237
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,798
The father of music is Bach.

238
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,800
Then what is Beethoven?

239
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,168
An uncle of music, I guess?

240
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,638
This is the first time
I'm hearing about it.

241
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,740
I never knew Bach was the father of music.

242
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,277
Look. If four of us got it right
and you're the only one who didn't,

243
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,812
that means you're below average.

244
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,280
HEH

245
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,515
I'm rather startled

246
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,684
that Jin-kyung even knows of Beethoven.

247
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,086
-You're thankful.
-Sure.

248
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,954
-I can't believe it.
-She didn't go off course.

249
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,923
How is Bach the father of music?

250
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,192
Let's try something else this time.

251
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,727
It's a this-or-that question.

252
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,328
Please choose between the two.

253
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,930
That's so easy.

254
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,065
-The target is Sae-ho.
-Okay.

255
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,234
AMOUPRE versus Netflix.

256
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,303
AMOUPRE VERSUS NETFLIX

257
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,971
Are you serious?

258
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,942
KILLERS WRITE DOWN THEIR ANSWERS
WITHOUT HESITATION

259
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,644
AND YET…

260
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,513
ONE MAN FACES A DILEMMA

261
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,148
Don't forget Director Yoo's here.

262
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,216
FEELING PRESSURED

263
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,319
Let's welcome Director Yoo Ki-hwan
from Netflix, our special visitor.

264
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,721
THE SAVIOR WHO GAVE US A NEW HOME

265
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,090
WHEN WE WERE LEFT ABANDONED

266
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,692
That's a nice touch.

267
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,295
HE'S STILL WATCHING US

268
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,996
If Sae-ho doesn't go
with the correct answer,

269
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,665
I won't sit back and watch.

270
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,732
MORE PRESSURE

271
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,800
Are you all done?

272
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,969
NODS UNWILLINGLY

273
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,704
UNEASY

274
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,040
You seem quite troubled.

275
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,410
This is the mustache I wore on Beat Coin.

276
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,645
I took it out after a full year.

277
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,213
NETFLIX GAVE HIS MUSTACHE
A NEW LIFE

278
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,183
BUT AMOUPRE
IS HIS OWN PRECIOUS BRAND

279
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,751
WHAT WILL HE CHOOSE?

280
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,687
Please show us your answer on three.

281
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,255
One, two, three.

282
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,424
-There's only one right answer.
-Of course.

283
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,794
Jin-kyung wrote Netflix.

284
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,463
Woo-jae wrote Netflix.

WHAT?

287
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,002
Sook wrote Neckflix.

288
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,570
Neck…

289
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,740
UNEXPECTED IGNORANCE

290
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,142
-Isn't it "Neck"?
-"Neck"?

291
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,578
-As in "neck slice"?
-I thought that was how you spell it.

292
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,614
"Neckflix," seriously?

293
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,881
Woo-young wrote Netflix.

294
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,416
It's not "Neckflix"?

295
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,484
OF COURSE NOT, SOOK

296

Sae-ho wrote

297
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,620
AMOUPRE.

298
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,722
THE ANSWER IS AMOUPRE

299
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,856
You failed!

300
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,660
I LOVE YOU, AMOUPRE

301
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,128
This is outrageous.

302
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,396
It's unacceptable.

303
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,064
UNGRATEFUL

304
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,867
While I appreciate Netflix very much…

305
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,869
I'M SORRY

306
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,972
Didn't you star
in two Netflix original series?

307
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,174
We even have a representative on the set.

308
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,610
WHAT ARE THEY DOING
IN FRONT OF THE PRECIOUS GUEST?

309
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,545
Hey, are you kidding or what?

310
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,180
-Wait, I can't take this.
-Director.

311
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,916
-One second. I apologize on his behalf.
-Director Yoo, right?

312
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,885
-That was…
-For what it's worth,

313
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,554
I hope you're willing
to keep the four of us.

314
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,124
-We couldn't care less about his brand.
-Director Yoo.

315
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,393
I may be ignorant,

316
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,727
but I'm a loyal subscriber.

317
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,262
I'm using the most expensive plan.

318
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,664
USES HER PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION
FOR FORGIVENESS

319
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,132
It was an honest mistake.

320
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,366
She merely misspelled the service.

321
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,901
You're a disgrace.

322
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,536
But Sae-ho…

323
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,271
Jeez, what's with your hair?

324
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,306
HIS HAIR REFLECTS HIS TORN MIND

325
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,309
What's with that unkempt hairstyle?

326
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,945
It's just that my brand
didn't sell enough puffer jackets.

327
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,582
-You went too far.
-He's right.

328
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,317
I get you wanted to promote your brand,

329
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,553
-but that wasn't cool.
-You put us to shame.

330
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,655
Next up, here's a question for Jin-kyung.

331
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,657
THE KIMCHI versus Netflix.

332
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,293
AMBUSH QUESTION
THE KIMCHI VERSUS NETFLIX

333
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,762
-What?
-What was that again?

334
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,664
What happened?

335
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,032
What?

336
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,834
PTSD FROM THE THIS-AND-THAT GAME

337
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,102
-What happened?
-What's he doing?

338
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,204
HE MUST'VE FELT DEEPLY TROUBLED

339
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,972
-He disappeared.
-Goodness.

340
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,741
TRYING TO MAKE A COMEBACK
WITH A SLAPSTICK

341
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,809
-I mean…
-What was that?

342
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,910
Let's use our words.

343
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,978
I didn't expect to see slapstick
in this day and age.

344
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,313
It's THE KIMCHI versus…

345
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,615
This is a no-brainer.

346
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,217
It's as simple as that.

347
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,685
I'm getting it right this time.

348
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,387
DETERMINED TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME

349
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,090
SO, WHAT'S THE RESULT?

350
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,258
Show us your boards on three.

351
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,694
One, two, three. Let's see them.

352
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,362
I got it right this time.

353
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,997
HOLD ON

354
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,265
I'll do my best.

355
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,035
Everyone, please focus on Jin-kyung.

356
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,138
You failed!

357
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,140
WOO-JAE: NETFLIX

358
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,875
SOOK AND SAE-HO: NETFLIX

359
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,343
-Seriously?
-Why did we fail again?

360
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,845
Wasn't it obvious?

361
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,347
INTRODUCING ALL-NEW SLICED
RADISH KIMCHI - THE KIMCHI

362
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,249
See? I knew it!

363
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,819
-You're just… I can never trust you.
-What?

364
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,655
What's with the new product promotion?

365
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,890
Introducing…

366
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,128
sliced radish kimchi
prepared in Jeolla Province style.

367
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,997
You'll find the strong scent
of salted seafood

368
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,565
very appetizing.

369
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,234
-I hope you'll try it.
-By the way,

370
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,902
that new kimchi is a killer.

371
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,103
-It's so good.
-Really?

372
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,171
It's to die for.

373
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,708
I saw it coming.
She and Sae-ho are birds of a feather.

374
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,978
-Still, this is wrong, Jin-kyung.
-I don't care about propriety,

375
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,315
but she is currently a regular
on a Netflix original series.

376
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,086
-For a number of seasons, too.
-Single's Inferno has had four seasons.

377
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,021
If I may, Director Yoo.

378
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,157
Why don't I send you
5 kg of the new kimchi?

379
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,224
YOU FEEL ME, RIGHT?

380
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,460
-I will send you a delicious batch.
-Hey, did you catch that?

381
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,528
He declined.

382
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,862
NO, THANK YOU

383
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,898
I'll send you AMOUPRE's puffer jacket.

384
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,965
He doesn't want it.

385
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,134
I thought he was asking for five.

386
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,237
Let's ask Woo-jae about Joo Woo-jae Show.

387
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,506
-Your YouTube channel.
-What show?

388
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,208
A show with that name doesn't exist.

389
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,409
DUMBFOUNDED

390
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,844
Isn't that your channel's name?

391
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,779
-It's Today's Joo Woo-jae.
-Oh, really?

392
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,648
Joo Woo-jae Show…

393
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,184
I thought it was
Joo Woo-jae Show all along.

394
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,587
-Here's another question for Jin-kyung.
-Okay.

395
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,523
Let's say God forgot to add one element

396
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,559
while creating Jin-kyung.

397
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,626
A MISSING ELEMENT?

398
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,961
What would it be?

399
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,897
-Just one element?
-Yeah.

400
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,166
Please write down just one.

401
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,969
IF WE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE THING
GOD DIDN'T GIVE JIN-KYUNG…

402
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,572
-Let's try to get it right.
-Okay.

403
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,873
Can I give them a hint?

404
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,341
-No.
-I don't think we need it.

405
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,978
-I think I've got it. My gut says so.
-Mine, too.

406
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,847
We might be on the same page this time.

407
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,583
We should be careful here, though.

408
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,652
-It's all about us being in sync, right?
-Sure.

409
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,387
-Not about hurting Jin-kyung.
-No.

410
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,423
THE ELDEST DOES HER BEST
TO CONTROL THE DAMAGE

411
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,892
One, two, three. Show us your boards.

412
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,960
DID THEIR INNER EYES WORK?

413
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,127
For goodness' sake…

414
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,698
You failed!

415
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,634
What's going on?

416
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,668
-What's the answer?
-How come?

417
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,036
Let me see it.

418
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,738
First, Woo-young wrote cognitive ability.

419
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,807
-Yes, as expected.
-Mine's similar.

420
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,542
-Sae-ho wrote hippocampus.
-Hippocampus.

421
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,377
Sook wrote brain.

422
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,212
Woo-jae wrote a sense of shame.

423
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,314
See? We all went in this direction. Hey.

424
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,416
What's with "boobies"? That's so random.

425
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,485
-This is a PG-15 show.
-Jeez.

426
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,553
Unbelievable.

427
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,055
What do you take us for?
Why would we write "boobies"?

428
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,123
GOD DIDN'T GIVE ME BOOBS

429
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,791
-Be serious, Jin-kyung.
-Don't be ridiculous.

430
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,860
How could we write such a thing?

431
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,029
-I told you to think simple.
-That's too much.

432
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,398
We can't write "boobies."

433
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,066
MOVING ON

434
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,702
-Unbelievable.
-Seriously.

435
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,037
HIT HARD BY A CRASS JOKE

436
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,139
-Here's a simple question for Woo-young.
-Okay.

437
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,341
If he were to be reborn,

438
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,845
which K-pop idol group
would he like to join other than 2PM?

439
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,913
An idol group?

440
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,248
CONTEMPLATES

441
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,284
Guys, let's go with an obvious answer.

442
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,618
An obvious one?

443
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,753
"OBVIOUS ONE"

444
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,222
Oh, right. I get it.

445
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,057
There's just one answer, guys.

446
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,026
-It's so easy.
-It's a piece of cake.

447
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,761
It is that easy…

448
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,462
BUT…

449
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,898
-We should get this one for sure.
-There's just one answer.

450
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,200
-What was the name?
-Your gut tells you the answer.

451
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,735
Okay, don't try anything for laughs.

452
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,238
Hold on, Sae-ho.
I know the answer, but I need a minute.

453
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,774
UNLIKE THE OTHERS, HE NEEDS
TO PUT HIS HIPPOCAMPUS TO WORK

454
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,509
-I'm going to be serious here.
-Go ahead.

455
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,643
Let's all do that.

456
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,646
-I won't try to make jokes out of it.
-Okay.

457
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,714
That's understandable.

458
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,149
-It's your field, after all.
-That's right.

459
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,751
I don't want to fool around
with this topic.

460
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,187
-Excluding 2PM, right?
-Exactly.

461
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,488
WHICH GROUP
WOULD WOO-YOUNG CHOOSE?

462
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,624
Show us your answers on three.

463
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,626
One, two, three. Let's see them.

464
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,562
We got it, right? We can't have failed.

465
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,364
HAHAHAHA

466
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,032
-But…
-Be serious, okay?

467
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,100
Aren't we unanimous?

468
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,102
One, two, three. You failed.

469
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,206
How come?

470
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,874
CHECKING WOO-YOUNG'S ANSWER

471
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,509
A SERIOUS ANSWER FROM SOOK: BTS

472
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,912
-Stray Kids?
-They were on our show, remember?

473
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,413
They weren't our only guest.

474
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,515
DID NO ONE READ WOO-YOUNG'S MIND?

475
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,583
Woo-young.

476
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,253
-Gosh. You did it, Jin-kyung.
-Isn't it Stray Kids?

477
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,355
It's not BTS?

478
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,923
-You're amazing.
-We did have many guests…

479
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,393
-I guess I read your mind.
-I didn't expect you to go with 2AM.

480
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,728
-Is your answer 2AM?
-Hold on.

481
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:36,996
What was the name of our group?

482
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,097
Unbalance.

483
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,332
I couldn't recall.
You should've gone with that!

484
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,700
"The team that sang Never"?

485
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,068
THEY RELEASED "NEVER" TOGETHER

486
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,303
BUT HE DIDN'T REMEMBER EITHER

487
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,838
I just couldn't recall "Unbalance."

488
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,974
The fact that I clicked with Jin-kyung

489
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,342
is rather unsettling.

490
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,045
That's spouses from a past life for you.

491
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,647
Next, here's a question for Sook.

492
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,616
In terms of physical touch,

493
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,419
how far are you willing to go
before making it official?

494
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,654
Before making it official?

495
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,656
-When you're just dating?
-Yes, exactly.

496
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,127
Can we write you-know-what?

497
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,929
You want us to write that?

498
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,164
You're not committed yet.

499
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,899
You haven't made it official yet.

500
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,168
Are we allowed to write it in words?

501
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,870
My, my.

502
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,171
Can we write it down?

503
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,239
Or what? Are you going to draw?

504
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,074
Do you get intimate
when they're just dating?

505
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,142
MS. CONSERVATIVE

506
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,209
Just dating?

507
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,979
Come on. I was a regular on Love Naggers.

508
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,182
The perspective
Love Naggers instills in you…

509
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,483
I mean…

510
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,718
FOR SOME REASON, HE'S PUFFED UP

511
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,686
Could we write this down, though?

512
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,221
Knowing her,

513
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,924
I think this is how far she'd allow

514
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,492
-before committing.
-Me too.

515
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,628
What?

516
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,564
SO MANY OPINIONS
WHAT'S THE CORRECT ANSWER?

517
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,833
Jin-kyung wrote, "touching her hair."

518
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,668
Woo-young wrote, "eye contact."

519
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,969
That's about what I thought.

520
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,037
Sae-ho wrote,

521
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,105

522
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,909
CAN HE BE ANY MORE CONSERVATIVE?

523
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,243
She's conservative.

524
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,511
-She won't let it go far.
-Agreed.

529
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,154
You won't believe how saucy she's become
since being on Love Naggers.

530
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,290
Goodness!

531
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,225
-What is it?
-What did she write?

532
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,927
"All the way"?

533
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,162
GET YOUR PENALTY FIRST

534
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,697
"A nod," seriously?

535
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,866
-Did she write touching my hair?
-Yeah.

536
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,267
That's so lame.

537
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,335
You're not official.

538
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,736
But you're dating!

539
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,804
Oh, my.

540
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,439
But you're just dating.

541
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,809
Didn't you say you're the type to kiss
the guy on your first blind date?

542
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,312
But we're talking about Sook here, not me.

543
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,482
If this had been about me,
my answer would've been boobies.

544
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,018
OH DEAR, THE BOOBIES

545
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,920
Okay. Thank you for your candor…

546
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,223
How could you not get me, guys?

547
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,059
Next up is a touchy subject,
so we kept going back and forth.

548
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,828
But the fact is
Sae-ho had an occasion to celebrate.

549
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:50,896
That's true.

550
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,031
We have a bunch of questions

551
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,700
that we have been holding back.

552
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,068
-What are they?
-I'm curious.

553
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,569
For example…

554
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,004
HERE IT IS

555
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,507
I don't know
when we'll get together next,

556
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,774
but won't we have to discuss

557
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,209
the issue of money gift when we do?

558
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,011
There's got to be someone
who paid the least.

559
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,046
-That's true.
-I handed in an empty envelope.

560
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,251
Was there someone whose money gift

561
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,553
didn't meet your expectations?

562
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,555
FLINCHES

563
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,023
Well, that's…

564
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,959
-I'll choose someone among our cast.
-From our castmates?

565
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,461
-Shall we do that?
-Yes.

566
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,029
-Restrict it to the cast?
-Yes.

567
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,365
Okay. Will you include the one
who didn't give you anything?

568
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,800
I'll have to, won't I?

569
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,868
WE CAN SEE THE ANSWER

570
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,103
Please don't go there.

571
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,205
Honestly, the money gift's amount…

572
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,439
How should I put it?

573
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,742
I don't think it matters.
I'm grateful to everyone.

574
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:41,079
In that case, let's go with someone
whose gift exceeded his expectations.

575
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,149
That'd be fine. It's a compliment.

576
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,251
I'm grateful that so many people came.

577
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,054
I don't know how this would come across,

578
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,090
but there were some people
who were particularly generous.

579
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,659
And does someone like that
come to your mind?

580
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,726
Yes, there is.

581
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,828
-Can you write their name down?
-All right, then.

582
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,631
He had so many A-lister guests.

583
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,534
Do we have to guess, too?

584
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,169
Yes, of course.

585
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,904
EVEN A NON-CONTRIBUTOR
MUST PARTICIPATE

586
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,808
OUT OF THE COUNTLESS GUESTS,
WHO WOULD'VE MOVED SAE-HO THE MOST?

587
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,176
Who would it be?

588
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,245
-Let's roll.
-Let's check our answers.

589
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,181
-Okay. One, two, three. Show us!
-One, two…

590
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,583
This is the truth.

591
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,650
This is what I think.

592
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,920
First things first. You failed.

593
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
You failed.

594
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,825
IT NEVER GETS EASIER

595
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,160
Darn it. That hurts.

596
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,228
Let's see. Guys.

597
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,264
-Look, we almost succeeded.
-Right.

598
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,566
SAE-HO AND WOO-YOUNG:
HONG JIN-KYUNG

599
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,168
JIN-KYUNG: HONG JIN-KYUNG

600
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,436
SOOK: YU JAE-SEOK

601
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,771
WOO-JAE: EX-GIRLFRIEND

602
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,275
-Here's why I didn't go with Jin-kyung.
-What a bummer.

603
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,210
We're supposed to choose one person

604
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,179
who exceeded Sae-ho's expectations.

605
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,715
Didn't you have high hopes for Jin-kyung?

606
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,783
I did, but she still amazed me.

607
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,585
Really?

608
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,786
I did go big.

609
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,022
I felt bad I couldn't make it.

610
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,825
But if your money gift
goes 100 million won,

611
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,660
-won't there be tax issues?
-Wait.

612
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,529
She didn't pay that much. I mean that.

613
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,865
THE REASON WHY THE NEWLYWED
WAS TOUCHED BY JIN-KYUNG

614
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,135
-The amount aside…
-But the amount is important.

615
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,670
Okay, the amount itself was great--

616
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,405
-Isn't your answer based on the amount?
-You bet.

617
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,374
I called her later,

618
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,043
and her heartfelt congratulatory message

619
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,678
moved me so deeply.

620
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,848
Do you recall what you said, Jin-kyung?

621
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,016
Of course not.

622
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,718
But I felt terrible I missed it.

623
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,288
I did mention this earlier,
but the most hilarious bit was…

624
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,189
Naturally, I was grateful
to all the guests.

625
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,991
I'm thankful to all my castmates.

626
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,760
-We thank you for the invitation.
-So afterward,

627
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,461
I went over the records

628
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,997
to repay their kindness later.

629
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,666
But with Woo-young…

630
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:41,900
-He was there.
-Yes.

631
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,135
You clearly saw him.

632
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,202
Then I thought,

633
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,339
this must be Woo-young
trying to make a fun tale

634
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,607
to share on Screwballs.

635
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,675
BIG PICTURE FOR THE FUTURE

636
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,610
-Let's go with that.
-You wanted to be prepared.

637
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,911
WOO-YOUNG'S EXPLANATION

638
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,246
I rushed over because I ran late.

639
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,714
I then had to wait in line.

640
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,684
That was when I got confused.
I thought, "What's going on?"

641
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,988
IN A NUTSHELL, HE WAS OUT OF IT
BECAUSE HE HAD TO RUSH TO GET IN LINE

642
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,856
After that, it slipped my mind.

643
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,325
IN CONCLUSION, IT WAS A MISTAKE

644
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,794
But I didn't stay for the meal afterward.

645
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,962
Test us on common knowledge again
for Jin-kyung.

646
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,098
Darn it. I suddenly want
to win desperately.

647
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,367
Okay. Let's test Woo-young

648
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,837
on common knowledge this time.

649
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,472
That's rather insulting.

650
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,742
You're dressed as Seong Gi-hun,

651
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,279
the main character
from the recent hit series, Squid Game 2.

652
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,847
How do you spell "squid" in English?

653
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,449
Freeze!

654
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,650
KILLERS EVADE COMMON KNOWLEDGE

655
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,719
That's way too difficult.

656
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,487
You find this difficult?

657
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,621
Are you guys serious?

658
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,823
It's difficult for me.

659
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,091
Can't you do better?

660
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,158
I'M YOUNG-HEE, OKAY?

661
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,294
I'm getting confused out of the blue.

662
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,197
-Thanks to the show…
-I just can't be sure.

663
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,767
…we've gotten to learn this word.

664
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,569
SQUID GAME 2 TOPS GLOBAL CHART
FOR 3 WEEKS STRAIGHT

665
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,870
INSTANT GLOBAL SUCCESS UPON RELEASE

666
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,338
This is a no-brainer.

667
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,374
THEY WOULD'VE HEARD OF IT OFTEN

668
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,476
Anyone who gets it wrong
had better stop eating squid.

669
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,111
-I agree.
-That'd be me.

670
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,746
You must get it right.

671
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,281
How many letters are there?
Can't you say as much?

672
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,051
-Am I dumb or what?
-I'm getting confused.

673
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,953
We all learned the word "parasite"…

674
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,088
DO THESE TOP 99% OF KILLERS

675
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,990
HAVE THE BASIC COMMON KNOWLEDGE?

676
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,059
…after Parasite's success.
The same went for Squid Game.

677
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,361
-I still feel so uncertain.
-I'll count to three.

678
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,163
One, two, three.

679
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,231
Isn't this it?

680
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,332
ANSWERS REVEALED

681
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,702
Did we get it right?

682
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,803
Did we?

683
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,171
FOR REAL?

684
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,740
This isn't like you.

685
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,108
COULD IT BE…

686
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,109
Seriously?

687
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,145
You got it right.

688
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,415
-That's insane!
-Squid.

689
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,151
Unbelievable!

690
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,052
WE'RE SURPRISED BY OUR OWN SUCCESS

691
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,587
I can't believe this. My goodness.

692
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,956
We know at least this much.

693
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,259
I LOVE YOU, NETFLIX

694
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,860
I can't believe we got it right!

695
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,128
It was way too easy.

696
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,630
I told you.

697
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,697
It's upsetting.

698
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,799
I still can't believe it.

699
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,333
Let's count this one out.

700
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,935
You can't discount my question again.

701
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,071
I mean, it was too easy.

702
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,607
I'm amazed at our knowledge.

703
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,842
I'm surprised at myself.

704
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:04,910
WE ARE TOO

705
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,678
Common knowledge is easy.

706
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,014
We are pretty good, aren't we?

707
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,316
Anyhow, your training to awaken
your inner eye was…

708
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,785
a success. Congratulations.

709
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,620
Moving on,

710
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:17,355
please carry out your promise.

711
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,723
Let's get that phone call now.

712
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,759
Give him a call.

713
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:21,860
THE CAST AND CREW ALIKE

714
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,562
HAVE ALL LONGED TO HEAR HIS VOICE

715
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,831
It's only 9:30 a.m. Why should I call him?

716
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,432
If you blow the whistle loud and clear…

717
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,733
STRONG LURE FOR JIN-KYUNG

718
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,868
You'll call him?

719
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,002
THAT MADE HER GO SOFT

720
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,871
Wait, let's do that in the next episode.

721
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,206
Probably in two hours.

722
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,607
A CALL WITH BYEON WOO-SEOK

723
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,677
-This feels like the right time.
-Let's do this.

724
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:39,878
Woo-seok?

725
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,746
I didn't give him a heads-up.
Won't he mind?

726
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,814
LOOKING FOR HIS NUMBER

727
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,183
-So he can actually call him.
-So they're really close.

728
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,820
They must've talked recently, too.
He's going through the recent call logs.

729
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,021
There he is.

730
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,524
OUT OF COUNTLESS WOO-SEOKS, THIS IS
BYEON WOO-SEOK, WOO-JAE'S FRIEND!

731
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,260
He's so busy these days.

732
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,328
Put him on speaker.

733
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,497
Go on.

734
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,631
I'll do that when he answers.

735
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,502
-Hello?
-Hey, Woo-seok.

736
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,137
WOO-SEOK ANSWERED!

737
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,073
-Put him on speaker.
-I'm sorry about this.

738
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,474
Let me apologize first.

739
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,410
I have Hong Jin-kyung here with me.

740
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,746
Let me put you on speaker for a bit.

741
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,249
-Sure.
-Hi, Woo-seok.

742
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,652
THE MOMENT
EVERYONE'S BEEN WAITING FOR

743
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,322
Woo-seok, there's something
I wanted to ask you about.

744
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,390
Please ask away.

745
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,458
Back then in Osaka,

746
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,426
we had something going, remember?

747
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,095
I'M SORRY, WOO-SEOK

748
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,630
Sorry? Did we perhaps argue?

749
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,098
"Argue."

750
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,667
-No, not "argue."
-Are you sure about that?

751
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,537
-You argued with him?
-No, more like flirting.

752
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,908
Woo-seok, I kept thinking about it.
I couldn't help but wonder.

753
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,777
Why did you look at me like that?

754
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,813
-He probably felt uncomfortable.
-What was that about?

755
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,282
Please be honest with me.

756
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,050
-Well, that was…
-Yes.

757
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,253
When was that again?

758
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,089
It was in December, Woo-seok.

759
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,492
-A day in last December.
-What year was it?

760
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,927
Was it in 2023?

761
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,596
It was in 2024.
Don't try to turn it into a joke.

762
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,165
It's not funny. So don't even try it.

763
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,733
I'm being serious here.

764
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,269
I'm being serious too, and I just…

765
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,404
-Hold on.
-Are you seriously--

766
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,806
Woo-seok, don't worry about it.

767
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:17,208
She's drunk. That's all.

768
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,443
DRUNK ON SWEET FANTASY

769
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,211
-Can we say hello?
-He's good.

770
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,815
Can you say hi to my castmates?

771
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,417
Goodness, Woo-seok.

772
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,586
-Hello.
-Hello, this is Kim Sook.

773
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,287
Oh, hello.

774
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,022
I'd love to cook for you sometime.

775
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,123
HER AUNTIE OMAKASE SELF
COMES OUT

776
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,393
Would you give me that honor?

777
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,728
I'll visit you with Woo-jae.

778
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,663
-I won't be available.
-But the truth is,

779
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,166
if you invite me,
I'll be there no matter what.

780
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,634
No matter what?

781
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,003
My gosh. What's your favorite, Woo-seok?

782
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,237
I'm happy with anything.

783
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,373
-So you're not a picky eater?
-That's right.

784
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,808
-Woo-seok.
-Hold on.

785
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:50,875
FAKE FLING INTERRUPTING

786
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,544
She's wasted.

787
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,746
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-Oh, I see.

788
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,549
Can you please ask the viewers
to love and support Screwballs?

789
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,219
Please enjoy and support
Woo-jae's show, Screwballs,

790
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,854
and show love to Woo-jae.

791
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,789
Thanks, Woo-seok.

792
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,992
-Thank you!
-I'm so sorry.

793
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,059
See you around, Woo-seok.

794
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,195
-Thank you, Woo-seok.
-It was my pleasure.

795
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,531
-I'll greet you in person later.
-Oh, sure.

796
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,500
THANK YOU, BYEON WOO-SEOK,
DESPITE A SUDDEN CALL

797
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,470
-He's definitely well-mannered.
-You can say that again.

798
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,171
-Tell me about it.
-He's a good guy.

799
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,307
But I didn't get to ask him anything.

800
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,375
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY

801
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,378
But he doesn't even remember.
What exactly happened, Jin-kyung?

802
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,581
Jin-kyung had her back to Woo-seok,

803
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,316
so he mistook her for Mr. Han Ki-bum.

804
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,051
He realized his mistake
when she turned around.

805
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,388
I'll keep this a secret
between Woo-seok and me.

806
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,089
TRUTH IS TO REMAIN A MYSTERY

807
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,358
AFTER THE INNER EYE TRAINING

808
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,495
THE KILLERS HEAD
TO THE NEXT TRAINING SITE

809
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,196
-Let me apologize again.
-For what?

810
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,532
For the money gift. But it was just that--

811
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,933
Don't worry about it.

812
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,202
I honestly thought
you must've been swamped.

813
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,270
"CHILL GUY" DOESN'T MIND

814
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,072
Didn't we once do

815
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,542
a road-movie-like episode
like this one together?

816
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,077
-We did several of them.
-I remember…

817
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,646
Where was it again?

818
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,982
-Was it Cheongyang?
-We did visit there.

819
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,084
Jin-kyung suggested
that we get our burial plots there.

820
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,152
Didn't we…

821
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,587
I still feel bad for my mistake.

822
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,857
I joked about Jin-kyung owning a mountain,
and the reporters ran the story.

823
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,627
You turned her into a billionaire.

824
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,395
Surely people didn't believe that.

825
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,863
-They did.
-You bet they did.

826
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,666
People actually did.

827
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:23,935
I think I'm in trouble.

828
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,003
Is it your stomach?

829
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,205
I got overly excited by your compliments

830
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,207
and ate more than I could handle.

831
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,776
-My stomach's acting up.
-Shall I get you some medicine?

832
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,445
-Really?
-Oh, dear.

833
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,747
I'll be fine after some medicine.

834
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,216
You didn't even eat that much.

835
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,718
But…

836
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,086
did he eat a lot?

837
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,654
Maybe it's because he ate more than usual?

838
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,289
He did eat more than his usual.

839
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,390
MR. NO-APPETITE HASN'T CHANGED

840
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,192
ASKING AFTER MEDICINE

841
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,993
He did overeat.

842
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,061
He sure did.

843
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,930
It was because of the compliments.

844
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,598
Where exactly are we going?

845
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,634
-It seems like…
-Are we in an industrial area?

846
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,369
FINAL TRAINING AWAITS THEM

847
00:28:58,436 --> 00:28:59,471
It's a junkyard.

848
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,974
A FEW MINUTES LATER

849
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,576
Hey.

850
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,911
-Get up! Do you want to die for real?
-Ready.

851
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,580
-We could all get shot.
-One, two…

852
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:13,685
WHAT MADE THEM SO DESPERATE?

853
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,623
SCREWBALLS OST - REBOOT
